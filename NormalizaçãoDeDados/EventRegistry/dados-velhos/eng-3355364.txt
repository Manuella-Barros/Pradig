Gaines from the Rams.\n\nBuffalo also continued stockpiling 2018 draft picks by getting a second-round selection from Los Angeles and a third-rounder from the Eagles. The Bills dealt a sixth-round pick to the Rams as part of the Watkins trade.\n\nThe moves were made day after Buffalo opened its preseason with a 17-10 loss to Minnesota. The shakeup continues an off-season overhaul under new coach Sean McDermott and GM Brandon Beane.\n\nWatkins' future in Buffalo was already in question after the Bills in May declined to pick up his fifth-year option. He is entering the final year of his deal. Matthews is also entering the final season of his contract, so the Eagles also faced the possibility of losing him in free agency.\n\nGaines was valuable defensive back in the Rams' rotation. He won a starting job in 2015 but then got hurt before the season started. He became expendable after the Rams acquired Kayvon Webster this off-season, who is pegged to start opposite Trumaine Johnson.\n\nThe Rams need playmakers for an offence that finished last in the NFL over the past two seasons. Watkins can be that type of dynamic threat when healthy.\n\nWatkins had been the Bills starter since Buffalo traded up five spots in the 2014 draft to select him with the No. 4 pick. He has 153 catches for 2,459 yards and 17 touchdowns in three seasons, but topped 1,000 yards just once, in 2015.\n\nHe's been hampered by an assortment of injuries and limited to playing just eight games last year after having surgery to repair a broken left foot. Watkins required a second operation in January after aggravating the injury last season.\n\nIn Los Angeles, Watkins is reunited with former Bills starter Robert Woods, who signed with the Rams in free agency after four seasons in Buffalo.\n\nThe Bills continue revamping their receiver group, with Matthews' acquisition coming four days after Buffalo signed veteran free agent Anquan Boldin.\n\nMatthews had been Philadelphia's most productive receiver, averaging 75 catches, 891 receiving yards and six touchdowns in his first three seasons. But the Eagles signed free-agent receivers Alshon Jeffery and Torrey Smith in the off-season, drafted Mack Hollins and Shelton Gibson and have been pleased with 2015 first-round pick Nelson Agholor's improvement.\n\nDarby started 29 games in his first two seasons in Buffalo.

He was a second-round pick (50th overall) in the 2015 draft.\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T18:05:00Z", "sim": 0.8980392217636108, "source": {"uri": "greenvilleonline.com", "title": "The Greenville News", "id": "9130"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "18:05:00", "url": "http://www.greenvilleonline.com/story/sports/college/clemson/2017/08/11/bills-trade-sammy-watkins-los-angeles-rams/559943001/", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8676111", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/greenvilleonline.png", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "18:05:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

He was a second-round pick (50th overall) in the 2015 draft.\n\n___\n\nAP pro football writer Rob Maaddi in Philadelphia and AP sports writer Greg Beacham in Los Angeles contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 The Associated Press.

Gaines from the Rams.\n\nBuffalo also continued stockpiling 2018 draft picks by getting a second-round selection from Los Angeles and a third-rounder from the Eagles. The Bills dealt a sixth-round pick to the Rams as part of the Watkins trade.\n\nThe moves were made day after Buffalo opened its preseason with a 17-10 loss to Minnesota. The shakeup continues an offseason overhaul under new coach Sean McDermott and GM Brandon Beane.\n\nWatkins' future in Buffalo was already in question after the Bills in May declined to pick up his fifth-year option.

Matthews is also entering the final season of his contract, so the Eagles also faced the possibility of losing him in free agency.\n\nGaines was valuable defensive back in the Rams' rotation. He won a starting job in 2015 but then got hurt before the season started. He became expendable after the Rams acquired Kayvon Webster this offseason, who is pegged to start opposite Trumaine Johnson.\n\nThe Rams need playmakers for an offense that finished last in the NFL over the past two seasons. Watkins can be that type of dynamic threat when healthy.\n\nWatkins had been the Bills starter since Buffalo traded up five spots in the 2014 draft to select him with the No. 4 pick.

(AP) -- The Buffalo Bills shook up their roster with two separate blockbuster trades Friday, dealing starting receiver Sammy Watkins to the Los Angeles Rams and acquiring receiver Jordan Matthews from Philadelphia in exchange for cornerback Ronald Darby.\n\nThe Bills acquired cornerback E.J. Gaines from the Rams.\n\nBuffalo also continued stockpiling 2018 draft picks by getting a second-round selection from Los Angeles and a third-rounder from the Eagles. The Bills dealt a sixth-round pick to the Rams as part of the Watkins trade.\n\nThe moves were made day after Buffalo opened its preseason with a 17-10 loss to Minnesota. The shakeup continues an offseason overhaul under new coach Sean McDermott and GM Brandon Beane.\n\nWatkins' future in Buffalo was already in question after the Bills in May declined to pick up his fifth-year option. He is entering the final year of his deal. Matthews is also entering the final season of his contract, so the Eagles also faced the possibility of losing him in free agency.\n\nGaines was valuable defensive back in the Rams' rotation. He won a starting job in 2015 but then got hurt before the season started. He became expendable after the Rams acquired Kayvon Webster this offseason, who is pegged to start opposite Trumaine Johnson.\n\nThe Rams need playmakers for an offense that finished last in the NFL over the past two seasons. Watkins can be that type of dynamic threat when healthy.\n\nWatkins had been the Bills starter since Buffalo traded up five spots in the 2014 draft to select him with the No. 4 pick. He has 153 catches for 2,459 yards and 17 touchdowns in three seasons, but topped 1,000 yards just once, in 2015.\n\nHe's been hampered by an assortment of injuries and limited to playing just eight games last year after having surgery to repair a broken left foot. Watkins required a second operation in January after aggravating the injury last season.\n\nIn Los Angeles, Watkins is reunited with former Bills starter Robert Woods, who signed with the Rams in free agency after four seasons in Buffalo.\n\nThe Bills continue revamping their receiver group, with Matthews' acquisition coming four days after Buffalo signed veteran free agent Anquan Boldin.\n\nMatthews had been Philadelphia's most productive receiver, averaging 75 catches, 891 receiving yards and six touchdowns in his first three seasons. But the Eagles signed free-agent receivers Alshon Jeffery and Torrey Smith in the offseason, drafted Mack Hollins and Shelton Gibson and have been pleased with 2015 first-round pick Nelson Agholor's improvement.\n\nDarby started 29 games in his first two seasons in Buffalo. He was a second-round pick (50th overall) in the 2015 draft.\n\n___\n\nAP Pro Football Writer Rob Maaddi in Philadelphia and AP Sports Writer Greg Beacham in Los Angeles contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to remove an incorrect reference to Anthony Lynn, who coaches the Chargers, not the Rams.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T20:29:00Z", "sim": 0.886274516582489, "source": {"uri": "boston.com", "title": "Boston.com", "id": "318"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "20:29:00", "url": "https://www.boston.com/sports/nfl/2017/08/11/bills-trade-sammy-watkins-to-rams", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8696359", "image": "https://www.boston.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Vikings_Bills_Football_71107-850x478.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "20:29:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

The Bills dealt a sixth-round pick to the Rams as part of the Watkins trade.\n\nORCHARD PARK, N.Y. -- The Buffalo Bills' offseason overhaul isn't over yet with receiver Sammy Watkins and cornerback Ronald Darby the latest players to be sent packing.\n\nThe Bills dealt both starters in separate blockbuster trades on Friday as part of an effort to reshape the roster under new coach Sean McDermott.\n\nWatkins was traded to the Los Angeles Rams, while Darby was sent to the Philadelphia Eagles. Buffalo addressed both positions by acquiring receiver Jordan Matthews from Philadelphia and cornerback E.J. Gaines from the Rams.\n\nThe Bills also continued looking to the future by further stockpiling 2018 draft selections. They acquired a second-round pick from L.A. and a third-rounder from the Eagles, while also sending a sixth-round pick to the Rams. Add in the acquisition of the Kansas Chiefs' first-round pick in trade completed in April, and the Bills now have two picks in each of the first three rounds next year.\n\nThe additional picks provide Bills new general manager Brandon Beane assets in a draft that looks like it will have several top-end quarterback prospects. Bills starter Tyrod Taylor's future is uncertain beyond this year.\n\nBeane disputed the notion he's strictly looking ahead to next year.\n\n\"This is not a throw-in-the-towel thing at all,\" Beane said. \"If we were throwing in the towel, I wouldn't be trying to get that starting receiver back.\"\n\nThe deals, however, involve more changes to a team with just 28 players who opened training camp on Buffalo's roster a year ago. The Bills also have just 14 players whom they've drafted, not including this year's six-player class.\n\nWatkins' future in Buffalo was already in question after the Bills declined to pick up his fifth-year contract option in May. He is entering the final year of his deal. Matthews is also entering the final season of his contract, so the Eagles also faced the possibility of losing him in free agency.\n\nWatkins showed glimpses of being a dynamic threat when healthy in three seasons with Buffalo since being selected in the first round of the 2014 draft. He has 153 catches for 2,459 yards and 17 touchdowns in three seasons, but topped 1,000 yards just once, in 2015.\n\nWatkins has been hampered by an assortment of injuries and limited to playing just eight games last year after having surgery to repair a broken left foot. He required a second operation in January after aggravating the injury last season.\n\nHe joins a revamped group of receivers on a Rams offense that has ranked last in the NFL in each of the past two seasons.\n\nThe change for the Bills came four days after signing veteran free agent Anquan Boldin. Matthews was Philadelphia's most productive receiver, averaging 75 catches, 891 receiving yards and six touchdowns in his first three seasons. But the Eagles signed free-agent receivers Alshon Jeffery and Torrey Smith and drafted Mack Hollins and Shelton Gibson.\n\nDarby started 29 games in his first two seasons in Buffalo. He was a second-round pick (50th overall) in the 2015 draft.\n\nThough he wasn't shopping either player, Beane said he first began receiving inquiries about Watkins in June. The Eagles' interest in Darby then developed later and both deals began falling into place over the past week.\n\nHe presented both trades to McDermott and owner Terry Pegula on Thursday night, following Buffalo's preseason-opening 17-10 loss to Minnesota.\n\nMcDermott said he had little sleep after spending much of the night attending meetings and going over the pros and cons of the two trades.\n\nHe's also aware of how two new additions have the potential of setting back the team's preparedness for the start of the regular season at a time the franchise is in the midst of a 17-year playoff drought -- the longest active streak in North America's four major professional sports.\n\n\"I'm invested. I know and feel what they feel,\" McDermott said, referring to Bills fans. \"We're building a football team that we want to compete in the short- and long-term and be good for a long time. Sometimes that's a day to day process, and sometimes those are not easy decisions.\"\n\nBuffalo's secondary will be completely revamped minus Darby. The Bills lost starter Stephon Gilmore and third-stringer Nickell Robey-Coleman in free agency and also released both starting safeties, Aaron Williams and Corey Graham.\n\nGaines was valuable defensive back in the Rams' rotation. He won a starting job in 2015 but then got hurt before the season started. He became expendable after the Rams acquired Kayvon Webster this offseason, who is pegged to start opposite Trumaine Johnson.\n\nNOTES: S Bacarri Rambo is listed week to week after hurting his hamstring against Minnesota. ...

(AP) -- The Buffalo Bills' offseason overhaul isn't over yet now that receiver Sammy Watkins and cornerback Ronald Darby became the latest players to be sent packing.\n\nThe Bills dealt both starters in separate blockbuster trades on Friday in an effort to reshape the roster under new coach Sean McDermott.\n\nWatkins was traded to the Los Angeles Rams, while Darby was sent to the Philadelphia Eagles. Buffalo addressed both positions by acquiring receiver Jordan Matthews from Philadelphia and cornerback E.J. Gaines from the Rams.\n\nThe Bills also continued looking to the future by further stockpiling 2018 draft selections. They acquired a second-round pick from L.A. and a third-rounder from the Eagles, while also sending a sixth-round pick to the Rams. Buffalo now has two picks in each of the first three rounds next year after acquiring the Kansas City Chiefs first-round selection in April.\n\nThe additional picks provide Bills general manager Brandon Beane assets in a draft that looks as if it will have several top-end quarterback prospects. Bills starter Tyrod Taylor's future is uncertain beyond this season.\n\nMcDermott acknowledged his most difficult challenge was not merely breaking the news of Watkins' departure to Taylor.\n\n''I'll take it a step further: How do you sell it to the entire team?'' McDermott said, before outlining his message.\n\n''You put one step in front of the other and we move on,'' he said. ''I asked them to continue to trust me and our decisions in terms of what we're doing.''\n\nJust don't call it a rebuilding plan , Beane said.\n\n''This is not a throw-in-the-towel thing at all,'' Beane said. ''If we were throwing in the towel, I wouldn't be trying to get that starting receiver back.''\n\nThe deals, however, involve more changes to a team with just 28 players who opened training camp on Buffalo's roster a year ago. The Bills also have just 14 players whom they've drafted, not including this year's six-player class.\n\nThe trades caught Bills players by surprise a day after a 17-10 preseason-opening loss to Minnesota.\n\n''It's tough to lose a guy like Sammy,'' Taylor said. ''We have to put a positive lining. It's a win-now league. And as a team, we have to refocus, do whatever it takes to win games.''\n\nWatkins' future in Buffalo was already in question after the Bills declined to pick up his fifth-year contract option in May. Matthews is also entering the final season of his contract.\n\nWhen healthy, Watkins showed glimpses of being a dynamic threat since Buffalo gave up a 2015 first-round pick to trade up five spots and select him fourth overall in 2014. He has 153 catches for 2,459 yards and 17 touchdowns in three seasons, but topped 1,000 yards just once, in 2015.\n\nWatkins has been hampered by an assortment of injuries and limited to playing just eight games last season after having surgery for a broken left foot. He required a second operation in January after aggravating the injury last season.\n\nHe joins a revamped group of receivers on a Rams offense that has ranked last in the NFL in each of the past two seasons.\n\nBuffalo is also retooling its receiver position, with the trade coming four days after signing veteran free agent Anquan Boldin .\n\nMatthews was Philadelphia's most productive receiver, averaging 75 catches, 891 receiving yards and six touchdowns in his first three seasons. But the Eagles signed free-agent receivers Alshon Jeffery and Torrey Smith and drafted Mack Hollins and Shelton Gibson.\n\nThe key for Philadelphia was adding a starting-caliber cornerback in Darby to a defense that plays in the pass-happy NFC East.\n\n''It's a corner-deficient league. It's hard to find those guys,'' Eagles executive vice president of football operations Howie Roseman said. ''And teams that have them aren't really ready to move them.''\n\nDarby started 29 games since the Bills selected him in the second round of the 2015 draft.\n\nGaines was a valuable defensive back in the Rams' rotation. He won a starting job in 2015, but then got hurt before the season started. He became expendable after the Rams acquired Kayvon Webster this offseason, who is pegged to start opposite Trumaine Johnson.\n\nMcDermott is aware how the trades have the potential of setting back Buffalo's preparedness at a time the franchise is in the midst of a 17-year playoff drought - the longest active streak in North America's four major professional sports.\n\nRead More\n\n''I'm invested. I know and feel what they feel,'' McDermott said, referring to Bills fans. ''We're building a football team that we want to compete in the short and long term and be good for a long time. Sometimes that's a day-to-day process, and sometimes those are not easy decisions.''\n\nNOTES: S Bacarri Rambo is listed week to week after hurting his hamstring against Minnesota. ... The Bills are off Saturday before returning to training camp on Sunday. ... Matthews and Darby will get to face their former teams on Thursday, when the Bills travel to play Philadelphia in a preseason game.\n\n---\n\nAP Pro Football Writer Rob Maaddi in Philadelphia and AP Sports Writer Greg Beacham in Los Angeles contributed to this report.\n\n---\n\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and https://www.twitter.com/AP-NFL", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T23:47:00Z", "sim": 0.8549019694328308, "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "title": "Yahoo Sports", "id": "2139"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "07:10:00", "url": "https://sports.yahoo.com/eagles-trade-jordan-matthews-bills-ronald-darby-171240724--nfl.html", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8756317", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4biyVoIGay7ReKARACUmUQ--/aD0xMzk2O3c9MjA5NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/Sports/ap/201708041118406918313", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "23:47:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

(AP) -- The Buffalo Bills' offseason overhaul isn't over yet with receiver Sammy Watkins and cornerback Ronald Darby the latest players to be sent packing.\n\nThe Bills dealt both starters in separate blockbuster trades on Friday as part of an effort to reshape the roster under new coach Sean McDermott.\n\nWatkins was traded to the Los Angeles Rams, while Darby was sent to the Philadelphia Eagles. Buffalo addressed both positions by acquiring receiver Jordan Matthews from Philadelphia and cornerback E.J. Gaines from the Rams.\n\nThe Bills also continued looking to the future by further stockpiling 2018 draft selections. They acquired a second-round pick from L.A. and a third-rounder from the Eagles, while also sending a sixth-round pick to the Rams. Add in the acquisition of the Kansas Chiefs' first-round pick in a trade completed in April, and the Bills now have two picks in each of the first three rounds next year.\n\nThe additional picks provide Bills new general manager Brandon Beane assets in a draft that looks like it will have several top-end quarterback prospects. Bills starter Tyrod Taylor's future is uncertain beyond this year.\n\nBeane disputed the notion he's strictly looking ahead to next year.\n\n\"This is not a throw-in-the-towel thing at all,\" Beane said. \"If we were throwing in the towel, I wouldn't be trying to get that starting receiver back.\"\n\nThe deals, however, involve more changes to a team with just 28 players who opened training camp on Buffalo's roster a year ago. The Bills also have just 14 players whom they've drafted, not including this year's six-player class.\n\nWatkins' future in Buffalo was already in question after the Bills declined to pick up his fifth-year contract option in May. He is entering the final year of his deal. Matthews is also entering the final season of his contract, so the Eagles also faced the possibility of losing him in free agency.\n\nWatkins showed glimpses of being a dynamic threat when healthy in three seasons with Buffalo since being selected in the first round of the 2014 draft. He has 153 catches for 2,459 yards and 17 touchdowns in three seasons, but topped 1,000 yards just once, in 2015.\n\nWatkins has been hampered by an assortment of injuries and was limited to playing just eight games last year after having surgery to repair a broken left foot. He required a second operation in January after aggravating the injury last season.\n\nHe joins a revamped group of receivers on a Rams offense that has ranked last in the NFL in each of the past two seasons.\n\nMatthews was Philadelphia's most productive receiver, averaging 75 catches, 891 receiving yards and six touchdowns in his first three seasons. But the Eagles signed free-agent receivers Alshon Jeffery and Torrey Smith and drafted Mack Hollins and Shelton Gibson.\n\nDarby started 29 games in his first two seasons in Buffalo. He was a second-round pick (50th overall) in the 2015 draft.\n\nThough he wasn't shopping either player, Beane said he first began receiving inquiries about Watkins in June. The Eagles' interest in Darby then developed later and both deals began falling into place over the past week.\n\nHe presented both trades to McDermott and owner Terry Pegula on Thursday night, following Buffalo's preseason-opening 17-10 loss to Minnesota.\n\nMcDermott said he had little sleep after spending much of the night attending meetings and going over the pros and cons of the two trades.\n\nHe's also aware of how two new additions have the potential of setting back the team's preparedness for the start of the regular season at a time the franchise is in the midst of a 17-year playoff drought -- the longest active streak in North America's four major professional sports.\n\n\"I'm invested. I know and feel what they feel,\" McDermott said, referring to Bills fans. \"We're building a football team that we want to compete in the short- and long-term and be good for a long time.

Matthews was a second-round pick by Philly in 2014 -- the same draft class as Watkins. He has been on the field more frequently than Watkins, while also being productive (he has scored 19 touchdowns in 46 games).\n\nThe Bills found some stability when they added veteran receiver Anquan Boldin to the mix, and they probably feel Watkins is not worth the gamble if they can have Matthews and Boldin in the offense. Defensively they are giving up Darby for Gaines. Gaines has had injury troubles and is a question mark as he played 11 games last season.\n\nThe Bills' secondary has no doubt gotten worse between the loss of Stephon Gilmore in free agency and Darby now, but at least they have picked up two draft picks for next season. You have to respect their recent maneuvering.\n\nAnd the Rams, which lacked major offensive weapons, finally have one in Watkins, so long as he can stay on the field.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-08-11", "textEnd": 472, "textStart": 457, "freq": 2}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T17:04:00Z", "sim": 0.8470588326454163, "source": {"uri": "larrybrownsports.com", "title": "Larry Brown Sports", "id": "8736"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "17:04:00", "url": "http://larrybrownsports.com/football/bills-trade-sammy-watkins-acquire-jordan-matthews-in-separate-deals/387659", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8666561", "image": "http://larrybrownsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/sammy-watkins.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "17:04:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

Gaines and a second-round pick. Buffalo also acquired WR Jordan Matthews and a third-round pick from the Eagles for CB Ronald Darby.\n\nIn trading Sammy Watkins, the Bills did little to justify Tyrod Taylor's faith. Friday's trades look to be about acquiring draft picks and rebuilding.\n\nBuffalo's new regime of Sean McDermott and Brandon Beane inherited a roster that appeared to top out short of the playoffs, so it's no surprise they've spent most of the offseason trying to undo deposed general manager Doug Whaley's mistakes. The Bills repeatedly traded down during the 2017 draft, grabbing an extra 2018 first-round pick from the Chiefs from their troubles, before firing Whaley the day after the draft.\n\nOn Friday, they added to their haul by acquiring a pair of 2018 picks as part of deals with the Eagles and Rams. Those trades amount to the following:\n\nBuffalo Bills get: WR Jordan Matthews, CB E.J. Gaines, Rams' 2018 second-round pick, Eagles' 2018 third-round pick\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles get: CB Ronald Darby\n\nLos Angeles Rams get: WR Sammy Watkins, Bills' 2018 sixth-round pick\n\nThe dust is still settling, but at first glance, let's run through the winners and losers from these three deals:\n\nJared Goff\n\nAs the Rams try to build some sort of offensive infrastructure for the 2016 first overall pick, it's hard to imagine their acquiring a better receiver to work with than Watkins, who averaged 80.5 receiving yards per game while healthy in 2015, good for what would be nearly 1,300 receiving yards over a 16-game campaign. While Watkins hasn't lived up to the draft-day trade that saw the Bills deal two first-round picks to move up and acquire him ahead of Mike Evans and Odell Beckham Jr. in 2014, injuries have been the problem, not talent.\n\nSammy Watkins\n\nThis was always going to be a huge season for Watkins, who was set to hit unrestricted free agency after the Bills declined to pick up the fifth-year option on his rookie deal for 2018. Last year was a lost season for the Clemson product, given that the Bills repeatedly pushed Watkins onto the field with a clear foot injury before Watkins finally underwent what ended up as two surgeries on his left foot. It seemed likely that the Bills would part company with Watkins after the year regardless of what happened.\n\nIt's hard to see how Watkins will be in a better situation for either his short- or long-term future. After being traded to the Rams, who gave up a starting cornerback and a high pick to acquire him, Watkins is likely looking at the franchise tag if he breaks out in 2017. It's not clear that would have been the case in Buffalo, and the tag will cost him millions of dollars versus what he could get on the free market.\n\nHe's also now set to play out his contract year with Goff, who was one of the worst quarterbacks in recent memory during his debut season, as opposed to the criminally underrated Tyrod Taylor. Goff should be better during his second season, especially with the arrival of Sean McVay from Washington as coach, but there's a chance Watkins is relying on a replacement-level quarterback to make him millions of dollars.\n\nTyrod Taylor\n\nSpeaking of the Bills quarterback, Taylor also finds himself in a make-or-break year, even if that career might not be in western New York. Taylor just lost his top receiver, and while he's getting a viable weapon in Matthews, remember that Matthews was the focal point of a wide receiving corps that was seen as one of the worst in the league in Philadelphia last season. Even if you argue that Matthews has a higher floor than Watkins by virtue of missing a total of just two games over the past three seasons, it should take some time for Taylor to develop a rapport with his new No. 1 wideout.\n\nJordan Matthews\n\nThe Broncos were comfortably a three-wideout team under new Bills offensive coordinator Rick Dennison, going three-wide as high as 72 percent of the time in 2014, per Football Outsiders, which was the fourth-highest rate in the league. At the same time, though, the Bills just paid $8.4 million over four years to sign fullback Patrick DiMarco this offseason, suggesting that their organizational plan was to roll a fullback onto the field more often than not.\n\nMore people play on ESPN than anywhere else. Join or create a league in the No. 1 Fantasy Football game! Sign up for free!\n\nThe presence of DiMarco (and Mike Tolbert) suggests that Matthews will be spending more time on the outside than he did in Philadelphia, where he was primarily a slot receiver. That could be a positive if he succeeds on the edge, given that some teams still discount the work done by receivers out of the slot.\n\nMore than anything, though, it's clear that Matthews is going to get far more targets in Buffalo than he would have in Philadelphia, where he was competing with Alshon Jeffery, Torrey Smith, Darren Sproles and a bevy of tight ends for targets. Now Matthews will be the primary focus of a receiving corps that includes second-round pick Zay Jones, the newly signed Anquan Boldin, a limited Charles Clay and LeSean McCoy. The Vandy product has a great shot at topping the 117 targets he racked up a year ago, which could get Matthews paid this offseason. It's also possible that the Bills give him a sweetheart deal in an attempt to smooth things over with their fans in advance of what looks like another rebuild.\n\nNelson Agholor\n\nWho saw that one coming? Agholor was basically left for dead after two frustrating seasons in Philadelphia, but after training camp reports suggested Agholor looked like a new man in the slot, the Eagles cleared out a spot for him by trading away Matthews. Coach Doug Pederson might not go three-wide all that often -- Philadelphia was there 60 percent of the time last season, 26th in the league -- but Agholor went from looking like a likely trade candidate to securing a roster spot with an outside shot at meaningful receptions.\n\nThe Eagles\n\nPhiladelphia was looking downright bereft at cornerback for the second consecutive season, having cycled again through middling veterans while using second- and third-round picks on Sidney Jones and Rasul Douglas, the former of whom is likely to miss a chunk of the 2017 season after rupturing his Achilles at his pro day. While the Eagles had long-term hope at the position, this is a team that should be capable of competing as early as this season. Cornerback was their biggest weakness.\n\nNow they have a promising option in both the short term and long term in Darby, who was stunningly effective during his debut season in Buffalo before slipping badly last season. Defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz has done excellent work with undersized corners in years past, notably launching Cortland Finnegan's career in Tennessee. It's too early to suggest Darby's a reclamation project, but dealing a wide receiver the Eagles were unlikely to sign for a likely starter at cornerback is a totally logical move, even if it did hurt to give up a third-round pick in the process.\n\nThe Rams\n\nSo much of what the Rams do on a year-to-year basis seems to be about erasing or accounting for the mistakes they've made in the past. Here again they're addressing their disastrous investment and reinvestment in the badly miscast Tavon Austin by shelling out another draft pick and what is (in the best case) going to be a huge contract to retain Watkins for the years to come.\n\nYou could understand why the Rams would want to take a shot at Watkins, but the 2018 free-agent wide receiver class is staggering, including players like Matthews, DeAndre Hopkins and Allen Robinson. Some of those guys will re-sign with their current teams, of course, but maybe the Rams end up giving someone like Jeffery or Terrelle Pryor a big deal. That wouldn't be the end of the world.\n\nWhat's frustrating about this move is that the Rams had to give up a second-round pick to acquire Watkins. Given that they're unlikely to be very good -- ESPN's FPI projects them to finish with the league's fifth-worst record -- chances are they'll be sending a high second-rounder to the Bills to acquire a player who hasn't been healthy for most of his career.\n\nAfter trading away a bevy of picks to acquire Goff, the Rams can't be in the pick-trading business. If anything, they should be looking at trading down and acquiring selections. (I realize they're getting a sixth-rounder, but per Chase Stuart's chart, even the top pick of the sixth round is worth just 12 percent as much as the fifth pick of the second round, the selection the Rams project to send to Buffalo.)\n\nEven if Los Angeles' bet on Watkins works out in 2017, the Rams are going to be stuck using their franchise tag or making a long-term bet on a player with a history of foot injuries. They could recoup a compensatory draft pick if they let Watkins leave, but that assumes Watkins will have a big-enough year to justify a serious deal in free agency while the Rams themselves mostly sit out, which seems like a very unlikely proposition.\n\nThey're also going to be in serious trouble at cornerback, where they just traded away Gaines and won't be able to afford franchising Trumaine Johnson for a third time after the season. Wade Phillips is a defensive genius, but the best guy on Los Angeles' depth chart for 2018 appears to be Broncos import Kayvon Webster, who played 58 defensive snaps last season and has spent the last several years buried underneath a stacked depth chart in Denver.\n\nThe Bills\n\nAs frustrating as this must be for Buffalo's fans, who are stuck undergoing yet another rebuild, the Bills are making the right sort of moves as they try to build a team to (eventually) make noise in the postseason. It's clear that the organization had soured on Watkins and had serious concerns about his ability to stay healthy; otherwise, they wouldn't have passed up the wideout's fifth-year option. And if the Bills don't have a lot of faith in Watkins staying healthy enough to pass a physical in 2018, it's difficult to imagine that they would see signing Watkins as a wise decision in the long term, either.\n\nIf you're going to move on from Watkins, then, this is a reasonable haul. You might argue that the Bills make a slight downgrade at cornerback by swapping Darby for Gaines, who has struggled with his own foot injuries. It's pretty clear Watkins has a higher upside than Matthews, although the higher floor for Matthews might offer some level of certainty the Bills prefer if they're handing out a long-term deal.\n\nWhat's really crucial, though, are those extra draft picks. As projected by FPI and using Stuart's chart, the Bills trading their sixth-round pick for Los Angeles' second-rounder and Philadelphia's third-round pick to trade the Rams pick (37, fifth-lowest FPI projection) and Eagles pick (80, 16th-lowest FPI projection) for pick 190 (the Bills have the sixth-lowest projection and that was the sixth-lowest pick of the sixth round, obviously the exact pick will pend specific compensatory selections) is roughly the equivalent of acquiring the 16th overall pick in a typical draft (17.1 points, closest to value of 16th pick, 16.9 points).\n\nThat gives the Bills what essentially amounts to three first-round picks in the 2018 draft, given that they'll have their own pick and Kansas City's selection from the Patrick Mahomes II trade. They can add a third-round compensatory pick for Stephon Gilmore if they cut three players from the group of DiMarco, Vladimir Ducasse, Ryan Harris, Andre Holmes and Steven Hauschka before Week 10, a move I would strongly encourage. Draft picks alone aren't a solution, but the best way to build a sustainably effective team isn't to trade up for a stud wide receiver or an inside linebacker, as the Bills did by sending multiple picks to acquire Reggie Ragland last season. It's to acquire draft picks and build a core of cheap, effective talent. As the Bills try to chase the juggernaut Patriots, they're wisely taking a page out of Bill Belichick's book.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T20:45:00Z", "sim": 0.843137264251709, "source": {"uri": "gearsofbiz.com", "title": "gearsofbiz.com", "id": "19218"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "04:46:00", "url": "http://gearsofbiz.com/winners-and-losers-from-bills-rams-eagles-mega-trades/6657", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8744552", "image": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "20:45:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

(AP Photo/Rich Barnes)\n\nBy John Wawrow, Associated Press\n\nORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) -- The Buffalo Bills' offseason overhaul isn't over yet with receiver Sammy Watkins and cornerback Ronald Darby the latest players to be sent packing.\n\nThe Bills dealt both starters in separate blockbuster trades on Friday as part of an effort to reshape the roster under new coach Sean McDermott.\n\nWatkins was traded to the Los Angeles Rams, while Darby was sent to the Philadelphia Eagles. Buffalo addressed both positions by acquiring receiver Jordan Matthews from Philadelphia and cornerback E.J. Gaines from the Rams.\n\nThe Bills also continued looking to the future by further stockpiling 2018 draft selections. They acquired a second-round pick from L.A. and a third-rounder from the Eagles, while also sending a sixth-round pick to the Rams. Add in the acquisition of the Kansas Chiefs' first-round pick in trade completed in April, and the Bills now have two picks in each of the first three rounds next year.\n\nThe additional picks provide Bills new general manager Brandon Beane assets in a draft that looks like it will have several top-end quarterback prospects. Bills starter Tyrod Taylor's future is uncertain beyond this year.\n\nBeane disputed the notion he's strictly looking ahead to next year.\n\n\"This is not a throw-in-the-towel thing at all,\" Beane said. \"If we were throwing in the towel, I wouldn't be trying to get that starting receiver back.\"\n\nThe deals, however, involve more changes to a team with just 28 players who opened training camp on Buffalo's roster a year ago. The Bills also have just 14 players whom they've drafted, not including this year's six-player class.\n\nWatkins' future in Buffalo was already in question after the Bills declined to pick up his fifth-year contract option in May. He is entering the final year of his deal. Matthews is also entering the final season of his contract, so the Eagles also faced the possibility of losing him in free agency.\n\nWatkins showed glimpses of being a dynamic threat when healthy in three seasons with Buffalo since being selected in the first round of the 2014 draft. He has 153 catches for 2,459 yards and 17 touchdowns in three seasons, but topped 1,000 yards just once, in 2015.\n\nWatkins has been hampered by an assortment of injuries and limited to playing just eight games last year after having surgery to repair a broken left foot. He required a second operation in January after aggravating the injury last season.\n\nHe joins a revamped group of receivers on a Rams offense that has ranked last in the NFL in each of the past two seasons.\n\nThe change for the Bills came four days after signing veteran free agent Anquan Boldin . Matthews was Philadelphia's most productive receiver, averaging 75 catches, 891 receiving yards and six touchdowns in his first three seasons. But the Eagles signed free-agent receivers Alshon Jeffery and Torrey Smith and drafted Mack Hollins and Shelton Gibson.\n\nDarby started 29 games in his first two seasons in Buffalo. He was a second-round pick (50th overall) in the 2015 draft.\n\nThough he wasn't shopping either player, Beane said he first began receiving inquiries about Watkins in June. The Eagles' interest in Darby then developed later and both deals began falling into place over the past week.\n\nHe presented both trades to McDermott and owner Terry Pegula on Thursday night, following Buffalo's preseason-opening 17-10 loss to Minnesota.\n\nMcDermott said he had little sleep after spending much of the night attending meetings and going over the pros and cons of the two trades.\n\nHe's also aware of how two new additions have the potential of setting back the team's preparedness for the start of the regular season at a time the franchise is in the midst of a 17-year playoff drought -- the longest active streak in in North America's four major professional sports.\n\n\"I'm invested. I know and feel what they feel,\" McDermott said, referring to Bills fans. \"We're building a football team that we want to compete in the short- and long-term and be good for a long time. Sometimes that's a day to day process, and sometimes those are not easy decisions.\"\n\nBuffalo's secondary will be completely revamped minus Darby. The Bills lost starter Stephon Gilmore and third-stringer Nickell Robey-Coleman in free agency and also released both starting safeties, Aaron Williams and Corey Graham.\n\nGaines was valuable defensive back in the Rams' rotation. He won a starting job in 2015 but then got hurt before the season started. He became expendable after the Rams acquired Kayvon Webster this offseason, who is pegged to start opposite Trumaine Johnson.\n\nNOTES: S Bacarri Rambo is listed week to week after hurting his hamstring against Minnesota. ... The Bills are off Saturday before returning to training camp on Sunday.\n\n___", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-08-10", "textEnd": 197, "textStart": 184}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T01:07:00Z", "sim": 0.843137264251709, "source": {"uri": "sports.abs-cbn.com", "title": "ABS-CBN SPORTS", "id": "6300"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "01:07:00", "url": "http://sports.abs-cbn.com/nfl/news/2017/08/12/bills-trade-watkins-rams-get-matthews-eagles-29638", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8727726", "image": "http://data-sports.abs-cbn.com/dev/articles/1502494605_photo-250x250-vikings-bills-footbal-webf-small.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "01:07:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

Here's a deep dive on all the implications of this big deal.\n\nIn some ways, it's a bummer to see JMatt go. He was a productive player with a fun personality who worked very hard and was well-liked in the Eagles locker room. He seemed to have a pretty tight relationship with Carson Wentz.\n\nSpeaking of Wentz, this trade may seem curious when you consider this offseason has been all about giving the young Eagles quarterback weapons to work with. In this case the Eagles removed a safety blanket for Wentz.\n\nBut it's hard to blame the Eagles for feeling this trade was necessary. As I explained all along, Matthews was never going to be re-signed after this year. The Eagles have a number of key players set to be free agents next offseason. Due to limited cap space, Philadelphia can't extend everyone and it's very easy to argue Matthews will get overpaid due to inflated volume stats. This trade was very much a business decision by the Eagles.\n\nIn any case, here's wishing Matthews the best in Buffalo.\n\nAnd here's wishing Darby the best in Philadelphia.\n\nThe Eagles suddenly have a new No. 1 cornerback. That's a huge relief considering how much the team's corners have struggled during practice this offseason. There was just no way the Eagles could go into the season with the group they had before adding Darby.\n\nThere are some questions about just how good Darby is following a lackluster 2016 season. It seems like Buffalo's defense as a whole didn't perform well under Rex Ryan last season, though. Darby looked really good as a rookie in 2015. The former second-round pick might not be an elite player but he's at least a capable starter. 33 pass breakups in 29 starts is pretty impressive.\n\nBills fans seem to upset Buffalo traded Darby, who many believed to be the team's best cornerback. We'll have more insight from Bills fans on this trade at Bleeding Green Nation in the coming days.\n\nDarby is a bright young talent at the age of 23. He's hardly the Eagles' only young corner, though.\n\nRonald Darby - 23\n\nJalen Mills - 23\n\nSidney Jones - 21\n\nRasul Douglas - 21\n\nC.J. Smith - 24\n\nDarby and Mills are likely the starters for this season. It remains to be seen what happens with 29-year-old Patrick Robinson, who has really struggled in training camp. Jones and Douglas likely won't have major roles this season. The injured Jones might not play at all while Douglas seems like he needs more time to adjust to the NFL. It's not impossible that Douglas will split playing time with Mills or eventually take over his job, however. Smith isn't a flashy prospect but he's looked solid since signing with the team as an undrafted free agent last offseason. He could be a nice depth guy to have around.\n\nThere's really no guarantee any of these players pan out, but this group is more inspiring than what the Eagles have had at corner in a long time. There's at least some long-term potential here to work with.\n\nIt's exciting to think about the combination of a healthy Jones and Darby starting in 2018.\n\nThe Eagles still have seven picks in next year's draft. They're missing their second rounder due to the Carson Wentz trade. The third rounder was obviously dealt for Darby.\n\nPhiladelphia will potentially have one Day 2 pick if Eric Rowe plays at least 50% of New England's defensive snaps this season. If that happens, the Patriots' pick will elevate to a third rounder.\n\nGiven Howie Roseman's penchant for making trades, it wouldn't be surprising if he packaged some combination of picks/players to get more pick(s) on Day 2 before next year's draft.\n\nFor reference, here's a recap of the Eagles' draft picks in 2019 as well.\n\n1st\n\n2nd\n\n3rd\n\n4th\n\n5th\n\n6th\n\n7th\n\n7th - (from Denver Broncos; conditional)\n\nTrading Matthews saved the Eagles $1,094,901 in cap space but the Eagles took on Darby's $800,426 base salary for this year. So this move didn't really impact the Eagles' cap space much.\n\nSpotrac projects Matthews to sign a five-year deal worth around $50,138,099 after this season. As previously stated, the Eagles were never likely to sign him to that deal. Now the Birds won't have to worry about him and they can focus on re-signing Alshon Jeffery, Tim Jernigan, Nigel Bradham, etc.\n\nAs for Darby, he's eligible for a contract extension after this season. His deal runs through the 2019 season, though, so the Eagles don't have to rush to pay him.'\n\nThe Eagles obviously don't trade Matthews if they had last year's group of receivers here. Philadelphia feels really good about their receiving corps. Alshon Jeffery has looked like the real deal all offseason long. He's a beast. Torrey Smith has caught the ball well in practice and still looks fast despite two down years in San Francisco. Nelson Agholor has look improved in practice, though he's struggled a little recently.\n\nBut the Eagles aren't just putting all their eggs in the Agholor basket. Rookie Mack Hollins has shown reliable hands and play-making ability. Marcus Johnson has shown he's capable of taking the top off a defense and making plays underneath as well. Bryce Treggs is having a productive summer. Greg Ward Jr. has made surprisingly good progress and might have the makings of a reliable slot receiver. David Watford looks practice squad worthy at the very least.\n\nA number of these young receivers aren't as proven as Matthews, that's for sure. But they've shown potential worth betting on. The Eagles are taking a reasonable risk.\n\nIt can certainly be argued that Matthews was the Eagles' best slot option. But he is far from their only slot option.\n\nThe Eagles have no shortage of players they can use in the slot. Agholor is likely the favorite to take snaps there, as Daniel Jeremiah indicated last week. But the Eagles can also line up Jeffery, who ran 17% of his routes from there in 2016 per Pro Football Focus, there in certain situations. Hollins is an option in the slot. Ward could get some looks there if he makes the team. Darren Sproles, Donnel Pumphrey, and Wendell Smallwood are all running backs with receiving ability. The Eagles line up Zach Ertz and Trey Burton not only in the slot but outside as well at times.\n\nPhiladelphia doesn't necessarily need to have an every-down slot guy like they did with Matthews. They can get creative and mix and match their slot options in order to add a new level of unpredictability to the offense.\n\nOddly enough, Matthews will be returning to Philadelphia this upcoming Thursday when the Eagles play the Bills at Lincoln Financial Field. This should be a nice opportunity for Philly fans to give Matthews some recognition for the hard work he's put in during his time with the Eagles.\n\nWe asked you to grade the Matthews-Darby trade and here's what you said.\n\nMy personal grade for the trade was a \"B\" rating so clearly great minds think alike. You can still vote in the poll by (clicking here).\n\nI've seen it suggested the Eagles should have kept Matthews as insurance if something happens to Jeffery. That doesn't make sense because Matthews clearly isn't a No. 1 receiver. If Jeffery isn't the answer, the Eagles will need to find another one, because Matthews was never the solution in that regard. But that's all moot now anyway.\n\nOverall, I'm glad the Matthews deal is done. It was pretty obvious that he wasn't in the team's long-term plans. Now the debates can stop and we can all look forward to seeing what Darby brings to the table.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T09:20:00Z", "sim": 0.8392156958580017, "source": {"uri": "bleedinggreennation.com", "title": "Bleeding Green Nation", "id": "6261"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "12:34:00", "url": "https://www.bleedinggreennation.com/2017/8/12/16137882/jordan-matthews-ronald-darby-trade-means-eagles-philadelphia-analysis-opinion-breakdown-bills-nfl-cb", "storyUri": "eng-3355470", "id": "8791493", "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F97nndv-AcfPjdPnj95NWCJNgmA=/0x59:2100x1240/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56163287/usa_today_8995970.0.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "09:20:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

(AP) -- The Buffalo Bills' offseason overhaul isn't over yet with receiver Sammy Watkins and cornerback Ronald Darby the latest players to be sent packing.\n\nThe Bills dealt both starters in separate blockbuster trades on Friday as part of an effort to reshape the roster under new coach Sean McDermott.\n\nWatkins was traded to the Los Angeles Rams, while Darby was sent to the Philadelphia Eagles. Buffalo addressed both positions by acquiring receiver Jordan Matthews from Philadelphia and cornerback E.J. Gaines from the Rams.\n\nThe Bills also continued looking to the future by further stockpiling 2018 draft selections. They acquired a second-round pick from L.A. and a third-rounder from the Eagles, while also sending a sixth-round pick to the Rams.\n\nThe additional picks provide Bills new general manager Brandon Beane assets in a draft that looks like it will have several top-end quarterback prospects. Bills starter Tyrod Taylor's future is uncertain beyond this year.\n\nBeane disputed the notion he's strictly looking ahead to next year.\n\n\"This is not a throw-in-the-towel thing at all,\" Beane said. \"If we were throwing in the towel, I wouldn't be trying to get that starting receiver back.\"\n\nThe deals, however, involve more changes to a team with just 28 players who opened training camp on Buffalo's roster a year ago.\n\nWatkins' future in Buffalo was already in question after the Bills declined to pick up his fifth-year contract option in May. He is entering the final year of his deal. Matthews is also entering the final season of his contract, so the Eagles also faced the possibility of losing him in free agency.\n\nWatkins showed glimpses of being a dynamic threat when healthy in three seasons with Buffalo since being selected in the first round of the 2014 draft. He has 153 catches for 2,459 yards and 17 touchdowns in three seasons, but topped 1,000 yards just once, in 2015.\n\nWatkins has been hampered by an assortment of injuries and limited to playing just eight games last year after having surgery to repair a broken left foot. He required a second operation in January after aggravating the injury last season.\n\nHe joins a revamped group of receivers on a Rams offense that has ranked last in the NFL in each of the past two seasons.\n\nThe change for the Bills came four days after signing veteran free agent Anquan Boldin . Matthews was Philadelphia's most productive receiver, averaging 75 catches, 891 receiving yards and six touchdowns in his first three seasons. But the Eagles signed free-agent receivers Alshon Jeffery and Torrey Smith and drafted Mack Hollins and Shelton Gibson.\n\nDarby started 29 games in his first two seasons in Buffalo. He was a second-round pick (50th overall) in the 2015 draft.\n\nThough he wasn't shopping either player, Beane said he first began receiving inquiries about Watkins in June. The Eagles' interest in Darby then developed later and both deals began falling into place over the past week.\n\nHe presented both trades to McDermott and owner Terry Pegula on Thursday night, following Buffalo's preseason-opening 17-10 loss to Minnesota.\n\nMcDermott said he had little sleep after spending much of the night attending meetings and going over the pros and cons of the two trades.\n\nHe's also aware of how two new additions have the potential of setting back the team's preparedness for the start of the regular season at a time the franchise is in the midst of a 17-year playoff drought -- the longest active streak in in North America's four major professional sports.\n\n\"I'm invested. I know and feel what they feel,\" McDermott said, referring to Bills fans.\n\n\"We're building a football team that we want to compete in the short- and long-term and be good for a long time. Sometimes that's a day to day process, and sometimes those are not easy decisions.\"\n\nBuffalo's secondary will be completely revamped minus Darby. The Bills lost starter Stephon Gilmore and third-stringer Nickell Robey-Coleman in free agency and also released both starting safeties, Aaron Williams and Corey Graham.\n\nGaines was valuable defensive back in the Rams' rotation.

(AP) -- The Buffalo Bills' offseason overhaul isn't over yet with receiver Sammy Watkins and cornerback Ronald Darby the latest players to be sent packing.\n\nThe Bills dealt both starters in separate blockbuster trades on Friday as part of an effort to reshape the roster under new coach Sean McDermott.\n\nWatkins was traded to the Los Angeles Rams, while Darby was sent to the Philadelphia Eagles. Buffalo addressed both positions by acquiring receiver Jordan Matthews from Philadelphia and cornerback E.J. Gaines from the Rams.\n\nThe Bills also continued looking to the future by further stockpiling 2018 draft selections. They acquired a second-round pick from L.A. and a third-rounder from the Eagles, while also sending a sixth-round pick to the Rams. Add in the acquisition of the Kansas Chiefs' first-round pick in trade completed in April, and the Bills now have two picks in each of the first three rounds next year.\n\nThe additional picks provide Bills new general manager Brandon Beane assets in a draft that looks like it will have several top-end quarterback prospects. Bills starter Tyrod Taylor's future is uncertain beyond this year.\n\nBeane disputed the notion he's strictly looking ahead to next year.\n\n\"This is not a throw-in-the-towel thing at all,\" Beane said. \"If we were throwing in the towel, I wouldn't be trying to get that starting receiver back.\"\n\nThe deals, however, involve more changes to a team with just 28 players who opened training camp on Buffalo's roster a year ago. The Bills also have just 14 players whom they've drafted, not including this year's six-player class.\n\nWatkins' future in Buffalo was already in question after the Bills declined to pick up his fifth-year contract option in May. He is entering the final year of his deal. Matthews is also entering the final season of his contract, so the Eagles also faced the possibility of losing him in free agency.\n\nWatkins showed glimpses of being a dynamic threat when healthy in three seasons with Buffalo since being selected in the first round of the 2014 draft. He has 153 catches for 2,459 yards and 17 touchdowns in three seasons, but topped 1,000 yards just once, in 2015.\n\nWatkins has been hampered by an assortment of injuries and limited to playing just eight games last year after having surgery to repair a broken left foot. He required a second operation in January after aggravating the injury last season.\n\nHe joins a revamped group of receivers on a Rams offense that has ranked last in the NFL in each of the past two seasons.\n\nThe change for the Bills came four days after signing veteran free agent Anquan Boldin . Matthews was Philadelphia's most productive receiver, averaging 75 catches, 891 receiving yards and six touchdowns in his first three seasons. But the Eagles signed free-agent receivers Alshon Jeffery and Torrey Smith and drafted Mack Hollins and Shelton Gibson.\n\nDarby started 29 games in his first two seasons in Buffalo. He was a second-round pick (50th overall) in the 2015 draft.\n\nThough he wasn't shopping either player, Beane said he first began receiving inquiries about Watkins in June. The Eagles' interest in Darby then developed later and both deals began falling into place over the past week.\n\nHe presented both trades to McDermott and owner Terry Pegula on Thursday night, following Buffalo's preseason-opening 17-10 loss to Minnesota.\n\nMcDermott said he had little sleep after spending much of the night attending meetings and going over the pros and cons of the two trades.\n\nHe's also aware of how two new additions have the potential of setting back the team's preparedness for the start of the regular season at a time the franchise is in the midst of a 17-year playoff drought -- the longest active streak in in North America's four major professional sports.\n\n\"I'm invested. I know and feel what they feel,\" McDermott said, referring to Bills fans. \"We're building a football team that we want to compete in the short- and long-term and be good for a long time. Sometimes that's a day to day process, and sometimes those are not easy decisions.\"\n\nBuffalo's secondary will be completely revamped minus Darby. The Bills lost starter Stephon Gilmore and third-stringer Nickell Robey-Coleman in free agency and also released both starting safeties, Aaron Williams and Corey Graham.\n\nGaines was valuable defensive back in the Rams' rotation. He won a starting job in 2015 but then got hurt before the season started.

The Eagles also surrendered a 2018 third-round pick, paying a steep price to try to rectify shortcomings at cornerback.\n\nDarby, 23, was a 2015 second-round pick by the Bills who started 29 games the last two seasons. He has two career interceptions and 33 passes defended. The Florida State product is 5-foot-11 and 193 pounds and instantly upgrades the Eagles' secondary; he will start at cornerback. He also has two years remaining on his contract, which was part of his appeal to the Eagles.\n\nHowie Roseman, the Eagles' executive vice president of football operations, didn't think there would be opportunities this summer to find a young, starting outside cornerback who was not a pending free agent. That made him willing to pay the price.\n\n\"It goes to the player that we got, the position that we're acquiring, and how difficult it is to find those guys,\" Roseman said.\n\nBut the Eagles had to move on from Matthews, who arrived in 2014 and has been productive since day one. In three seasons, Matthews, 25, totaled 225 catches, 2,673 receiving yards, and 19 touchdowns. He was the team's top receiver the last two years and is respected in the locker room for his work ethic and character.\n\n\"Hard to pull the trigger on a trade like that when you're giving up that kind of player and person,\" Roseman said.\n\nMatthews is a free agent at the end of the season, and his name has been in trade rumors since the combine in March. NFL Network analyst Daniel Jeremiah, a former Eagles scout, left training camp this summer believing that Nelson Agholor would be the team's slot receiver this season and did not know where that left Matthews. That ramped up speculation that Matthews could be shipped elsewhere.\n\nRoseman said the Eagles have not actively shopped Matthews, but he acknowledged that when a player's name surfaces in media reports, other teams call. The Eagles could have tried signing Matthews to a contract extension, although Roseman noted the team has several expiring contracts this offseason. Alshon Jeffery's is one of them.\n\n\"It wasn't that (Matthews) wasn't necessarily in our long-term plans,\" Roseman said.\n\nThe Eagles made an offseason commitment to upgrading their wide receivers, which made trading Matthews easier to bear for the offense. The key is Jeffery, who is the team's No. 1 wide receiver and will require a significant salary to stay in Philadelphia. The Eagles have been cautious in their handling of Jeffery, who missed practices this week with a shoulder injury and did not play in Thursday night's exhibition opener against Green Bay. Roseman continued to insist that Jeffery will be ready come opening day on Sept. 10.\n\nVeteran Torrey Smith also has a starting spot on the outside. Without Matthews, the Eagles will likely not stick to one player exclusively in the slot. Agholor would seem to be the biggest beneficiary, and the team is hopeful that the underachieving 2015 first-round pick can rebound this season. But the Eagles can also use tight Ertz and tight end Trey Burton in the slot, along with running back Donnel Pumphrey and rookie receiver Mack Hollins.\n\nAfter an impressive preseason debut on Thursday when he totaled four catches for 64 yards and a touchdown, Hollins bolstered the optimism that was already present concerning the fourth-round pick. He could find a role with the receivers this year and develop into an eventual starter.\n\nAs much as the Eagles emphasized wide receiver this offseason, they did a poor job addressing cornerback. The position appeared to be a glaring weakness, which is why the acquisition of Darby is critical. Journeyman Patrick Robinson was the only veteran added to the group, but he's been inconsistent this summer. The Eagles drafted Sidney Jones in the second round and Rasul Douglas in the third, but Jones could miss the season with an injury suffered before the draft and Douglas is a project.\n\nAcquiring Darby helps them both short term and long term. He can start immediately, but he's also the type of player who can grow with the other young cornerbacks. Jones and Douglas are 21; Darby and Jalen Mills are 23. That's a young core the Eagles want to build around at the position.\n\n\"It's a unique opportunity to have a bunch of young corners at that position,\" Roseman said. \"You look around the league, and it is a corner-deficient league. It's hard to find those guys. It's hard to find guys who've been solid starters in this league and played at a high level. Teams that have them aren't really ready to move them.\"\n\nRoseman said this deal would not have occurred if Darby was a pending free agent like Matthews. However, the additional year also raised the price for Darby. That required the extra third-round pick in the deal. The Eagles are now missing their second- and third-round picks for the 2018 draft. They have three fourth-round picks, one of which could turn into a third if New England cornerback Eric Rowe plays at least 50 percent of the defensive snaps.\n\nRoseman admitted that the second night of the draft could be tough to watch next year. But it's the price the Eagles were willing to pay -- along with one of the most productive, respected players on the team -- to address the cornerback position.\n\n\"It's hard to think about that Friday and think about the fact that potentially...we don't have a pick,\" Roseman said. \"By the same token, we want to set ourselves up for a lot of Sundays where we have good days.\"", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-09-10", "textEnd": 2843, "textStart": 2835}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T15:18:00Z", "sim": 0.8274509906768799, "source": {"uri": "tnonline.com", "title": "East Penn Press", "id": "2111"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "15:18:00", "url": "http://www.tnonline.com/2017/aug/11/eagles-deal-matthews", "storyUri": "eng-3355470", "id": "8809139", "image": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "15:18:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

The 6-foot-3, 205-pounder had 225 receptions for 2,673 yards and 19 touchdowns. According to the Eagles, he was one of only five receivers in the league with at least 65 receptions and 800 receiving yards in each of his first three seasons. The others were Odell Beckham Jr., Mike Evans, A.J. Green and Randy Moss.\n\nLatest Video\n\n\"Since the day we drafted him, Jordan has been an unbelievable teammate, hard worker and obviously incredibly productive,\" Eagles Vice President of Football Operations Howie Roseman said in a news conference streamed on the team's website. \"It's hard to pull the trigger on a trade like that when you're giving up that kind of player and person.\n\n\"A lot of priorities go into building a team that consistently competes for championships, and having a group of cornerbacks that are young and can grow together is very important. We wish Jordan all the best, but we did what we thought was best for our team going forward.\"\n\nThe new guy\n\nDarby, the Bills' second-round draft pick in 2015, appeared in 29 games for Buffalo over the last two seasons. The 5-11, 190-pounder had two interceptions and 137 tackles.\n\nHe joins a secondary that lacks top-notch cornerbacks. Darby, 23, is expected to immediately start for the Eagles, leaving Jalen Mills, Patrick Robinson, rookie Rasul Douglas and Ron Brooks to compete for two other spots. Rookie Sidney Jones could also become a factor when he's recovered from a ruptured Achilles tendon.\n\nBrooks, who was in line to be the Eagles' slot corner this season, suffered a hamstring injury in the Eagles' 24-9 loss at Green Bay on Thursday night.\n\n\"This is a passing-driven league,\" Roseman said. \"People are spreading you out (on defense) with three- and four-wide receiver packages. (The trade) was a unique opportunity to have a bunch of young corners at that position. It's hard to find solid starters.\"\n\nMatthews, who has one year left on his contract, became expendable after the Eagles upgraded their wide receivers during the offseason.\n\nThey signed free agents Alshon Jeffery and Torrey Smith and then drafted Mack Hollins and Shelton Gibson. Nelson Agholor, the Eagles' first-round draft pick in 2015, has been a standout during training camp after two disappointing seasons.\n\n\"You look at wide receiver group as a whole and how they performed throughout the spring, and the competition has been encouraging,\" Roseman said. \"Looking at that group, we have bunch of young players we're excited about.\"\n\nPopular among Eagles\n\nBy trading Matthews, 25, the Eagles lost one of their locker room leaders, however.\n\nAlong with quarterback Carson Wentz and tight end Zach Ertz, he was among the most popular teammates.\n\nThat was reflected in the reaction of some of the players on Twitter when the trade was announced.\n\n\"Crazy part of this business,\" Wentz tweeted. \"(Matthews) you'll always be my boy both on & off the field. Couldn't ask for a better teammate & friend.\"\n\n\"Honestly don't think a teammate had a bigger impact on my life,\" Ertz wrote. \"Going to miss going to battle with (Matthews) on Sunday! Love you bro!\"\n\nIn Buffalo, Jordan will be reunited with running back LeSean McCoy, who was his Eagles teammate in 2014 before being traded to the Bills.\n\nDarby was teammates in Buffalo in 2015 with Eagles linebacker Nigel Bradham and Brooks. Darby has two years remaining on his contract.\n\n\"It hurts when people you care about leave,\" Roseman said. \"The hardest part was talking to Jordan about it. However good he is as a player, he's a better person.

The latest Bills news and rumors have indicated that the team participated in two different trades as of Friday. One of those trades sent their receiver Sammy Watkins to the Los Angeles Rams. In a separate deal, the Buffalo Bills traded away their best cornerback for the Eagles' Jordan Matthews. Both of the deals might give a good sign of the direction that the Buffalo Bills are heading in for the future. Here are the latest details on these two different NFL trade reports as they have happened.\n\nAccording to Bleacher Report on Friday, the Bills' trade involves sending away wide receiver Sammy Watkins and a 2018 pick in the sixth round to the Los Angeles Rams. In exchange, Buffalo is getting cornerback E.J. Gaines and a 2018 second-round pick from the deal. The move seems shocking to many fans as the team made a big trade to go up to No. 4 in the 2014 NFL Draft to acquire him. However, Watkins was hobbled over the 2016 season with a foot injury. He played in just half of the games of the season, racking up just 28 receptions for 430 yards and two touchdowns scored.\n\nThe Sammy Watkins trade wasn't all the Buffalo Bills had in store for their roster, though. Shortly after that news hit, the team traded for Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver Jordan Matthews and a 2018 third-round pick. In exchange, the Bills sent away cornerback Ronald Darby, according to ESPN. Darby was considered their top cornerback on the depth chart.\n\nMatthews, who like Watkins is also in just his fourth season, had 73 receptions for 804 yards and three touchdowns in the 2016 season. Over his career, he's had 225 catches for 2,673 yards and 19 touchdowns. It would seem that this separate trade brings in a new potential top receiver for the team's depth chart heading into their upcoming season.\n\nWith these two deals, the Buffalo Bills have now traded two of their top players at their respective positions, which might signal a rebuild is in progress. In exchange for Watkins and Darby, they did acquire needed position players but also two future draft picks. Buffalo will now have two picks in each of the first three rounds of the 2018 NFL Draft.\n\nThe 2017 season will be the Bills' first under first-year general manager Brandon Beane and coach Sean McDermott. For the 2016 NFL season, Buffalo finished with a record of 7-9 overall but seemed to have a roster that may have been on the rise. Now it looks like that roster will be built in a new direction in the coming seasons.\n\n[Featured Image by Tom Szczerbowski/Getty Images]", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T19:04:00Z", "sim": 0.8235294222831726, "source": {"uri": "inquisitr.com", "title": "The Inquisitr News", "id": "2639"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "19:04:00", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/4426117/buffalo-bills-news-rumors-team-trades-sammy-watkins-to-rams-gets-jordan-matthews-from-eagles/", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8684731", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/buffalo-bills-news-sammy-watkins-traded-to-rams-jordan-matthews-from-eagles.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "19:04:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

The Bills dealt Ronald Darby to the Eagles and acquired E.J. Gaines in the trade with the Rams.\n\nBuffalo also continued stockpiling 2018 draft picks by acquiring a second-round selection from Los Angeles and a third-rounder from the Eagles. The Bills dealt a sixth-round pick to the Rams as part of the Watkins trade.\n\nThe moves were announced early Friday afternoon, a day after Buffalo opened its preseason with a 17-10 loss to Minnesota. The shakeup continues an offseason overhaul under new coach Sean McDermott and GM Brandon Beane.\n\nMatthews had been Philadelphia's most productive receiver, averaging 75 catches, 891 receiving yards and six touchdowns in his first three seasons. But the Eagles signed free-agent receivers Alshon Jeffery and Torrey Smith in the offseason, drafted Mack Hollins and Shelton Gibson and have been pleased with 2015 first-round pick Nelson Agholor's improvement.\n\nDarby started 29 games in his first two seasons in Buffalo. He was a second-round pick (50th overall) in the 2015 draft.\n\nAP sports writer Rob Maaddi in Philadelphia contributed to this report.\n\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T17:34:00Z", "sim": 0.8235294222831726, "source": {"uri": "therepublic.com", "title": "The Republic", "id": "159"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "17:34:00", "url": "http://www.therepublic.com/2017/08/11/fbn-bills-eagles-rams-trades/", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8671725", "image": "http://d1bdhkmqqz901h.cloudfront.net/1200x630/smart/http://s3.amazonaws.com/new-smedia/a503f841df72433d9fa866cd43965600/4a9c719c95ad49a1b6a7da9cf46ef36c.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "17:34:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

Buffalo addressed both positions by acquiring receiver Jordan Matthews from Philadelphia and cornerback E.J. Gaines from the Rams.\n\nThe Bills also continued looking to the future by further stockpiling 2018 draft selections. They acquired a second-round pick from L.A. and a third-rounder from the Eagles, while also sending a sixth-round pick to the Rams. Buffalo now has two picks in each of the first three rounds next year after acquiring the Kansas City Chiefs first-round selection in April.\n\nThe additional picks provide Bills general manager Brandon Beane assets in a draft that looks as if it will have several top-end quarterback prospects. Bills starter Tyrod Taylor's future is uncertain beyond this season.\n\nMcDermott acknowledged his most difficult challenge was not merely breaking the news of Watkins' departure to Taylor.\n\n\"I'll take it a step further: How do you sell it to the entire team?\" McDermott said, before outlining his message.\n\n\"You put one step in front of the other and we move on,\" he said. \"I asked them to continue to trust me and our decisions in terms of what we're doing.\"\n\nJust don't call it a rebuilding plan , Beane said.\n\n\"This is not a throw-in-the-towel thing at all,\" Beane said. \"If we were throwing in the towel, I wouldn't be trying to get that starting receiver back.\"\n\nThe deals, however, involve more changes to a team with just 28 players who opened training camp on Buffalo's roster a year ago. The Bills also have just 14 players whom they've drafted, not including this year's six-player class.\n\nThe trades caught Bills players by surprise a day after a 17-10 preseason-opening loss to Minnesota.\n\n\"It's tough to lose a guy like Sammy,\" Taylor said. \"We have to put a positive lining. It's a win-now league. And as a team, we have to refocus, do whatever it takes to win games.\"\n\nWatkins' future in Buffalo was already in question after the Bills declined to pick up his fifth-year contract option in May. Matthews is also entering the final season of his contract.\n\nWhen healthy, Watkins showed glimpses of being a dynamic threat since Buffalo gave up a 2015 first-round pick to trade up five spots and select him fourth overall in 2014. He has 153 catches for 2,459 yards and 17 touchdowns in three seasons, but topped 1,000 yards just once, in 2015.\n\nWatkins has been hampered by an assortment of injuries and limited to playing just eight games last season after having surgery for a broken left foot. He required a second operation in January after aggravating the injury last season.\n\nHe joins a revamped group of receivers on a Rams offense that has ranked last in the NFL in each of the past two seasons.\n\nBuffalo is also retooling its receiver position, with the trade coming four days after signing veteran free agent Anquan Boldin .\n\nMatthews was Philadelphia's most productive receiver, averaging 75 catches, 891 receiving yards and six touchdowns in his first three seasons. But the Eagles signed free-agent receivers Alshon Jeffery and Torrey Smith and drafted Mack Hollins and Shelton Gibson.\n\nThe key for Philadelphia was adding a starting-caliber cornerback in Darby to a defense that plays in the pass-happy NFC East.\n\n\"It's a corner-deficient league. It's hard to find those guys,\" Eagles executive vice president of football operations Howie Roseman said. \"And teams that have them aren't really ready to move them.\"\n\nDarby started 29 games since the Bills selected him in the second round of the 2015 draft.\n\nGaines was a valuable defensive back in the Rams' rotation. He won a starting job in 2015, but then got hurt before the season started. He became expendable after the Rams acquired Kayvon Webster this offseason, who is pegged to start opposite Trumaine Johnson.\n\nMcDermott is aware how the trades have the potential of setting back Buffalo's preparedness at a time the franchise is in the midst of a 17-year playoff drought - the longest active streak in North America's four major professional sports.\n\n\"I'm invested. I know and feel what they feel,\" McDermott said, referring to Bills fans. \"We're building a football team that we want to compete in the short and long term and be good for a long time. Sometimes that's a day-to-day process, and sometimes those are not easy decisions.\"\n\nNOTES: S Bacarri Rambo is listed week to week after hurting his hamstring against Minnesota. ... The Bills are off Saturday before returning to training camp on Sunday. ... Matthews and Darby will get to face their former teams on Thursday, when the Bills travel to play Philadelphia in a preseason game.\n\n___\n\nAP Pro Football Writer Rob Maaddi in Philadelphia and AP Sports Writer Greg Beacham in Los Angeles contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T01:44:00Z", "sim": 0.8235294222831726, "source": {"uri": "wsoctv.com", "title": "WSOC", "id": "497"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "01:44:00", "url": "http://www.wsoctv.com/sports/eagles-trade-jordan-matthews-to-bills-for-ronald-darby/588609101", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8730712", "image": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "01:44:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

Nelson Agholor struggled. Dorial Green-Beckham was untapped potential. Running back Darren Sproles had a more significant role in the passing game in Carson Wentz's rookie season.\n\nSo in the offseason, the group underwent a significant teardown. Alshon Jeffery and Torrey Smith were signed in free agency. Mack Hollins and Shelton Gibson were drafted. Green-Beckham was released. And as Matthews battled a knee injury in camp, Agholor started to impress, especially in spelling Matthews in the slot.\n\nThe Eagles carried only five wide receivers for much of last season. If they do it again, there are still some tough decisions left on the horizon.\n\nIt was becoming clear that there wouldn't be enough passes from Wentz to go around.\n\nSo shedding Matthews elevates Agholor to the projected starter in the slot -- the Eagles official site already has him at first string -- with Jeffery and Smith on the outside. Marcus Johnson, a 23-year-old out of Texas who spent last season on the practice squad, has been impressive in camp and might be in line for a spot.\n\nHollins has been impressive in camp and had a 38-yard touchdown catch-and-run that featured a fearsome stiff arm in the preseason opener. Bryce Treggs, a speedy deep threat, was the Birds' leading receiver with seven catches for 91 yards with a long of 38 yards.\n\nSo the top five wide receivers would appear to be Jeffery, Smith, Agholor, Johnson and Hollins. Treggs and Gibson could be on the bubble depending on how they perform the rest of the preseason and how the Eagles decide to structure their roster.\n\nSo what it means in a nutshell: Agholor will start, and a wide receiver who might have been a numbers casualty has a job in Philadelphia.\n\nHowie Roseman: 'Unique opportunity' led to Philadelphia Eagles trade of Jordan Matthews for Ronald Darby\n\nCornerback\n\nExecutive vice president of football operations Howie Roseman said Darby was an intriguing trade target because he's only 23 years old and under team control for another two years on his rookie contract. It puts the Eagles in the unique position of having five cornerbacks -- Darby, Jalen Mills, C.J. Smith, Rasul Douglas and the injured Sidney Jones -- under the age of 25 who could start for them.\n\nRoseman called the NFL \"corner-deficient,\" and he's not wrong. It's becoming one of the positions where a team can never have too many.\n\nSo the Eagles instantly got younger and more experienced -- a rare combo -- in one swoop.\n\nThe ripple effect of adding Darby is a little cloudier than that of subtracting Matthews.\n\nDarby has started all 29 games he's been healthy for in the first two years of his career, so it's not unreasonable to pencil him as the starter. But does that mean Mills of veteran Patrick Robinson, a 29-year-old the Birds signed in free agency, bump down to the No. 3 spot? And then what happens to Ron Brooks, who started last season as the Eagles' slot corner before suffering a season-ending quad injury in October.\n\nJones, a second-round pick who may or may not play this season after tearing his Achilles' tendon in March, and Douglas, a third-round pick, seem like definitely parts of the Eagles' plans. Those two, combined with Mills, Robinson and Darby give the Birds a stable of five cornerbacks. If Jones doesn't play this season, maybe Smith can slide up into a contributing role.\n\nBut where does that leave Brooks and third-stringer Aaron Grymes?\n\nIt's clear that the Eagles are going to need plenty of able cornerbacks given the competition they're going to face in the NFC East, but the question becomes which cornerbacks will the Eagles put on the field. There's plenty of mixing and matching to do over the next couple weeks.\n\nSo what it means in a nutshell: This competition got a whole lot more interesting.\n\nMeet new Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Ronald Darby, with Howie Roseman's scouting report\n\nOverall impact\n\nIt's clear the Eagles paid a stiff price for Darby. Matthews was historically productive -- 225 catches for 2,673 yards and 19 touchdowns in his first three seasons -- in Philadelphia, and Agholor is no sure thing despite the strides he's made in camp.\n\nA third-round pick is also an asset that shouldn't be overlooked. Douglas figures into the Eagles plans this season, and he was their third-round pick in April. In 2018, the Eagles already gave up their second-round pick to Cleveland when they traded up to select Carson Wentz. Now the third-round pick will be in Buffalo. They do have three fourth-rounders -- one of which could become a third-rounder if Eric Rowe plays 50 percent of the New England Patriots' defensive snaps this season -- but not having a second or third-rounder is a tough situation, especially for a team that's trying to build around a franchise quarterback.\n\nWhat it means in a nutshell: The Eagles might have gotten better, but they definitely got a lot more interesting.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T09:54:00Z", "sim": 0.8156862854957581, "source": {"uri": "pennlive.com", "title": "PennLive.com", "id": "371"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "15:16:00", "url": "http://www.pennlive.com/philadelphiaeagles/index.ssf/2017/08/what_the_jordan_matthews-ronal.html", "storyUri": "eng-3355470", "id": "8808855", "image": "http://image.pennlive.com/home/penn-media/width620/img/philadelphiaeagles_impact/photo/23221556-standard.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "09:54:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

Receiving a promising young player with multiple years left on his contract at a premium position is just as rare.\n\nAnd so that's why Philadelphia Eagles executive vice president of football operations Howie Roseman decided to \"pull the trigger\" on the deal that sent Eagles wide receiver Jordan Matthews and a third-round pick in next year's draft to the Buffalo Bills for cornerback Ronald Darby.\n\n\"This is a unique opportunity,\" Roseman told reporters Friday afternoon.\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles trade WR Jordan Matthews to Buffalo Bills for CB Ronald Darby\n\nThe Eagles gave up a receiver who had been historically productive in his first three years in the NFL. Matthews caught 67 passes for 872 yards and eight touchdowns last season and seemed poise to be team's starting slot receiver this fall. But Matthews was also a pending free agent, and whether or not he would re-sign -- or if the Eagles could afford to re-sign him -- was still up in the air.\n\nIn return, the Eagles got a 23-year-old cornerback who had a stellar rookie season before regressing. Darby has two years left on his rookie contract, which gives the Birds time to see how he fits in with the team and the development of the other young corners on the roster.\n\nThe Eagles entered the offseason incredibly thin at corner. They added veteran Patrick Robinson in free agency as a stopgap before selecting the injured Sidney Jones and Rasul Douglas in the draft. Now Darby's in the mix. Suddenly, the Eagles have five cornerbacks under the age of 25 who could potentially start for them in Darby (23), Jones (21), Douglas (23), Jalen Mills (23) and C.J. Smith (24).\n\n\"It's kind of a unique opportunity to have a bunch of young corners at that position, and we spent a lot of time going over this because this is obviously a big trade for our football team,\" Roseman said. \"You look around the league, and it is a corner-deficient league. It is hard to find those guys.\"\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles react to trade of Jordan Matthews to Buffalo Bills\n\nThe control over a young player was important to Roseman in the trade. He said he wouldn't have made the trade if he was getting a free agent in return. The front office won't have to worry about re-signing Darby until 2019, and the Eagles will have a better idea if he's the player who was Pro Football Focus' defensive rookie of the year in 2015 or the one who struggled last year.\n\nRoseman said once Matthews' name surfaced in the media in trade rumors, teams started reaching out about trading for Matthews. When Darby's name came up from the Bills, it piqued the Eagles' interest.\n\n\"We were not out there shopping Jordan Matthews,\" Roseman said.\n\n\"We weren't picking up the phone and calling teams on Jordan because of his value to our team,\" Roseman added. \"Certainly, we know the production he had. It goes to the player that we got, the position that we're acquiring and how difficult it is to find those guys.\"\n\n4 Philadelphia Eagles who shined, 4 who struggled against Packers\n\nWith Matthews joining another former Eagle skill position player up north in LeSean McCoy, third-year pro Nelson Agholor seems poised to step up into the spot vacated by Matthews in the slot. Agholor, along with Marcus Johnson, has been impressive in camp and helps lessen the blow of the trade. Of course, Agholor will have to avoid a repeat of last year's disastrous performance to help replace Matthews' production alongside free-agent signees Alshon Jeffery and Torrey Smith.\n\n\"Obviously, Nelson's had a really good spring, and really, the young players have taken a step up, which is a great testament to our coaching staff,\" Roseman said. \"We're excited about some of their futures, and when we looked at it, we were concerned if we could keep a bunch of them, but by the same token, we knew that it was an opportunity to add to our back end, which is an important part of our football team.\"\n\nThe trade has a deep impact on two positions that were most in need of a revamp after last season. Whether it works out for either side will play out on the field this fall and beyond.\n\n\"There's no insurance on any of these things,\" Roseman said. \"We do what's in the best interest of the team, and then when you pull the trigger on anything like this, you think about the player you're giving up and the draft pick, but we felt like this was the best decision for us.\"", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T18:13:00Z", "sim": 0.8078431487083435, "source": {"uri": "pennlive.com", "title": "PennLive.com", "id": "371"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "10:03:00", "url": "http://www.pennlive.com/philadelphiaeagles/index.ssf/2017/08/howie_roseman_unique_opportuni.html", "storyUri": "eng-3355470", "id": "8775061", "image": "http://image.pennlive.com/home/penn-media/width620/img/philadelphiaeagles_impact/photo/23218940-standard.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "18:13:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

That future comes at a certain cost and in the Bills' case that included wide receiver Sammy Watkins, who the Bills once considered their franchise superstar.\n\nOn Friday, Beane announced that Watkins -- along with a 2018 sixth-round pick -- was heading to the Los Angeles Rams in exchange for E.J. Gaines and a 2018 second round pick.\n\nSIGN UP to watch every Bills game this season on DAZN\n\nWatkins, the fourth overall pick in 2014, had been long plagued by injuries throughout his professional career -- especially in 2016 where he missed the last eight games with a foot fracture.\n\nThe Bills declined Watkins' option in May, thus igniting the inevitable end of his tenure in Buffalo. Watkins was set to make over $13 million if the Bills were to keep him. As a result of the trade, Buffalo avoids Watkins' immense payday.\n\nLast season, Gaines struggled in his first year since a foot related injury. According to Pro Football Focus, Gaines allowed nine touchdowns. It was the most that a cornerback has allowed all season.\n\nMORE: Bills happy with start\n\nAlmost simultaneously, the Bills acquired wide receiver Jordan Matthews and a 2018 second round pick from the Philadelphia Eagles for cornerback Ronald Darby and a 2018 sixth-round pick.\n\nBoth trades were announced within minutes of each other even though they were unrelated. According to Beane, both Los Angeles and Philadelphia had long inquired about the two now-former Bills players.\n\n\"LA got very serious about Sammy [Watkins] and Philadelphia got very serious about Ronald [Darby],\" Beane said. \"And the timing worked out, I was able to acquire Jordan to help fill in for Sammy and E.J. Gaines help fill in for Ronald.\"\n\nMatthews, like Watkins, faced his own battle with injuries. Last season, Matthews missed two games due to a back-related injury, and more recently he has been dealing with tendonitis in his knee. Matthews has been the Eagles most dependable receiver -- even before the Carson Wentz era took over -- but a mix of career-low numbers in 2016 plus the Eagles additions of Alshon Jeffrey and Torrey Smith made the 25-year-old more expendable.\n\nThe Bills have Zay Jones, Anquan Bolden, and Matthews as options in the slot but all have experience to fill Watkins' old role on the outside.\n\n\"[Matthews] is a self-made man,\" Beane said. \"He's a tough kid and he's going to work hard.\"\n\nBeane also mentioned Matthews' leadership as something that he will bring into the Bills locker room. Hours after it was announced that Matthews would be leaving, many of his former teammates, including Wentz, offered parting words.\n\nCrazy part of this business. @jmattjmattjmatt you'll always be my boy both on & off the field. Couldn't ask for a better teammate & friend. -- Carson Wentz (@cj_wentz)\n\nAugust 11, 2017\n\nThe Eagles desperately sought cornerback help dating back to the NFL Draft. At the draft the Eagles brought in Sidney Jones and Rasul Douglas, but the addition of Darby immediately fills in the Eagles' void. Darby will be the presumed starting right-side cornerback going forward.\n\nWhat both Matthews and Gaines have in common is that both are set to be unrestricted free agents after this season. Matthews is in the final year of his rookie deal which payed him $4.9 million over four years -- compared to the potential pay increase Watkins was going to receive. Gaines has will earn $1.7 million in 2017 with the Bills.\n\nWhile many fans found it difficult to part ways with one of the most promising receivers in Bills history, Buffalo is building for something special.\n\nThe Bills currently have two picks in each of the first three rounds of the 2018 draft. The abundance of draft picks allows Buffalo to secure a safe selection in one of the deepest draft classes in recent memory, with the likes of USC's Sam Darnold or OSU's Mason Rudolph giving solace to Beane's claim that the Bills will \"try to win today and win tomorrow.\"", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-08-11", "textEnd": 2910, "textStart": 2895}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T20:18:00Z", "sim": 0.8078431487083435, "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "title": "Sporting News", "id": "1722"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "01:26:00", "url": "http://www.sportingnews.com/ca/nfl/news/buffalo-bills-sammy-watkins-ej-gaines-philadelphia-eagles-carson-wentz-jordan-matthews-ronald-darby/1wo9559cn4mj71otpe8sa8jz5e", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8729407", "image": "http://images.performgroup.com/di/library/Sporting_News_CA_CMS_image_storage/db/4/jordan-matthews-ftr-eagles-081117-getty_d8dl9wl5ybn112phhd6zovo1w.jpg?t=-755044779", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "20:18:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

The Buffalo Bills traded wide receiver Sammy Watkins to the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nYou read that correctly. Watkins, whom the Bills paid a steep price to draft No. 4 overall in 2014, is gone with one year remaining on his original rookie contract.\n\nThe Bills also packaged their sixth-round pick in 2018 with Watkins, and got back cornerback E.J. Gaines and the Rams' second-round pick in 2018.\n\nIn a separate deal, another high draft choice, the 2015 second-round pick, Ronald Darby, was sent to the Philadelphia Eagles in exchange for wide receiver Jordan Matthews and Philadelphia's third-round pick in 2018.\n\nAfter these deals, the Bills now own two picks in each of the first, second and third rounds of 2018, a draft that is expected to be rich in quarterback talent.\n\nThus, what these trades would seem to indicate is that quarterback Tyrod Taylor can expect to be the Bills quarterback this season, but shouldn't make any plans beyond this year.\n\nWith all those draft picks available, it seems like the Bills -- if they choose -- can really put an attractive deal together to go up and get the best quarterback available, whether that's USC Sam Darnold, UCLA's Josh Rosen, or whomever. This, of course, is assuming the Bills don't hit rock bottom this season and won't have to worry about moving up in the draft to get one of the top QBs.\n\nThe trade of Watkins brings an end to what could only described as a disappointing three-year tenure for the talented wideout in Buffalo. He was the top-rated wide receiver in the 2014 draft, but that was also a draft filled with several top prospects, including Odell Beckham Jr. who has proven to be the best of the bunch.\n\nRather than stay at No. 9, the Bills switched places with the Browns, plus sent their 2015 first-round choice to Cleveland, so they could move up five spots to get Watkins. It was a reckless trade by former general manager Doug Whaley, and now it has proven to be a terrible one, too.\n\nWatkins endured non-stop nagging injuries, and he wound up missing 11 of the possible 48 games he could have played, but also was well less than 100 percent in many others.\n\nHe caught 153 passes for 2,459 yards and 17 TDs as a Bill. By comparison, the man who will probably replace him in the starting lineup -- Matthews, who was the Eagles' second-round pick in 2014 -- has missed only two games in his career and has 225 catches for 2,673 yards and 19 TDs.\n\nMatthews, like Watkins, is eligible for unrestricted free agency after this year.\n\nSome would say the writing was on the wall for Watkins when the Bills declined to exercise the fifth-year option on his contract. At the time, it was a move that made sense because the team was essentially telling him to prove he could stay healthy and produce.\n\nIf he did so, then new GM Brandon Beane and coach Sean McDermott would look to extend Watkins during this season, or perhaps prior to his hitting the market in 2018.\n\nBuffalo's wide receiver corps now contains rookie second-round pick Zay Jones, and two players -- Matthews and Anquan Boldin -- who will be playing on what amounts to one-year deals.\n\nMatthews has been a steady performer in Philadelphia. His lowest reception total is 67 as a rookie, and for yards it was 804 last season when he missed the only two games of his pro career.\n\nThe trade of Darby to Philadelphia was certainly interesting because the third-year pro seemed like he'd be a good fit in McDermott's defense. However, after a solid rookie season in 2015, Darby declined in 2016 and the Bills decided to move on.\n\nGaines was a sixth-round pick of the Rams in 2014. He started 15 games as a rookie and made two interceptions, missed all of 2015 with a foot injury, and then started 10 of 11 games in 2016 and did not make a pick.\n\nSal Maiorana, USA Today\n\nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T19:28:00Z", "sim": 0.8039215803146362, "source": {"uri": "wltx.com", "title": "WLTX", "id": "18532"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "09:41:00", "url": "http://www.wltx.com/sports/bills-send-sammy-watkins-to-the-rams/463724173", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8772567", "image": "http://content.wltx.com/photo/2017/05/03/sammy%20watkins_1493786399486_9357508_ver1.0.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "19:28:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

Elliott suspension, the Bills decided to flip their roster overnight with a pair of out-of-nowhere trades.\n\nBuffalo's new regime of Sean McDermott and Brandon Beane inherited a roster that appeared to top out short of the playoffs, so it's no surprise they've spent most of the offseason trying to undo deposed general manager Doug Whaley's mistakes. The Bills repeatedly traded down during the 2017 draft, grabbing an extra 2018 first-round pick from the Chiefs from their troubles, before firing Whaley the day after the draft.\n\nOn Friday, they added to their haul by acquiring a pair of 2018 picks as part of deals with the Eagles and Rams. Those trades amount to the following:\n\nThe dust is still settling, but at first glance, let's run through the winners and losers from these three deals:\n\nJared Goff\n\nAs the Rams try to build some sort of offensive infrastructure for the 2016 first overall pick, it's hard to imagine their acquiring a better receiver to work with than Watkins, who averaged 80.5 receiving yards per game while healthy in 2015, good for what would be nearly 1,300 receiving yards over a 16-game campaign. While Watkins hasn't lived up to the draft-day trade that saw the Bills deal two first-round picks to move up and acquire him ahead of Mike Evans and Odell Beckham Jr. in 2014, injuries have been the problem, not talent.\n\nSammy Watkins\n\nThis was always going to be a huge season for Watkins, who was set to hit unrestricted free agency after the Bills declined to pick up the fifth-year option on his rookie deal for 2018. Last year was a lost season for the Clemson product, given that the Bills repeatedly pushed Watkins onto the field with a clear foot injury before Watkins finally underwent what ended up as two surgeries on his left foot. It seemed likely that the Bills would part company with Watkins after the year regardless of what happened.\n\nIt's hard to see how Watkins will be in a better situation for either his short- or long-term future. After being traded to the Rams, who gave up a starting cornerback and a high pick to acquire him, Watkins is likely looking at the franchise tag if he breaks out in 2017. It's not clear that would have been the case in Buffalo, and the tag will cost him millions of dollars versus what he could get on the free market.\n\nHe's also now set to play out his contract year with Goff, who was one of the worst quarterbacks in recent memory during his debut season, as opposed to the criminally underrated Tyrod Taylor. Goff should be better during his second season, especially with the arrival of Sean McVay from Washington as coach, but there's a chance Watkins is relying on a replacement-level quarterback to make him millions of dollars.\n\nTyrod Taylor\n\nSpeaking of the Bills quarterback, Taylor also finds himself in a make-or-break year, even if that career might not be in western New York. Taylor just lost his top receiver, and while he's getting a viable weapon in Matthews, remember that Matthews was the focal point of a wide receiving corps that was seen as one of the worst in the league in Philadelphia last season. Even if you argue that Matthews has a higher floor than Watkins by virtue of missing a total of just two games over the past three seasons, it should take some time for Taylor to develop a rapport with his new No. 1 wideout.\n\nJordan Matthews\n\nThe Broncos were comfortably a three-wideout team under new Bills offensive coordinator Rick Dennison, going three-wide as high as 72 percent of the time in 2014, per Football Outsiders, which was the fourth-highest rate in the league. At the same time, though, the Bills just paid $8.4 million over four years to sign fullback Patrick DiMarco this offseason, suggesting that their organizational plan was to roll a fullback onto the field more often than not.\n\nThe presence of DiMarco (and Mike Tolbert) suggests that Matthews will be spending more time on the outside than he did in Philadelphia, where he was primarily a slot receiver. That could be a positive if he succeeds on the edge, given that some teams still discount the work done by receivers out of the slot.\n\nMore than anything, though, it's clear that Matthews is going to get far more targets in Buffalo than he would have in Philadelphia, where he was competing with Alshon Jeffery, Torrey Smith, Darren Sproles and a bevy of tight ends for targets. Now Matthews will be the primary focus of a receiving corps that includes second-round pick Zay Jones, the newly signed Anquan Boldin, a limited Charles Clay and LeSean McCoy. The Vandy product has a great shot at topping the 117 targets he racked up a year ago, which could get Matthews paid this offseason. It's also possible that the Bills give him a sweetheart deal in an attempt to smooth things over with their fans in advance of what looks like another rebuild.\n\nNelson Agholor\n\nWho saw that one coming? Agholor was basically left for dead after two frustrating seasons in Philadelphia, but after training camp reports suggested Agholor looked like a new man in the slot, the Eagles cleared out a spot for him by trading away Matthews. Coach Doug Pederson might not go three-wide all that often -- Philadelphia was there 60 percent of the time last season, 26th in the league -- but Agholor went from looking like a likely trade candidate to securing a roster spot with an outside shot at meaningful receptions.\n\nThe Eagles\n\nPhiladelphia was looking downright bereft at cornerback for the second consecutive season, having cycled again through middling veterans while using second- and third-round picks on Sidney Jones and Rasul Douglas, the former of whom is likely to miss a chunk of the 2017 season after rupturing his Achilles at his pro day. While the Eagles had long-term hope at the position, this is a team that should be capable of competing as early as this season. Cornerback was their biggest weakness.\n\nNow they have a promising option in both the short term and long term in Darby, who was stunningly effective during his debut season in Buffalo before slipping badly last season. Defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz has done excellent work with undersized corners in years past, notably launching Cortland Finnegan's career in Tennessee. It's too early to suggest Darby's a reclamation project, but dealing a wide receiver the Eagles were unlikely to sign for a likely starter at cornerback is a totally logical move, even if it did hurt to give up a third-round pick in the process.\n\nThe Rams\n\nSo much of what the Rams do on a year-to-year basis seems to be about erasing or accounting for the mistakes they've made in the past. Here again they're addressing their disastrous investment and reinvestment in the badly miscast Tavon Austin by shelling out another draft pick and what is (in the best case) going to be a huge contract to retain Watkins for the years to come.\n\nYou could understand why the Rams would want to take a shot at Watkins, but the 2018 free-agent wide receiver class is staggering, including players like Matthews, DeAndre Hopkins and Allen Robinson. Some of those guys will re-sign with their current teams, of course, but maybe the Rams end up giving someone like Jeffery or Terrelle Pryor a big deal. That wouldn't be the end of the world.\n\nWhat's frustrating about this move is that the Rams had to give up a second-round pick to acquire Watkins. Given that they're unlikely to be very good -- ESPN's FPI projects them to finish with the league's fifth-worst record -- chances are they'll be sending a high second-rounder to the Bills to acquire a player who hasn't been healthy for most of his career.\n\nAfter trading away a bevy of picks to acquire Goff, the Rams can't be in the pick-trading business. If anything, they should be looking at trading down and acquiring selections. (I realize they're getting a sixth-rounder, but per Chase Stuart's chart, even the top pick of the sixth round is worth just 12 percent as much as the fifth pick of the second round, the selection the Rams project to send to Buffalo.)\n\nEven if Los Angeles' bet on Watkins works out in 2017, the Rams are going to be stuck using their franchise tag or making a long-term bet on a player with a history of foot injuries. They could recoup a compensatory draft pick if they let Watkins leave, but that assumes Watkins will have a big-enough year to justify a serious deal in free agency while the Rams themselves mostly sit out, which seems like a very unlikely proposition.\n\nThey're also going to be in serious trouble at cornerback, where they just traded away Gaines and won't be able to afford franchising Trumaine Johnson for a third time after the season. Wade Phillips is a defensive genius, but the best guy on Los Angeles' depth chart for 2018 appears to be Broncos import Kayvon Webster, who played 58 defensive snaps last season and has spent the last several years buried underneath a stacked depth chart in Denver.\n\nThe Bills\n\nAs frustrating as this must be for Buffalo's fans, who are stuck undergoing yet another rebuild, the Bills are making the right sort of moves as they try to build a team to (eventually) make noise in the postseason. It's clear that the organization had soured on Watkins and had serious concerns about his ability to stay healthy; otherwise, they wouldn't have passed up the wideout's fifth-year option. And if the Bills don't have a lot of faith in Watkins staying healthy enough to pass a physical in 2018, it's difficult to imagine that they would see signing Watkins as a wise decision in the long term, either.\n\nIf you're going to move on from Watkins, then, this is a reasonable haul. You might argue that the Bills make a slight downgrade at cornerback by swapping Darby for Gaines, who has struggled with his own foot injuries. It's pretty clear Watkins has a higher upside than Matthews, although the higher floor for Matthews might offer some level of certainty the Bills prefer if they're handing out a long-term deal.\n\nWhat's really crucial, though, are those extra draft picks. As projected by FPI and using Stuart's chart, the Bills trading their sixth-round pick for Los Angeles' second-rounder and Philadelphia's third-round pick to trade the Rams pick (37, fifth-lowest FPI projection) and Eagles pick (80, 16th-lowest FPI projection) for pick 190 (the Bills have the sixth-lowest projection and that was the sixth-lowest pick of the sixth round, obviously the exact pick will pend specific compensatory selections) is roughly the equivalent of acquiring the 16th overall pick in a typical draft (17.1 points, closest to value of 16th pick, 16.9 points).\n\nThat gives the Bills what essentially amounts to three first-round picks in the 2018 draft, given that they'll have their own pick and Kansas City's selection from the Patrick Mahomes II trade. They can add a third-round compensatory pick for Stephon Gilmore if they cut three players from the group of DiMarco, Vladimir Ducasse, Ryan Harris, Andre Holmes and Steven Hauschka before Week 10, a move I would strongly encourage. Draft picks alone aren't a solution, but the best way to build a sustainably effective team isn't to trade up for a stud wide receiver or an inside linebacker, as the Bills did by sending multiple picks to acquire Reggie Ragland last season. It's to acquire draft picks and build a core of cheap, effective talent. As the Bills try to chase the juggernaut Patriots, they're wisely taking a page out of Bill Belichick's book.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T17:18:00Z", "sim": 0.800000011920929, "source": {"uri": "espn.com.au", "title": "ESPN.com", "id": "5195"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "01:26:00", "url": "http://www.espn.com.au/nfl/story/_/id/20313763", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8729430", "image": "http://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2016%2F0913%2Fr125415_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "17:18:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

(AP) -- The Buffalo Bills have shaken up their roster with two separate trades, dealing starting receiver Sammy Watkins to the Los Angeles Rams and acquiring Jordan Matthews from Philadelphia.\n\nBoth are blockbuster trades in which Buffalo also shuffled its cornerbacks. The Bills dealt Ronald Darby to the Eagles and acquired E.J. Gaines in the trade with the Rams.\n\nBuffalo also continued stockpiling 2018 draft picks by acquiring a second-round selection from Los Angeles and a third-rounder from the Eagles. The Bills dealt a sixth-round pick to the Rams as part of the Watkins trade.\n\nThe moves were announced early Friday afternoon, a day after Buffalo opened its preseason with a 17-10 loss to Minnesota. The shakeup continues an offseason overhaul under new coach Sean McDermott and GM Brandon Beane.\n\nSponsored Content: Sign up for a free webinar as the U.S. Trade and Development Agency and Small Business Administration explore the hybrid IT environment in government.\n\nMatthews had been Philadelphia's most productive receiver, averaging 75 catches, 891 receiving yards and six touchdowns in his first three seasons. But the Eagles signed free-agent receivers Alshon Jeffery and Torrey Smith in the offseason, drafted Mack Hollins and Shelton Gibson and have been pleased with 2015 first-round pick Nelson Agholor's improvement.\n\nDarby started 29 games in his first two seasons in Buffalo. He was a second-round pick (50th overall) in the 2015 draft.\n\n___\n\nAP sports writer Rob Maaddi in Philadelphia contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T17:35:00Z", "sim": 0.800000011920929, "source": {"uri": "federalnewsradio.com", "title": "Federal News Radio", "id": "9518"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "17:35:00", "url": "https://federalnewsradio.com/sports-news/2017/08/eagles-trade-jordan-matthews-to-bills-for-ronald-darby/", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8671838", "image": "https://federalnewsradio.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Vikings_Bills_Football_71107.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "17:35:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

Outside of injuries, such as the one that caused the Miami Dolphins to sign a retired quarterback like Jay Cutler, no one expects any other huge shocks. The #Buffalo Bills turned the NFL on its head with a surprising out-of-nowhere trade on Friday involving the Los Angeles Rams and Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nThe Buffalo Bills traded their top wide receiver and former No. 1 draft pick #Sammy Watkins to the Los Angeles Rams along with the team's 2018 sixth round draft pick. In exchange, the Los Angeles Rams sent their 2018 second round draft pick and cornerback E.J.\n\nGaines to the Buffalo Bills. A third team in the trade, the Philadelphia Eagles, received former Bills cornerback Ronald Darby and sent their 2018 third round pick to Buffalo.\n\nSo, the Buffalo Bills gave away their best wide receiver but this isn't as bad as it sounds. Jordan Matthews is a pretty good receiver although he wasn't explosive with Carson Wentz throwing the ball last season. Tyrod Taylor is a better quarterback than anyone gives him credit for and he should make Matthews better.\n\nThey might just be looking forward to next year already.\n\nNo one expects the Los Angeles Rams to set the world on fire this season although there are some who think they are a great sleeper pick to somehow sneak into playoff contention. However, Jared Goff was one of the worst quarterbacks in the NFL in 2016 and only Sean McVay can hope to turn him around.\n\nHaving Sammy Watkins to throw the ball to could do that. Now, Watkins has not remained healthy his entire NFL career, so that is a worry. Interestingly, Watkins bragged that he was going to change how the NFL gives out contracts when he becomes a free agent and had big demands. Playing for a weak Rams team will kill a lot of his value next season. There was almost no chance he was going to resign for a reasonable deal in 2018 so the Buffalo Bills had to cut ties now to protect their future. The Rams have to hope he pays off this year.\n\nThat leaves the Philadelphia Eagles.

This Friday, however, is different. First, the league announced that it had suspended Dallas Cowboys star running back Ezekiel Elliott for the first six games of the upcoming season. Not even an hour later, the Buffalo Bills made announcements of their own.\n\nAccording to the team's Twitter account, the Bills have made two trades involving two of their starting players:\n\nWe've acquired CB E.J. Gaines and a 2018 2nd round pick from the Rams for WR Sammy Watkins and a 2018 6th round pick.\n\nWe've acquired WR Jordan Matthews and a 2018 3rd round pick from the Eagles for CB Ronald Darby.\n\nLet's break down the two trades.\n\nSammy Watkins, the fourth overall selection in the 2014 NFL draft, has been the Bills' number one wide receiver the last three seasons. The 24-year old caught 153 passes for 2,459 yards and 17 touchdowns in the 37 games he played for the team. However, he also has struggled with injuries and appeared in only eight games last season. Consequently, Buffalo opted not to pick up his fifth-year contract option.\n\nRonald Darby, on the other hand, was picked in the second round of the 2015 draft. He quickly established himself as one of the Bills' starting perimeter cornerbacks. Playing opposite Stephon Gilmore, who joined the New England Patriots this offseason, the 23-year old appeared in 29 games for the team, registering two interceptions (both during his rookie campaign).\n\nAs noted above, Buffalo will also give up a 2018 sixth round draft pick as part of the Watkins trade.\n\nE.J. Gaines is expected to replace Darby in Buffalo's starting lineup. The 25-year old originally entered the NFL as a sixth round draft pick by the then-St. Louis Rams in 2014. In his three seasons in the league, the 5'10 Gaines appeared in 26 games - missing the entire 2015 campaign due to injury - and registered two interceptions as one of the Rams starting cornerbacks.\n\nJordan Matthews was picked in the second round of the 2014 NFL draft by the Philadelphia Eagles. The 6'3 wideout played the second-most snaps on his team last season and finished with 73 catches for 804 yards and three scores. Over the course of his three-year career, the 25-year old has caught 225 catches for 2,673 yards and 19 touchdowns. Consequently, he will take over for Watkins as one of Buffalo's top offensive weapons.\n\nAs noted above, Buffalo will also receive a 2018 second round draft pick as well as a 2018 third round draft pick.\n\nThe Bills' new leadership of head coach Sean McDermott and general manager Brandon Beane has basically replaced Watkins and Darby one-by-one. While it remains to be seen whether or not the two moves will actually make the team better in the short term, the two draft picks give Buffalo additional capital to move around the board during next year's draft.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T16:13:00Z", "sim": 0.7960784435272217, "source": {"uri": "patspulpit.com", "title": "Pats Pulpit", "id": "7873"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "10:03:00", "url": "https://www.patspulpit.com/2017/8/11/16135100/afc-east-report-buffalo-bills-trade-sammy-watkins-ronald-darby-los-angeles-rams-philadelphia-eagles", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8775064", "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WdK24BXoMpkdq_hcMZaLsz9wrwM=/0x427:4425x2916/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56155467/629151628.0.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "16:13:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

Gaines and a second-round pick.\n\nThe wheeling and dealing wasn't done. The Bills also swung a deal with the Philadelphia Eagles, shipping cornerback Ronald Darby to the Philadelphia Eagles in exchange for wide receiver Jordan Matthews and a third-round pick.\n\nDarby, who was a second-round pick of the Bills in 2015, played well as a rookie but struggled last season. Watkins was an even bigger disappointment -- the talented but oft-injured former No. 4 overall pick the Bills traded an extra first-rounder to move up for and draft back in 2014. The Bills had already declined Watkins' fifth-year option for 2018, but his sudden departure was still a surprise.\n\nNew Buffalo GM Brandon Beane vehemently denied the moves were a white flag from the team in 2017.\n\n\"This is not a throw-in-the-towel thing at all,\" Beane told reporters. \"Somebody mentioned that somebody said that out there, and honestly, that's annoying to me. You don't know me if you think I'm throwing in the towel. When I go out there and play pingpong, whatever I'm doing, I'm not throwing in the towel. If we're throwing in the towel, we're not trying to get a starting receiver back.\"\n\nThe argument can be made that in refusing to pick up his option, the Bills had already passed judgment on Watkins' long-term future with the team, and Matthews is at least a capable young receiver with more receiving yards the past three years than Watkins. But in selling off young talent from the Doug Whaley era and stockpiling picks, the Bills certainly look like a team more focused on the future than the present.\n\nThe Rams, in theory, got the No. 1 wide receiver Jared Goff so badly needs if he's to take the next step (or a step) forward in his second season. But that \"in theory\" caveat is a lulu with Watkins, who has missed 11 games the past two years.\n\nNever mind that he's still working his way back from foot surgery and will become a free agent after the season.\n\nThe Eagles found a taker for Matthews (who they'd been shopping for some time) and added a young defensive back in Darby who will probably be their best cornerback as soon as he sets foot in Philly. However, Darby backslid badly with the Bills in 2016, ranking 68th at his position, per Pro Football Focus.\n\nIn other words, there could just as easily be zero winners in these trades as three, depending on how things shake out over the next year.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T02:47:00Z", "sim": 0.7960784435272217, "source": {"uri": "bleacherreport.com", "title": "Bleacher Report", "id": "3199"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "07:00:00", "url": "http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2727017-nfl-preseason-week-1-roundup-roberto-agauyo-pick-continues-to-haunt-buccaneers", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8755379", "image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/688/780/666f1eb5292f770c1f68c58d82c27ba6_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "02:47:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

Gaines, a second-rounder from the Rams and a third-rounder from Philly.\n\nThe deals were announced before most people could even take a breath following the news of Ezekiel Elliott's six-game suspension by the NFL. That means that the Cowboys, a slight favorite in the NFC East, may be the favorites no longer, which opens the door just a little bit more for the Eagles. Philly's biggest weakness was potentially at corner, where it was set to start Jalen Mills and Patrick Robinson. Now, Darby gets his chance to break out with a change of scenery. A 2015 second-round pick, Darby was PFF's Defensive Rookie of the Year that season, but he slumped a bit as a sophomore.\n\nThe move improves the Eagles' secondary, and the loss of Matthews is more than survivable, as they added Alshon Jeffery and Torrey Smith on one-year free-agent deals and still have Zach Ertz, Darren Sproles, Nelson Agholor, Paul Turner, Brent Celek and rookie Mack Hollins around to catch passes from Carson Wentz. Philly, maybe the best team last season to not make the playoffs, is definitely taking steps in the right direction.\n\nMatthews makes the transition to Buffalo's offense, in its first season under head coach Sean McDermott and offensive coordinator Rick Dennison. Swapping out Watkins for Matthews means that Tyrod Taylor might not have a receiver on the offense with whom he has worked before; Matthews joins Anquan Boldin, rookie Zay Jones, Rod Streater, Andre Holmes and Corey Brown in the unit, among others. Matthews averaged just 11.4 yards per catch over the past two seasons and caught only three touchdowns over 14 games in 2016. Per Football Outsiders, he was 76th in both DYAR and DVOA among all qualified receivers.\n\nGaines doesn't bring much more to the table and is well below the caliber of Darby. He missed all of 2015 with a foot injury and another five games in 2016. He was set to only be a backup for the Rams, but he could compete to work his way opposite of rookie first-rounder Tre'Davious White in Buffalo. The real reason for the Bills to complete these deals was not either of the players they received -- both are free agents after the season -- but the two picks. The Bills chose not to option the fifth-year on Watkins' deal, thereby making him a free agent in 2018. At best, Watkins leaving would have meant a third-round compensatory pick. Instead, the Bills get a second-rounder and third-rounder, guaranteed.\n\nThe added bonus is that Matthews and Gaines have potential to get better and become a part of the Bills' long-term plans, though they haven't really seemed to handle the Watkins or Taylor contract situations -- or most contract situations since their last postseason appearance in 1999 -- very well, so maybe it won't matter. The Bills were a longshot to win eight games this season, and, if anything, this move comes at the expense of the 2017 roster with the hope that it's good for 2018 and beyond.\n\nOn paper this does look like a good move for Buffalo, but only because it had begun to sever ties with Watkins anyway. The Bills were headed in the wrong direction with Watkins and Darby, their two best players under 25, and now they're trying to get the most return on that sullied investment.\n\nFinally, the Rams get the prized player, but can they do what Buffalo couldn't seem to figure out and utilize him properly? Watkins seems to be on par with A.J. Green and Amari Cooper -- two other fourth overall picks of recent years -- in terms of talent, but he has missed 11 games over the past two seasons. He is also inconsistent, though in 2015 he had five 100-yard games over a nine-game stretch, and that was playing in an offense that rarely threw the ball and finished 31st in pass attempts with Taylor.\n\nWatkins' latest challenge will be playing in an offense that ranked 32nd in both points and yards in 2016 behind the worst passer of last season: Jared Goff.\n\nThe Rams' best move was signing left tackle Andrew Whitworth in free agency, but they have also added Watkins, former Buffalo teammate Robert Woods and rookies Gerald Everett, Cooper Kupp and Josh Reynolds, and they are looking for continued growth from Todd Gurley, Tyler Higbee and Mike Thomas. In the case of Tavon Austin, the third-highest paid receiver in the league this year, the Rams are just looking for any type of growth at all.\n\nThat's a lot of weapons and Watkins may be the best of them, but all of the moves and all of the money spent will be for nothing if Goff continues to struggle.\n\nIt is highly improbable that the Rams will make a postseason run unless Goff is at least above average, and though the move to add Watkins is a net positive, it doesn't seem like Los Angeles is very close to a playoff run. If Watkins isn't re-signed, then the Rams lost yet another future pick without much return. Even a third-round comp pick seems like an uncertainty given that Jeffery and Terrelle Pryor could receive only one-year deals.\n\nThe overall winner appears to be Philadelphia, a team that has a decent shot at making the playoffs and acquired a young player who has two more years left on his deal. Matthews is not a special receiver, and the third-round pick for Darby is more than fair.\n\nThe biggest loser is Buffalo, which managed to downgrade at receiver and cornerback and received only two Day 2 picks in return. Those picks are meaningless if they don't pan out, and if they do, there's little guarantee that the Bills will even know what to do with them or know how to retain them long-term.\n\nMeanwhile, the Rams still seem to have that 7-9 smell to them, even without Jeff Fisher, because they finished somewhere in the middle of this trade and likely did not improve significantly. Despite Watkins' obvious talent, he has injury concerns and could be leaving for another team next year without having helped L.A. make any sort of postseason run in a division where it seems like the clear third-place team. If Goff does break out in 2017, it probably won't be solely because of Watkins. If he doesn't break out, then it was all for nothing.\n\nAt least the fans got to see something interesting and rare on a mid-August Friday: trades involving three teams. If only they were better teams.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T18:28:00Z", "sim": 0.7960784435272217, "source": {"uri": "sportsonearth.com", "title": "Sports on Earth", "id": "5273"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "09:41:00", "url": "http://www.sportsonearth.com/article/247799536/nfl-trades-bills-eagles-rams-watkins-matthews", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8772562", "image": "http://www.sportsonearth.com/assets/images/9/8/0/247800980/cuts/1980x1100/cut.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "18:28:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

business with a rigorous practice at the NovaCare Complex.\n\nThe Eagles endured their longest workout of training camp at 2 hours, 40 minutes and featured plenty of hitting. It possibly was done in an effort to take the players' minds off the trade, which sent Matthews and a third-round pick in the 2018 draft to the Bills in exchange for cornerback Ronald Darby.\n\nLatest Video\n\n\"I had a good relationship with (Matthews), but this business is a difficult one and you have to make some tough choices from time to time,\" Eagles coach Doug Pederson said. \"We're moving forward. It's business as usual.\"\n\nSome of the players were clearly still shaken by the trade move, however. In addition to being the Eagles' most productive receiver with 225 catches over the last three seasons, Matthews was also one of the more popular players off the field.\n\nHe was especially close with tight end Zach Ertz and quarterback Carson Wentz. According to Ertz, they were among \"five or six guys\" who went out to dinner with Matthews after the trade was announced Friday afternoon.\n\n\"You can't quantify with numbers what he meant to this team and to me, personally,\" Ertz said Saturday. \"Jordan played a huge role in helping me develop as a player and as a man. He's a brother for life.\"\n\nWentz had also bonded with Matthews on the field and away from football.\n\nLast season, Matthews caught 73 passes from Wentz -- Ertz led the team with 78 receptions -- for 804 yards and three touchdowns. Matthews sat out much of the recent offseason minicamps and organized team activities (OTAs) with knee tendonitis, but still accompanied the other wide receivers to North Dakota for a series of informal workouts with Wentz last month.\n\nAfter the dinner Friday, Wentz drove Matthews to Philadelphia International Airport for him to catch a flight to Buffalo.\n\n\"On the personal side, it's tough,\" Wentz said Saturday. \"This is my first time experiencing this with someone who is one of my best friends. Seeing him (Friday), it was tough on him, too. Kind of out of the blue.\"\n\nThe Eagles made the trade out of a desperate need to upgrade their defense as cornerback.\n\nDarby, the Bills' second-round draft pick in 2015, will be a starter as soon as he gets comfortable with the Eagles' defense.\n\nHe watched Saturday's practice on the field, frequently chatting with fellow cornerback Ron Brooks, who was also his teammate in Buffalo.\n\n\"I was a little surprised at the trade because everything happened so fast,\" Darby said Saturday. \"But at the end of the day, it's a blessing. I think this defense is a great match for my skill set, and I'm excited to get out there.\"\n\nDarby, 5-foot-11 and 190 pounds, is known for his blazing speed, which allows him to play aggressive, man-to-man defense without fear of getting beat deep.\n\nHe will be paired at cornerback with some combination of Jalen Mills, Patrick Robinson, rookie Rasul Douglas and Brooks, once he recovers from a strained hamstring.\n\n\"(Darby) has speed, he's versatile, he's a playmaker, he's smart and he's got great instincts and ball skills,\" said Eagles linebacker Nigel Bradham, who was Darby's teammate in Buffalo in 2015. \"He's going to be a great asset to our defense.\"\n\nMatthews became expendable because of the depth the Eagles have at wide receiver.\n\nNelson Agholor, the Eagles' first-round draft pick in 2015, will have the first shot at replacing Matthews in the slot with outside receivers Alshon Jeffery and Torrey Smith. Mack Hollins, Shelton Gibson and others are also vying for playing time.\n\n\"We all have a lot of respect for Jordan, and he's a friend,\" Agholor said. \"My only worry now is with myself. I have a job to do and that's to keep working hard and making plays to help this team win football games.\"\n\nThe Eagles will not have to wait long to have a reunion with Matthews.\n\nThey play their preseason opener at Lincoln Financial Field on Thursday against the Bills.\n\n\"It's going to be really weird seeing him on the other team,\" Wentz said. \"It's not going to fun, I'll tell you that.\"", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T17:28:00Z", "sim": 0.7960784435272217, "source": {"uri": "pressofatlanticcity.com", "title": "Press of Atlantic City", "id": "9805"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "14:07:00", "url": "http://www.pressofatlanticcity.com/sports/local/eagles/eagles-try-to-move-on-from-matthews-trade/article_9c9e0730-eff2-57e6-8722-f99b8256cd77.html", "storyUri": "eng-3355470", "id": "8924743", "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/pressofatlanticcity.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/a5/3a504fc9-3be8-5de1-9ee4-8c9e9725997d/597a3365daf3d.image.jpg?crop=1567%2C1175%2C98%2C0&resize=840%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "17:28:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

In one trade, the Bills dealt top cornerback Ronald Darby to the Philadelphia Eagles for #wide receiver Jordan Matthews and a third round pick. In the other, the Bills shockingly decided to trade #Sammy Watkins, whom Buffalo drafted with the 4th overall pick in the 2014 NFL draft.\n\nWatkins has had a varied career with the Bills, as he struggled to stay on the field for an entire season for his entire time with the team. His best year came in 2015, when Watkins had 60 receptions for over 1000 receiving yards and nine touchdowns.\n\nIn 2015, Watkins was easily one of the best receivers in the league in the second half of the year.\n\nUnfortunately, his production declined significantly in 2016, as he had only 28 catches for 430 receiving yards and just two touchdowns. He again struggled to stay on the field with injury issues. Those injury issues have been a continuous problem for the Bills since he was drafted, and it's likely that those medical concerns played a part in the Bills trade decision.\n\nEven though Sammy had expected to be in Buffalo for at least this year, he hasn't criticized the team for its decision. Instead, he has accepted the decision of general manager Brandon Beane and even thanked Buffalo for all the memories.\n\nNew chapter in life everything happens for a reason... Buffalo thank you for all the memories.. Rams nation get ready.. -- King Me (@sammywatkins)\n\nAugust 11, 2017\n\nHe ended his Tweet with a suggestion that he would be bringing some serious game to the Rams.\n\nIt's hard to really see him being a monster receiver with Jared Goff at quarterback, but Bills fans definitely know how skilled Watkins can be when he stays on the field. Here's a video that is just a reminder of how explosive Watkins is when he is healthy.\n\nOpinions of the Bills trade have varied widely. Many fans are glad that he is gone, as they are tired of watching Watkins sit on the bench with injuries. But there are also a ton of Bills who are upset that the star wide receiver has been traded. He was easily the most dynamic receiver on the roster, and the Bills are left with slot receiver Jordan Matthews as their new number one.\n\nFor what it's worth, Jordan Matthews has been way more consistent than Watkins, as he has had at least 800 receiving yards and 65 receptions every single season. Still, it's hard not to see Matthews as a significant downgrade from Watkins.\n\nAs a Bills fan, I'm glad to see that Watkins appreciated his time in Buffalo and I am sorry that he had to go.

He's never eclipsed 1,000 yards, is prone to occasional drops and didn't prove he could win on the perimeter in his few opportunities there.\n\nThe team didn't have any major conversations with Matthews on an extension, which was a major indication that they were preparing to move on if the right deal came along.\n\nIt's rare that good corners become available on the trade market, but Buffalo is rebuilding behind a new head coach-general manager combo, so Darby, a former second-round pick, is that rare good corner who became available.\n\nDarby, who played well as a rookie, isn't a superstar, and his presence doesn't immediately make the Eagles playoff contenders. But he's way better than anything the Eagles had on the roster, and they are unquestionably a better overall team with Darby and without Matthews than vice versa.\n\nThe Eagles were looking at starting the season with Patrick Robinson and Jalen Mills as starters at cornerback. Robinson is having a terrible camp and said recently that he's nowhere near where he should be. Mills has two career starts and is probably more suited to play nickel back.\n\nThis tweet pretty much says it all:\n\nRonald Darby had 22 pass breakups over the last 2 seasons. No Eagle corner had more than 12 over that time.\n\n-- Nathan Jahnke (@PFF_NateJahnke) August 11, 2017\n\nEven better, Darby has two years left on his deal, which is why the Eagles needed to throw in a 2018 third-rounder to make it happen. If Darby plays well this season, the Eagles can think about giving him the long-term money they didn't want to commit to Matthews. If not, the Eagles have high 2017 draft picks Sidney Jones (second round) and Rasul Douglas (third round) to develop.\n\nThe loss of Matthews hurts, but should be mitigated. The Eagles have several different options for the slot, starting with Nelson Agholor, who'll get the first chance to prove that his impressive training camp signifies an awakening after two dismal seasons. Versatile halfbacks Darren Sproles and Donnel Pumphrey are slot specialists. Tight end Zach Ertz and Trey Burton are also reliable pass catchers who operate around the same area of the field that Matthews does.\n\nBesides, if the Eagles are developing offensively around free agents Torrey Smith and Alshon Jeffery, there should be less emphasis on the role of the slot receiver. Matthews was the team's focus at receiver because the Eagles have lacked any real presence on the outside since Chip Kelly let Jeremy Maclin walk out the door after the 2015 season. The team has since juggled Riley Cooper, Miles Austin, Agholor, Dorial Green-Beckham, Josh Huff and some others in attempt to find a field-stretcher.\n\nBottom line: The Eagles needed cornerback help much more than Carson Wentz needed an inside receiver. The price was steep, but solid, young corners don't become available every day of the week.\n\n- Geoff Mosher, a longtime Philadelphia sports reporter, is also a host on @975TheFanatic in Philadelphia.

So who got the best end of the deal?\n\nTo recap, here's what each team ends up with after the two trades:\n\nBills get: The Rams' second-round draft pick, the Eagles' third-round draft pick, cornerback E.J. Gaines and receiver Jordan Matthews.\n\nRams get: The Bills' sixth-round draft pick and receiver Sammy Watkins.\n\nEagles get: cornerback Ronald Darby.\n\nFor the Bills, this move was about acquiring draft picks for the future: The new regime has already decided to move on from Watkins, the prize pick of the old regime. So they decided to move on from Watkins a year early and get a second-round draft pick. They also picked up a third-round draft pick for Darby.\n\nFor the Rams, this was all about Watkins: They want to give young quarterback Jared Goff another weapon, and now they've done so.\n\nAnd for the Eagles, this was about making the defense better right away: Darby should help immediately.\n\nWatkins is heading into the final year of his rookie contract and is cheap for the Rams, at a salary of just $690,000 this year. He'll be an unrestricted free agent next year unless the Rams slap the franchise tag on him. Watkins has 153 catches for 2,459 and 17 touchdowns in three seasons.\n\nMatthews is also heading into the final year of his rookie contract and is a little more expensive, with a salary of $1.1 million. Matthews has 225 catches for 2,673 and 19 touchdowns in three seasons.\n\nGaines is heading into the final year of his rookie contract as well, with a salary of $1.8 million. He has started 25 games for the Rams but missed the entire 2015 season.\n\nDarby has two more years left on his rookie contract, with salaries of $800,000 this year and $1 million next year. Darby has started 29 games in two years with the Bills.\n\nSo which team did the best?

In 2015 the Eagles traded for linebacker Kiko Alonso, sending running back Lesean McCoy to Buffalo. With the strange Jordan Matthews situation -- he sat out most of OTAs with an unknown injury -- a trade was bound to happen.\n\nIn the aftermath of Matthews' departure, Nelson Agholor seems like the candidate most likely to benefit from the trade. It's long been speculated that Agholor was a better fit for the slot, even before he was drafted. Agholor's shiftiness and quickness makes him a better fit as a slot receiver in this scheme, as he can do more in space than what Matthews could from an athletic standpoint.\n\nFocusing on the player the Eagles received, Ronald Darby, it appears that a lot of people around the league were high on him. As Aaron Schatz of Football Outsiders remarked, he's viewed as Buffalo's best cornerback.

You might say the Bills are looking to trust their own process by stocking up on draft picks over the next few years, and that may not be a terrible strategy for the long term. For now, it leaves the Bills in a bit of a rebuilding mode heading into the start of the 2017 season.\n\nThe Bills made a pair of trades with the Philadelphia Eagles and Los Angeles Rams. The Bills received wide receiver Jordan Matthews from the Eagles in exchange for cornerback Ronald Darby and a 3rd round draft pick from Philly in the 2018 NFL Draft. To make up for the loss of Darby, the Bills acquired E.J. Gaines and a 2018 second-round draft pick from the Rams in exchange for wide receiver Sammy Watkins.\n\nWe've acquired WR Jordan Matthews and a 2018 3rd round pick from the Eagles for CB Ronald Darby. pic.twitter.com/OQA1PfRET0\n\n-- Buffalo Bills (@buffalobills) August 11, 2017\n\nBuffalo was fortunate to have a couple of teams that appeared to be good trade partners at this point in the preseason. In Los Angeles, the Rams drafted what they hope is a franchise quarterback last season in Jared Goff, so adding a possible weapon and target in Watkins made sense for the Rams. In Philadelphia, added depth at wide receiver and the reported emergence of Nelson Agholor as a slot receiver meant the Eagles could make a move to ship a wide receiver to help out another position on the team. The biggest position of need for Philly is at cornerback, and the addition of Darby instantly upgrades the position.\n\nIt is becoming clear the Bills are gearing up to build their team through the draft in 2018, and the timing of that move makes sense. Tom Brady is nearing his retirement with the New England Patriots, which likely means the Patriots could be at least a little bit more vulnerable than they have in years in the eyes of the Bills franchise. Preparing for a possible push back to the top of the AFC East begins now with a plan to rebuild the roster. Trading away Watkins, a player highly regarded by the team's previous leadership, signals the official changing of the guard with how the team will be structured.\n\nWe've acquired CB E.J.

thought the biggest story of the weekend might be the Ezekiel Elliott suspension, the Bills decided to flip their roster overnight with a pair of out-of-nowhere trades.\n\nBuffalo's new regime of Sean McDermott and Brandon Beane inherited a roster that appeared to top out short of the playoffs, so it's no surprise they've spent most of the offseason trying to undo deposed general manager Doug Whaley's mistakes. The Bills repeatedly traded down during the 2017 draft, grabbing an extra 2018 first-round pick from the Chiefs from their troubles, before firing Whaley the day after the draft.\n\nOn Friday, they added to their haul by acquiring a pair of 2018 picks as part of deals with the Eagles and Rams. Those trades amount to the following:\n\nThe dust is still settling, but at first glance, let's run through the winners and losers from these three deals:\n\nJared Goff\n\nAs the Rams try to build some sort of offensive infrastructure for the 2016 first overall pick, it's hard to imagine them acquiring a better receiver to work with than Watkins, who averaged 80.5 receiving yards per game while healthy in 2015, good for what would be nearly 1,300 receiving yards over a 16-game campaign. While Watkins hasn't lived up to the draft-day trade that saw the Bills trade two first-round picks to move up and acquire him ahead of Mike Evans and Odell Beckham Jr. during the 2014 draft, injuries have been the problem, not talent.\n\nSammy Watkins\n\nThis was always going to be a huge season for Watkins, who was set to hit unrestricted free agency after the Bills declined to pick up the fifth-year option on his rookie deal for 2018. Last year was a lost season for the Clemson product, given that the Bills repeatedly pushed Watkins onto the field with a clear foot injury before Watkins finally underwent what ended up as two surgeries on his left foot. It seemed likely that the Bills would part company with Watkins after the year regardless of what happened.\n\nIt's hard to see how Watkins will be in a better situation for either his short- or long-term future. After being traded to the Rams, who gave up a starting cornerback and a high pick to acquire Watkins, Watkins is likely looking at the franchise tag if he breaks out in 2017. It's not clear that would have been the case in Buffalo, and the tag will cost him millions of dollars versus what he could get on the free market.\n\nHe's also now set to play out his contract year with Goff, who was one of the worst quarterbacks in recent memory during his debut season, as opposed to the criminally underrated Tyrod Taylor. Goff should be better during his second season, especially with the arrival of Sean McVay from Washington as coach, but there's a chance Watkins is relying on a replacement-level quarterback to make him millions of dollars.\n\nTyrod Taylor\n\nSpeaking of the Bills quarterback, Taylor also finds himself in a make-or-break year, even if that career might not be in Western New York. Taylor just lost his top receiver, and while he's getting a viable weapon in Matthews, remember that Matthews was the focal point of a wide receiving corps that was seen as one of the worst in the league in Philadelphia last season. Even if you argue that Matthews has a higher floor than Watkins by virtue of missing a total of just two games over the last three seasons, it should take some time for Taylor to develop a rapport with his new No. 1 wideout.\n\nJordan Matthews\n\nThe Broncos were comfortably a three-wideout team under new Bills offensive coordinator Rick Dennison, going three-wide as high as 72 percent of the time in 2014 per Football Outsiders, which was the fourth-highest rate in the league. At the same time, though, the Bills just paid $8.4 million over four years to sign fullback Patrick DiMarco this offseason, suggesting that their organizational plan was to roll a fullback onto the field more often than not.\n\nThe presence of DiMarco (and Mike Tolbert) suggests that Matthews will be spending more time on the outside than he did in Philadelphia, where he was primarily a slot receiver. That could be a positive if he succeeds on the edge, given that some teams still discount the work done by receivers out of the slot.\n\nMore than anything, though, it's clear that Matthews is going to get far more targets in Buffalo than he would have in Philadelphia, where he was competing with Alshon Jeffery, Torrey Smith, Darren Sproles, and a bevy of tight ends for targets. Now, Matthews will be the primary focus of a receiving corps that includes second-round pick Zay Jones, the newly-signed Anquan Boldin, a limited Charles Clay, and LeSean McCoy. The Vandy product has a great shot at topping the 117 targets he racked up a year ago, which could get Matthews paid this offseason. It's also possible the Bills give him a sweetheart deal in an attempt to smooth over their fans in advance of what looks like another rebuild.\n\nNelson Agholor\n\nWho saw that one coming? Agholor was basically left for dead after two frustrating seasons in Philadelphia, but after training camp reports suggested Agholor looked like a new man in the slot, the Eagles cleared out a spot for him by trading away Matthews. Coach Doug Pederson might not go three-wide all that often -- Philadelphia was there 60 percent of the time last season, which was 26th in the league -- but Agholor went from looking like a likely trade candidate to securing a roster spot with an outside shot at meaningful receptions.\n\nThe Eagles\n\nPhiladelphia was looking downright bereft at cornerback for the second consecutive season, having cycled again through middling veterans while using second- and third-round picks on Sidney Jones and Rasul Douglas, the former of whom is likely to miss a chunk of the 2017 season after rupturing his Achilles at his pro day. While the Eagles had long-term hope at the position, this is a team that should be capable of competing as early as this season. Cornerback was their biggest weakness.\n\nNow, they have a promising option in both the short- and long-term in Darby, who was stunningly effective during his debut season in Buffalo before slipping badly last season. Defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz has done excellent work with undersized corners in years past, notably launching Cortland Finnegan's career in Tennessee. It's too early to suggest Darby's a reclamation project, but dealing a wide receiver the Eagles were unlikely to sign for a likely starter at cornerback is a totally logical move, even if it did hurt to give up a third-round pick in the process.\n\nThe Rams\n\nSo much of what the Rams do on a year-to-year basis seems to be about erasing or accounting for the mistakes they've made in years past. Here, again, they're addressing their disastrous investment and re-investment in the badly-miscast Tavon Austin by shelling out another draft pick and what is (in the best case) going to be a huge contract to retain Watkins for the years to come.\n\nYou could understand why the Rams would want to take a shot at Watkins, but the 2018 free-agent wide receiver class is staggering, including players like Matthews, DeAndre Hopkins, and Allen Robinson. Some of those guys will re-sign with their current teams, of course, but maybe the Rams end up giving someone like Jeffery or Terrelle Pryor a big deal. That wouldn't be the end of the world.\n\nWhat's frustrating about this move is that the Rams had to give up a second-round pick to acquire Watkins. Given that they're unlikely to be very good -- ESPN's FPI projects them to finish with the league's fifth-worst record -- chances are that they'll be sending a high second-rounder to the Bills to acquire a player who hasn't been healthy for most of his career.\n\nAfter trading away a bevy of picks to acquire Goff, the Rams can't be in the pick-trading business. If anything, they should be looking at trading down and acquiring selections. (I realize they're getting a sixth-rounder, but per Chase Stuart's chart, even the top pick of the sixth round is worth just 12 percent as much as the fifth pick of the second round, the selection the Rams project to send to Buffalo.)\n\nEven if Los Angeles' bet on Watkins works out in 2017, the Rams are going to be stuck using their franchise tag or making a long-term bet on a player with a history of foot injuries. They could recoup a compensatory draft pick if they let Watkins leave, but that assumes Watkins will have a big enough year to justify a serious deal in free agency while the Rams themselves mostly sit out, which seems like a very unlikely proposition.)\n\nThey're also going to be in serious trouble at cornerback, where they just traded away Gaines and won't be able to afford franchising Trumaine Johnson for a third time after the season. Wade Phillips is a defensive genius, but the best guy on Los Angeles' depth chart for 2018 appears to be Broncos import Kayvon Webster, who played 58 defensive snaps last season and has spent the last several years buried underneath a stacked depth chart in Denver.\n\nThe Bills\n\nAs frustrating as this must be for Buffalo's fans, who are stuck undergoing yet another rebuild, the Bills are making the right sort of moves as they try to build a team to (eventually) make noise in the postseason. It's clear that the organization had soured on Watkins and had serious concerns about his ability to stay healthy; otherwise, they wouldn't have passed up the wideout's fifth-year option. And if the Bills don't have a lot of faith in Watkins staying healthy enough to pass a physical in 2018, it's difficult to imagine that they would see signing Watkins as a wise decision in the long term, either.\n\nIf you're going to move on from Watkins, then, this is a reasonable haul. You might argue that the Bills make a slight downgrade at cornerback by swapping Darby for Gaines, who has struggled with his own foot injuries. It's pretty clear Watkins has a higher upside than Matthews, although the higher floor for Matthews might offer some level of certainty the Bills prefer if they're handing out a long-term deal.\n\nWhat's really crucial, though, are those extra draft picks. As projected by FPI and using Stuart's chart, the Bills trading their sixth-round pick for Los Angeles' second-rounder and Philadelphia's third-round pick to trade Rams pick (37, fifth-lowest FPI projection) and Eagles pick (80, 16th-lowest FPI projection) for pick 190 (the Bills have the sixth-lowest projection and that was the sixth-lowest pick of the sixth round, obviously the exact pick will pend specific compensatory selections) is roughly the equivalent of acquiring the 16th overall pick in a typical draft. (17.1 points, closest to value of 16th pick, 16.9 points).\n\nThat gives the Bills what essentially amounts to three first-round picks in the upcoming 2018 draft, given that they'll have their own pick and Kansas City's selection from the Patrick Mahomes II trade. They can add a third-round compensatory pick for Stephon Gilmore if they cut three players from the group of DiMarco, Vladimir Ducasse, Ryan Harris, Andre Holmes, and Steven Hauschka before Week 10, a move I would strongly encourage. Draft picks alone aren't a solution, but the best way to build a sustainably effective team isn't to trade up for a stud wide receiver or an inside linebacker, as the Bills did by sending multiple picks to acquire Reggie Ragland last season.

Gaines and a 2018 second-round pick from the Los Angeles Rams in exchange for wide receiver Sammy Watkins.\n\nWatkins, the No. 4 overall pick in the 2014 NFL Draft, spent four seasons with the Bills but spent much of last season injured. He has had two surgeries on a broken foot but had stayed healthy during training camp. Earlier this offseason, the Bills declined the fifth-year option on Watkins' contract, making him a free agent after this season.\n\nThe trade was one of two huge moves the Bills made on Friday. They also traded cornerback Ronald Darby to the Eagles in exchange for Jordan Matthews and a 2018 third-round pick. The Bills now have two first-round picks, two second-round picks and two third-round picks in the 2018 NFL Draft.\n\nMeanwhile, they added Gaines to replace Darby and Mathews to replace Watkins. Gaines was a sixth-round pick in the 2014 NFL Draft but has outperformed his draft position since entering the league. He spent 2015 on injured reserve with a lisfranc injury but had strong years in 2014 and 2016.\n\nWatkins now reunites with former teammate Robert Woods in Los Angeles. New Bills general manager Brandon Beane has wasted no time shaping this roster in his image. Hired in May, Beane has already traded 2016 fourth-round pick Cardale Jones, 2014 first-round pick Sammy Watkins and 2015 second-round pick Ronald Darby, all draft picks of Doug Whaley.\n\nBeane now has a stockpile of draft picks to work with and managed to replace Watkins and Darby in the lineup.\n\nIn three seasons with the Bills, Watkins had 153 catches, for 2,459 yards and 17 touchdowns. His best season came in 2015 when he had 60 catches for just over 1,000 yards and nine touchdowns. Watkins never lived up to the lofty expectations placed on him after the Bills spent two first-round picks to get him.\n\nNow the Bills will be heading in an entirely new direction at wide receiver. Recently acquired Anquan Boldin, rookie Zay Jones and Jordan Matthews will be the top three receivers on the team.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T15:03:00Z", "sim": 0.7843137383460999, "source": {"uri": "newyorkupstate.com", "title": "NewYorkUpstate.com", "id": "18847"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "18:08:00", "url": "http://www.newyorkupstate.com/buffalo-bills/index.ssf/2017/08/buffalo_bills_trade_sammy_watkins_to_la_rams_for_second-round_pick.html", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8676484", "image": "http://image.newyorkupstate.com/home/nyup-media/width620/img/buffalo-bills/photo/2017/08/11/23217824-standard.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "15:03:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

After initially acquiring wide receiver Jordan Matthews and a 2018 third round NFL Draft pick from the Philadelphia Eagles in exchange for cornerback Ronald Darby, the Bills then promptly shipped another wide receiver in Sammy Watkins across the country in a separate deal.\n\nWith Matthews officially in for the Bills and Watkins now with the Los Angeles Rams, in addition to a 2018 sixth-round pick, the NFC West franchise then sent another cornerback in E.J. Gaines back to Buffalo alongside a 2018 second round pick.\n\nWe've acquired CB E.J.

While previously spending his entire NFL career in upstate New York, the veteran wide out's time with the Bills was mostly marred by lingering injuries.\n\nAfter appearing in all 16 regular-season games as a rookie back in 2014, he then made 13 and eight such appearances, respectively, during the two following two seasons. Most recently, Watkins produced a mere 28 receptions for 430 yards and two touchdowns in 2016. However, his best single-season effort came in 2015 despite missing three regular-season matchups. While posting 60 receptions on 95 targets, he also produced 1,047 yards and nine touchdowns, both of which still serve as single-season career-high marks.\n\nFor his NFL tenure as a whole, Watkins has registered 153 receptions for 2,459 yards and 17 touchdowns across 37 regular-season games.\n\nRelated Items:AFC East, Buffalo Bills, FRS News, Los Angeles Rams, NFC West, Todays NFL News", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-08-11", "textEnd": 797, "textStart": 782}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T15:13:00Z", "sim": 0.7843137383460999, "source": {"uri": "fanragsports.com", "title": "FanRag Sports", "id": "16930"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "18:16:00", "url": "https://www.fanragsports.com/news/bills-trade-sammy-watkins-rams-ej-gaines/", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8677803", "image": "https://d3d2maoophos6y.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/11100521/CGV_0101170259_Bills_v_Jets.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "15:13:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

In return, the Bills will get cornerback E.J. Gaines and a second-round pick in 2018.\n\nWatkins will be reunited with his former teammate Robert Woods in LA. The big question about this trade is whether Watkins will actually be healthy this season.\n\nWatkins has played a total of 37 games since he was drafted in 2014 thanks to constant foot problems. When healthy, Watkins is easily one of the most talented wide receivers in football. That's the problem though, he's never healthy.\n\nThe Rams must think that Watkins is as healthy as he's been in his entire career. If so, second-year quarterback Jared Goff has some real weapons to work with, with Woods, Watkins and rookie Cooper Kupp.\n\nTo fill Watkins spot the Bills also made a deal with the Philadelphia Eagles, shipping off cornerback Ronald Darby for wide receiver Jordan Matthews and a third-round pick.\n\nThe Bills receiver corps and secondary had a massive turnover from last season. They now have Jordan Matthews, Anquan Boldin and rookie Zay Jones catching passes from Tyrod Taylor. In the secondary they are now without Stephon Gilmore, Nickell Robey-Coleman - who was one of the best slot corners in football last year - and now they just traded Ronald Darby. Rookie Tre'Davious White and E.J.

He was limited to eight games and 28 receptions last year because of a broken foot.\n\nBuffalo had declined in May to pick up his fifth-year option, worth $13.26 million, which means Watkins is set to become a free agent after the season.\n\nHis cap number is $6.34 million this season, according to OvertheCap.com, although Buffalo is reportedly responsible for $2.4 million of that figure, which was paid out as a roster bonus.\n\nWatkins rejoins former Bills teammate Robert Woods in Los Angeles. Woods was signed as a free agent earlier this year.\n\nThe Bills immediately replaced Watkins by trading cornerback Ronald Darby to Philadelphia for receiver Jordan Matthews and a third-round pick. The Bills also signed veteran receiver Anquan Boldin four days ago. Matthews averaged 75 catches, 891 receiving yards and six touchdowns in his first three seasons.\n\nDarby, a second-round pick in the 2015 draft, started 29 games in his first two seasons in Buffalo.\n\nGaines started 25 games for the Rams since being drafted in the sixth round out of Missouri in 2014, making two interceptions. He missed the entire 2015 season with a broken foot.\n\n\"We want to thank E.J. for all he has contributed to our organization since we drafted him in 2014,\" Snead said. \"E.J. has been a dedicated professional during his time with us and we wish him and his family the best in their future endeavors.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\n23 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T17:32:00Z", "sim": 0.7803921699523926, "source": {"uri": "vcstar.com", "title": "Ventura County Star", "id": "10017"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "23:04:00", "url": "http://www.vcstar.com/story/sports/nfl/rams/2017/08/11/rams-trade-receiver-sammy-watkins/559830001/", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8716220", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/vcstar.png", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "17:32:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

Gaines in exchange.\n\nMoments later, Robinson reported another deal - in this, Buffalo acquired receiver Jordan Matthews and a 2018 third-round pick from the Philadelphia Eagles, with the Eagles receiving CB Ronald Darby. According to Robinson, the Bills and Eagles have been discussing the Matthews trade since before the NFL Draft.\n\nThe Bills have since confirmed the trades.\n\nThe big name in all of this is Watkins. The fourth overall pick out of Clemson in 2014, he entered the league with great fanfare, and former Bills general manager Doug Whaley traded up to nab Watkins. A speedster who was the rare player to be named All-American as a freshman, Watkins' career in Buffalo has been derailed by foot injuries. He played in just 21 games over the 2015-16 seasons.\n\nHe's said to be healthy now after undergoing a second foot surgery in January. But it's unlikely Watkins was in Buffalo's long term plans: the team had previously declined his fifth-year option, and as such he's in the final year of his rookie contract.\n\nWatkins joins a Rams offense that struggled mightily last season with Case Keenum and Jared Goff at quarterback; Los Angeles was last in the league nearly across the board in almost every statistical category.\n\n[Now's the time to sign up for Fantasy Football! Join for free]\n\nBut the Rams are now being led by Sean McVay, the youngest head coach in the NFL, and an offensive-minded coach charged with making Goff, last year's No. 1 pick, into one of the league's top young passers, and turning around a franchise that has been the definition of mediocrity for years.\n\nMatthews, also a member of the 2014 draft class - he was a second-round pick from Vanderbilt - has played in 46 of 48 career games, missing two last year with a sprained ankle. He was a solid member of the Eagles' offense, averaging 75 catches, 891 yards and just over six touchdowns per game for his career.\n\nThe Eagles, who were in dire need of starting cornerbacks, got one in Darby, who started all 29 games he's been available for over the first two years of his career.\n\nBuffalo now has quite a lot of draft capital in 2018: as a result of its trade with the Kansas CIty Chiefs, it has two first round picks (the Chiefs traded up to take QB Pat Mahomes), two second round picks, and two third-round picks.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T16:28:00Z", "sim": 0.7764706015586853, "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "title": "Yahoo Sports", "id": "2139"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "09:41:00", "url": "https://sports.yahoo.com/busy-bills-buffalo-trades-sammy-watkins-rams-acquires-jordan-matthews-eagles-174739301.html", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8772548", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4TZINnta1tCldH6Pm0_l2Q--/aD0yODUzO3c9NDM5OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/b1567c58c7591f59b895cd4421193b8b", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "16:28:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

They're investing in the future.\n\nThe Bills made two blockbuster moves Friday. The team traded cornerback Ronald Darby to the Philadelphia Eagles for wide receiver Jordan Matthews and a third round pick in the 2018 NFL Draft. In a separate transaction, E.J. Gaines and a 2018 second round pick were acquired from the Los Angeles Rams in exchange for wide receiver Sammy Watkins and a sixth round pick next year.\n\nTrading away Darby is an interesting decision since the Bills lack depth in the secondary. Is Gaines an upgrade over Darby? That's tough to say. Maybe the Bills' front office doesn't care. Gaines is in a contract year. It could be a one-year tryout for him to determine if the Bills want to sign him to a longer term deal.\n\nThe good news is that Matthews is no slouch. He's a solid wide receiver. He hasn't registered a 1,000-yard season yet, but he's been a top option for the Eagles. And he's had to play with a mix of quarterbacks in Philadelphia, so that says a lot about his versatility. Like Gaines, he's in a contract year. He could fill a gap for now, or he might be a long-term answer at wide receiver. Time will tell.\n\nThe headliner of these trades is Watkins. The writing was on the wall when the Bills decided not to pick up his option for 2018. That meant two things: Either the Bills would give him a one-year audition and sign him to a longer (more expensive) deal after this season, or they would part ways with him. Obviously, it was the latter all along.\n\nWatkins had his moments in Buffalo, but he struggled to stay healthy. It didn't help that the Bills gave up so much to draft him in 2014 when there were other wide receivers -- Odell Beckham Jr., to name one -- available.\n\nThat trade was made under the previous front office. There are new sheriffs in town. There's a bit of irony to all of this: After the Bills sacrificed picks to draft Watkins in 2014, the team is now adding picks by trading him in 2017.\n\nAnd that's really what this is about. Are the Bills in full-on tank mode? Maybe, maybe not. Sean McDermott, the Bills' new head coach, will want his team performing 100 percent each week. Gaines, when healthy, can be a strong corner. And Matthews is a very good receiver. He has the size and speed to make some plays.\n\nBut the Bills are investing in their future. With Friday's trades, they now have two picks in each of the first three rounds of the 2018 draft. They could either use those picks to build a quality roster or package a few of them to move up. The 2018 draft is supposed to be deeper at quarterback.\n\nDarby and Watkins will be missed. Bills fans may be scratching their heads and wondering what to make of this. It may not pan out in 2017, but the Bills' front office is doing the right things to plan for 2018 and beyond.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T15:52:00Z", "sim": 0.7647058963775635, "source": {"uri": "auburnpub.com", "title": "Auburn Citizen", "id": "9091"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "23:04:00", "url": "http://auburnpub.com/blogs/in_the_pros/buffalo-bills-invest-in-future-by-trading-ronald-darby-sammy/article_d87e73b6-7eb7-11e7-aa21-fbffbdcd994b.html", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8716198", "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/auburnpub.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/ab/9ab5757e-7eb8-11e7-baf4-03c18edc1361/598de667be075.image.jpg?crop=1529%2C860%2C0%2C247&resize=1120%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "15:52:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

Gaines and a 2018 second-round draft pick. Then, Buffalo announced it acquired Philadelphia Eagles receiver Jordan Matthews and a 2018 third-round draft pick in exchange for cornerback Ronald Darby.\n\nThe move seems as if it could be a lateral one for the Bills, as Matthews and Watkins bring similar abilities and statlines through their first three seasons in the league. But the addition of Matthews at the No. 1 receiver spot on the depth chart gives the Bills a proven weapon for quarterback Tyrod Taylor.\n\nMatthews will be joined by Anquan Boldin, who Buffalo signed to a contract just days ago. In addition to the pair, Brandon Tate will likely grab the No. 3 slot, and a slew of others are looking to claim the fourth and fifth receiver spots.\n\nMatthews was drafted by the Eagles in the second round of the 2014 draft out of Vanderbilt University, and he's been a proven commodity. He's recorded at least 800 yards receiving in each of his three seasons, and has been a prime target for the Eagles' quarterbacks every season.\n\nWatkins, on the other hand, was often injured, but many are looking to him to have another breakthrough season. During his rookie season, he caught 65 passes for 982 yards and 6 touchdowns. He followed that season up by catching 60 passes for a career-best 1,047 yards and 9 touchdowns.\n\nLast season, though, Watkins broke a bone in his foot and had a screw surgically installed. He missed the first half of the season and was finally activated off the injured reserve list prior to Week 12. In eight games, he hauled in 28 passes for 430 yards and 2 touchdowns. He was due to be a free agent after the upcoming season when the Bills declined his fifth-year option in May.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-11", "textEnd": 89, "textStart": 80}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T15:17:00Z", "sim": 0.7647058963775635, "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "title": "Heavy.com", "id": "4362"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "18:08:00", "url": "http://heavy.com/sports/2017/08/bills-jordan-matthews-trade-depth-chart-roster-sammy-watkins-receivers/", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8676536", "image": "https://heavyeditorial.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/gettyimages-619335480-e1502471180377.jpg?quality=65&strip=all", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "15:17:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

That's what the Buffalo Bills did today.\n\nFirst they shipped their best wideout, Sammy Watkins, and a sixth round pick to the Los Angeles Rams for defensive back E. J. Gaines and a second round pick. Then they traded away corner Ronald Darby to the Philadelphia Eagles for receiver Jordan Matthews and a third round pick. This positions their new head coach, Sean McDermott, and new general manager, Brandon Beane, with six picks in the first three rounds of the 2018 draft, two in each of the first, second and third rounds having gotten next years first round pick from Kansas City Chiefs on a draft day trade.\n\nMatthews has been a very productive receiver for the Eagles, but the second round pick from 2014 is entering the final year of his rookie contract and the team never got serious about extending his deal. He will likely come in and play the slot for Buffalo for the season and then go on his way in free agency after.\n\nGaines is a sixth round pick from the same draft and will come in and start opposite of the Bills 1st round pick form the year, Tre'davious White. Both players could be kept around if they click with the coaching staff and do well in the season, or they could move on without costing the Bills anything. These moves seem to be freeing up cap space and creating a situation where McDermott can get the players he wants onto the team.\n\nFor the Rams, they get the vertical threat they've been searching for in Watkins. It also gives the team another marquee players to help sell tickets. This shows how quickly things change in the NFL. In 2014, the Bills were so high on Watkins that they traded away their first round pick and the first and fourth in 2015 to the Cleveland Browns to move up six spots to get Watkins. This is one of the 2014 first rounders that didn't get their fifth year option picked up.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T18:46:00Z", "sim": 0.7647058963775635, "source": {"uri": "bleedingcool.com", "title": "Bleeding Cool Comic Book, Movie, TV News", "id": "2574"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "18:50:00", "url": "https://www.bleedingcool.com/2017/08/11/buffalo-bills-trade-sammy-watkins/", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8683146", "image": "https://www.bleedingcool.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SammyWatkins.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "18:46:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

In the first, they sent No. 1 wide receiver and former No. 4 overall pick in the 2014 draft Sammy Watkins to the Los Angeles Rams along with a 2018 sixth-round pick, and received cornerback E.J. Gaines and a 2018 second-round pick in return.\n\nThe team announced the trade via its official Twitter account.\n\nWatkins, 24, has been a good player for the Bills whenever he's been healthy on the field, but has struggled the last two years with injuries to his foot. The Bills declined to pick up his fifth-year option earlier this offseason, fueling speculation that he might be moved by the team's new management. Those rumors have now come to fruition.\n\nWatkins immediately becomes the highest-upside wide receiver on the Rams, who also acquired former Bills wideout Robert Woods as a free agent earlier this offseason. He will likely slide right in as Jared Goff's No. 1 wideout as he attempts to rebound from his miserable rookie season.\n\nThe second trade saw the Bills send cornerback Ronald Darby to the Philadelphia Eagles in exchange for wide receiver Jordan Matthews and a 2018 third-round pick.\n\nThe Bills, meanwhile, added a whole bunch of draft value in these deals. They now own two first-round picks (theirs and the Chiefs', the result of a draft-day deal that saw the Chiefs move up for quarterback Patrick Mahomes), two second-round picks (theirs and the Rams'), and two third-round picks (theirs and the Eagles') in the 2018 draft.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T17:36:00Z", "sim": 0.7607843279838562, "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "title": "CBS Sports", "id": "765"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "17:36:00", "url": "https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/bills-trade-sammy-watkins-to-rams-for-e-j-gaines-and-a-huge-draft-pick-upgrade/", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8671983", "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2016/12/21/303a8b88-c422-46a2-afc9-c3de8e23ee05/thumbnail/770x433/d2e66481c04d7bc4825832da225c4e65/sammy-watkins-1400.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "17:36:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

But unlike his predecessor Doug Whaley, the ex-Bills general manager who recklessly traded two first-round picks to move up for Watkins in 2014, Beane is being strategic and deserves the patience of Buffalo's fan base.\n\nConsider the Bills' current stash of draft selections in 2018:\n\nBuffalo could add to its haul of 2018 draft selections by working the NFL's compensatory pick system to its advantage. By releasing at least three of their qualifying unrestricted free-agent signings from this offseason, the Bills would put themselves in good position to receive a third-round pick in 2018 for the loss of cornerback Stephon Gilmore in free agency. They could also release a fourth player to receive a fourth-round pick for losing receiver Robert Woods in free agency.\n\nWhy stop there? If the Bills do not view 2016 second-round pick Reggie Ragland as a good long-term fit for their scheme -- he was demoted last week to the third-team defense -- trading Ragland for a mid- to late-round pick could be appealing.\n\nA faction of Bills fans seem hurt by the departure of Watkins, who when healthy was the top talent on the Bills' roster next to running back LeSean McCoy. With Watkins gone, Bills fans should see the benefit of a drag of a season -- perhaps a final record of 4-12 or 5-11 rather than another seven- or eight-win year that leaves Buffalo lost in no-man's land between the top of the draft and the playoffs.\n\nBeane, known as a hard-nosed competitor, was visibly defensive Friday about the idea he is sacrificing the 2017 season for long-term gain.\n\n\"This is not a throw-in-the-towel thing at all,\" Beane said. \"Somebody mentioned that somebody said that out there, and honestly, that's annoying to me. You don't know me if you think I'm throwing in the towel. When I go out there and play pingpong, whatever I'm doing, I'm not throwing in the towel. If we're throwing in the towel, we're not trying to get a starting receiver back.\"\n\nIt is true that between acquiring Jordan Matthews from the Eagles, signing veteran Anquan Boldin earlier this month and selecting East Carolina's Zay Jones in the second round of April's draft, the Bills might have a better group at receiver than last season. With Watkins sidelined by injury for eight games in 2016, the Bills tried to get by with Woods, Marquise Goodwin, Justin Hunter and others. It did not work.\n\nBeane used the additions of Matthews and Boldin to push back against the idea that the trade sets up Taylor to fail this season, which would make it easier for the Bills to part ways with him next offseason and draft a quarterback. However, the relevant comparison for Taylor is not whether Matthews, Boldin and Jones are a better group than an injured Watkins, Woods and Goodwin last year.\n\nInstead, the comparison that matters for Taylor is whether he is better off when he went to bed Friday night with Matthews, Boldin and Jones as his receivers after waking up thinking he would be throwing to Watkins, Boldin and Jones. As McCoy said Friday, it is \"obvious\" who is better between Matthews and Watkins -- it's Watkins.\n\nMatthews has better production (225 catches, 2,673 yards and 19 touchdowns) than Watkins (153 catches, 2,459 yards and 17 touchdowns) since they both entered the league in 2014, but Watkins routinely drew the attention of opposing defenses for his ability to blow the top off the defense. Watkins has averaged 16.1 yards per catch, while Matthews' average is only 11.9 yards per reception.\n\nIt is a difficult for Beane to make the argument that the Bills are better off in 2017 with Matthews and cornerback E.J. Gaines, who was acquired from the Rams, than they were with Watkins and Darby. If that was true, the Bills would not have received second- and third-round picks next year as fair value for giving up two of their top young players.\n\nBut let's be clear: the Bills getting worse in the short term with these trades is not necessarily a bad thing. If the deals help the Bills acquire a franchise quarterback and otherwise shape a winning roster, the moves will both be huge wins for Beane in the long term.\n\nInstead of smashing his driver off the tee and dunking his golf ball in a pond attempting to make the playoffs in 2017, Beane is laying up and positioning his next shot. For Bills fans, that should be considered a smart and refreshing approach after two years of watching Whaley and coach Rex Ryan play the game like amateurs.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T17:04:00Z", "sim": 0.7607843279838562, "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "title": "ESPN.com", "id": "4"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "17:04:00", "url": "http://www.espn.com/blog/buffalo-bills/post/_/id/28531", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8820591", "image": "http://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0812%2Fr243169_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "17:04:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

But it might be good for Goff and bad for Watkins. Here's why, plus fallout of who else is affected.\n\nIn trading Sammy Watkins, the Bills did little to justify Tyrod Taylor's faith. Friday's trades look to be about acquiring draft picks and rebuilding.\n\nJordan Matthews forged a strong connection to Carson Wentz, but now Matthews is gone, leaving the Eagles quarterback looking for targets.\n\nThe Bills' decision to trade their top receiver and top cornerback for future draft picks signals that first-year general manager Brandon Beane and coach Sean McDermott view the team as a long-term rebuilding project.\n\nBuffalo now owns two selections in the first, second and third rounds of the 2018 draft. The Bills previously acquired the Kansas City Chiefs' first-round pick when they traded down during the 2017 draft to select cornerback Tre'Davious White at No. 27.\n\nWatkins' departure strips quarterback Tyrod Taylor of his top passing target this season. Taylor took a $10 million pay cut during the offseason to remain with the Bills, but his future with the team remains in doubt. The Bills can release Taylor before paying him a $6 million roster bonus in March and save most of his $18 million cap number in 2018, the final year of his contract.\n\n\"It doesn't say anything,\" said Bills GM Brandon Beane about what the trade means for Taylor. \"Everybody's forgetting Anquan [Boldin] last week. This is not a throw-in-the-towel thing at all. Somebody mentioned that somebody said that out there, and honestly, that's annoying to me. You don't know me if you think I'm throwing in the towel. When I go out there and play ping pong, whatever I'm doing, I'm not throwing in the towel. If we're throwing in the towel, we're not trying to get a starting receiver back. To your question on Tyrod, it's nothing. We got Anquan, who we added. I told you, I honestly believe he's a Hall of Famer, he still can play in this league. Jordan Matthews is a starting receiver. If you look at his numbers and what he's done, those aren't anything to laugh at. So Tyrod will get every opportunity to lead this team, and we're all rooting for him. It's our best interest.\"\n\nDarby, who finished second in voting for defensive rookie of the year in 2015, had two years remaining on his contract. White now projects as the Bills' top cornerback this season with Gaines likely to start opposite him.\n\nThe Rams have been searching all year for an outside vertical threat to complement new coach Sean McVay's offense and finally have that player in Watkins, who joins former Bills teammate Robert Woods in the Rams' wide receiver corps.\n\n\"Sammy has proven he can be a productive player and an explosive receiver in this league. We look forward to having him in a Rams uniform,\" Rams general manager Les Snead said. \"We want to thank E.J. for all he has contributed to our organization since we drafted him in 2014.\n\n\"E.J. has been a dedicated professional during his time with us, and we wish him and his family the best in their future endeavors.\"\n\nWatkins can play a role similar to the one DeSean Jackson played in Washington the past four years for McVay, who was the Redskins' offensive coordinator. Watkins joins Woods and slot receiver Cooper Kupp in three-receiver sets, putting Tavon Austin's role on the team in serious question.\n\nThe Rams had hoped that the 5-foot-8 Austin would show more progress, but he spent the offseason recovering from wrist surgery and had been held out of training camp because of a hamstring injury. The Rams' other vertical threat, Mike Thomas, is suspended the first four games of the season for violating the NFL's policy on performance-enhancing substances. And their last one, Josh Reynolds, is a rookie who is raw.\n\nWatkins enters the 2017 season on the final year of his contract after the Bills declined his fifth-year option earlier this offseason.\n\nGaines seemingly entered training camp in competition with newcomer Kayvon Webster for the No. 2 cornerback job, alongside Trumaine Johnson. But Webster's familiarity with Rams defensive coordinator Wade Phillips' system -- playing on Phillips' Denver Broncos defenses the past two years -- gave him an advantage and ultimately won him the job.\n\nMatthews has been a highly productive player since being selected 42nd overall in 2014. He ranks first in receptions (225) and third in receiving yards (2,673) among Eagles in their first three years and is one of only five players in NFL history with 65-plus receptions and 800-plus receiving yards in each of their first three seasons, joining a club that includes Randy Moss, Odell Beckham Jr., Mike Evans and A.J. Green.\n\nDespite the production, the Eagles never got serious about working out a contract extension with Matthews, who is in the final year of his rookie deal. Executive vice president of football operations Howie Roseman has a history of re-upping homegrown players early if they have been identified as part of the core. It was telling that he chose not to aggressively pursue a new contract with Matthews.\n\nPart of the issue is that Matthews' value is difficult to gauge. His numbers suggest he's deserving of something in the range of Kenny Stills (four years, $32 million) or Austin (four years, $42 million). The counter would be that Matthews is a slot receiver -- not an exceptionally explosive one relative to some others out there -- and paying big money for a player who might end up being the team's third receiving option doesn't make sense, especially if they want to extend Alshon Jeffery beyond this year.\n\nThere is also a knee injury to consider. Matthews has struggled to get right since sustaining what was described as a bone bruise last August on a low hit during training camp. One ailment after the next has crept up in the months since. He is currently dealing with knee tendinitis, which kept him from practicing for a good portion of the spring. A recent report suggested some team employees believe Matthews could have practiced more but allowed his contract status to influence his decision-making, a charge that the Matthews strongly denied.\n\nNelson Agholor enjoyed a strong spring manning the slot in Matthews' absence. The Eagles are also high on rookie Mack Hollins and second-year player Marcus Johnson. The departure of Matthews will make it easier for the front office to keep some of the promising young talent on the 53-man roster.\n\nJust as importantly, the trade brings some much-needed talent to a suspect cornerback group. Patrick Robinson and Jalen Mills sat atop the depth chart before the deal, with Ron Brooks as the favorite to man the slot. (Brooks, coming off a ruptured quad tendon, injured his hamstring Thursday in the preseason opener against the Green Bay Packers.) Inconsistency has plagued the group during the spring and summer, and defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz has made it quite clear that the competition is far from settled.\n\n\"I'd love to have some continuity there. But we also have to let it play,\" he said.\n\nESPN Bills reporter Mike Rodak, ESPN Rams reporter Alden Gonzalez and ESPN Eagles reporter Tim McManus contributed to this report.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T19:59:00Z", "sim": 0.7607843279838562, "source": {"uri": "gearsofbiz.com", "title": "gearsofbiz.com", "id": "19218"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "23:04:00", "url": "http://gearsofbiz.com/bills-ship-sammy-watkins-to-rams-get-jordan-matthews-from-eagles/6658", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8716237", "image": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "19:59:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

Gaines and a 2018 second-round selection. Separately, cornerback Ronald Darby was traded to the Philadelphia Eagles for wide receiver Jordan Matthews and a 2018 third-round selection.\n\nGeneral Manager Brandon Beane will address the media at 4 p.m. to discuss the moves.\n\nThe deals come after the team's first preseason game Thursday night and are massive steps in reshaping the roster under the leadership of Beane and coach Sean McDermott. The decision to ship both Watkins and Darby away qualifies as nothing less than stunning.\n\nThe Bills paid a massive price under previous General Manager Doug Whaley to acquire Watkins three years ago, trading first-round picks in 2014 and '15, as well as a 2015 fourth-rounder, to move up five spots for the Clemson wide receiver. Watkins' time in Buffalo, however, was hampered by injuries, particularly in 2016.\n\nHe missed half the year on injured reserve because of pain in his surgically repaired left foot - an injury that required a second procedure in January. After sitting out much of the spring, Watkins has taken a pretty full work load during training camp and figured to be the team's No. 1 receiver. He started Thursday's game with three straight receptions and finished the night with four catches for 39 yards.\n\n\"That's the hump I need to get over. Get tackled, get busted up a couple plays,\" Watkins said after the game. \"That's football, so I feel great.\"\n\nTim Graham's Hot Read: Bills jolt fans, NFL by trading No. 1 WR Sammy Watkins, top CB Ronald Darby\n\nStarting quarterback Tyrod Taylor said Thursday night that he was pleased with the chemistry he had formed with Watkins so far this summer.\n\n\"We just have to build from that,\" he said. \"That's something that me and him worked on this offseason on our own, as well as stuff we've been doing throughout camp. Just getting on the same page. Like I said, that was a start, we just got to continue to keep building from that.\"\n\nThey won't get that chance now. It's clear that McDermott and Beane did not share the same evaluation of Watkins as Whaley did. That was shown when the team elected not to pick up the fifth-year option on his rookie contract earlier this offseason. Watkins thus finishes his Bills career with 153 catches for 2,459 yards and 17 touchdowns in 37 games.\n\nThe Bills weren't done, though. They also sent Darby to the Eagles in a deal that on its own would have dropped jaws. The Bills' second-round draft pick in 2015, Darby has started all 29 games in which he's appeared over two years. He's made 137 tackles, 33 passes defensed and two interceptions in that time. Darby's rookie season was particularly strong, as he had 21 passes defensed. His play took a step backward in 2016, but he still figured to be one of the two starting cornerbacks for the Bills on the outside along with rookie first-round draft pick Tre'Davious White.\n\nInstead, the Bills brought in replacements for Watkins and Darby in the trades, while also adding significant draft capital.\n\nComing from the Eagles is Matthews, a 25-year-old who like Watkins is entering his fourth season. A former second-round draft pick, he has similar numbers to Watkins, with 225 catches for 2,673 yards and 19 touchdowns, although he has played in all 48 games, with 46 starts.\n\nGaines is also a 25-year-old entering his fourth season. He started 15 games as a rookie in 2014 and finished with 70 tackles, 14 passes defensed and two interceptions. He missed all of 2015 on injured reserve because of a Lisfranc injury to his foot and returned in 2016 to play in 11 games (with 10 starts), making 56 tackles, seven passes defensed and one forced fumble.\n\nAfter the trades, the Bills now own two first-round picks in 2018 (their own and Kansas City's), two second-round picks (their own and the Rams') and two third-round picks (their own and the Eagles').\n\nSince taking over, McDermott and Beane have systematically dismantled the roster constructed by Whaley. The current 90-man roster shows just 31 players who have appeared in a regular-season game for the Bills before.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T15:12:00Z", "sim": 0.7607843279838562, "source": {"uri": "buffalonews.com", "title": "The Buffalo News", "id": "16510"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "18:08:00", "url": "http://buffalonews.com/2017/08/11/bills-make-pair-blockbuster-trades-sending-wr-sammy-watkins-rams-cb-ronald-darby-eagles/", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8676499", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/bncore/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/DG5wLsrXcAEPZQd.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "15:12:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

(Adrian Kraus/Associated Press)\n\nTrades don't happen too often in the NFL once the preseason begins, but the Buffalo Bills don't care. On Friday, the Bills made a pair of deals that significantly change their team this season and in the future.\n\nBuffalo sent wide receiver and former No. 4 overall pick Sammy Watkins to the Los Angeles Rams in exchange for cornerback E.J. Gaines and a second-round pick in next year's draft. Then, the Bills acquired wide receiver Jordan Matthews and a third-rounder in 2018 from the Philadelphia Eagles, sending cornerback Ronald Darby to Philly.\n\nThe Bills, who haven't made the playoffs since 1999, are under new management, with first-year Coach Sean McDermott and General Manager Brandon Beane working quickly to leave a fresh imprint on a team that seems to be forever spinning its wheels.\n\nGM Brandon Beane: I was not actively shopping Watkins and Darby. Timing with both teams became serious so we did the deals at the same time. pic.twitter.com/VHuwRjUnLS\n\n-- Buffalo Bills (@buffalobills) August 11, 2017\n\nThe Bills are instantly weaker at both receiver and corner. Watkins, despite a host of injury problems, is a clear upgrade from Matthews, while Darby is the second cornerback to leave Western New York since free agency began in the spring, following Stephon Gilmore's move to the Patriots.\n\n[Ezekiel Elliott suspension: An inside look at the NFL's investigation and punishment decision]\n\nStill, Buffalo looks as if it has a real plan for the future after Friday's trades. The Bills now have two first-rounders, two second-rounders and two third-rounders in 2018. That's a lot of draft capital in short order. The Bills, who have been at or near .500 in each of the past three seasons while going through two head coaches and one interim coach during that span, clearly are ready to accept another potentially middle-of-the-road season in exchange for replenishing their talent pool via next spring's draft.\n\nMeanwhile, the Rams add a top-flight target for second-year quarterback Jared Goff and first year Coach Sean McVay. Watkins, the Clemson product who was drafted ahead of Tampa Bay wide receiver Mike Evans and Giants' star wideout Odell Beckham Jr. in the 2014 draft, has flashed plenty of tantalizing potential despite missing 11 games over the past two seasons. He caught 60 passes for 1,047 yards and nine touchdowns in 2015 -- the best of his three seasons in Buffalo. He has one year remaining on his rookie contract.\n\n['He doesn't act like he's young': At 31, Sean McVay must turn around the Rams]\n\nThen there are the Eagles, who bulked up their receiving corps for second-year quarterback Carson Wentz in the offseason, importing Alshon Jeffery from the Bears and Torrey Smith from the 49ers. The additional presence of third-year man Nelson Agholor seems to have made Mathews expendable, despite his catching 225 passes for 2,673 yards and 19 scores in his three seasons in Philadelphia. Matthews immediately becomes Buffalo quarterback Tyrod Taylor's No. 1 target.\n\nBut the main focus here should be on the Bills, who are making an aggressive effort to change their organization. It may take a little while to see their moves pay off.

In return, the Eagles have acquired cornerback Ronald Darby.\n\nDarby, a former second-round pick of the Bills, had two solid seasons for Buffalo, but was seen as an ideal match for a man-cover scheme. Buffalo seems to be stockpiling picks for next year's draft. He has made 29 career starts during his two seasons, collecting 61 tackles as a rookie and 60 last season.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T18:24:00Z", "sim": 0.7568627595901489, "source": {"uri": "newzy.net", "title": "newzy.net", "id": "18498"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "17:44:00", "url": "http://newzy.net/2017/08/11/eagles-trade-jordan-matthews-third-rounder-to-bills-for.html", "storyUri": "eng-3355470", "id": "8824602", "image": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "18:24:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

He was a second-round pick (50th overall) in the 2015 draft.\n\nDarby, a native of Oxon Hill, MD, played three seasons for the Seminoles, appearing in 42 career games and totaling 79 tackles (57 solo), 16 pass breakups, 2 interceptions, 2 forced fumbles and 1 fumble recovery. In this league, you're not going to be able to get anything unless you give something. But playing devil's advocate, let's say they throw the ball 520 times and he gets a 20 percent target share, we're looking at 104 targets.\n\nDarby provides new strength at arguably the Eagles weakest position on the team. We have some people in the building who have been around him.\n\nRoseman said it's not that Matthews wasn't in the team's long-term plans; it was just that the offer in return was good for the team.\n\nWatkins and Matthews will both become unrestricted free agents in March. With Jeffery and Smith on one-year deals, Matthews could have factored into the longterm plans. Buffalo will now have two picks in each of the first three rounds of the 2018 NFL Draft.\n\nBuffalo's overall approach with these trades, and specifically the loss of Watkins, can not sit well with starting quarterback Tyrod Taylor.\n\nThe former Clemson standout has 153 catches for 2,459 yards and 17 touchdowns in three National Football League seasons despite undergoing multiple foot surgeries.\n\n\"Crazy part of this business\", Wentz tweeted. \"Couldn't ask for a better teammate & friend\". Darby has two years remaining on his contract. Darby is the fourth player from the Bills to join the Eagles' defense in the last two seasons. Certainly we know the production he had. The Eagles have several different options for the slot, starting with Nelson Agholor, who'll get the first chance to prove that his impressive training camp signifies an awakening after two dismal seasons. \"It's hard to pull the trigger on a trade like that when you're giving up that kind of player and person\".", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T20:13:00Z", "sim": 0.7529411911964417, "source": {"uri": "aliveforfootball.com", "title": "aliveforfootball.com", "id": "18447"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "10:03:00", "url": "http://aliveforfootball.com/2017/08/eagles-trade-jordan-matthews-3rd-round-pick-to-bills-for/", "storyUri": "eng-3355470", "id": "8775112", "image": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "20:13:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

In July, he was part of the winning pairing in the Bills' inaugural media golf tournament.\n\nBeane surely knows a thing or two about when to uncork a 300-yard drive and when to keep his driver in his bag. In the case of Friday's unexpected trades that sent Buffalo's top wide receiver Sammy Watkins to the Los Angeles Rams and its top cornerback Ronald Darby to the Philadelphia Eagles, Beane is laying up off the tee in 2017 in hopes of setting up a better shot to the green in 2018.\n\nThe approach might not please Bills fans who invested their dollars into Watkins' merchandise and tickets this season, nor is it necessarily fair to quarterback Tyrod Taylor, who now must prove himself this season without one of the game's most talented receivers. But unlike his predecessor Doug Whaley, the ex-Bills general manager who recklessly traded two first-round picks to move up for Watkins in 2014, Beane is being strategic and deserves the patience of Buffalo's fan base.\n\nConsider the Bills' current stash of draft selections in 2018:\n\nBuffalo could add to its haul of 2018 draft selections by working the NFL's compensatory pick system to its advantage. By releasing at least three of their qualifying unrestricted free-agent signings from this offseason, the Bills would put themselves in good position to receive a third-round pick in 2018 for the loss of cornerback Stephon Gilmore in free agency. They could also release a fourth player to receive a fourth-round pick for losing receiver Robert Woods in free agency.\n\nWhy stop there? If the Bills do not view 2016 second-round pick Reggie Ragland as a good long-term fit for their scheme -- he was demoted last week to the third-team defense -- trading Ragland for a mid- to late-round pick could be appealing.\n\nA faction of Bills fans seem hurt by the departure of Watkins, who when healthy was the top talent on the Bills' roster next to running back LeSean McCoy. With Watkins gone, Bills fans should see the benefit of in a drag of a season -- perhaps a final record of 4-12 or 5-11 rather than another seven- or eight-win year that leaves Buffalo lost in no-man's land between the top of the draft and the playoffs.\n\nBeane, known as a hard-nosed competitor, was visibly defensive Friday about the idea he is sacrificing the 2017 season for long-term gain.\n\n\"This is not a throw-in-the-towel thing at all,\" Beane said. \"Somebody mentioned that somebody said that out there, and honestly, that's annoying to me. You don't know me if you think I'm throwing in the towel. When I go out there and play pingpong, whatever I'm doing, I'm not throwing in the towel. If we're throwing in the towel, we're not trying to get a starting receiver back.\"\n\nIt is true that between acquiring Jordan Matthews from the Eagles, signing veteran Anquan Boldin earlier this month and selecting East Carolina's Zay Jones in the second round of April's draft, the Bills might have a better group at receiver than last season. With Watkins sidelined by injury for eight games in 2016, the Bills tried to get by with Woods, Marquise Goodwin, Justin Hunter and others. It did not work.\n\nBeane used the additions of Matthews and Boldin to push back against the idea that the trade sets up Taylor to fail this season, which would make it easier for the Bills to part ways with him next offseason and draft a quarterback. However, the relevant comparison for Taylor is not whether Matthews, Boldin and Jones are a better group than an injured Watkins, Woods and Goodwin last year.\n\nInstead, the comparison that matters for Taylor is whether he is better off when he went to bed Friday night with Matthews, Boldin and Jones as his receivers after waking up thinking he would be throwing to Watkins, Boldin and Jones. As McCoy said Friday, it is \"obvious\" who is better between Matthews and Watkins -- it's Watkins.\n\nMatthews has better production (225 catches, 2,673 yards and 19 touchdowns) than Watkins (153 catches, 2,459 yards and 17 touchdowns) since they both entered the league in 2014, but Watkins routinely drew the attention of opposing defenses for his ability to blow the top off the defense. Watkins has averaged 16.1 yards per catch, while Matthews' average is only 11.9 yards per reception.\n\nIt is a difficult for Beane to make the argument that the Bills are better off in 2017 with Matthews and cornerback E.J. Gaines, who was acquired from the Rams, than they were with Watkins and Darby. If that was true, the Bills would not have received second- and third-round picks next year as fair value for giving up two of their top young players.\n\nBut let's be clear: the Bills getting worse in the short term with these trades is not necessarily a bad thing. If the deals help the Bills acquire a franchise quarterback and otherwise shape a winning roster, the moves will both be huge wins for Beane in the long term.\n\nInstead of smashing his driver off the tee and dunking his golf ball in a pond attempting to make the playoffs in 2017, Beane is laying up and positioning his next shot. For Bills fans, that should be considered a smart and refreshing approach after two years of watching Whaley and coach Rex Ryan play the game like amateurs.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T16:09:00Z", "sim": 0.7529411911964417, "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "title": "ESPN.com", "id": "4"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "16:09:00", "url": "http://www.espn.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/244159", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8814832", "image": "http://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0812%2Fr243169_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "16:09:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

Gaines and the Rams' 2018 second-round pick. The Bills immediately turned around and dealt their own cornerback, Ronald Darby, to the Eagles for wide receiver Jordan Matthews and a 2018 third-round pick.\n\nThe entire NBA universe has spent 2017 obsessing over the market value of superstars on expiring contracts -- from DeMarcus Cousins to Paul George, and now Kyrie Irving. In the NBA, a good basketball player on a bad team in the final year of his deal is always for sale. It's not a question as much as an intrinsic understanding that a trade is best for everyone involved. Since the Patriots have dominated the 21st-century NFL, football teams are finally changing how they make decisions, but the league is still in the Stone Age when it comes to valuing contracts as assets. The Watkins deal shows that the NFL is slowly learning that a true rebuild means short-term assets like Watkins need to be converted into long-term assets before they walk out the door.\n\nIf the Bills had reservations about Watkins's durability, flipping him for an asset would've been no-brainer, had they belonged to another North American pro sports league. Now it's catching on in the NFL. Watkins, Gaines, and Jordan Matthews will all be free agents after this season, so the Bills swapped one year of Watkins for a top-40 draft pick. Moving a player of Watkins's caliber isn't just a football decision, it's a mission statement for the Bills moving forward.\n\nThe Bills swapped a player they drafted fourth overall for a second-round pick and Gaines, who was drafted 184 picks after the Bills took Watkins. But when the whiplash subsides, it makes sense. That Rams 2018 pick could easily end up in the top 35. Perhaps the Bills have finally learned from their AFC East tormentors and begun valuing early-second-round picks similarly, if not more favorably, to late-first-round picks. The deal is also reminiscent of the Browns' decision to trade Trent Richardson for a first-round pick in 2013, a shocking decision at the time. (Mike Lombardi, the Browns GM at the time, is a Ringer contributor and GM Street host.)\n\nUnder the guidance of new owners Terry and Kim Pegula, the Bills are atoning for past mismanagement. They fired GM Doug Whaley and the entire scouting department the day after the NFL draft. In May, they hired Brandon Beane to lead the franchise out of the morass it has been stuck in during the 21st century. Beane, who served as assistant GM in Carolina since 2015 and had been with the team since 1998, would probably have served as the successor to Carolina's Dave Gettleman had he stayed put. Brandon Beane has no relation to Billy, but he's adopting the Moneyball approach anyway and collecting assets.\n\nThe seeds for this move were planted in May, when the Bills declined to pick up Watkins's fifth-year option, making him a free agent in 2018. Watkins was the only receiver from the 2014 first round to not have his option picked up. The Bills gave up a haul (including their 2015 first-round pick) for the right to pick Watkins, passing on Odell Beckham Jr., Brandin Cooks, and Kelvin Benjamin in the process. They brought that move full circle in 2017 by unloading Watkins for a pick.\n\nSammy Watkins is not a replicable talent. He is thrilling to watch. In his career as a Bill, Watkins logged 153 receptions, 2,459 yards, and 17 touchdowns over 37 games. Condensed into a 16-game season, he averaged 66 receptions, 1,063 yards, and seven touchdowns, which is an appropriately underwhelming stat line. Watkins is one of the few players that can be compared to Calvin Johnson with a straight face, but health issues prevented him from making a serious impact. In Watkins's first two years in Buffalo, he injured his ribs, groin, hip, and calf.\n\nWatkins sustained a Jones fracture in his foot during the 2016 offseason, and hasn't been himself since. Dez Bryant, Julio Jones, and Kevin Durant have all suffered Jones fractures in recent years, and the injury comes with a notoriously tricky recovery process. Watkins missed eight games last season as he was dealing with the injury, which required surgery last offseason and again this offseason to alleviate pain in the same foot. In total, he's missed 11 of the Bills' 32 games over the past two seasons.\n\nWatkins is a rare talent, but if the Bills decided they weren't going to re-sign him, why wouldn't they cash him in for assets? The true shock here isn't that the Bills dealt Watkins, but that the \"expiring contract\" deal that's so routine in baseball and basketball has taken this long to come to football.\n\nFor Los Angeles, the deal is a gamble. If the Rams crash and burn this season and lose Watkins in free agency, they'll feel mighty stupid when that second-round pick comes by. The Rams gave up a treasure trove to acquire Jared Goff, and the Cal quarterback looked lost in his rookie year. The team tightened its offensive line by signing Andrew Whitworth in the offseason and is now parting with more draft capital to provide Goff a star receiver. With these weapons, Goff will have a much better supporting cast than he did last season, but he'll also have fewer excuses if he once again looks overwhelmed.\n\nWatkins's replacement in Buffalo will be looking for a fresh start ahead of his own upcoming free agency. Jordan Matthews became superfluous to the Birds when they added Alshon Jeffery and Torrey Smith in the offseason. Nelson Agholor's improvement this offseason only made Matthews more expendable. If the Bills are looking to sign a wide receiver entering his prime to a second contract, Matthews has a much lower ceiling from a talent perspective, but his durability provides a much higher floor.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T18:32:00Z", "sim": 0.7529411911964417, "source": {"uri": "theringer.com", "title": "The Ringer", "id": "18904"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "23:04:00", "url": "https://www.theringer.com/nfl/2017/8/11/16135964/sammy-watkins-buffalo-bills-los-angeles-rams-trade", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8716218", "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q5hmO38klrlcY-yf452TRW19m3E=/0x0:3655x2056/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56158689/630500884.0.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "18:32:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

second-round selection from Los Angeles and a third-rounder from Philadelphia.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles have reportedly traded receiver Jordan Matthews and a third-round pick next year for cornerback Ronald Darby.\n\nDarby, 23, was a second-round pick of Buffalo in 2015 out of Florida State and represents an immediate upgrade for an Eagles CB depth chart.\n\nThe moves were announced early Friday afternoon, a day after Buffalo opened its preseason with a 17-10 loss to Minnesota.\n\nThe Bills' front office was boosted by an offseason regime change that saw first-year coach Sean McDermott get more say in personnel moves. He is entering the final year of his deal.\n\nFor the Rams, this was all about Watkins: They want to give young quarterback Jared Goff another weapon, and now they've done so. He became expendable after the Rams acquired Kayvon Webster this off-season, who is pegged to start opposite Trumaine Johnson. But when he's healthy, Watkins is one of the most dynamic receivers in the game.\n\nWatkins hasn't been able to stay healthy the past two years, missing 11 games due to foot injuries. Watkins required a second operation in January after aggravating the injury last season.\n\nThe Bills continue revamping their receiver group, with Matthews' acquisition coming four days after Buffalo signed veteran free agent Anquan Boldin. Last night, Watkins caught the first three passes thrown his way in what we now know was his last game as a Bill. They have Kansas City's first-round pick next spring in addition to their own.\n\nAs for Darby, who finished second in voting for defensive rookie of the year in 2015, he has two years remaining on his contract.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T20:24:00Z", "sim": 0.7490196228027344, "source": {"uri": "clicklancashire.com", "title": "clicklancashire.com", "id": "18148"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "17:44:00", "url": "http://clicklancashire.com/2017/08/12/big-buffalo-bills-shakeup-watkins-traded.html", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8824548", "image": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "20:24:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

But after the bombshell he dropped at One Bills Drive, one would have to believe that no one on the Buffalo roster is untouchable.\n\nWide receiver Sammy Watkins and cornerback Ronald Darby were sent packing in two separate trades within minutes of each other, and it left the Bills with a collective, wide-eyed look as they convened for a short practice. If guys like that, two starters including one who was a No. 4 overall draft pick just three years ago, can be dealt, then anybody is in play.\n\n\"Definitely surprised,\" said quarterback Tyrod Taylor. \"Being in this league seven years, you know every day you step into the building could be your last day. I wish Sammy the best. I have faith in coach (Sean) McDermott, I have faith in management that they made a decision based on the betterment of this team. Just surprised it happened so fast.\"\n\nWatkins and a sixth-round draft pick in 2018 are on the way to the Los Angeles Rams in exchange for cornerback E.J. Gaines and the Rams' second-round pick in 2018. And 2015 second-round pick Ronald Darby, who started two years at cornerback for Buffalo, was sent to Philadelphia in exchange for wide receiver Jordan Matthews and a conditional third-round pick in 2018.\n\nRunning back LeSean McCoy, like Taylor, was surprised by the trades, but unlike Taylor, he knows what it feels like to get the shocking news that you never saw coming. In 2015, the Eagles traded him to the Bills for linebacker Kiko Alonso and it took a year for McCoy to fully grasp what happened, and to get comfortable in his new surroundings.\n\n\"I'm sure he's hurt,\" said McCoy. \"You get traded. It's a business and he has to understand that. But I can understand how he feels, being traded for a guy that he's better than.\"\n\nThe deals had been coming together over the past few days, and after the Bills' 17-10 preseason-opening loss to the Vikings, Beane met with McDermott and owner Terry Pegula to lay it on the table, and the decision was made to pull the trigger.\n\n\"They were two separate moves, though fortunately the timing worked out the way I wanted,\" said Beane. \"I had calls from multiple teams about Sammy back to June shortly after I took over the job. People ask about different players all the time; you never know what's serious or just bait. We were not actively shopping either of these guys, but L.A. got very serious about Sammy, and Philadelphia got very serious about Ronald and the timing worked out.\"\n\nMcDermott admitted to being taken aback slightly, but as everything was presented, he clearly saw the vision.\n\n\"Last night, coming off my first game, trying to digest some of that and then have these conversations late into the night, not a lot of sleep,\" said McDermott. \"It was a difficult decision, one that we spent a lot of time discussing, but these are the conversations that have to be had.\"\n\nThe Bills are a team trying to build for the future. Beane repeatedly said the goal for 2017 remains unchanged and the Bills want to win now, but it's obvious these moves were made for success down the road. The Bills now have two picks in each of the first three rounds of the 2018 draft, and that will give Beane plenty of ammunition to either plug multiple holes on the team, or packaging some of the picks to perhaps draft an elite quarterback.\n\nSo comes to an end a somewhat disappointing three-year stint in Buffalo for Watkins. The Bills paid a hefty price to draft him in 2014, switching places with the Browns (No. 9 to No. 4) while also giving the Browns their 2015 first-round pick to ensure they could pick Watkins.\n\nWatkins endured non-stop nagging injuries, and he wound up missing 11 of the possible 48 games he could have played, but also was well less than 100 percent in many others. He caught 153 passes for 2,459 yards and 17 touchdowns as a Bill. By comparison, the man who will probably replace him in the starting lineup - Matthews, who was the Eagles' second-round pick in 2014 - has missed only two games in his career and has 225 catches for 2,673 yards and 19 touchdowns.\n\nAs for Darby, he had a nice rookie season in 2015, but declined last season, so a change of scenery may do him good. Unlike Matthews, who should be able to earn a starting job, Gaines will be joining an open competition to replace Darby.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T02:50:00Z", "sim": 0.7490196228027344, "source": {"uri": "upi.com", "title": "UPI", "id": "149"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "02:50:00", "url": "https://www.upi.com/Sports_News/NFL/2017/08/11/Buffalo-Bils-high-profile-deals-show-no-one-is-untouchable/5831502505301/", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8735362", "image": "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/5831502505301/2017/upi/30f8a3709822f32d331f252cf4600609/v2.1/Buffalo-Bils-high-profile-deals-show-no-one-is-untouchable.jpg?lg=4", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "02:50:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

Buffalo traded Sammy Watkins and a 2018 sixth-round draft pick to the Rams for cornerback E.J. Gaines and a 2018 second-round pick. Then, Buffalo decided to trade cornerback Ronald Darby to the Eagles for receiver Jordan Matthews and a 2018 third-round pick.\n\nNo one saw these trades coming, so let's take a look and see how the fans and players reacted to it.\n\nEagles quarterback Carson Wentz and receiver Torrey Smith were sad to see Matthews go and praised him for being a great teammate.\n\nReceiver Marcus Johnson went a bit further and wrote a brief post on Instagram about how much Matthews had an impact on him as a friend and teammate.\n\nRams receiver Robert Woods, who played in Buffalo from 2013-16, seems excited about reuniting with Watkins in Los Angeles.\n\nSosa Kremenjas of Turf Show Times loves the Rams trading for Watkins. Kremenjas believes Los Angeles finally found its No. 1 receiver that it desperately needed.\n\n\"He can work all levels of the field effectively, and was one of the leagues best deep threats. For an offense that lacks one, he fits in perfectly. Not only that, but his hands are strong, his routes are clean and sharp, and Sammy is a freak of nature. His natural ability to glide through his routes creating big separation will be a massively welcomed addition to this roster.\"\n\nBuffalo Rumblings created a poll that asks fans to vote on whether or not they approved of the Watkins and Darby trades. As of right now, the votes are split, with a sliver more fans approving of it.\n\nBleeding Green Nation also asked fans to grade the Eagles-Bills trade. Brandon Lee Gowton gave an in-depth rundown of positives and negatives of the trade. He gave it a B, and the majority of readers agree.\n\nOn the other hand, you have to feel bad for this Buffalo fan.

He had two solid seasons in Buffalo, earning 2015 NFL All-Rookie honors, but his style of play isn't seen as ideal for the zone coverage defensive scheme the Bills are shifting to.\n\nJordan Matthews, the likely new number one receiver for the Bills, started 13 games for the Eagles last season, catching 73 passes for 804 yards and three touchdowns. His low TD total was down last year from eight in each of 2014 and 2015.\n\nThese blockbuster trades signify a clear change in direction for the Bills, as Brandon Beane, hired as the Bills' new general manager in May, is clearly willing to move on from stars drafted by the previous regime.\n\nThe Bills now own the Kansas City Chiefs' 2018 first-round pick, the Rams' 2018 second-round pick, and the Eagles' 2018 third-round pick (via ESPN's Field Yates).", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T17:13:00Z", "sim": 0.7411764860153198, "source": {"uri": "thesportsquotient.com", "title": "The Sports Quotient", "id": "10204"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "10:03:00", "url": "http://thesportsquotient.com/nfl/2017/8/11/bills-trade-watkins-to-rams-acquire-matthews-from-eagles", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8775122", "image": "http://thesportsquotient.com/media/posts/36848/usatsi_9709574.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "17:13:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

Gaines and a 2018 second-round pick, the Bills announced Friday.\n\nAlso Friday, the Bills acquired wide receiver Jordan Matthews and a 2018 third-round pick from the Philadelphia Eagles for cornerback Ronald Darby.\n\nThe Bills' decision to trade their top receiver and top cornerback for future draft picks signals that first-year general manager Brandon Beane and coach Sean McDermott view the team as a long-term rebuilding project.\n\nBuffalo now owns two selections in the first, second and third rounds of the 2018 draft. The Bills previously acquired the Kansas City Chiefs' first-round pick when they traded down during the 2017 draft to select cornerback Tre'Davious White at No. 27.\n\nWatkins' departure strips quarterback Tyrod Taylor of his top passing target this season. Taylor took a $10 million pay cut during the offseason to remain with the Bills, but his future with the team remains in doubt. The Bills can release Taylor before paying him a $6 million roster bonus in March and save most of his $18 million cap number in 2018, the final year of his contract.\n\n\"It doesn't say anything,\" said Beane about what the trade means for Taylor. \"Everybody's forgettingAnquan [Boldin]last week. This is not a throw-in-the-towel thing at all. Somebody mentioned that somebody said that out there, and honestly, that's annoying to me. You don't know me if you think I'm throwing in the towel. When I go out there and play pingpong, whatever I'm doing, I'm not throwing in the towel. If we're throwing in the towel, we're not trying to get a starting receiver back.\n\n\"To your question on Tyrod, it's nothing. We got Anquan, who we added. I told you, I honestly believe he's a Hall of Famer. He still can play in this league. Jordan Matthews is a starting receiver. If you look at his numbers and what he's done, those aren't anything to laugh at. So Tyrod will get every opportunity to lead this team, and we're all rooting for him. It's our best interest.\"\n\nDarby, who finished second in voting for Defensive Rookie of the Year in 2015, had two years remaining on his contract. White now projects as the Bills' top cornerback this season with Gaines likely to start opposite him.\n\nThe Rams have been searching all year for an outside vertical threat to complement new coach Sean McVay's offense and finally have that player in Watkins, who joins former Bills teammate Robert Woodsin the Rams' wide receiver corps.\n\nThe Rams had been talking to the Bills about a deal like this dating back to early May, when Buffalo declined its fifth-year option on Watkins' contract.\n\nRams general manager Les Snead called Watkins a \"complementary piece,\" though he figures to be much more than that.\n\n\"When you attack a team with your pass game, you'd like to use the width of the field and the length of the field, and that's what speed can do,\" Snead said at the team's annual charity luncheon in downtown Los Angeles. \"It's really just trying to open the field up.\"\n\nWatkins can play a role similar to the one DeSean Jackson played in Washington the past three years for McVay, who was the Redskins' offensive coordinator. Watkins joins Woods and slot receiver Cooper Kupp in three-receiver sets, putting Tavon Austin's role on the team in serious question.\n\nThe Rams had hoped that the 5-foot-8 Austin could develop into more of a vertical threat in this offense, but he spent the offseason recovering from wrist surgery and had been held out of training camp because of a hamstring injury. The Rams' other vertical threat, Mike Thomas, is suspended the first four games of the regular season for violating the NFL's policy on performance-enhancing substances, and their other receiver, Josh Reynolds, is a rookie who is still developing.\n\nSnead said Austin \"definitely has a place.\"\n\n\"Tavon is a fast kid,\" Snead said. \"Jimmy Johnson probably said it best, long before I was in football -- speed is important.\"\n\nWatkins enters the 2017 season on the final year of his contract after the Bills declined his fifth-year option earlier this offseason. Snead \"definitely\" wants to figure something out with Watkins long term but hasn't yet broached that topic with his representatives.\n\n\"He's 24,\" Snead said. \"So, you don't just do it for the now -- although we do think he'll help the now. But because of the age, you'd want it to be for the future, as well.\"\n\nGaines seemingly entered training camp in competition with newcomer Kayvon Webster for the No. 2 cornerback job, alongside Trumaine Johnson. But Webster's familiarity with Rams defensive coordinator Wade Phillips' system -- playing on Phillips' Denver Broncos defenses the past two years -- gave him an advantage and ultimately won him the job.\n\nMatthews has been a highly productive player since being selected 42nd overall in 2014. He ranks first in receptions (225) and third in receiving yards (2,673) among Eagles in their first three years and is one of only five players in NFL history with 65-plus receptions and 800-plus receiving yards in each of their first three seasons, joining a club that includes Randy Moss, Odell Beckham Jr., Mike Evans and A.J. Green.\n\nDespite the production, the Eagles never got serious about working out a contract extension with Matthews, who is in the final year of his rookie deal. Executive vice president of football operations Howie Roseman has a history of re-upping homegrown players early if they have been identified as part of the core. It was telling that he chose not to aggressively pursue a new contract with Matthews.\n\nPart of the issue is that Matthews' value is difficult to gauge. His numbers suggest he's deserving of something in the range of Kenny Stills (four years, $32 million) or Austin (four years, $42 million). The counter would be that Matthews is a slot receiver -- not an exceptionally explosive one relative to some others out there -- and paying big money for a player who might end up being the team's third receiving option doesn't make sense, especially if the Eagles want to extend Alshon Jeffery beyond this year.\n\nThere is also a knee injury to consider. Matthews has struggled to get right since sustaining what was described as a bone bruise last August on a low hit during training camp. One ailment after the next has crept up in the months since. He is currently dealing with knee tendinitis, which kept him from practicing for a good portion of the spring. A recent report suggested some team employees believe Matthews could have practiced more but allowed his contract status to influence his decision-making, a charge that Matthews strongly denied.\n\nNelson Agholor enjoyed a strong spring manning the slot in Matthews' absence. The Eagles are also high on rookie Mack Hollins and second-year player Marcus Johnson. The departure of Matthews will make it easier for the front office to keep some of the promising young talent on the 53-man roster.\n\nJust as importantly, the trade brings some much-needed talent to a suspect cornerback group. Patrick Robinson and Jalen Mills sat atop the depth chart before the deal, with Ron Brooks as the favorite to man the slot. (Brooks, coming off a ruptured quad tendon, injured his hamstring Thursday in the preseason opener against the Green Bay Packers.) Inconsistency has plagued the group during the spring and summer, and defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz has made it quite clear that the competition is far from settled.\n\n\"I'd love to have some continuity there. But we also have to let it play,\" he said.\n\nESPN Bills reporter Mike Rodak, ESPN Rams reporter Alden Gonzalez and ESPN Eagles reporter Tim McManus contributed to this report.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T15:17:00Z", "sim": 0.7372549176216125, "source": {"uri": "6abc.com", "title": "6abc Action News", "id": "187"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "01:51:00", "url": "http://6abc.com/2297153/", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8731307", "image": "http://a.espncdn.com/media/motion/2017/0811/dm_170811_nfl_schefter_on_watkins_and_matthews_trade/dm_170811_nfl_schefter_on_watkins_and_matthews_trade.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "15:17:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

While we waited for a verdict on Ezekiel Elliott's 2017 season from the NFL to continue our rankings, the Buffalo Bills decided to shake up the receiver rankings at the same time.\n\nOn Monday, the Bills signed veteran Anquan Boldin. But the moves made by Buffalo on Friday were intriguing to say the least.\n\nFirst, the Bills sent their number one receiver, Sammy Watkins, and a 6th round draft pick in the 2018 NFL Draft to the Los Angeles Rams for cornerback E.J. Gaines and a 2nd round pick in the 2018 NFL Draft.\n\nThat move was subsequently followed by another corner-for-receiver deal. Buffalo dealt corner Ronald Darby to Philadelphia for Jordan Matthews and a 3rd round pick in the 2018 NFL Draft.\n\nBuffalo adding a couple picks is a nice component of these deals, and they also saved money. Both nice. Neither has any impact on fantasy football this season.\n\nSo let's talk about Watkins and Matthews.\n\nAdvantage Watkins, who was hyped coming out of a football powerhouse program and has athletic ability for days. Matthews went to Vanderbilt.\n\nEverything here is a significant advantage to Matthews, who has been a more consistent part of the offense in Philadelphia in spite of quarterback changes and has been on the field more than Watkins during the three years since they were drafted. Indeed, Matthews is one of only five receivers in NFL history to catch at least 65 balls and post at least 800 receiving yards in each of his first three seasons - and he did that with a merry-go-round at quarterback in Philly.\n\nAdvantage Watkins. The dynamic athletic ability that made him the fourth overall pick has shown - when he's been healthy - on the field in Buffalo, leading to one of the highest yard-per-reception averages over the last three years in the NFL. Matthews is more of a steady possession receiver.\n\nThat's all the past, though. What about the new homes of these guys?\n\nLet's start with Matthews, who heads to a Buffalo team that has a lot of nice pieces but the mix doesn't feel settled.\n\nShady McCoy will remain a key component of their passing game as well, and we already mentioned Boldin. However, the problem in Buffalo is simple: there doesn't appear to be a vertical threat on the roster.\n\nThe Bills used a second round pick on Zay Jones out of East Carolina this spring, He put up huge numbers at East Carolina (caught an NCAA record 158 passes for 1,746 yards and 8 touchdowns) but his average depth of target was only 8.3 yards. Indeed, the perfect mentors for the rookie might be Boldin and Matthews.\n\nBut who is going to stretch out an opposing defense?\n\nIf we back off the need for a deep threat, though, the reality is that the Bills host three games to open December before traveling to New England and Miami to close out the season. If you've paid attention to professional football in your life, you undoubtedly know that Buffalo isn't a kind place to play once the snow begins to fall; deep threats are great only if you can get the ball to them. Having more consistent receivers will likely be a good thing for the Bills.\n\nOverall Fantasy Impact: Bills\n\nI think the biggest winner in these deals is quarterback Tyrod Taylor. He won't be able to open up the field, but now he has two dependable veteran targets and a good rookie coming to work with. When the weather goes to hell in Buffalo, Taylor should be able to get the ball out quickly and keep the chains moving. Whether or not the Bills can get the ball in the end zone will be something to keep an eye on, though.\n\nLet's look at the situation in LA now, where Watkins will certainly bring some sexy to a team that wasn't lacking in that department.\n\nIn 2016, the Rams used the first overall pick on Jared Goff out of Cal to be the face of the franchise as they moved from St. Louis to LA. Rookie seasons aren't an end-all measuring stick for quarterbacks, but Goff's rookie campaign wasn't very good. He completed under 55 percent of his pass attempts and threw seven touchdowns to only five touchdowns.\n\nBut, again, he was a rookie. And running back Todd Gurley - an emerging young superstar in his own right - was banged up, which put more pressure on Goff and Case Keenum to win games with their arms.\n\nTavon Austin is the biggest threat on the Rams' offense. Watkins has speed to stretch a defense; Austin has Devin Hester-level speed. He's a game-breaker in every way, but the Rams have struggled to find the right role for him. He finished second on the Rams in rushing yards last year (albeit with only 149 yards on the season) and third in receiving yards with only 509.\n\nThe Rams needed real receivers to open up space for Austin.\n\nSo they added... two former Bills.\n\nRobert Woods, who spent the last three seasons playing opposite Watkins in Buffalo, signed in LA earlier in the offseason. The addition of Watkins will likely shift the two back into the roles they played with the Bills, with Woods being more of a possession receiver; Woods had 51 receptions for 613 yards and one touchdown last year.\n\nOverall Fantasy Impact: Rams\n\nTo me, the big winner here is Gurley. Woods, Watkins and Austin is a more interesting mix at the receiver position than the Rams has last year, should present more opportunities for the Ram's quarterback to make big plays, and should open up the field for Gurley. Because the quarterback position is still a mess, Gurley will still need to be the heartbeat of the offense but now there are more options for the ball to get spread out.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T14:02:00Z", "sim": 0.7372549176216125, "source": {"uri": "chicagonow.com", "title": "chicagonow.com", "id": "5828"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "03:32:00", "url": "http://www.chicagonow.com/daily-chicago-sports-tab/2017/08/fantasy-football-breakdown-buffalo-receiver-moves/", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8867695", "image": "http://www.chicagonow.com/daily-chicago-sports-tab/files/2017/08/Sammy-Watkins.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "14:02:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

Virginia Butler\n\n6 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nORCHARD PARK - Let's take a deep breath, exhale, and think about what the Buffalo Bills did Friday afternoon in a rational and thoughtful way.\n\nOn the surface, it was jarring to learn that new general manager Brandon Beane traded away perhaps the most dynamic player on the team, wide receiver Sammy Watkins, not to mention a young starting cornerback, Ronald Darby.\n\nWhen that news hit almost simultaneously around lunch time, Twitter feeds began to erupt and the word I kept seeing was \"Tank!\" All I could do was roll my eyes at the nonsense. I can tell you right now, no team in the NFL truly tries to tank -- not the Jets this year, not the Browns the past couple years, no one -- and the Bills aren't going to become the first.\n\nI smiled when I sat in the Bills media room and watched Beane answer the tank question. \"Everybody is forgetting we signed Anquan (Boldin) last week,\" he said. \"This is not a throw-in-the-towel at all. That's annoying to me. You don't know me if you think I'm throwing in the towel. If I was throwing in the towel, I wouldn't have tried to get a starting receiver back.\"\n\n\u25ba Blockbuster trade for the Bills\n\nWhat Beane did Friday in sending Watkins and a 2018 sixth-round pick to the Los Angeles Rams in exchange for cornerback E.J. Gaines and the Rams' second-round pick in 2018 was a master stroke. And when he traded Darby to Philadelphia for wide receiver Jordan Matthews and the Eagles' third-round pick in 2018, the double-barrel deal looked even better.\n\nLet's break this down: Watkins and Matthews are both eligible for free agency after this season, so their future status in Buffalo basically washes clean. The Bills lose some potential brilliance this season from Watkins (potential being the operative word because he's never been able to approach his high ceiling), but they gain a player in Matthews who has 70 more NFL receptions and has missed only two games in three seasons.\n\nDarby had a fine rookie season, and a rather disappointing second year for Buffalo. Gaines had a fine rookie year in 2014, and after missing all of 2015 with a foot injury, bounced back and played decently in 2016, though. No one is ever going to call him a standout, but he has started 25 NFL games. Will anyone ever be able to call Darby a standout? Maybe, but right now, he certainly isn't.\n\nPlayer for player, on paper, things look pretty equal, and the only wild card is that Watkins is the one man in this group who could go on to become a star, perhaps even this year. If his breakout happens, he'll likely outperform Matthews.\n\nNow, dig deeper and look at what the Bills get in draft currency. They lose a sixth-rounder (who cares?), but they gained a second- and third-round pick. So, not only did they gain immediate on-field replacements, they now have in the bank two picks in each of the first three rounds in 2018.\n\nBeane and coach Sean McDermott are in lockstep on just about everything, and that certainly pertains to the importance of the draft.\n\n\"With the draft picks, that's a big part of planning for the future,\" said McDermott. \"We believe that you build through the draft.\" In echoing those comments, Beane said, \"You have to draft well in this league to win. That helps us to have that kind of currency in the first three rounds, at the prices you pay those guys.\"\n\nBoth men wouldn't touch the Tyrod Taylor question, only to pledge their undying support to him, but what transpired Friday can only be perceived one way: Neither man is sold on Taylor as the long-term answer at quarterback. He was, by far, the best option for 2017, but they know they need to be better at that position and now, with all these early-round picks, they have put themselves in a prime position to be draft-day wheelers and dealers in the pursuit of a high-end quarterback.\n\nAnd hey, if Taylor shocks us all and performs at a Pro Bowl level, maybe they keep him and use all those picks to address the several other needs they have on this roster.\n\nIn the end, the Bills were not a playoff team with Watkins and Darby on the roster, and they aren't with them off the team. That's how you have to look at this.\n\nPut another way, Doug Whaley foolishly thought the Bills were on the cusp of being a playoff team when he made the Watkins trade, a trade I never supported because of what it cost. In making these deals, though he'll never admit it publicly, Beane is correctly assessing that while the Bills aren't a playoff team in 2017, these types of transactions are the steps you take on the road to becoming a playoff team.\n\nIt was a good day for the Bills.\n\nMAIORANA@Gannett.com\n\n6 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T21:18:00Z", "sim": 0.7333333492279053, "source": {"uri": "democratandchronicle.com", "title": "Rochester Democrat and Chronicle", "id": "8075"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "01:26:00", "url": "http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/sports/2017/08/11/buffalo-bills-surprisingly-trade-sammy-watkins-and-ronald-darby/561278001/", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8729409", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/democratandchronicle.png", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "21:18:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

The Buffalo Bills traded their top wide receiver today, and Beane declared that the Bills are not throwing in the towel this season. He might need to clarify a few items in order for #Fans to believe him.\n\nBills wideout Sammy Watkins was traded to the Los Angeles Rams for a 2018 sixth round draft pick and cornerback EJ Gaines. The Bills also sent cornerback Ronald Darby to the Philadelphia Eagles for wide receiver Jordan Matthews and a 2018 third round pick. The trade ensures that the Bills have two picks in the first, second, and third rounds in next year's draft.\n\nThe trade sent a wide receiver that clipped over 1,000 yards receiving in 2015 with nine touchdown passes. The former No. 4 overall draft pick was selected by Buffalo in 2014. Watkins suffered an injury-plagued season a year ago in which he recorded only 430 yards receiving and two touchdown passes. The Bills brought in Matthews who corralled 804 yards receiving last season with three touchdown passes. EJ Gaines will replace Darby in the cornerback position. Neither corners had any interceptions last season, while Darby recorded 13 more tackles.\n\nBeane made comments that the team is not throwing away this season and immediately looking to the future. These comments are problematic as the Bills traded away their best wideout and cornerback in order to receive draft picks.\n\nThe Bills acquired Anquan Boldin this week, and Beane tried to play off that quarterback Tyrod Taylor has plenty of weapons to throw to in Boldin and Mathews. Boldin may be a future hall of famer, but he is turning 37 years old on October 3rd. Watkins is just 24 years old. That's a huge difference, as Boldin only had 584 receiving yards last season.\n\nThe move also brings into question Taylor's job security. Taylor took $10 million less to come back to Buffalo this offseason. The Bills can release him in March before paying him a $6 million bonus which saves the Bills about $18 million in cap space. Taylor also loses his top target in Watkins and will surely see his numbers decline this season.\n\nWatkins was in the final year of his contract, which would make the trade make sense if the Bills did not want to pay him. However, Beane's comments are a sign of #False Hope. The Bills share a division with the New England Patriots who won 14 games, and the Miami Dolphins who won 10 games last season. All signs point to a rebuild, and there is nothing wrong with giving fans that closure for the season.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-10-03", "textEnd": 1706, "textStart": 1695}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T22:28:00Z", "sim": 0.7333333492279053, "source": {"uri": "us.blastingnews.com", "title": "Blasting News", "id": "6890"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "09:41:00", "url": "http://us.blastingnews.com/sports/2017/08/bills-general-manager-should-give-fans-closure-after-watkins-trade-001925693.html", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8772627", "image": "http://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2017/8/12/660x290/b_1433x630/sammy-watkins-bills-at-redskins-122015-keith-allison-flickr-flickrcom_1503971.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "22:28:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

In his three years in Buffalo - the last two in Rex Ryan's run-oriented offense and with multiple quarterbacks - Watkins had 153 catches for 2,459 yards and 17 touchdowns and averaged 16.1 yards per catch. He had over 800 yards in each of his three seasons in Philadelphia, with the Eagles sacrificing him in order to bolster their defense with Darby. The others were Odell Beckham Jr., Mike Evans, A.J. Green and Randy Moss.\n\n\"But we're just trying to figure out the best way to build this team and be competitive - not only during the regular season but hopefully one day to win playoff games and get even further than that\". When you pull the trigger on anything like this, you think about the player you're giving up and the draft pick. \"It goes to the player that we got, the position that we're acquiring and how hard it is to find those guys\". The young corner has 137 tackles, two interceptions, and 33 pass breakups in the last two years.\n\nHe joins a secondary that lacks top-notch cornerbacks. Patrick Robinson and Jalen Mills sat atop the depth chart before the deal, with Ron Brooks as the favorite to man the slot. Rookie Rasul Douglas is still learning on the fly and second round selection Sidney Jones may not play in 2017 as he recovers from an injury.\n\nBut what about Austin, the fifth-year receiver who signed a massive new contract last year?\n\n\"There's no insurance on any of these things\", Roseman said.\n\nRoseman touted Hollins on Friday as \"tremendously consistent, a big kid with really good speed\".\n\nEven before Matthews was traded, Jeffery was projected to be this team's No. 1 wide receiver, and that certainly remains the case following Friday's deal. Gaines and a 2018 second-round pick. People ask about different players all the time; you never know what's serious or just bait. They become the eighth and ninth players since June 1 that the Ravens have lost for the year because of injury, suspension or retirement.\n\nBy trading Matthews, 25, the Eagles lost one of their locker room leaders, however.\n\nFans will remember how you were the one who caught the first ever touchdown pass of Carson Wentz, marking the start of a new era for the Eagles.\n\nThe control over a young player was important to Roseman in the trade.\n\nSo for the final time, thank you, Jordan Matthews.\n\nBut that Hollins ramble represented the other part of the equation - the part that made de facto general manager Howie Roseman comfortable enough to trade away the sixth player in National Football League history to catch at least 65 passes for at least 800 yards in each of his first three National Football League seasons, since the Eagles drafted him in the second round from Vanderbilt in 2014.\n\nThe Bills originally took Darby, a product of Florida State, off the board in the second round of the 2015 draft. Darby has two years remaining on his contract. Something has got to give, and it's got to be Matthews playing on the perimeter. And in talking to Rams personnel, they don't view this as a one-year pickup but rather a chance to add a young, dynamic talent they hope is a big part of their future.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-06-01", "textEnd": 2018, "textStart": 2012}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T14:52:00Z", "sim": 0.729411780834198, "source": {"uri": "expressnewsline.com", "title": "expressnewsline.com", "id": "18917"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "20:05:00", "url": "http://expressnewsline.com/2017/08/12/projecting-eagles-wr-depth-chart-after-jordan-matthews-trade.html", "storyUri": "eng-3355470", "id": "8838408", "image": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "14:52:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

A second-round draft pick out of Vanderbilt in 2014, the 42nd player taken overall, Matthews made 225 catches for 2,673 yards and 19 touchdowns. The Birds will hope to get that kind of production now from Nelson Agholor, who will likely take over Matthews' role in the slot.\n\nIt was evident that the Birds needed help at corner. Darby, who is 5-11, 195, is just 23-years-old. He, like Matthews, was a former second-round pick, the 50th player taken overall in 2015 after having played at Florida State. In his rookie season two years ago, he had two interceptions, but none last year. He has made 29 career starts during his two seasons, collecting 61 tackles as a rookie and 60 last season.\n\nIn the first game of his pro career, Darby intercepted Indianapolis' Andrew Luck.\n\nThe Eagles perceive their receiver group to be a strength now, after signing Alshon Jeffery and Torrey Smith during the offseason. They also drafted Mack Hollins and Shelton Gibson. Hollins had a strong game in the Birds' 24-9 loss in the preseason opener to the Packers on Thursday night as did Bryce Treggs. Additionally, Greg Ward and Marcus Johnson are having strong camps.\n\nMatthews caught three passes for 18 yards against Green Bay.\n\nInterestingly, the Bills and Eagles will play each other Thursday night in their second preseason game.\n\nEnjoying our content?

The Bills, under new management in 2017, just announced blockbuster trades on both sides of the football.\n\nThe team, which recently declined star WR Sammy Watkins' fifth-year option, traded the fourth-overall pick in the 2014 NFL Draft to the Los Angeles Rams. In return, Buffalo receives the services of a quality starting cornerback, fourth-year veteran E.J. Gaines, and a second-round pick in 2018.\n\nBut the team wasn't done, as it also announced it was moving starting cornerback (and budding star) Ronald Darby to Philadelphia in return for WR Jordan Matthews and a third-round pick in 2018.\n\nSo to review, the Bills traded Sammy Watkins and Ronald Darby for veterans E.J. Gaines and Jordan Matthews, while gaining second- and third-round picks in next year's NFL draft.\n\nThis string of moves suggests that Bills management is moving swiftly to ensure coach Sean McDermott has all of the ammunition he needs to load up on players that fit his system in the future. When adding on the Bills trading back in order to allow the Kansas City Chiefs to land QB Patrick Mahomes last April, Buffalo now holds two selections in each of the first three rounds next spring.\n\nThe team has to be thrilled with it's allocation of resources, but for the coming season, they're meaningless. Gaines and Matthews are quality football players. But they are not the same caliber of athletes as the players they are replacing. Nor do they bring the same level of game-changing ability. The Bills have flipped perhaps the two biggest chess pieces on their roster and replaced then with quality role players.\n\nThese personnel decisions were not made with the present in mind. The same cannot be said for their partners, the Rams and the Eagles.\n\nThe Rams suddenly tout an impressive wide receiver group, with sophomore QB Jared Goff finding himself with a number of new toys. Watkins will step in as the alpha of a group that features rookies Cooper Kupp, Josh Reynolds and Gerald Everett and recently signed Robert Woods. It's a completely re-worked group and one that is a massive upgrade over last season.\n\n(Photo by Rich Graessle/Icon Sportswire)\n\nWhile Goff's arm strength doesn't necessarily lend itself well to pushing the ball down the field to Watkins, the Clemson product will do well as a run-after-catch target and possesses the route running and suddenness to get open underneath.\n\nPhiladelphia has to be thrilled with how this trade changes its 2017 outlook. The team had a problem at the slot receiver position: both Matthews and 2015 first-round pick Nelson Agholor are most effective from the slot. With Matthews shipped out to Buffalo, the log jam for the middle-of-the field receiver has been cleared. And in return, the Eagles bring back a high-end starter in Darby. Darby will immediately be the best cornerback on the roster and be a Day 1 starter.\n\nBut while this trade has implications for all parties and their respective divisions (should we just give the Patriots a bye now?), there appears to be a seismic shift taking place in Buffalo. The team appears content to take its lumps in 2017, particularly on the offensive side of the ball. The team's top three targets now? Rookie Zay Jones, long-time veteran Anquan Boldin and the previously mentioned Matthews.\n\nBoldin and Matthews are cut from the same cloth, and the Bills are likely to find themselves in a similar quandary to what the Philadelphia Eagles faced just several hours ago: many of their pass catchers are best suited to play the same role in the offense. And who is going to be the downfield beneficiary of QB Tyrod Taylor's big-play mentality?\n\nThe answer figures to be Jones. But wide receivers frequently face a steep transition period when joining the ranks of the NFL. And while Jones is a great athlete, there's no guarantee he's going to grasp the nuances of NFL route running to assimilate quickly as a featured receiver. Defensively, the Bills' changes will be less harsh, but a difficult season lies ahead nonetheless.\n\nMcDermott has always had speed on the second level. Buffalo is transitioning out of a traditional 3-4 defense, which has more down-hill gap plugging linebackers. There's some dissonance there between personnel and ideologies that could pose a problem.\n\nThe Bills have made their intentions very clear with their moves on Friday: they're playing the long game. A rapid youth movement is underway as the team loads up to saturate its roster with high draft picks next season.\n\nOr perhaps the Bills have their eyes on installing \"one of their own\" at another position with all of this ammunition. They have been very shaky in their commitment to Taylor ever since he stepped into the starting role. With six selections in the first three rounds next year, perhaps the Bills have their eyes set on trying to move for one big fish instead of six fresh ones.\n\nEither way, times of change are here in Buffalo. For as sudden as the changes came on Friday, let it be known now that there's no end in sight.\n\nMORE COVERAGE: Anquan Boldin getting warm reception with Buffalo Buffalo needs Marcell Dareus to return to his 2015 form What does a successful season look like for Buffalo?

The three-way deal that technically wasn't a three-way deal can be a win-win-win for all sides. The Eagles and Rams greatly improved their biggest weaknesses without giving up too much. These weren't traditional \"win-now\" moves by Philadelphia or Buffalo because Darby has two years left on his rookie deal and Watkins, who turned 24 in June, could be retained by the franchise tag in 2018 if the Rams can't reach a long-term deal with him.\n\nThe Bills are taking the biggest risk because talented young players are hard to find, and the 2017 Buffalo squad is now worse. Acquiring receiver Jordan Matthews from Philadelphia and cornerback E.J. Gaines from the Rams allows the Bills to tell fans they aren't giving up on this season, but this move is all about the future for a team in transition. Bills general manager Brandon Beane and head coach Sean McDermott didn't see Watkins or Darby as long-term fits and now look to the 2018 draft as the key moment to remake the organization in their image.\n\nThere's a lot to get into, so let's break down all the winners and losers of the trades below:\n\nJared Goff, Rams quarterback: The most striking takeaway from visiting Rams training camp was the team's lack of deep speed. The first week of camp was partly defined by a lack of big plays, with Robert Woods the closest thing the Rams had to a vertical receiver. That's not Woods' strength, and the acquisition of Watkins will allow Woods to do what he does best as a possession \"X\" receiver while Watkins tries to take the top off defenses deep.\n\nThe entire Rams receiver group makes more sense with Watkins in the No. 1 role, Woods sliding to No. 2, impressive rookie receiver Cooper Kupp in the slot and Tavon Austin floating in the abyss. Now it's up to Goff to prove he can complete deep throws, something that he didn't show as a rookie.\n\nGeneral manager Howie Roseman knew that a top cornerback trio of Jalen Mills, Patrick Robinson and Ron Brooks would struggle to hold up over the course of the season. The Eagles have struggled to draft difference-making cornerbacks for years, and Darby is a proven commodity. Pro Football Focus' Defensive Rookie of the Year in 2015, Darby is an incredible value with only $1.3 million combined due over the next two seasons. To put it another way: Darby outplayed Stephon Gilmore for two straight seasons, and Gilmore earned the highest guarantees of any free agent this year.\n\nThat contract is one reason why the Eagles had to give up a third-round pick in addition to Jordan Matthews to make the trade work, but I believe it's worth it because of how well Darby should fit into coordinator Jim Schwartz's system.\n\nNelson Agholor and Daniel Jeremiah: The trade especially made sense for the Eagles because they were able to fill a major position of need by giving up a guy who already appeared to be the odd man out of a revamped receiving corps. Agholor, the team's first-round pick in 2015, was poised to take much of Matthews' work in the slot. The Eagles also have seen youngsters Mack Hollins and Marcus Johnson emerge in camp.\n\nNFL Network's Daniel Jeremiah foresaw something like this happening when he predicted last week that Agholor was going to take over the slot position in Philadelphia, leaving Matthews with an uncertain future. Matthews hit out against Jeremiah after that take, but it turned out DJ knew what he was talking about.\n\nKayvon Webster, Rams cornerback: Rams defensive coordinator Wade Phillips told me at training camp that he liked his cornerback group more than outside observers, noting it is deeper than people think. This trade spoke to that confidence. E.J. Gaines was competing to start in L.A. and will likely start for the Bills.\n\nGaines' removal from the Rams opens up the starting job for Kayvon Webster, a little-known former Broncos cornerback who Phillips made sure to bring with him to the West Coast. Phillips believes Webster has matured as a pro and is ready to make a big impact after shining in limited work behind the best cornerback trio in football in Denver.\n\nBills fans: The plan is always changing. Beane and McDermott should not be punished for the sins of former Bills leaders, but that doesn't make it any easier for a loyal fanbase that is always believing the best in this organization without getting much return. The team gave up two first-round picks and a fourth-rounder to acquire Watkins back in 2014, and now he was dealt for pennies on the dollar.\n\nDarby looked like the next big thing in Buffalo under Rex Ryan in 2015, and now both men are out of town. It's hard to blame Bills fans for growing tired of buying jerseys or buying sales jobs from new regimes. It's up to Beane and McDermott to prove they are different.\n\nTyrod Taylor, Bills quarterback: Already in a difficult \"prove-it\" year with this new staff, Taylor just lost his only real deep threat. Matthews and recent free-agent pickup Anquan Boldin are best out of the slot. Rookie Zay Jones is more of a possession receiver type. It's hard to imagine this passing game having a lot of cohesion early in the season, and now the Bills front office has a lot of draft ammunition to find its quarterback of the future in 2018.\n\nTavon Austin, Rams receiver: Paid like a No. 1 receiver, Austin now appears relegated to a No. 4 job with the occasional end around or trick play mixed in. That's probably the role he's suited for, but the team's insistence this offseason that Austin could turn into a deep threat now sounds like wishful thinking. He has barely practiced this offseason following shoulder surgery and a training camp hamstring pull, which may have pushed the Rams to make this move. Austin doesn't make for a logical trade candidate because no team will want his contract, which has no guarantees after 2017.\n\nRams' future salary cap space: It's hard to imagine Austin with the Rams next season, in large part because general manager Les Snead is going to need to find cap space. The team already is strapped with commitments and needs to fit in a contract for holdout defensive tackle Aaron Donald and presumably a massive contract for new No. 1 wideout Sammy Watkins. The agent for Watkins knows he has great leverage in talks with the Rams, because the team does not want to give up such a high-draft pick on a one-year rental for a player.\n\nAlready short on draft picks because of the trade to acquire Jared Goff, dealing away a valuable second-round pick reduces the Rams' flexibility next year. The Rams will be highly motivated to make this Watkins acquisition work, with the honeymoon period in Los Angeles for coach Sean McVay and Goff growing ever shorter. This is a trade intended to help the Rams make noise starting now.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T18:01:00Z", "sim": 0.7254902124404907, "source": {"uri": "nfl.com", "title": "NFL.com", "id": "5624"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "20:53:00", "url": "http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000828634/article/winners-and-losers-of-bills-trades-with-rams-eagles", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8699629", "image": "http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/photo/2017/08/11/0ap3000000828639_thumbnail_200_150.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "18:01:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

With the preseason opener back on Thursday, the off-day gives the Bills a chance to recover before taking on the final week of training camp.\n\nWith two massive trades on Friday, the off-day became another day to process and mull over the future of the Buffalo Bills.\n\nGeneral Manager Brandon Beane shipped wide receiver Sammy Watkins to the Los Angeles Rams for defensive back E.J. Gaines and a 2nd round pick in 2018. Tag-teamming that deal was a separate move to send defensive back Ronald Darby to the Philadelphia Eagles for wide receiver Jordan Matthews and a 3rd round pick in 2018.\n\nAs it currently stands, the Bills hold two draft picks in each of the first three rounds of next year's draft.\n\nWatkins landed in LA on Saturday afternoon and was on the sideline for the Rams preseason game against the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nHe joins the Rams after the previous front office regime spent two 1st round picks on the star wideout in the 2014 draft. The last two years have been marred by multiple foot surgeries for Watkins. The Bills also declined the 5th-year option on his rookie contract earlier this year, making him a free agent after the 2017 season. Watkins says he feels no ill will toward the Bills after this trade.\n\n\"Nah, it's a business,\" said Watkins to the Los Angeles media. \"I'm in LA. I can't wait to get started honestly. It's a blessing to be here. Being in LA can help me out, nice weather, and to be in this city with these players, trying to chase a goal and win championships and go to the playoffs.\"\n\nDarby arrived in Philadelphia in time to watch his new team practice Saturday morning. He joins an Eagles team in dire need of help in the secondary. The 2-year starter in Buffalo will also join former teammates Corey Graham and Ron Brooks.\n\nWith Stephon Gilmore now on the New England Patriots, Darby stood a good chance of being the Bills top defensive back for the season opener. Now he heads to a division with superstar wide receivers like Dez Bryant and Odell Beckham Jr.\n\n\"It was fast. i just heard i was getting traded,\" said Darby after the Eagles practice. \"Close my eyes, open them, I'm on a plane. Close my eyes, open them, I'm laying down in a hotel, and now I'm out here, so everything's been moving real fast.\"\n\nThe Bills will gather again at St. John Fisher College in Pittsford for a training camp session on Sunday at 2:15pm.

that sent wide receiver Jordan Matthews and a 2018 third-round draft pick to Buffalo was, in theory, in the works since the 2016 season as the Eagles watched an offense that lacked weapons around franchise quarterback Carson Wentz and a Jim Schwartz defense bogged down without reliable cornerbacks.\n\nIn theory, that is. The actual trade that went down on Friday was in the works for a matter of days, or however many conversations it took for Howie Roseman to get a deal done.\n\nKnow this, though: From the day the Eagles drafted Wentz, they knew they needed to be a whole lot better around him. And on the other side of the ball, all of the pressure in the world from an aggressive front four couldn't cover up the fact that, pun intended, the Eagles needed more from the cornerback group.\n\n\"There's one football, right. I think we look at the skill-position groups as a whole. So we're looking at the wide receiver position, we're looking at the tight end position, we're looking at the running back position,\" Roseman said. \"And certainly, when we're making a trade like this, we're looking at those groups as well when we're letting go of a tremendously productive guy who played a ton of snaps and who has a ton of targets.\n\n\"When we went into it, we wanted to come out of the offseason with an improved offensive line, an improved defensive line, improved weapons around Carson, and certainly to address the corner position in a draft that we thought was unique at that spot.\n\n\"We weren't necessarily confident that we would be able to do all of that. We still sit here with a lot of things that we would like to do, but just seeing those guys on the field sometimes we're encouraged by the progress, encouraged by a lot of those guys that we brought in here, the chemistry of the group.\"\n\nGiving up Matthews and a third-round pick for Darby, who is only 23 years old with two years left on his contract and who two seasons ago was considered, in the midst of a fantastic rookie season, one of the rising, young stars of the position, is a significant price. The Eagles traded away their 2018 second-round draft pick in the Wentz trade prior to the 2016 NFL Draft and now they've dealt their third-round pick. They have an extra fourth-round selection from New England in the deal that sent cornerback Eric Rowe to the Patriots that becomes a third-round pick should Rowe play 50 percent of the Patriots' defensive snaps this season.\n\nBut, as Roseman said on Friday, you can't get value in this league without giving up value and that's the deal here. With Matthews gone, the Eagles will see who takes advantage of the opening. Does Nelson Agholor, who did not have a strong preseason game on Thursday night after a really good spring and summer, emerge? Does Bryce Treggs, who has come on in a big way the last couple of weeks in camp and in the preseason opener, continue to develop? Remember, the Eagles were high on Treggs when they claimed him off of waivers last summer from San Francisco.\n\nAdding Alshon Jeffery and Torrey Smith in free agency and then selecting Mack Hollins and Shelton Gibson in the draft are obvious reasons the wide receiver group has improved so much, but let's be just as fair and say that the internal improvement of players like Agholor, Treggs, and Marcus Johnson play into the equation. New wide receivers coach Mike Groh has done a terrific job with his room. The Eagles have an abundance of young talent at wide receiver after a 2016 season during which they were among the highest in the league in dropped passes and among the lowest in the league, 31st to be exact, in receiving yards at wide receiver.\n\nAnd, as Roseman said, it's important to factor into the equation the versatility the tight end group brings. Zach Ertz and Trey Burton are going to catch a lot of passes this year. Running back Darren Sproles is going to be involved a lot in the passing game. The Eagles have options in the passing game, and they're not afraid to use them.\n\nAt cornerback, well, it was obvious the Eagles needed some immediate help. The book on Darby is that he's got rare speed for the position and that, while he isn't a physically imposing player, he's going to play big and cover well. At 23, he teams well with a young core that includes Jalen Mills (23), C.J. Smith (24), Rasul Douglas (22 in August), and Sidney Jones (21), who is recovering from Achilles tendon surgery and will not, repeat, will not, be rushed back this season. Veteran Patrick Robinson is here on a one-year contract and he played well in the preseason opener at Green Bay.\n\nRoseman isn't finished with the roster. He's a wheeler and a dealer and he's going to keep looking. But just think about how far this team has come since the trade that put the Eagles in position to take Wentz No. 2 overall in the '16 draft. There is some really promising talent throughout the roster, young players who are getting good coaching and improving and emerging and building a foundation with some long-term veterans who are still highly productive on the field.\n\nThe Eagles gave up something on Friday in the form of a consistent, hard-working, and very well-liked and admired young veteran in Matthews and a valuable third-round draft pick in 2018 to get their hands on a two-year starter at cornerback who is a quality starting cornerback in this league. The Eagles are a better team right now than they were a day prior.\n\nAll of the pieces added to the existing roster are fitting right in like a puzzle that should stay together, for the most part, for many years to come.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T19:12:00Z", "sim": 0.7254902124404907, "source": {"uri": "philadelphiaeagles.com", "title": "philadelphiaeagles.com", "id": "5290"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "20:06:00", "url": "http://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/news/dave-spadaro/article-1/Darby-Another-Young-Piece-Added-To-Core/ea1e0261-63f9-463c-98e9-024266e3a981?campaign=phi:fanshare:facebook", "storyUri": "eng-3355470", "id": "8693476", "image": "http://prod.static.eagles.clubs.nfl.com//assets/images/imported/PHI/photos/spadaro-column-headshot/580x400-EaglesInsider.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "19:12:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

While trying their best to get ready for the upcoming season, the Bills shocked the NFL world on Friday by announcing two blockbuster trades that immediately changes the course of the upcoming season and beyond.\n\nThe nuts and bolts of it:\n\nThe Bills traded away wide receiver Sammy Watkins to the Los Angeles Rams, cornerback Ronald Darby to the Philadelphia Eagles, and a sixth-round pick in 2018 to the Rams as well.\n\nIn return, the Bills have received wide receiver Jordan Matthews, cornerback E.J. Gaines, a second-round pick from the Rams in 2018, and a third-round pick from the Eagles in 2018.\n\nThere is a lot to digest here, trying to figure out what the vision is both for the short and the long-term of the Buffalo Bills. It's something we've heard about time and time again from head coach Sean McDermott and general manager Brandon Beane over the last several months.\n\nAnd now, we've got our first #BeaneBomb which challenges us to figure out what the principles of each really are. So, here's my read:\n\nThe Bills are now all in on building for the future.\n\nThrough the entirety of the offseason, the core names have mostly remained the same for the Bills -- Tyrod Taylor, LeSean McCoy, Richie Incognito, Eric Wood, Kyle Williams, Marcell Dareus... but past those normal stalwarts, all we saw was a complete overhaul of the bottom two-thirds of the roster.\n\nThe Bills gave us a little hint of what could have been on the horizon with the Watkins and the Darby trades with what they did on draft day by acquiring an additional first round selection for 2018 -- perhaps as future ammo -- to what their true intentions really were. And with Taylor essentially being on a one-year prove it deal, while both Wood and Kyle Williams are on the final year of their contract, the complete overhaul into the future is also knocking on the door.\n\nNow, before we get into the individual players gained and lost in the deals, let's first analyze exactly the assets that the Bills now have in their holster, and what they can potentially do with those draft picks.\n\nSo, with the two trades today, this gives the Bills a really fun first three, maybe even four rounds of the 2018 NFL Draft. Here's the current stable of picks:\n\nTwo first-round picks, theirs and Kansas City's. Two second-round picks, theirs and that of the Los Angeles Rams. Two third-round picks, theirs and Philadelphia's. Plus, if they cut wide receiver Andre Holmes, defensive end Ryan Davis, and guard Vladimir Ducasse, it can bring them an additional third-round compensatory selection. And, if they take it a step further and cut either fullback Patrick DiMarco or kicker Stephen Hauschka in addition to those initial three cuts, they can obtain another potential fourth round pick.\n\nIf they do all of that, it would give them a whopping nine picks within the first four rounds of the draft. If they only go for the first level of compensatory picks, it will likely give them seven picks in the first three rounds. If they go for none of the compensatory options, they're still sitting pretty with seven selections in the first four rounds.\n\nThis brings just about the ultimate flexibility for Beane, McDermott, and the Bills.\n\nNow, the Bills have the ammo to significantly reshape their roster with the type of players, and people, that they want in the locker room for 2018 and beyond. If one of those two first-round picks ends up being a really high pick in the draft, the Bills have their franchise quarterback, and perhaps some ammo to get to the top of the order as well by way of multiple picks.\n\nNow, let's say both Buffalo and Kansas City both have an average to above-average year. With the ability now to deal compensatory selections, the Bills could potentially have nine picks to get up to whichever selection they need to in the draft order to take the franchise quarterback they so covet and even have themselves covered to add to the rest of the roster along the way.\n\nThey could literally pay a king's ransom to finally address the franchise quarterback position, and still have a normal draft. That, in itself, is worth its weight in gold to the Bills and their desire to build for both the short and long-term.\n\nLast year, if you'll recall, I wrote that in the current state of the Bills roster, draft picks, and cap space, that I'd rather be in the position the Cleveland Browns were in rather than what Rex Ryan, Doug Whaley, and company had going on. As it turns out, it seems Sean McDermott, Brandon Beane and the new wave of the Bills tends to agree.\n\nFlexibility is everything in the NFL when you're trying to build a roster, and the Bills just bought themselves a whole heaping amount of it.\n\nNow, let's get to the players involved.\n\nThe Bills dealt two young and talented players that show a lot of promise and potential, but also have gone through their share of adversity along the way. For Watkins, it was the concerns over an injury, and for Darby, it was all about his up-and-down play from one year to the next.\n\nWe'll start with Watkins, who is by far one of the most naturally talented players I've ever seen play football in person. The guy, when fully healthy, is one of the smoothest players going. To me, the only way you can deal a player with that type of potential is if you are getting a substantial sum in return, and it appears that's what the Bills did.\n\nWith only 16 games left on his current contract, a newfound but somewhat murky clean bill of health, and the potential for him to sign a mega contract in the coming offseason, the Bills weren't going to get a first round selection in return for Watkins. They did, however, maximize all the value they could get on him with his present situation with a second-round pick, got a potential starting player in return, and in a separate trade, replenished the wide receiver spot.\n\nThe short and long-term building personified.\n\nThe Darby trade was the biggest win of the two for the Bills -- at least it was to me. Darby was a revelation in his rookie season but then benched in his second season by the same coach that praised him so outwardly. Don't forget, this is a player that has been a man-to-man cover corner for basically the duration of his college and professional career, and one that they were trying to force into the starting lineup of a zone coverage schemed defense.\n\nStill, Darby has two years left on his current contract, is much more valuable to the type of defense the Eagles are running and yielded a huge lump sum in return. The Bills find themselves with a bonafide starting receiver in the NFL, and a third-round pick to boot. That trade, considering the lack of vision for Darby in the Bills current defensive system, could have been the biggest heist of the day for them.\n\nAs for those players they brought to Buffalo?\n\nShort-term players with only one year left on their current contract and with a cap hit of under $2 million each, that could turn into long-term options -- if the Bills like what they see in the 2017 season, that is.\n\nYeah, I'd say the Bills are living up to what they've been preaching.\n\nWith Matthews, he'll jump into the starting lineup and provide them with a real clean bill of health, and the versatility to line up both outside the numbers and in the slot -- much like what they've got with both Anquan Boldin and Zay Jones, too. Don't get me wrong, there is a big drop-off in pure talent from Watkins to Matthews -- and there will be some frustrating concentration drops with Matthews -- but they still have a starting caliber option for the team in 2017.\n\nAs for Gaines, the Bills receive a starting caliber player, and an experienced starter, that will feel much more at home in McDermott's zone-based scheme. He did not grade well on ProFootballFocus.com in 2016 while a member of the Gregg Williams defense in Los Angeles but did in his rookie season in 2014.\n\nBoth Matthews and Gaines are 25, and if they impress, could probably be brought back at a manageable salary if all goes well for them in Buffalo.\n\nTo put a line under all of this, I really, really liked the moves.\n\nThe Bills weren't lying when they said they wanted to build for both now and for later because that's exactly what they've done. And even if you don't like that Watkins or Darby has been dealt, or even if you aren't crazy about Matthews or Gaines, this is all underscored by a bigger point:\n\nIn today's NFL, unless you have the franchise quarterback in place, you're basically just spinning your wheels in the snow while stuck at a green light. With the moves they made today, the Bills now have themselves in a position to address the very thing that Bills fans have been clamoring for years on end.\n\nBy this time next year, we could be sitting here and analyzing the top flight quarterback the Bills just picked up in the 2018 NFL Draft.\n\nAnd to me, there's no beating that -- no matter who gets dealt.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T16:59:00Z", "sim": 0.7254902124404907, "source": {"uri": "wkbw.com", "title": "WKBW", "id": "2037"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "20:26:00", "url": "http://www.wkbw.com/sports/bills/watkins-deal-stuns-the-masses-but-its-clear-now-the-buffalo-bills-are-all-in-on-the-future", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8695938", "image": "http://media2.wkbw.com/photo/2015/05/21/watkins_1432225720421_18616579_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "16:59:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

However, the Eagles overhauled the wide receiver group this offseason between a new position coach in Mike Groh and players in both free agency (Alshon Jeffery, Torrey Smith) and the draft (Mack Hollins, Shelton Gibson).\n\nOn the other, he was presented with an opportunity to bolster a young cornerback group that could grow and develop together. The Eagles invested a 2016 late-round pick in Jalen Mills that has paid off. This year, both second-day selections were used on the position in Sidney Jones and Rasul Douglas.\n\nThe Buffalo Bills offered Ronald Darby, a 23-year-old former second-round pick with 29 starts in his first two seasons. Darby was the runner-up in the NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year vote in 2015. But Roseman and the Eagles would have to part with Matthews, who is also well-respected in the locker room, and a 2018 draft pick in return.\n\nRoseman agreed to the deal and it was officially announced Friday afternoon.\n\n\"This was a unique opportunity. We were not shopping Jordan Matthews,\" Roseman said.\n\n\"You look around the league and it is a corner-deficient league. It's hard to find those guys. It's hard to find guys who have been solid starters in the league and can play at a high level and teams that have them aren't really ready to move them.\"\n\nDarby is now a part of the youth movement at cornerback with Mills (23 years old), Jones (21 years old), Douglas (almost 22 years old), and second-year corner C.J. Smith (24 years old).\n\n\"He's got rare speed,\" Roseman said of Darby. \"His production on the ball, he doesn't have a high interception number, but his (pass breakup) number is incredibly high. He's played a variety of coverages. He won a National Championship at FSU.\"\n\nIn scouting Darby, Roseman specifically pointed out how the Bills played the NFC East in 2015. The Eagles saw how the new cornerback fared against some of the receivers they will see twice a season. Darby has 32 pass breakups and two interceptions in his career.\n\nThink back to the successful Eagles teams of the 2000s. Troy Vincent and Bobby Taylor were the starting corners before giving way to Lito Sheppard and Sheldon Brown, and then Brown and Asante Samuel. The Eagles have invested the resources to cultivate a deep, talented backfield for years to come.\n\n\"We're just trying to figure out the best way to build our team to consistently compete and a big part of that is trying to get the corner position right for the long term,\" Roseman said. \"That really was the genesis of this trade.\"", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T20:25:00Z", "sim": 0.7176470756530762, "source": {"uri": "philadelphiaeagles.com", "title": "philadelphiaeagles.com", "id": "5290"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "23:46:00", "url": "http://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/news/article-1/In-A-Corner-Deficient-League-Howie-Roseman-Seizes-Opportunity-To-Add-Ronald-Darby/5f55a8fd-5ab6-48d1-9bc2-1288a9260f0f?campaign=phi:fanshare:facebook", "storyUri": "eng-3355470", "id": "8720681", "image": "http://prod.static.eagles.clubs.nfl.com//assets/images/imported/PHI/photos/app_thumbnails/2017/Darby_Ronald_3_580App_081117.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "20:25:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

Now, because of a trade the team made on Friday afternoon that saw Watkins shipped to the Los Angeles Rams, they won't be seeing him at all.\n\nIn exchange for Watkins, the Bills received E.J. Gaines, a cornerback who is gearing up for his third season in the NFL. Buffalo also received a second round draft pick in the deal while giving up a sixth round pick.\n\nIn an effort to replace Watkins, the Bills quickly traded starting cornerback Ronald Darby to the Philadelphia Eagles in exchange for Jordan Matthews, a receiver that was selected in the second round of the 2014 NFL Draft.\n\nThe team made two huge trades seemingly within a few seconds of one another, sending their fan base into a frenzy. Many Buffalo supporters are already claiming that the team is \"tanking.\"\n\nHowever, the team isn't tanking. In fact, Matthews could potentially make a huge impact in the Bills' passing game, making fans forget about Watkins before long.\n\nYes, Watkins is an extremely talented receiver who, when healthy, is one of the best in the league at the position. However, the problem with Watkins is that he's not always healthy.\n\nThe former Clemson Tiger missed half of the 2016 season with a nagging foot injury, an ailment that cost him three games in the 2015 season. While Watkins claims that his foot his 100% healed, that won't be proven until he takes the field for the first time in the regular season.\n\nMatthews, however, has been able to stay healthy throughout his three-year career. The 25-year-old didn't miss a single game throughout his first two seasons in the NFL, and missed just two games in the 2016 campaign.\n\nMatthews has been extremely productive over his first few years in the league, as well. Entering his fourth season, the former Vanderbilt wideout has 225 receptions for 2,673 yards and 19 touchdowns under his belt. Statistically speaking, Matthews is a more effective receiver than Watkins, who has caught 153 passes for nearly 2,500 yards throughout his career.\n\nWill Matthews be able to effectively replace Watkins' in the 2017 season? This is a bit of a loaded question, as the two players specialize in different roles. Watkins is an extremely talented No. 1 receiver who shines on the outside. Matthews, however, is primarily a slot receiver who is effective in the middle of the field.\n\nIn fact, according to Pro Football Focus, Matthews is the NFL's leading slot receiver over the past three seasons.\n\nThe Bills have added the NFL's leading slot receiver over the past three seasonshttps://t.co/iaGAijp01j pic.twitter.com/bUNP8xXbpA\n\n-- Pro Football Focus (@PFF) August 11, 2017\n\nWhile Buffalo no longer has a bonafide receiving threat on the outside, they've added a reliable pair of hands for quarterback Tyrod Taylor in the middle of the field by adding one of the NFL's best slot receivers. Watkins' absence will give also potentially allow rookie Zay Jones to step up and claim the first spot on the team's depth chart at receiver far earlier than anyone expected him to.\n\nWhile Matthews won't necessarily replace Watkins in terms of role, he'll replace him in terms of production. Barring any injuries or unforeseen circumstances, Matthews will likely finish the 2017 season as the Bills' leading receiver. The wideout caught 73 passes in his rookie season, 85 passes in his sophomore outing, and 67 passes in 2016 - numbers that would have led Buffalo in that statistic in each of those years.\n\nWhile fans are still shocked that Watkins is no longer a Bill, they managed to find a pretty solid replacement in Matthews. While he won't be starting against opposing team's primary cornerbacks, he'll still be a productive receiver who will likely stay healthy for Buffalo. The Bills could have done much worse.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-08-11", "textEnd": 2704, "textStart": 2689}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T19:13:00Z", "sim": 0.7176470756530762, "source": {"uri": "billswire.usatoday.com", "title": "Bills Wire", "id": "19299"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "10:03:00", "url": "http://billswire.usatoday.com/2017/08/11/can-new-bills-wr-jordan-matthews-effectively-replace-sammy-watkins/", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8775108", "image": "https://usatbillswire.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/usatsi_9674461.jpg?w=640", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "19:13:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

After the Kansas City Chiefs moved up to draft Patrick Mahomes, the team sent a first-round pick to the Bills. Now the team has multiple selections in each of the first three rounds, and decided that Watkins and Darby will not be part of that long-term rebuilding effort.\n\nFor Watkins, the reason is obvious. He struggled to stay on the field and has continued to deal with nagging injuries since his rookie season. With a strong showing in the team's preseason opener, the Bills likely thought it was their final chance to get good value for him with free agency on the way in 2018.\n\nThe trade of Darby is a little more surprising, but is likely tied to the addition of Sean McDermott as Buffalo's head coach. As defensive coordinator of the Carolina Panthers, McDermott valued length in outside cornerbacks. The team drafted Tre'Davious White in the first round to give them that, but Darby didn't as much.\n\nGetting Matthews and Gaines means the team doesn't have a disaster at either position, but the coup of the deals for the Bills were the draft picks. The team was already a long shot to compete much in 2017, so losing Watkins and Darby doesn't tank any Super Bowl hopes.\n\nMatthews and Gaines are enough to keep the boat afloat, though.\n\nPhiladelphia drafted Matthews in the second round for the 2014 NFL Draft, and he's been a decent receiver for the Eagles ever since. He's hauled in 225 passes for 2,673 yards and 19 touchdowns in three season, but may have been phased out of the Philadelphia offense soon.\n\nPhiladelphia signed receiver Alshon Jeffery in the offseason, so it already has a No. 1 receiver to help quarterback Carson Wentz progress. With Nelson Agholor impressing in training camp, Eagles offensive coordinator Frank Reich didn't deny that Matthews could see reduced playing time to the former first-round pick.\n\nNow Matthews has a chance for a one-year audition with the Bills before he becomes a free agent in 2018. With the team focused on the future, he and Gaines will have to prove they're long-term pieces to stick around for a while.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T17:40:00Z", "sim": 0.7176470756530762, "source": {"uri": "sbnation.com", "title": "SB Nation", "id": "962"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "17:44:00", "url": "https://www.sbnation.com/2017/8/11/16135102/sammy-watkins-ronald-darby-trade-buffalo-bills-rebuilding-2018-nfl-draft", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8673208", "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iqOfSgCX64kmmfFDxbHDOQaNk-s=/0x0:3000x1688/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56155835/usa_today_10210538.0.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "17:40:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

Gaines and the Rams' 2018 second-round draft pick.\n\nThe 24-year-old was the number four overall pick of the 2014 draft as the Bills traded up to make him the top wide receiver taken ahead of Mike Evans and Odell Beckham Jr, his selection coming immediately before that of Oakland Raiders pass-rushing star Khalil Mack. Watkins can be that type of dynamic threat when healthy.\n\nThe former Clemson standout has 153 catches for 2,459 yards and 17 touchdowns in three National Football League seasons despite undergoing multiple foot surgeries.\n\nWatkins is entering the final year of his rookie contract. The Bills acquired Matthews and a 2018 third-round pick from the Philadelphia Eagles in exchange for cornerback Ronald Darby.\n\nThe Rams need playmakers for an offense that finished last in the N.F.L. the past two seasons. He battled injuries last season and scored just twice. He was a first round pick for the Bills in 2014.\n\nIn Los Angeles, Watkins is reunited with former Bills starter Robert Woods, who signed with the Rams in free agency after four seasons in Buffalo. But the addition of Matthews at the No. 1 receiver spot on the depth chart gives the Bills a proven weapon.\n\nIn his three years as a member of the Buffalo Bills, Watkins caught 153 passes for 2,459 and 17 touchdowns. So, they essentially swapped Watkins, Darby, and a 6th-rounder for Gaines, Matthews, a 2nd-round pick, and a 3rd-rounder.\n\nRelated News: 12 August 2017 Manchester United vs West Ham: Potential XI with three at the back 12 August 2017 Everton 7/10 to win against Stoke City in Saturday's Premier League clash 12 August 2017 Arsenal score two late goals for comeback win vs. Leicester City 12 August 2017 International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) Experiences Light Trading Volume 12 August 2017 Army jawan killed in ceasefire violation across LoC by Pakistani troops 12 August 2017 Should Trump dial back the threats against North Korea? 12 August 2017 North Korea says it's examining plans to attack Guam 12 August 2017 La minaccia della Corea del Nord 12 August 2017 Mourinho: Matic Not Fully Available For Super Cup Clash 12 August 2017 Elon Musk's AI Just \"Wiped Out\" World's Best DOTA 2 Players 12 August 2017 Asian Stocks Fall Amid Escalating US, North Korea Tension Pep Guardiola defends Man City's big spending", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-08-12", "textEnd": 1592, "textStart": 1578, "freq": 11}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T17:26:00Z", "sim": 0.7176470756530762, "source": {"uri": "xnewspress.com", "title": "xnewspress.com", "id": "19050"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "08:57:00", "url": "http://xnewspress.com/2017/08/buffalo-bills-depth-chart-after-trading-for-jordan-matthews/", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8893126", "image": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "17:26:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

It will also be the first time head coach Doug Pederson meets with the media following the trade that sent wide receiver Jordan Matthews to Buffalo along with a draft pick in exchange for cornerback Ronald Darby. We will carry that press conference live at around 10:45 a.m. here on PhiladelphiaEagles.com and the Eagles Mobile App. Until then, here's what you need to know for Saturday, August 12.\n\n1. Ronald Darby Calls Trade A Blessing\n\nCSN Philly's John Clark was there at Philadelphia International Airport, no surprise there, when new cornerback Ronald Darby arrived Friday night. It remains to be seen whether or not he will practice with the team on Saturday as he gets situated with his new team, but in a brief interview, Darby said he was \"surprised\" to learn of the move.\n\n\"It's a blessing at the end of the day,\" Darby said.\n\nThe 23-year-old with 29 career starts under his belt offered a scouting report for his new fans.\n\n\"I'm going to be aggressive, play fast, and get to the ball,\" he said.\n\nDarby has 32 passes defensed in his first two NFL seasons showing that he, indeed, will be around the football.\n\n2. Howie Roseman Capitalized On Unique Opportunity\n\nThe Eagles knew parting with Jordan Matthews, a productive wide receiver and outstanding person in the locker room, was going to be a tough decision. But the depth at the position, with the offseason additions and internal development that to position coach Mike Groh, allowed the Eagles to take advantage of the rare opportunity to add a young cornerback with starting experience.\n\n\"You look around the league and it is a corner-deficient league. It's hard to find those guys. It's hard to find guys who have been solid starters in the league and can play at a high level and teams that have them aren't really ready to move them.\"\n\nDarby is now a part of the youth movement at cornerback with Jalen Mills (23 years old), Sidney Jones (21 years old), Rasul Douglas (almost 22 years old), and second-year corner C.J. Smith (24 years old).\n\n\"He's got rare speed,\" Roseman said of Darby. \"His production on the ball, he doesn't have a high interception number, but his (pass breakup) number is incredibly high. He's played a variety of coverages. He won a National Championship at FSU.\"\n\n3. Nelson Agholor A Big Winner In Trade\n\nThe trade was just one of two for the Bills, as they sent wide receiver Sammy Watkins to the Los Angeles Rams for cornerback E.J. Gaines. Draft picks were also exchanged. But NFL.com's Gregg Rosenthal evaluated the deals and called wide receiver Nelson Agholor one of the big winners.\n\n\"The trade especially made sense for the Eagles because they were able to fill a major position of need by giving up a guy who already appeared to be the odd man out of a revamped receiving corps,\" Rosenthal wrote. \"Agholor, the team's first-round pick in 2015, was poised to take much of Matthews' work in the slot. The Eagles also have seen youngsters Mack Hollins and Marcus Johnson emerge in camp.\"\n\n4. Did NFL Network Analyst Know Of Potential Trade?\n\nNFL Network analyst and former Eagles scout Daniel Jeremiah predicted Agholor's ascension to the slot role in a recent episode of his Move the Sticks podcast.\n\n\"At the receiver position, I think they're in great shape. Nelson Agholor has had a total rebirth. He's in the slot. He's going to live in the slot. He's going to be their slot receiver. I'll be shocked if he's not,\" he said.\n\nHe didn't know what it meant for Matthews, but now we do.\n\nRookie wide receiver Mack Hollins epitomizes the change at the position. Expected to be a special teams player in his first year, Hollins scored the Eagles' lone touchdown on a 38-yard catch-and-run showing that maybe there should be a bigger role for him on offense.\n\nFran Duffy studied the All-22 and this is what he saw on the play.\n\n\"This was a post-cross concept from the Eagles, a very common vertical pass play that is prevalent in most offenses in the league. The basic idea is to put the free safety in the middle of the field in a bind. If the safety jumps down on the dig route (run by Mack Hollins on the right), then the post will be open for Torrey Smith on the left,\" Duffy wrote.\n\n\"The safety stayed home, creating a gaping hole in the middle of the field. The Packers run a three-man stunt up front, creating a free run at Wentz for linebacker Clay Matthews. This isn't Johnny Anonymous coming down the pike at Wentz, it is one of the most ferocious defenders in the NFL. Wentz showed off his athleticism, again keeping his eyes downfield and delivering this throw to the rookie, Hollins, who makes a great play after the catch, running through one tackle and stiff-arming a second defender with authority on his way to the end zone. It was an outstanding play by the Eagles' offense, and (hopefully) a good sign of things to come with this new-look unit.\"", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-12", "textEnd": 573, "textStart": 564}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T10:24:00Z", "sim": 0.7176470756530762, "source": {"uri": "philadelphiaeagles.com", "title": "philadelphiaeagles.com", "id": "5290"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "17:44:00", "url": "http://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/news/article-1/Wake-Up-Call-Ronald-Darby-Calls-It-A-'Blessing'-To-Be-An-Eagle/499bc974-0d39-4516-9f76-088602ebb4a3?campaign=phi:fanshare:facebook", "storyUri": "eng-3355470", "id": "8824531", "image": "http://prod.static.eagles.clubs.nfl.com//assets/images/imported/PHI/photos/app_thumbnails/2017/Darby_Ronald_580App_081217.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "10:24:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

There is one indisputable thing you can say about the Eagles' acquisition of cornerback Ronald Darby from Buffalo: They are in a much better position to contend for a playoff spot than they were 24 hours ago.\n\nMuch, much better.\n\nIn Darby, the Eagles added not only a starting-caliber cornerback, but also one who possesses a trait that is in dangerously short supply among the rest of the group.\n\n[Eagles trade Jordan Matthews to Buffalo, get cornerback Ronald Darby]\n\nHe has speed.\n\nIn 2015, when the Bills selected Darby at No. 50 overall, the former Florida State star ran a 4.38 40-yard dash at the combine. That number ranks in the top 15 percent at his position over the last three years (12th out of 104, per Pro-Football-Reference.com). By comparison, Jalen Mills and Rasul Douglas both ran 40s that rank in the bottom 20 percent, Douglas' 4.59 ranking 86th out of 104 and Mills' 4.61 ranking 90th.\n\nStraight-line speed is a small part of a cornerback's needed skill set, but it is an important one. The Eagles' lack of it has been on display throughout training camp, with Carson Wentz lobbing deep ball after deep ball over Mills, Douglas and veteran journeyman Patrick Robinson. For sure, Wentz deserves plenty of credit: He has been remarkably accurate on his deep throws throughout the summer. But the sheer number of shots down the field available to him had been jarring enough to think that it would be a deal breaker for any playoff hopes. This is the worst group of corners the Eagles have had perhaps in their history. And that is saying something.\n\nIn Darby, the Eagles clearly think they have found an answer. The Bills had one of the top pass defenses in the NFL last season, though Darby was aided by starting opposite a Pro Bowl-caliber cover man in Stephon Gilmore, who signed a huge free-agent contract with the Patriots this off-season.\n\nThe price was steep: a third-round pick and Jordan Matthews' final season before free agency.\n\nConsider:\n\nDarby was the No. 50 overall pick in the 2015 draft, which is notable because it means he was still on the board at No. 47, when the Eagles selected cornerback Eric Rowe, whom the Eagles gave up on after one year, trading him to the Patriots last season for a fourth-round pick. So when all was said and done, this was the balance sheet:\n\nEagles Give Up:\n\n- 2015 2nd-rounder\n\n- 2018 3rd-rounder\n\n- 1 year of Jordan Matthews\n\nEagles Get:\n\n- 3 years of CB (1 of Rowe, 2 of Darby)\n\n- 2018 4th-rounder\n\nIf they'd simply drafted Darby at No. 47 instead of Rowe, they would have gotten four years of rookie-contract cornerback play, plus they'd still have a 2018 third-rounder and one more season of Matthews in the slot.\n\nAll of that is immaterial to the wisdom of the move in the present moment. It's just a good example of how the Eagles' front-office dysfunction set the team back. If the current personnel structure had been in place back in 2015, perhaps the Eagles end up drafting Darby.\n\nWhatever the case, the move makes plenty of sense. Assuming Darby lives up to expectations and remains in Philly long term (he has two more seasons left before free agency), it will give the Eagles a ton of young depth at corner, with Mills, 2017 second-rounder Sidney Jones, and 2017 third-rounder Douglas.\n\nRead more by David Murphy Published: August 11, 2017 \u00e2\u0080\" 3:01 AM EDT | Updated: August 11, 2017 \u00e2\u0080\" 2:01 PM EDT\n\nThanks for your continued support...\n\nWe recently asked you to support our journalism.

Going from Watkins to Matthews, and Darby to Gaines is a downgrade in upside at each position, but the team did get draft picks it hopes will offset the difference.\n\nAdam Caplan of ESPN provided some further background information on the swap:\n\nMatthews has registered 225 catches for 2,673 yards and 19 touchdowns across three seasons since the Eagles selected him in the second round of the 2014 draft. That includes a 2016 campaign where he tallied 73 grabs for 804 yards and three scores.\n\nMeanwhile, Darby enjoyed a strong rookie season after the Bills took him with the 50th overall pick in 2015. He racked up 68 combined tackles, 21 passes defended and two interceptions. He struggled to match that production last year, however, with just 12 passes defended and no picks.\n\nMatthews should slide into the Bills' starting lineup opposite rookie wideout Zay Jones with recent signing Anquan Boldin operating out of the slot.

It may have been perceived by fans and the league that the Bills were laying an egg and looking towards the future. Yes, even though they added draft picks, there is a chance that these trades so late in the offseason could lead to a lack of chemistry on the Week 1 roster, and hurt the relationship the team has with it's fans. After 17 years of no playoffs, a lot was expected this season. But there's not necessarily reason to panic after the trades made.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how the team reacts to these moves this season, namely Tyrod Taylor, who just lost his number one receiver. He will now be entering this season, one that is important to not only Taylor's future with the Bills, but his future as a starter in this league, with his five top receivers as guys he's never played a regular season snap with. Sammy Watkins is a generational talent, one that the organization traded up a lot to acquire, and regardless of injuries, to let him go for an average to under average starter in LA Rams CB E.J. Gaines and a 2nd round pick is surprising and hard to understand. Here's what the moves mean for Buffalo's present and what it could mean down the road.\n\nThis Season:\n\nFor a team that has enough pressure as it is, what does trading your team's top receiver, and best young defensive back say to the rest of the players in Buffalo? It says nobody's safe, and team is looking to build a contender for the future through the draft. Chemistry on the team may be hurt by this as well. Tyrod Taylor is on his second \"prove-it\" deal in a row, and although the talent this year at receiver is significantly better, getting rid of a potential star in Sammy Watkins hurts the core significantly. Although Watkins has had an injury-plagued career, when he's been on the field he's been effective and all he needed was one full season to show what he can do.\n\nThe team however, did add WR Jordan Matthews from the Philadelphia to replace Watkins as the de facto number one receiver. Matthews has shown flashes of being a solid NFL receiver, with 225 catches for 2,673 yards over his first three seasons, and has only missed two games over those years. If he can take another step forward this season with an increase in targets, these trades may not look so bad.\n\nHopefully Matthews and Taylor can develop some sort of relationship in these last couple of weeks of the offseason, along with other top newcomers rookie Zay Jones and veteran Anquan Boldin. Boldin was a huge signing for Taylor, and could go a long way in his development at the QB position.\n\nAs far as moving CB Ronald Darby to Philadelphia as part of the trade for Matthews, I don't really get it. Darby has shown flashes over his first two seasons as a potential lock down corner in this league and to get an average receiver and a third round pick hurts the depth of this position as well as putting a bunch of pressure on rookie 1st round pick Tre'Davious White's shoulders, who becomes the teams number one corner. Yes, Buffalo also received E.J. Gaines from the Rams in the Watkins trade, but from what GM Brandon Beane has to say, Gaines isn't even a lock to make the roster. The Bills lacked depth at the position before trading their best player there on the depth chart, so this season will show a lot about HC Sean McDermott, who has been known for his ability to develop corners, namely Josh Norman.\n\nDown the Road:\n\nWith these additions however, the Bills look really good going into the 2018 NFL Draft. After adding a 2nd round pick and a 3rd round pick in those trades, Buffalo now has two 1st-rounders, two 2nd-rounders, and two 3rd-rounders in this years draft. That's not bad to build a future around in a talented 2018 draft. It also gives young players like Zay Jones and Tre'Davious White the opportunity to develop in bigger roles in their rookie year.\n\nSo, the other way to look at this is that Bills management is looking past this year, and going all in on the 2018 QB draft class which is very talented and is headlined by guys like Sam Darnold, Mason Rudolph, Josh Allen and many others. The Bills could be looking at Taylor as a rental for this season, and if he pans out as a viable starter then they can use the picks to build in other areas, like receiver or corner where they were hurt in these trades. Standout receivers like Deon Cain from Clemson and James Washington from Oklahoma State could be available in the early rounds with one of those picks which would giver the Bills a solid top 2 combination with Zay Jones for the long term.\n\nSo after all of this, the Buffalo Bills didn't make themselves that much worse in the present. They downgraded a couple of positions, but odds are Watkins would have gotten injured, and Buffalo will still have a better receiving core than last year with Jones, Boldin, Matthews and other guys like Andre Holmes and Philly Brown.\n\nThe cornerback position may have lost their best player, but adding E.J. Gaines, who has shown flashes of a capable starter with the Rams, could give Tre'Davious White the reigns at number one corner and give him an experienced guy opposite him to be a safety belt.\n\nObviously Sammy Watkins is a fantastic talent, but until he can stay on the field he's worth little to nothing, shown from the production out of Bills receivers minus Watkins last season. Buffalo has phenomenal depth at the position this year, and adding a veteran like Anquan Boldin, a future hall of famer, could be huge for the development of young guys like Zay Jones and Jordan Matthews.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T20:02:00Z", "sim": 0.7058823704719543, "source": {"uri": "isportsweb.com", "title": "isportsweb", "id": "4620"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "03:32:00", "url": "http://www.isportsweb.com/2017/08/12/implications-of-recent-buffalo-bills-moves/", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8867710", "image": "http://www.isportsweb.com/wp-content/uploads//2017/08/USATSI_10106556.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "20:02:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

touchdown drive in Thursday night's preseason opener showed two things: Why the team thought it could afford to deal Jordan Matthews, and why that trade with Buffalo is nonetheless a gamble for an organization trying to build a contender around Carson Wentz.\n\nIt was Matthews who kept the drive alive with a 7-yard catch on fourth-and-6 from Green Bay's 42, three plays before Wentz connected with Mack Hollins on what Hollins turned into a 38-yard touchdown ramble, the fourth-round rookie breaking from the middle of the field to the left sideline and delivering what Wentz later labeled \"two pretty nasty stiffarms there to finish up the play.\"\n\nMatthews caught three passes on the drive; he was the receiver Wentz was most comfortable with, the one Wentz looked for when he was dodging pass-rushers, as was frequently the case during the 10 snaps the QB played in Thursday's exhibition.\n\nBut that Hollins ramble represented the other part of the equation - the part that made de facto general manager Howie Roseman comfortable enough to trade away the sixth player in NFL history to catch at least 65 passes for at least 800 yards in each of his first three NFL seasons, since the Eagles drafted him in the second round from Vanderbilt in 2014. Roseman sent Matthews and the team's third-round pick in 2018 to Buffalo for cornerback Ronald Darby.\n\nMatthews is big (6-foot-3, 212 pounds) and sturdy, an exemplary worker, popular with teammates, especially with Wentz, who tweeted to Matthews that he would \"always be my boy, both on and off the field. Couldn't ask for a better teammate & friend.\"\n\n\"You worry about everything when you trade a professional like Jordan Matthews,\" Roseman told reporters Friday afternoon. \"This isn't one where you're celebrating and doing a dance, because you're giving up a good player and a good pick. In this league, you're not going to be able to get anything unless you give something ... it hurts when people you care about leave.\"\n\nBut Hollins (6-4, 221) also is big, and he looks pretty sturdy. And right now he ranks behind Alshon Jeffery and Torrey Smith, perhaps behind even Nelson Agholor, Thursday's two-point conversion failure notwithstanding, on a receiving corps the Eagles clearly feel they have upgraded substantially.\n\nRoseman touted Hollins on Friday as \"tremendously consistent, a big kid with really good speed.\"\n\nIntrigue bubbled beneath the surface with Matthews all spring and summer, as he approached the final year of his rookie deal. It became apparent that management wasn't disposed to give No. 1 receiver money, $10 million-plus a year, to a guy it didn't see as its No. 1 receiver going forward.\n\n\"Those things have a way of kind of sorting themselves out,\" Roseman said.\n\nMatthews sat out most of the spring work with knee tendinitis that the organization didn't seem to think was all that serious. Then, last week, offensive coordinator Frank Reich talked about Matthews sharing the slot position with Agholor and perhaps rookie running back Donnel Pumphrey, as the coaching staff pursued matchups. This would definitely have limited Matthews' snaps. Praise for Matthews in this camp has been sparing.\n\nAs the preseason began, it seemed very possible Matthews would be leaving, and inevitable that the Eagles would seek a starting cornerback in return. When the trade happened, they had to throw in the third-rounder, because as Roseman noted, it's \"a corner-deficient league,\" and prying away a starting-quality corner from anyone in August is a difficult feat.\n\nAlso, with Jeffery, among others, here on a one-year deal, Roseman stressed that he did not want to trade Matthews and get back someone with the same looming free agency problem. Darby, 23, was a second-round Buffalo pick in 2015, meaning he has two years left on his rookie deal.\n\nDespite the risks involved - Jeffery and Smith came with questions, Agholor has been a mistake-ridden disappointment through two NFL seasons, Hollins is a rookie with one preseason game behind him - it's clear that the Eagles felt they had to add a solid starting-quality corner to be competitive in the NFC East this season. In the spring, it was easy to talk about second-round draftee Sidney Jones maybe being back from his Achilles' tear by midseason, or third-round draftee Rasul Douglas starting from Day 1, but as camp developed, it was apparent the corner position was in worse shape, right now, than a year ago, which was saying something.\n\n\"Our priority was sorting out the cornerback position,\" Roseman said.\n\nThe Bills, who visit the Linc on Thursday, probably wouldn't have traded Darby for anything after his rookie season, when he finished second in defensive rookie of the year balloting, but like several Buffalo teammates, he dropped off dramatically in 2016, as the Rex Ryan regime flamed out. A new coaching staff, headed by former Eagles defensive coordinator Sean McDermott, seems to be inaugurating a longterm rebuild. Given the Matthews contract situation, the third-round pick might have been more attractive to the Bills than the player they got, on the day they also parted with 2014 first-round pick Sammy Watkins, who struggled with injuries and hasn't lived up to the tradeup from ninth to fourth overall Buffalo made to draft him.\n\nThe third-round pick going to Buffalo with Matthews isn't insignificant, but the Eagles pretty much had to add a decent corner, partly because last year they traded Eric Rowe to New England, a year after drafting Rowe in the second round - three slots ahead of where Buffalo took Darby.\n\n\"There's a point in a trade when you think, 'If I don't do this, I'm gonna lose the player,' \" Roseman said, when asked about including the pick in the deal.\n\nRoseman also pointed out that the Eagles can still court Matthews as a free agent next spring, if Buffalo doesn't lock him up, which seemed pretty silly - if you don't want to pay big money now, why would you in free agency, for the exact same skillset? This was probably window dressing to lessen the fallout over trading a popular player, but maybe Roseman does have a distant scenario in mind in which nobody is willing to pay Matthews what the receiver thinks he is worth.\n\nRoseman probably deserves credit for getting what would seem to be a decent corner at a time of year when that is next to impossible, but then there also is the fact that he bears much responsibility for the Eagles not having better corners in the first place. In fact, with this trade, the Eagles' 2014 draft joins 2011 and 2015 as major talent dead zones, unless you include Darby as a draft asset, assuming he comes in and plays well.\n\nGiven Darby's age, Roseman could reasonably sell this as a trade for the future, but the trade also reflects that the Eagles have aspirations in 2017, maybe bigger ones than they let on through much of the offseason.\n\nRead more by Les Bowen Published: August 12, 2017 \u00e2\u0080\" 3:01 AM EDT Thanks for your continued support...\n\nWe recently asked you to support our journalism.

So they decided to move on from Watkins a year early and get a second-round draft pick. They also picked up a third-round draft pick for Darby.\n\nFor the Rams, this was all about Watkins: They want to give young quarterback Jared Goff another weapon, and now they've done so.\n\nAnd for the Eagles, this was about making the defense better right away: Darby should help immediately.\n\nWatkins is heading into the final year of his rookie contract and is cheap for the Rams, at a salary of just $690,000 this year. He'll be an unrestricted free agent next year unless the Rams slap the franchise tag on him. Watkins has 153 catches for 2,459 and 17 touchdowns in three seasons.\n\nMatthews is also heading into the final year of his rookie contract and is a little more expensive, with a salary of $1.1 million. Matthews has 225 catches for 2,673 and 19 touchdowns in three seasons.\n\nGaines is heading into the final year of his rookie contract as well, with a salary of $1.8 million. He has started 25 games for the Rams but missed the entire 2015 season.\n\nDarby has two more years left on his rookie contract, with salaries of $800,000 this year and $1 million next year.

In exchange, the Bills acquired Eagles wide receiver Jordan Matthews, Rams cornerback E.J. Gaines, as well as second- and third-round picks in 2018.\n\nEven given Watkins' problems staying healthy since entering the NFL as the fourth overall selection in 2014, he is a far-and-away better talent than Matthews. Darby, who finished second in defensive rookie of the year voting in 2015, had started 29 games over the past two seasons. Both Matthews and Gaines are entering the final season of their contracts, so it's possible neither will have an extended future in Buffalo.\n\nInstead of the players the Bills received in return, the key to whether this trade will be successful for Buffalo is the draft picks they acquired. Buffalo now owns six picks in the first three rounds of the 2018 draft -- one in each round. If they release a package of players later this month, they could add another 2018 third-round pick as part of the NFL's compensatory draft pick system.\n\nThe Bills never bottomed out as badly as the Browns in recent years, but Buffalo's impressive stash of draft selections rivals that of Cleveland, which is in full-blown rebuilding mode. First-year Bills coach Sean McDermott avoided using that rebuilding label for his team this offseason, but it now can be slapped on the 2017 Bills, who have clearly sacrificed short-term gain for potential long-term success.\n\nBuffalo's overall approach with these trades, and specifically the loss of Watkins, cannot sit well with starting quarterback Tyrod Taylor. By trading away his top passing target, the Bills are essentially setting up Taylor to fail this season. Mark down Aug. 11 as the beginning of the end of Taylor's tenure in Buffalo.\n\nTaylor took a $10 million pay cut in March to stay with the Bills, saying at the time he was putting his trust in management to fill in pieces around him after Taylor dealt with a lackluster group of receivers over his first two seasons as the starter. Instead, management has pulled out the rug on Taylor.\n\nBuffalo can avoid paying $14 million of Taylor's $18 million cap number next season if the team releases him before a $6 million roster bonus is due in March. After Friday's transactions, that move seems inevitable.\n\nWith a war chest of draft selections, the Bills have chips to move around the draft board next April. If Taylor is no longer on the roster, expect the Bills to pursue one of the draft's potential top quarterbacks -- USC's Sam Darnold, UCLA's Josh Rosen or Wyoming's Josh Allen.\n\nThe Bills' main competition in trying to land their franchise quarterback will be the New York Jets, who have been engaged in tank mode since the start of the offseason.\n\nAfter Friday, it looks like Buffalo is chasing the Jets in a race to the bottom of the barrel this season -- and the top of the 2018 draft.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-11", "textEnd": 1846, "textStart": 1839}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T18:10:00Z", "sim": 0.6941176652908325, "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "title": "ESPN.com", "id": "4"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "18:10:00", "url": "http://www.espn.com/blog/afceast/post/_/id/84332", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8676841", "image": "http://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0803%2Fr239708_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "18:10:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

He needed to wait for Jordan Matthews to complete his physical in Buffalo before taking the field for the Eagles.\n\nIt's not expected to take long for Darby to become the Eagles' top cornerback. After the Eagles traded Matthews and a third-round pick for Darby on Friday, the 23-year-old Maryland native is in line to be a big part of the Eagles' present and future. He brings top-end speed that the other cornerbacks lack and a playing style that fits what defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz wants at the position.\n\n\"Everybody knows me for my speed,\" Darby said, \"but I'm willing to come up and tackle. Play aggressive.\"\n\nDarby thrived as a rookie in 2015 as an immediate starter for the Bills and had two interceptions and 21 passes defended. He was named Pro Football Focus' defensive rookie of the year that season. His performance declined last year, and Darby said he needed to do a better job finishing plays. Eagles safety Corey Graham, who started next to Darby in Buffalo, said scheme adjustments last season hurt the entire defense. He remembers how Darby excelled as a rookie and said that will translate to the Eagles.\n\n\"He was special the whole year,\" Graham said. \"He was lights out from the beginning. ...The kid has talent. As long as he can get in the playbook and learn exactly what we're doing and play fast, he'll be good.\"\n\nGraham, who has played in Schwartz's system before, indicated that Darby is a better fit in the Eagles scheme than what the Bills are expected to run this year with new coach Sean McDermott. Darby's man-to-man coverage ability is expected to be an asset. Darby didn't anticipate it taking a long time to learn the Eagles defense. Although Graham said Darby is better when he can play fast and not think, the concepts are similar to what Darby has done before.\n\n\"Corner, it's not that difficult once you get the concepts down, know the names of the plays,\" Darby said.\n\nDarby said he's a \"great match\" for the aggressive personality that Schwartz likes in his defensive backs. It's how Darby said he's played since he was at Florida State. In man-to-man defense, he said he can run against anybody. A high school track star who won the bronze medal in the 200 meters in the 2011 World Youth Championships, Darby ran a 4.38-second 40-yard dash at the combine in 2015. If he was tested this summer, he said the time would be even faster.\n\n\"I know for sure low 4.3s,\" Darby said.\n\nSafety Terrence Brooks, who was Darby's teammate at Florida State, said that Darby is \"so damn quick, it's crazy.\" But he also commented on Darby's physicality, which he didn't think should be lost when looking at Darby.\n\nGraham and Brooks are among the familiar faces Darby saw at Eagles practice. He knows former Bills teammates Ron Brooks and Nigel Bradham and former Florida State teammate Tim Jernigan. That will help in the transition to the Eagles.\n\nCoach Doug Pederson said the Eagles will treat Darby similar to how they did Graham last week -- give him a couple days to evaluate how he fits and then figure out what to do. Pederson said the Eagles will \"take it slow with him,\" not wanting to put him on the field when he doesn't know the defense. If Darby is available for Thursday's game against the Bills -- Darby's former team -- Pederson said he would play.\n\nThe Eagles need Darby ready by Week 1. That's when the NFC East schedule starts in Washington. Howie Roseman said the Eagles watched how Darby played against the division's receivers in 2015. Asked if he's excited to go against them again, Darby responded, \"Hell yeah!\"\n\nDarby watched the Eagles' other young cornerbacks on the field Saturday. He stood with Sidney Jones. Much is expected of Darby this season, but if the Eagles were right about the trade, he'll be in the Eagles secondary for years to come. He said it's even more \"exciting\" to know that it will come in Philadelphia in front of fans that impressed him in person when the Bills visited in 2015.\n\n\"The future's looking bright,\" Darby said. \"Right now's looking bright.\"\n\nVisit The Philadelphia Inquirer at www.philly.com", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T22:47:00Z", "sim": 0.6941176652908325, "source": {"uri": "bostonherald.com", "title": "Boston Herald", "id": "2238"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "22:47:00", "url": "http://www.bostonherald.com/sports/patriots/2017/08/eagles_cb_ronald_darby_has_speed_but_is_ready_to_come_up_and_tackle", "storyUri": "eng-3355470", "id": "8851604", "image": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "22:47:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

It was one of those tweets involving a big enough name (and not quite enough information) that make you look for the little blue check multiple times.\n\nThe team then announced the Watkins trade was indeed real, and it was with the Los Angeles Rams, for cornerback E.J. Gaines and a 2018 second-round pick. Buffalo would also include a 2018 sixth-round pick in the deal.\n\nNot even a minute later, the Bills released details of a second trade, this one with the Philadelphia Eagles. That deal sent cornerback Ronald Darby to Philadelphia in exchange for Jordan Matthews and a 2018 third-round pick.\n\nViewed as a three-team trade, here are the whos, whats, and wheres.\n\nSo what exactly did the Bills get out of all this?\n\nThere's a new regime in Buffalo and oftentimes, incoming coaches and front office executives tend to like getting players of their own. This was evident earlier in the offseason when the Bills decided to not pick up the fifth-year option for Watkins.\n\nIt's not difficult to see why the Bills might not be thrilled with him. During his three years in the league, the injury-prone 24-year-old took the field in just 37 of 48 possible games, playing 16 during his rookie year, 13 during 2015, and just 8 in 2016.\n\nWhen he was on the field, though, Watkins was a stud. In 2015, he led 86 wide receivers with 50 or more targets in Reception Net Expected Points (NEP) per target at 1.05. -- every time he was targeted, Buffalo gained over a full expected point. (That's insane, especially over 96 targets.) Among the 14 wide receivers in 2015 to gain 100 or more Reception NEP, Watkins's 60 receptions were the fewest by 9 catches.\n\nWatkins isn't averse to performing with bad quarterbacks. During his rookie season, Watkins had 128 targets from Kyle Orton and E.J. Manuel -- neither of whom will be mistaken for Johnny Unitas -- and managed to finish the year 18th in Reception NEP and 37th out 90 in Reception NEP per target among receivers with 50-plus target receivers.\n\nIn the final year of his rookie deal, Watkins could have left the Bills with just a third-round comp pick at the most -- or he could have had a good season and the Bills could have franchised or re-signed potentially one of the league's most talented receivers.\n\nHis skillset also meshed well with that of Tyrod Taylor, a player who, this summer, almost became an ex-Bill himself. Last year, Taylor had the seventh-highest average depth of target among quarterbacks (9.8), while Watkins was 15th among wide receivers (14.6).\n\nWatkins will be replaced by Matthews. The fit is strange because the Bills now have what amount to three big slot receivers in Matthews, rookie Zay Jones, and new free-agent signee Anquan Boldin.\n\nAmong 41 wide receivers with 100 or more targets last season, Matthews was 38th in Reception NEP, despite being 26th in targets and tied for 23rd in receptions.\n\nIt might not be too surprising to see the Bills go with a shorter and quicker passing game in 2017, given their personnel. It could look something like the Tennessee Titans of last season, though similar efficiency is certainly not guaranteed. It appears in both big-play ability and efficiency, the Bills will take a step back in 2017.\n\nThe Bills' secondary did need to improve, as last season, they ranked 20th in Adjusted Defensive Passing NEP per play. Ronald Darby was basically the team's top corner, and played a big part in that. He'll now be replaced by E.J Gaines.\n\nBy Sports Info Solutions charting from Football Outsiders, the two weren't drastically different by yards allowed per pass. Among 82 corners targeted 40 or more times in 2016, Gaines ranked 58th at 8.1 yards allowed per pass, while Darby was 62nd at 8.4.\n\nThe big difference, though, was in Success Rate. By that metric, Darby was 12th at 59 percent, while Gaines was 82nd at just 32 percent. So, while Darby was occasionally beaten for some big plays, Gaines was routinely beaten just about everywhere.\n\nDarby, 23, is also a full two years younger than Gaines. Part of Gaines's struggles in 2016 could be from his return from a Lisfranc injury that cost him the entire 2015 season. Maybe he'll improve another season removed from the ailment, but if the Bills want to deal away a receiver with foot problems, it's an odd move to swap your best cornerback for one with foot problems of his own.\n\nIn each of the two trades, draft picks were involved. For Buffalo, they can't be ignored, because they look like the main motivation for these moves. It's hard to imagine the Bills think swapping Watkins and Darby for Matthews and Gaines will be an upgrade for 2017.\n\nBecause, as the numbers show, it won't be. But this isn't just about the upcoming season.\n\nWith the second- and third-round picks acquired, the Bills now own two first-round picks, two in the second, and two in the third for 2018. That's a nice little setup they have going on there.\n\nBuffalo is now the most recent team to see the value in stocking up future draft picks for a rebuild. However, what makes the Bills different from teams like the Cleveland Browns or New York Jets is they weren't a team with league-low talent.\n\nSure, last year was disappointing, but the Bills were still a top-10 team by our nERD rankings as late as Week 13 -- replace the Rex and Rob Ryan regime with a competent coaching staff, and this could have been a Wild Card team. This morning, the Bills were 16th in our preseason nERD projections with a 32 percent chance of the playoffs, well above the Browns (6.1 percent), Jets (13.5 percent), and San Francisco 49ers (11.2 percent).\n\nThe might of the New England Patriots scared the Bills into preparing for a time when the Patriots could be ready to take a step back. In turn, Buffalo got worse for 2017. They now have their sights set on the future, and they have to hope the future goes according to plan.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T17:59:00Z", "sim": 0.6941176652908325, "source": {"uri": "numberfire.com", "title": "numberFire", "id": "11841"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "20:53:00", "url": "https://www.numberfire.com/nfl/news/15812/are-the-buffalo-bills-crazy-for-trading-sammy-watkins", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8699647", "image": "https://d1tjohjvimcqgl.cloudfront.net/website/articles/15812_a2.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "17:59:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

both of which involved swapping cornerbacks and receivers with NFC teams.\n\nAnd while the Sammy Watkins news will generate the biggest headlines, sending the team's former first-round pick to the Rams, the other deal sends ripples into the wide receiver depth chart as well.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles have shipped receiver Jordan Matthews and a third-round draft pick in 2018 to Buffalo in exchange for cornerback Ronald Darby.\n\nMatthews was in exclusive company as a three-year veteran of the Eagles, posting 225 catches and 2,673 yards in his first trio of seasons with the team, but after Phialdelphia's offseason additions of Alshon Jeffery and Torrey Smith, not to mention a summer emergence by former first-round draft pick Nelson Agholor, Matthews was apparently deemed expendable.\n\nShipping the former second-round selection out of Vanderbilt to the Bills, who also own a host of other ex-Eagles like LeSean McCoy, solves two immediate concerns for Philadelphia and unofficial general manager Howie Roseman: Ridding themselves of a potential big-money extension for Matthews, who was due to become a free agent after the 2017 season, and landing much-needed help in the defensive backfield, where journeyman Patrick Robinson was slated to start opposite second-year man Jalen Mills at cornerback.\n\nDarby, 23, was a second-round pick of Buffalo in 2015 out of Florida State and represents an immediate upgrade for an Eagles CB depth chart. He intercepted two passes as a rookie with the Bills and started 14 games in 2016, logging 69 tackles and deflecting 12 passes.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T17:36:00Z", "sim": 0.6941176652908325, "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "title": "CBS Sports", "id": "765"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "17:36:00", "url": "https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/eagles-trade-jordan-matthews-and-a-2018-draft-pick-to-bills-for-cornerback-help/", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8671999", "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2016/11/23/cb49c32f-0550-478f-bd1d-973e15dc5cf6/thumbnail/770x433/374341197e6ec0fde524bee1e11de977/jordan-matthews-1400.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "17:36:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

Gaines and a second-round draft pick in 2018. The Bills acquired wide receiver Jordan Matthews and a third-round pick in 2018 for Darby.\n\n\"Jordan Matthews is a wide receiver with a long r\u00e9sum\u00e9, already in a three-year career and he's had great production with multiple quarterbacks,\" said Bills head coach Sean McDermott. \"With E.J. and what he's done with his career, we thought that he would give us a chance as well at the corner position.\"\n\nGeneral manager Brandon Beane told reporters he is not actively shopping any Bills players around the National Football League but had been receiving calls from other teams expressing interest in both players. The calls about Watkins, he said, stepped up around June.\n\n\"We're not actively shopping anybody but L.A. got very serious about Sammy and Philadelphia got very serious about Ronald,\" Beane said. \"The timing worked out and as I realized the time worked out, I was able to acquire Jordan to help fill in for Sammy and E.J. Gaines to fill in for losing Ronald.\"\n\nMany are now questioning whether these deals, and the draft picks the team is accumulating, is a sign the team is already thinking about looking beyond the 2017 season to focus on building for 2018. Beane sharply denied it, saying he would not have acquired veteran wide receiver and former Super Bowl champion Anquan Boldin if the team was intending to downgrade.\n\n\"This is not a throw-in-the-towel thing at all,\" Beane said. \"Someone our there said that and, quite honestly, that's annoying to me because that's not me. You don't know me if you think I'm throwing in the towel.\"\n\nMcDermott expressed his support for the GM, stating \"I have the ultimate trust in Brandon and his staff.\"\n\nThe Buffalo Bills have missed the NFL postseason for 17 years. McDermott told reporters he knows the passion of Bills fans and their thinning patience.\n\n\"I get it. I absolutely get it. That's why I didn't sleep last night,\" said McDermott. \"These are tough decisions. As I said before, I'm a part of that.\n\n\"When I signed my name to the dotted line I became a part of that 17-year time period. I see the RVs pulled out here every game. I heard about it and then two nights ago, I experienced it.\"\n\nThose RVs were just some of the vehicles that park and host pregame festivities leading up to a kickoff.\n\nThe Bills lost their first preseason game of the 2017 schedule Thursday night, 17-10, to the Minnesota Vikings at New Era Field.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T14:56:00Z", "sim": 0.6941176652908325, "source": {"uri": "news.wbfo.org", "title": "news.wbfo.org", "id": "4641"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "14:56:00", "url": "http://news.wbfo.org/post/bills-trade-watkins-darby-separate-surprise-deals", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8806981", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wbfo/files/styles/medium/public/201708/pic_for_web_11.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "14:56:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

Wide receiver Sammy Watkins was dealt to the Los Angeles Rams while cornerback Ronald Darby was sent to the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nIn exchange for Watkins and a sixth-round draft pick next year, the Bills received cornerback E.J. Gaines and a second-round draft pick in 2018. The Bills acquired wide receiver Jordan Matthews and a third-round pick in 2018 for Darby.\n\n\"Jordan Matthews is a wide receiver with a long r\u00e9sum\u00e9, already in a three-year career and he's had great production with multiple quarterbacks,\" said Bills head coach Sean McDermott. \"With E.J. and what he's done with his career, we thought that he would give us a chance as well at the corner position.\"\n\nGeneral manager Brandon Beane told reporters he is not actively shopping any Bills players around the National Football League but had been receiving calls from other teams expressing interest in both players. The calls about Watkins, he said, stepped up around June.\n\n\"We're not actively shopping anybody but L.A. got very serious about Sammy and Philadelphia got very serious about Ronald,\" Beane said. \"The timing worked out and as I realized the time worked out, I was able to acquire Jordan to help fill in for Sammy and E.J. Gaines to fill in for losing Ronald.\"\n\nMany are now questioning whether these deals, and the draft picks the team is accumulating, is a sign the team is already thinking about looking beyond the 2017 season to focus on building for 2018. Beane sharply denied it, saying he would not have acquired veteran wide receiver and former Super Bowl champion Anquan Boldin if the team was intending to downgrade.\n\n\"This is not a throw-in-the-towel thing at all,\" Beane said. \"Someone our there said that and, quite honestly, that's annoying to me because that's not me. You don't know me if you think I'm throwing in the towel.\"\n\nMcDermott expressed his support for the GM, stating \"I have the ultimate trust in Brandon and his staff.\"\n\nThe Buffalo Bills have missed the NFL postseason for 17 years. McDermott told reporters he knows the passion of Bills fans and their thinning patience.\n\n\"I get it. I absolutely get it. That's why I didn't sleep last night,\" said McDermott. \"These are tough decisions. As I said before, I'm a part of that.\n\n\"When I signed my name to the dotted line I became a part of that 17-year time period. I see the RVs pulled out here every game. I heard about it and then two nights ago, I experienced it.\"\n\nThose RVs were just some of the vehicles that park and host pregame festivities leading up to a kickoff.\n\nThe Bills lost their first preseason game of the 2017 schedule Thursday night, 17-10, to the Minnesota Vikings at New Era Field.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T01:55:00Z", "sim": 0.686274528503418, "source": {"uri": "news.wbfo.org", "title": "news.wbfo.org", "id": "4641"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "01:55:00", "url": "http://news.wbfo.org/post/bills-deal-watkins-darby-separate-surprise-deals", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8731668", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wbfo/files/styles/medium/public/201708/pic_for_web_11.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "01:55:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

They have just made a blockbuster move that could put the cherry on top of it all.\n\nThe Rams and Buffalo Bills have agreed to a trade which sends wide receiver Sammy Watkins and a sixth-round pick to the Rams, with the Bills receiving cornerback E.J. Gaines and a second-round pick per Adam Schefter:\n\nBills have acquired CB E.J. Gaines and Rams 2018 second round pick for WR Sammy Watkins and Bills 2018 sixth round pick.\n\n-- Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) August 11, 2017\n\nThis move will reunite former Bills teammates in Watkins and wide-out Robert Woods who the Rams acquired earlier in the offseason. As a result, this move bolsters an offense that the Rams are trying to ensure will look vastly different than it did a year ago.\n\nThe Rams were dead last in yards and scoring last season. They also averaged the least yards per play in the entire league.\n\nThis move provides them with more offensive firepower and also gives them a reliable go-to receiver they have not had in years. Last season Watkins missed half of the season due to injury which limited his production.\n\nIn 2015 when Watkins played in 13 games, he had 60 receptions for 1,047 yards and nine touchdowns. He averaged 17.5 yards per reception and 80.5 yards per game.\n\nThis move will reshape the Rams offense. It now gives them not only a go-to receiver, but also a player who can make plays down the field and draw the defense.\n\nFormer number one overall pick Jared Goff is in position to benefit the most from the Watkins deal. He will get a receiver who makes his job a lot easier and opens up the field.\n\nThis move will hopefully prove to be a big win for the Rams offense.\n\nBrendan Abban is a staff writer for the Los Angeles Rams on Endzonescore and hosts the KBR Sports podcast.

The two best friends then bid farewell to each other.\n\n\"It's tough,\" said Wentz, the Eagles quarterback and face of the franchise. \"It's one of those things where there's a personal side of things, and the football side of things. The football side of things, you just have to trust what they're doing upstairs. But on a personal side, it's tough. This is my first time experiencing this with someone that's one of my best friends. Seeing him (Friday), it was tough on him, too. It was kind of out of the blue. There's really no other way to put it. It's just tough personally.\"\n\nSurely you've heard what happened by now. The Eagles traded one of the more popular players on the team and one of its best receivers in Matthews to the Buffalo Bills, along with a third-round draft pick next year, in exchange for cornerback Ronald Darby on Friday afternoon.\n\nThe ripple effect was felt on Saturday, as the Eagles took the practice field just 24 hours after the trade.\n\nEveryone in the locker room respected Matthews, especially the five players who dined with him Friday night: Wentz, tight ends Ertz and Trey Burton, linebacker Jordan Hicks and safety Chris Maragos.\n\n\"It was good to see him one last time before he left,\" Hicks said. \"Just kind of have that conversation, just encourage him and him encourage us. We're brothers for life. It's deeper than just football around here.\"\n\nAs difficult as it was to say good-bye to Matthews, the Eagles can take solace in the fact that they are a better team because of this deal, and that is not to take anything away from Matthews.\n\nThis team needed a cornerback. It's been the most pertinent topic of the offseason. Now they have one, and, as executive vice president of football operations Howie Roseman said shortly after the deal was announced on Friday afternoon: \"You're not going to be able to get anything unless you give something.\"\n\nDarby gives the Eagles a cornerback who becomes an instant starter on the outside, probably opposite Jalen Mills. Both are 23 years old. Waiting in the wings are rookies Rasul Douglas and Sidney Jones, both of whom are 21.\n\n\"With picking up Darby, for sure, I think that was a good pickup,\" Mills said. \"You see that team in Seattle, they were a young secondary, started young, then all those guys grew up together in the league, and now they're one of the top secondaries in the NFL. So for sure, with them doing this it was pretty good.\"\n\nThe biggest concerns, however, are the locker room effect and team chemistry.\n\n\"Everyone loved him,\" Wentz said. \"He was the ultimate competitor out here. He always was about the team first, and so, replacing a guy like that in the locker room is definitely not going to be easy.\"\n\nThey can talk all they want about being professionals and next guy stepping up and all that other clich\u00e9 stuff, but to lose someone as high-quality as Matthews will leave a mark.\n\n\"Our group was extremely close,\" Ertz said. \"The saddest part was him leaving us and us leaving him. We understand the business side of the game. If it wasn't for the Philadelphia Eagles, a kid from California (Ertz), and a kid from Huntsville, Alabama (Matthews) would have never met. He's got a brother for life in me. He knows that, and I know that.\"\n\nIn three years, Matthews was able to earn respect in a locker room of 53 different personalities from points all over the map. He never complained, he fought through injuries, and was grateful for every day he set foot on the field. But he was in the final year of his deal and the Eagles have their sights set on spending their money elsewhere, though it is beyond me why you wouldn't want to build a team around a player of Matthews' high fiber.\n\n\"There's only a few guys that I could say probably work harder than me -- and he's one of them,\" said safety Malcolm Jenkins, the team's defensive leader. \"He's earned a lot of respect from his teammates because of who he is every day. He's earned that respect from me and pretty much everybody in the locker room. He's a great leader. He loves this team and was really excited about this year. But that's the nature of the business so we're all kind of dealing with that personally and individually.\"\n\nWith Matthews no longer around, the doors open opportunities for others. Players like Nelson Agholor, who took first-team reps in Matthews' old slot position on Saturday. Mack Hollins will also get long looks there and perhaps even undrafted rookie Greg Ward.\n\nWentz, though, does not have the kind of chemistry with any of them that he had with Matthews and isn't sure how long it will take to build with Agholor, Hollins or anyone else.\n\n\"We were so close off the field, that on the field that helped just kind of knowing what to expect from each other,\" he said. \"That does take time.\"\n\nAt least it won't be long until the Eagles see Matthews again. It won't be dinner, but the Birds and Bills will play each other in a preseason game Thursday night at Lincoln Financial Field.\n\n\"It's going to be weird,\" Wentz said. \"It's going to be really weird. I don't know. It's not going to be fun, I'll tell you that.\"\n\nEnjoying our content? Become a Burlington County Times subscriber to support stories like these.

He's 23 years old, still on his rookie contract and appears to have plenty of years ahead of him. Combining him with second-year pro Jalen Mills and rookies Sidney Jones and Rasul Douglas suddenly gives the Birds a group of young cornerbacks at a position that seemed incredibly thin in early April.\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles trade WR Jordan Matthews to Buffalo Bills for CB Ronald Darby\n\nHere's a look at what Darby's done so far in the pros, where he came from and more.\n\nName: Ronald Darby\n\nAge: 23\n\nExperience: Third season\n\nCollege: Florida State\n\nDrafted: 2015, second round, No. 50 overall by Buffalo\n\nCareer stats: 137 tackles, two interceptions, 33 passes defended\n\nHeight: 5-11\n\nWeight: 193 pounds\n\nDarby entered fall camp as the Bills' No. 1 cornerback despite a sophomore slump in which he failed to intercept a pass. According to Pro Football Focus, Darby graded as the No. 66 cornerback in the NFL last season, a steep fall from his rookie season when the site had him ranked No. 8. As a rookie, Darby's PFF grade of 86.3 was the fifth-best the site had given to a rookie corner since 2006.\n\nThe Bills have been undergoing a defensive shift from Rex Ryan to Sean McDermott this offseason, and it appears Darby didn't quite fit in with the team's future plans.\n\nDarby is a Florida State product, where he was the ACC Defensive Rookie of the Year in 2012. He was a starter on the Seminoles' national championship team the next year and didn't give up any touchdowns. Before Florida State, he played at Potomac High School in Maryland, where he ended his career as a five-star recruit, No. 2 player in Maryland and No. 2 cornerback nationally, according to the 247Sports composite rankings.\n\nHis career in Buffalo got off to a fast start, where he started 15 games and earned PFWA All-Rookie Team honors. Pro Football Focus named him Defensive Rookie of the Year. He made 14 more starts last year -- he has 29 starts in 29 games in his career -- but wasn't able to record an interception.\n\nHowie Roseman: 'Unique opportunity' led to Philadelphia Eagles trade of Jordan Matthews for Ronald Darby\n\nHere's Eagles executive vice president of football operations Howie Roseman's scouting report on Darby:\n\n\"He's got rare speed. His production on the ball, though he doesn't have a high interception number, but his PBU number is incredibly high. He's played a variety of coverages. He won a national championship at FSU. You see him go against the players we go against in our division -- the Bills in 2015 played the NFC East -- so you have that look. When you go into a draft, a lot of those things are unknown, so you have a lot of known quantities in him. We have some people in the building who have been around him, which is an important part as well.\"", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T18:13:00Z", "sim": 0.6784313917160034, "source": {"uri": "pennlive.com", "title": "PennLive.com", "id": "371"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "10:03:00", "url": "http://www.pennlive.com/philadelphiaeagles/index.ssf/2017/08/meet_new_philadelphia_eagles_c.html", "storyUri": "eng-3355470", "id": "8775075", "image": "http://image.pennlive.com/home/penn-media/width620/img/philadelphiaeagles_impact/photo/23219247-standard.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "18:13:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

On Friday, the Bills traded away their starting WR, Sammy Watkins, and their top CB, Ronald Darby.\n\nWatkins was one of QB Tyrod Taylor's favorite targets. Watkins was drafted fourth overall in the 2014 NFL Draft after a fantastic career with the Clemson Tigers. Ronald Darby was drafted 50 overall in the 2015 NFL Draft. Darby finished second in the voting for defensive rookie of the year in 2015.\n\nWhat could motivate such a maneuver by the Bills management? Draft picks, and a focus on building the future.\n\nBuffalo traded Watkins and a 2018 sixth-round pick to the Los Angeles Rams for cornerback E.J. Gains and a 2018 second-round pick. For Darby the Bills received a 2018 third-round pick and WR Jordan Matthews from the Philadelphia Eagles. Both Matthews and Gains are competent players, but not the talent of Watkins and Darby. Both Matthews and Gains are playing on the last year of their respective contracts. After the 2017 season the Bills are not going to be saddled with expensive or lengthy contract obligations. With these moves the Bills now have six picks in the first three rounds of the 2018 NFL Draft (two first round, two second round, and three second round). Depending on how the Bills play the remainder of the preseason they could earn another 2018 third round pick based on the NFL's compensatory pick system.\n\nAlthough the Bills recently signed veteran WR Anquan Boldin to a one-year dear, trading his favorite target does not bode well for the former Hokie QB.\n\nFirst year head coach Sean McDermott and first year general manager Brandon Bean look to be setting up the 2018 NFL Draft to be what they will be betting their career with the Bills on rather than trying to build a team around the pieces left behind by former HC Rex Ryan and GM Dough Whaley.\n\nAs I stated in my Virginia Tech NFL Preseason preview this is a make or break year for Tyrod. These recent moves seem to indicate that the Bills are focusing on the future and will likely be unwilling to take the $18 million cap hit that Tyrod would represent if they kept him on the roster past March 2018.

With the trade, the Rams no longer have the ability to exercise his 2018 option after the Bills declined it earlier this offseason.\n\nTavon Austin's cap number is $8 million in 2018, which is the fifth highest on the team. If they cut him after 2018, there would be no dead cap money. That leaves L.A. with a hard decision: trade Austin, or pay both receivers north of $20 million combined in 2018? The Rams will have the opportunity to try extending Watkins or franchise tag him. For the past three years, the bounty the Bills gave up in order to select him has been an albatross around his neck, made worse by the fact that Odell Beckham, Jr., was available at the spot where Buffalo was originally supposed to pick.\n\nThat might be the case, but for now, the trade is the talk of the town. He'll now be replaced by E.J Gaines. That's why this was going to be an important season for Austin, and why it now seems his days with the Rams are numbered. However, what makes the Bills different from teams like the Cleveland Browns or New York Jets is they weren't a team with league-low talent.\n\nThe Bills' decision to trade their top receiver and top cornerback for future draft picks signals that first-year general manager Brandon Beane and coach Sean McDermott view the team as a long-term rebuilding project. \"That's my responsibility. I believe in clear and concise communication and developing trust and that's what I hope has developed over the course of the first six months, six and a half months on the job and we're going to continue to work our tails off to put this football team and this organization in a position to win and sustain success\".\n\nFor the Rams, it's a no-brainer, a risk worth taking. He hasn't played 16 games in a season since 2014, and has made just 21 starts in the last two years.\n\nWatkins logged 2,459 yards on 153 receptions and 17 touchdowns in 37 games. Many fans are glad that he is gone, as they are exhausted of watching Watkins sit on the bench with injuries. Matthews and Darby will get to face their former teams on Thursday, when the Bills travel to play Philadelphia in a preseason game. However, there's still a chance he's simply a player who can't stay healthy. Agholor, mostly a slot receiver, will play all across the formation for head coach Doug Pederson and get increased targets with Jordan Matthews in Buffalo.

The former second-round pick out of Florida State finished second in voting for defensive rookie of the year in 2015 before taking a bit of a step back last season. Asked what he liked about Darby, Roseman pointed to his \"rare speed\" -- he ran a 4.38-second 40-yard dash at the scouting combine -- as well as his \"production on the ball.\" He only has two career interceptions but has racked up 33 pass breakups in 29 games.\n\nThe Eagles' evaluators also had the benefit of watching Darby against a number of receivers in the division, as the Bills played the NFC East in 2015. So they at least have some idea of how he could fare against Odell Beckham Jr., Dez Bryant, et al.\n\nDarby provides a much-needed talent infusion to a suspect cornerback group. Traveled veteran Patrick Robinson and former seventh-round pick Jalen Mills sat atop the depth chart prior to the trade, with Ron Brooks -- returning from a significant quad injury -- the favorite to man the slot. The corners from top to bottom have struggled with inconsistency through camp, and it was no secret that the Eagles were very much in the market for an upgrade. Darby has a good chance to claim one of the starting spots in short order.\n\nUnlike Matthews, who was in the final year of his rookie deal, Darby still has two years remaining on his -- a critical component to this trade going down. Just 23, he joins a young group of promising corners that includes Mills and rookies Sidney Jones and Rasul Douglas.\n\nIt's to be determined how Darby will fit into the locker room (there were some character concerns coming out of FSU) and into Jim Schwartz's scheme, but there's little question that the back end of the Eagles defense is in better shape from an ability perspective as a result of the acquisition.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T23:02:00Z", "sim": 0.6784313917160034, "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "title": "ESPN.com", "id": "4"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "23:02:00", "url": "http://www.espn.com/blog/nfceast/post/_/id/77288", "storyUri": "eng-3355470", "id": "8715923", "image": "http://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2015%2F1029%2Fr21025_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "23:02:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

He needed to wait for Jordan Matthews to complete his physical in Buffalo before taking the field for the Eagles.\n\nIt's not expected to take long for Darby to become the Eagles' top cornerback. After the Eagles traded Matthews and a third-round pick for Darby on Friday, the 23-year-old Maryland native is in line to be a big part of the Eagles' present and future. He brings top-end speed that the other cornerbacks lack and a playing style that fits what defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz wants at the position.\n\n\"Everybody knows me for my speed,\" Darby said, \"but I'm willing to come up and tackle. Play aggressive.\"\n\nDarby thrived as a rookie in 2015 as an immediate starter for the Bills and had two interceptions and 21 passes defended. He was named Pro Football Focus' defensive rookie of the year that season. His performance declined last year, and Darby said he needed to do a better job finishing plays. Eagles safety Corey Graham, who started next to Darby in Buffalo, said scheme adjustments last season hurt the entire defense. He remembers how Darby excelled as a rookie and said that will translate to the Eagles.\n\n\"He was special the whole year,\" Graham said. \"He was lights out from the beginning. ...The kid has talent. As long as he can get in the playbook and learn exactly what we're doing and play fast, he'll be good.\"\n\nGraham, who has played in Schwartz's system before, indicated that Darby is a better fit in the Eagles scheme than what the Bills are expected to run this year with new coach Sean McDermott. Darby's man-to-man coverage ability is expected to be an asset. Darby didn't anticipate it taking a long time to learn the Eagles defense. Although Graham said Darby is better when he can play fast and not think, the concepts are similar to what Darby has done before.\n\n\"Corner, it's not that difficult once you get the concepts down, know the names of the plays,\" Darby said.\n\nDarby said he's a \"great match\" for the aggressive personality that Schwartz likes in his defensive backs. It's how Darby said he's played since he was at Florida State. In man-to-man defense, he said he can run against anybody. A high school track star who won the bronze medal in the 200 meters in the 2011 World Youth Championships, Darby ran a 4.38-second 40-yard dash at the combine in 2015. If he was tested this summer, he said the time would be even faster.\n\n\"I know for sure low 4.3s,\" Darby said.\n\nSafety Terrence Brooks, who was Darby's teammate at Florida State, said that Darby is \"so damn quick, it's crazy.\" But he also commented on Darby's physicality, which he didn't think should be lost when looking at Darby.\n\nGraham and Brooks are among the familiar faces Darby saw at Eagles practice. He knows former Bills teammates Ron Brooks and Nigel Bradham and former Florida State teammate Tim Jernigan. That will help in the transition to the Eagles.\n\nCoach Doug Pederson said the Eagles will treat Darby similar to how they did Graham last week - give him a couple days to evaluate how he fits and then figure out what to do. Pederson said the Eagles will \"take it slow with him,\" not wanting to put him on the field when he doesn't know the defense. If Darby is available for Thursday's game against the Bills - Darby's former team - Pederson said he would play.\n\nThe Eagles need Darby ready by Week 1. That's when the NFC East schedule starts in Washington. Howie Roseman said the Eagles watched how Darby played against the division's receivers in 2015. Asked if he's excited to go against them again, Darby responded, \"Hell yeah!\"\n\nDarby watched the Eagles' other young cornerbacks on the field Saturday. He stood with Sidney Jones. Much is expected of Darby this season, but if the Eagles were right about the trade, he'll be in the Eagles secondary for years to come. He said it's even more \"exciting\" to know that it will come in Philadelphia in front of fans that impressed him in person when the Bills visited in 2015.\n\n\"The future's looking bright,\" Darby said. \"Right now's looking bright.\"\n\nRead more by Zach Berman Published: August 12, 2017 \u00e2\u0080\" 3:01 AM EDT Thanks for your continued support...\n\nWe recently asked you to support our journalism.

You're either happy or disappointed in the way you performed, didn't win the game and then you lose somebody in the locker room like Jordan Matthews and then you get a two-hour, 40-minute practice in full pads, live. So yeah ... definitely down today. It's one of those things that you've got to kind of fight through.\"\n\nQuarterback Carson Wentz likely was hit hardest by this decision. Not only did he lose his favorite wide receiver, but one of his best friends.\n\n\"Numbers don't tell you what kind of person he is, how he treats people and the effect he has on their lives,\" he said.\n\nAt the same time, Wentz is not ready to stand up and wonder aloud: \"Just what the heck is going on here?\"\n\nAfter driving Matthews to the airport on Friday, reality hit.\n\n\"Unfortunately this is a part of the business I'm experiencing for the first time,\" he said at his locker after Saturday's practice.\n\nA few minutes earlier, he put on a happier face for the TV cameras.\n\n\"You've just got to trust what they're doing upstairs,\" he said. \"Ultimately, they're the ones who make the decisions and what they think is best for the team I'm going to be in support of 100 percent. They haven't let me down or haven't let this team down yet.\"\n\nLater on Saturday, the Eagles signed undrafted free agent wide receiver Keevan Lucas, who was a teammate of quarterback Dane Evans at Tulsa, and assigned him Matthews' old number of 81.\n\nHead coach Doug Pederson probably wasn't happy to see Matthews go, either, saying he had a \"good relationship\" with the receiver. But he put on a bold face nevertheless.\n\n\"It's like anything that we do in life,\" he said. \"The next person steps up and here we go. We can sit and have poor attitudes and all that, but at the same time we're happy for both parties, and we're moving forward. That's business as usual.\"\n\nExcept it's not.\n\n\"From a personal standpoint, basically every time I do one-on-ones, it's against Jordan Matthews,\" Jenkins said. \"I stay after [practice] and do some releases with receivers, it's Jordan Matthews. So for me, even in my daily preparation, I've got to find a new Jordan Matthews.\n\n\"And I know he's kind of been that guy to a bunch of different guys lives, whether it be Carson Wentz or Trey Burton, Zach Ertz. He's had a big role in a lot of guys' lives.\"\n\nBut Jenkins and the Eagles will carry on, and if Darby can be what they think he can be at a position of greater need, then they will all get over what happened on Friday that much quicker.\n\n\"I talked with Howie,\" Maragos said, \"and he was very, very open, and he was like, 'this was a very tough decision to do.' I mean, he understands the weight of things and I think he, more than anybody, understands chemistry, camaraderie, all those types of things. He understands the severity of it.\n\n\"And I know [owner] Mr. [Jeff] Lurie too. He really respects quality people and [those are] the type of people he wants in this organization. So they take those things very, very seriously.\"\n\nMore than a new look, the Eagles will have a new feel having lost one of their most beloved leaders.\n\nNaturally, their next preseason game is against the Bills Thursday night at home. It means Matthews will come out of the visitors tunnel.\n\n\"It's going to be weird, really weird,\" Wentz said. \"I don't know. It's not going to be fun, I'll tell you that.\"\n\nNothing about Friday and Saturday was, either.\n\nYet this team has no choice but to pick up and keep going.\n\n\"At the end of the day, we've got to do what's best on the field,\" Maragos said. \"For me, as much as I love Jordan, Darby is going to help us out, and we've got receivers that can play. And that's the business.\"\n\nPROFILE: RONALD DARBY\n\nBorn: January 2, 1994 (age 23), Oxon Hill, MD\n\nPosition: Cornerback, Philadelphia Eagles\n\nCollege: Florida State\n\nAcquired: Trade with Buffalo Bills\n\nExperience: 3rd year\n\nHeight: 5' 11''\n\nWeight: 190 lbs.\n\nCareer accomplishments: Two interceptions, 33 pass breakups and 137 tackles in 29 career games (all starts) with Buffalo, which selected him in second round 2015 NFL Draft.\n\nNotable: One of the fastest players in the NFL, Darby ran a 4.38-second 40-yard dash at the NFL Scouting Combine.\n\nNfierro@mcall.com\n\nTwitter @nickfierro\n\n610-778-2243", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "1994-01-02", "textEnd": 5271, "textStart": 5256}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T19:28:00Z", "sim": 0.6705882549285889, "source": {"uri": "mcall.com", "title": "The Morning Call", "id": "1805"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "14:07:00", "url": "http://www.mcall.com/sports/football/eagles/mc-spt-new-look-eagles-20170812-story.html", "storyUri": "eng-3355470", "id": "8924715", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-598f87d8/turbine/mc-spt-new-look-eagles-20170812", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "19:28:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

However, he's been nicked by injuries throughout his career and only appeared in eight games last season. Matthews immediately fills the void created by Watkins.

And, the 5-foot-11 corner said Saturday he's even faster than when he first entered the league.\n\nEagles cornerback Jalen Mills doesn't need a reminder about new teammate's speed. At LSU, Mills used to watch tape of the best corners across the country and spent plenty of time studying Darby. Guess what quality stuck out?\n\n\"He's a quick guy, you know what I mean?\" Mills said. \"A really quick guy.\"\n\nBut over the next four weeks, Darby faces a significant challenge. He needs to get comfortable playing in the Eagles' defense -- and he needs to do it fast.\n\nThe Birds acquired Darby in exchange for wide receiver Jordan Matthews and a 2018 third-round pick Friday in large part because of their woes at cornerback. Patrick Robinson and Mills didn't inspire much confidence as the presumed starters, and third-round rookie Rasul Douglas likely needs more seasoning before he's prepared to accept a large role on an NFL defense.\n\nEntering this week, Philly's corners represented a glaring weakness on an otherwise balanced roster. The Eagles pegged Darby as the antidote for the struggled, but with the Sept. 10 regular season opener at Washington sitting less than a month away, he'll need to get acclimated to new surroundings in a hurry.\n\nHe seems to understand the task.\n\n\"My goal right now is to come in and learn from the vets -- vets like [safety Malcolm] Jenkins and all of them,\" Darby said. \"Just kind of learn the playbook.\"\n\n'You're losing a brother': Philadelphia Eagles react to Jordan Matthews' departure\n\nDarby isn't overly concerned about adapting to a new defense, though. He's joining a slew of former teammates -- he played with Eagles defensive backs Ron Brooks and Corey Graham and linebacker Nigel Bradham in Buffalo, while defensive tackle Tim Jernigan played with Darby at Florida State - and that could ease the transition.\n\nPlus, Darby said he's heard players rave about defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz, who doesn't run an overly complex scheme.\n\nAnd cornerbacks often have the same responsibilities in different defenses, so Darby doesn't expect to study unfamiliar techniques.\n\n\"At corner, it's not that difficult,\" Darby said. \"Once you get the concepts down, remember the names of plays and things, it comes pretty fast.\"\n\nStill, coach Doug Pederson said the team will try to play Darby in Thursday night's preseason game against the Bills, his old team. After that, Philly will wrap training camp and head toward the thick of preparation for the regular season, meaning they won't have much time to catch players up on schemes.\n\nSo, Darby will aim to nail down the Eagles' playbook and his responsibilities within the defense as quickly as he jolts around a football field. And if he can do that, he'll help spin the Eagles' crop of cornerbacks from a deficiency to a position filled with promise.\n\nAt 23, Darby believes he can still look ahead to prime years. Second-round rookie Sidney Jones, 22, has the talent to develop into a mainstay in Philly's secondary once he recover from a torn Achilles tendon. Mills, 23, and Douglas, 21, also have potential to produce steady play for the Birds in the years to come.\n\nDarby is the central piece. If he can settle in with the Eagles, he can be a fast fix at a key position.\n\n\"I just know it's a young group,\" Darby said of the Eagles' corners. \"I see them today, they're out there working hard, and there's a lot of talent. The future's looking bright. Right now, it's looking bright.\"", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-09-10", "textEnd": 1432, "textStart": 1424}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T16:52:00Z", "sim": 0.6666666865348816, "source": {"uri": "pennlive.com", "title": "PennLive.com", "id": "371"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "20:05:00", "url": "http://www.pennlive.com/philadelphiaeagles/index.ssf/2017/08/philadelphia_eagles_ronald_dar.html", "storyUri": "eng-3355470", "id": "8838414", "image": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NGGb7B8RtmE/hqdefault.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "16:52:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

While the reception total is close to his career average of 75 receptions per season, the yardage and touchdown numbers produced in 2016 were the worst of Matthews' career to date.\n\nMatthews caught eight touchdown passes in each of his first two NFL seasons, and in 2015 he fell three yards short of the 1,000-yard mark. It should be noted that Matthews missed two games due to injury last season, and he was also working with a rookie quarterback in second overall pick Carson Wentz. Matthews joins an offense that struggled through the air in 2016, as the Bills ranked 30th in passing offense and 27th in passing touchdowns (17).\n\nAs for Darby, the Eagles receive a cornerback who accounted for 69 combined tackles and 12 passes defensed in 2016. Darby, selected with the 50th overall pick in the 2015 NFL Draft, has started all 29 games that he's played in so far in his career. Darby has two career interceptions, with both coming in his rookie season (2015). Unlike Matthews, who will be a free agent at the end of the 2017 season, Darby's rookie contract runs through the 2018 campaign.\n\nRelated Items:AFC East, Buffalo Bills, FRS News, NFC East, Philadelphia Eagles, Todays NFL News", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-08-11", "textEnd": 481, "textStart": 466}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T15:20:00Z", "sim": 0.6666666865348816, "source": {"uri": "fanragsports.com", "title": "FanRag Sports", "id": "16930"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "18:09:00", "url": "https://www.fanragsports.com/news/bills-acquire-wr-jordan-matthews-draft-pick-eagles/", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8676633", "image": "https://d3d2maoophos6y.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/11101343/DGA17072796_Philadelphia_Eagles_Training_Camp1.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "15:20:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

cornerback was at practice on Saturday, but he could not practice.\n\nRonald Darby was acquired by the Eagles in a blockbuster trade on Friday afternoon and was ready to go. Except the player he was traded for, receiver Jordan Matthews, had not yet taken his physical with his new team, the Buffalo Bills.\n\nWhen Darby is able to practice -- probably on Sunday -- it probably won't be long before he becomes one of the starting corners.\n\n\"My goal right now is to come in, learn from the vets like (Malcolm) Jenkins, and learn the playbook,\" Darby said. \"Corner is not that difficult. Once you get the concepts down and remember names of plays and things, it comes pretty fast. It's very exciting, especially in a city like this with great fans.\"\n\nCertainly the Birds bulked up their secondary, but it did not come without a heavy price. Not only did they have to part ways with the popular Matthews, they also had to throw in a third-round draft pick in 2018.\n\nIt was evident that the Birds needed help at corner. Darby, who is 5-foot-11, 195 pounds, is just 23 years old and has made 29 career starts already. Like Matthews, he was a former second-round pick, the 50th player taken overall in 2015 after having played at Florida State. In his rookie season two years ago, he had two interceptions, but none last year.\n\nHe gives the Eagles a young cornerback group that can grow and learn together. Sidney Jones and Rasul Douglas are both 21, Jalen Mills is 23 and C.J. Smith is 24.\n\n\"It's kind of a unique opportunity to have a bunch of young corners at that position,\" said Howie Roseman, the team's executive vice president of football operations. \"We spent a lot of time going over this because this is obviously a big trade for our football team, and you look around the league and it is a corner deficient league. It's hard to find those guys. It's hard to find guys who have been solid starters in this league and can play at a high level, and teams that have them aren't really ready to move them.\"\n\nThat didn't make the decision to deal Matthews any easier. It was equally as difficult to part with a third-round pick next year, because it now leaves the Eagles currently without picks in the second and third rounds, though they have three in the fourth -- their own, Minnesota's and New England's. The Patriots' pick could become a third-rounder if cornerback Eric Rowe, traded last year, gets at least 50 percent of their defensive snaps. Interestingly, the Eagles drafted Rowe 47th overall in the same draft that Darby went 50th overall.\n\nRoseman said the team wasn't actively shopping Matthews, even though Matthews had only this season left on his rookie contract. The VP added that he would not have done the deal if the player they were getting back had only one year left on his contract. Darby has two seasons remaining on his contract.\n\n\"You worry about everything when you trade a professional like Jordan Matthews,\" Roseman said. \"This isn't one where you're celebrating and doing a dance, because you're giving up a good player and a good pick. But in this league you're not going to be able to get anything unless you give something. I think we have a really good group, a character group, not only at the wide receiver positon but on this team and on the offensive side of the ball. But it hurts when people you care about leave.\"\n\nPederson's approach\n\nHead coach Doug Pederson said he may not allow receiver Alshon Jeffery to participate in team drills for the remainder of training camp.\n\n\"I just want to make sure he's healthy,\" the coach said. \"We're not playing for a while. Just want to give him plenty of rest. He's getting a lot of work with Carson (Wentz) in seven-on-sevens and individual work, getting everything he needs to get done leading up to the season.\"\n\nPederson may take the same approach with veterans such as Darren Sproles, who he said probably won't play again in the preseason. The coach is also giving plenty of rest during team drills to left tackle Jason Peters, defensive end Chris Long and defensive tackle Fletcher Cox.\n\n\"Everybody is case by case,\" Pederson said. \"It's individual by individual. This is the best interest for him.\"\n\nPumphrey concerns\n\nAfter a preseason in which he put the ball on the ground twice, rookie running back Donnel Pumphrey fumbled again during 11-on-11 work after being hit by linebacker Steven Daniels.\n\n\"We have to continue to work, work through that,\" Pederson said. \"(Saturday) was a very humid day. The guys were sweating a bunch. You could probably attribute it to that. I don't want to make excuses for guys. We just got to -- you know, the emphasis is obviously hanging onto the ball, whether he's catching a punt or obviously in the backfield. Just got to make a point of emphasis with him.\"\n\nMissing\n\nQuarterback Nick Foles did not practice again on Saturday and has missed most of camp with elbow soreness.\n\nPederson said that Foles would try to do some things Saturday afternoon after practice, then \"We'll see where he's at here in the next couple days.\"\n\nOthers of note who did not practice included running back Wendell Smallwood (hamstring), receiver Bryce Treggs (leg soreness), offensive tackle Halapoulivaati Vaitai (knee), right guard Brandon Brooks (ankle), cornerback Ron Brooks (hamstring) and cornerback Aaron Grymes (personal reasons).\n\nRoster move\n\nThe Eagles signed receiver Keevan Lucas and waived linebacker Steven Daniels on Saturday. Lucas, who played in the slot at Tulsa, was in the Eagles' rookie camp back in May on a tryout. He is 5-9, 190.\n\nEnjoying our content?

lot of confusion on Twitter Friday afternoon about the Buffalo Bills dealing wideout Sammy Watkins to the Rams and acquiring Jordan Matthews from the Philadelphia Eagles, but it lead to one question about Los Angeles from me.\n\nWatkins heads to Los Angeles, formerly Buffalo's 2014 first-round pick.\n\nDarby, 23, was a second-round pick of Buffalo in 2015 out of Florida State and represents an immediate upgrade for an Eagles CB depth chart.\n\nWatkins, 24, is a great offensive weapon when healthy.\n\nGaines was valuable defensive back in the Rams' rotation.\n\nTaylor took a $10 million pay cut in March to stay with the Bills, saying at the time he was putting his trust in management to find pieces around him after Taylor dealt with a lackluster group of receivers over his first two seasons as the starter.\n\nBoth Gaines and Watkins are entering the final years of their rookie contracts this upcoming season, as Buffalo's front office elected not to pick up the receiver's fifth-year option this offseason. Darby has started 29 games the past two years for the Bills, tallying 121 tackles and two interceptions, which is very similar to the type of production Gaines has given the Rams the past few seasons.\n\nWatkins hasn't been able to stay healthy the past two years, missing 11 games due to foot injuries.\n\nThe Bills found some stability when they added veteran receiver Anquan Boldin to the mix, and they probably feel Watkins is not worth the gamble if they can have Matthews and Boldin in the offense. Last season he had 28 receptions for 430 yards and two scores in eight games for the Bills. He was a second-round pick (50th overall) in the 2015 draft. If they release a package of players later this month, they could add another 2018 third-round pick as part of the NFL's compensatory draft pick system.\n\nRelated News: 12 August 2017 Knicks reportedly hire Michelle Obama's brother for front office role 12 August 2017 Manchester United negotiate Zlatan Ibrahimovic's return 12 August 2017 LA City Council Votes Unanimously To Approve 2028 Olympics 12 August 2017 Premier League Season Predictions: Man City Title, Man United Runner-Up Price Target Analysis Precision Drilling Corporation (PDS) 12 August 2017 Salma Hayek cooks, babysits for Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively 12 August 2017 War Threats Have Become Background Noise in South Korea 12 August 2017 Maduro speaks before the new constituent assembly 12 August 2017 Fifth Harmony: \"There's Nothing We Can't Get Through Together\" 12 August 2017 Big-spending Guardiola leads chase of Chelsea 12 August 2017 Failed marriage drove Buxar DM to kill self on Gzb railway tracks Stabenow: Health care is not a privilege", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-08-12", "textEnd": 1855, "textStart": 1841, "freq": 10}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T21:18:00Z", "sim": 0.658823549747467, "source": {"uri": "xnewspress.com", "title": "xnewspress.com", "id": "19050"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "12:49:00", "url": "http://xnewspress.com/2017/08/buffalo-bills-agree-to-trade-sammy-watkins/", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8793372", "image": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "21:18:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

The injury prone receiver's trade to the Los Angeles Rams may seem like a bid for a complete rebuild, but the Bills should be (and seemingly are) viewing 2017 as a transition year. While they won't be contending for the AFC East this season, they're in a perfect situation to not repeat the mistakes that they made with Rex Ryan before Sean McDermott took the helm.\n\nFor starters, the Tyrod Taylor contract needs to be examined. Taylor is locked in through 2018, with his 2019 salary being voided after a restructure. Some expected the Bills to sign Taylor to a massive deal, but they instead opted to bid their time a bit. The restructure, which Taylor accepted in March, is largely a transition contract while the Bills figure out exactly what their future is at quarterback. Should someone really stand out to them in the 2018 draft, they may take a shot on him, have him ride the bench while Taylor plays out his contract, and let the veteran test the market in 2019.\n\nIf Taylor makes it to free agency in 2019, he'll share a free-agent class that includes Carson Palmer , Matt Ryan and Alex Smith . Ryan will assuredly be re-signed by the Atlanta Falcons , Palmer may hang it up after this contract and Smith will largely be determined by the Kansas City Chiefs ' success over the next few years. Bottomline: Taylor has the potential to be playing for a serious franchise QB contract, and if the Bills find a player that they love in the 2018 draft, they'll have the means to take a shot outside of Taylor.\n\nAccording to Spotrac, in 2018 the Bills will have over $26 million of cap space available in free agency. Defensive tackle Kyle Williams and center Eric Wood will both be hitting the market. Both could be considered priorities during the offseason, but Williams will be 35 next year and 2016 third-round pick Adolphus Washington looms as a replacement, while advanced metrics loved the job Ryan Groy did last season filling in as an injury replacement on the offensive line.\n\nIf the Bills don't want to give Washington the starting job at defensive tackle or re-sign Williams, they could pursue Star Lotulelei of the Carolina Panthers , who is an unrestricted free agent in 2018. McDermott, of course, worked with Lotulelei in Carolina, and would give the Bills two potential stars in the middle of the defensive line. It's common practice for coordinators to bring some of their guys over upon team switches, and Lotulelei, who will be 28 next season, makes the most sense. McDermott is bringing back the 4-3 defense that Buffalo was successful in before Ryan tried converting them to a 3-4 base. With the talent that Buffalo has and McDermott's emphasis on pressure, Lotulelei is a great fit in Buffalo alongside pass rushing terrors like Jerry Hughes and potential 2016 first-round pick Shaq Lawson .\n\nWith all of this being said, there's one category that this benefits the Bills the most in: the draft. The Bills now have a cornucopia of options. They have two first-round picks, two second-round picks, two third-round picks, and a fourth, fifth and seventh. With nine draft picks -- six in the first three rounds -- Buffalo can now sit on them or try to deal them to teams that are seeking more early round talent.\n\nThe Bills traded their first-round pick in 2017 to the Chiefs (who selected Pat Mahomes), primarily for the Chiefs' 2018 first-rounder in addition to a pick-swap in the first round and a mid-round pick. Now, with Watkins going to the Rams for a second-rounder and E.J. Gaines and Ronald Darby being sent to the Eagles for a third-round pick and Jordan Matthews , they have the entire 2017 season to evaluate needs and draft accordingly. Should they decide that they want someone more established, teams are always willing to flip established players for picks.\n\nThe final factor: There's a new GM in Buffalo. Brandon Beane was hired from a Panthers executive position in March, and he seems intent on making sure that this is his Bills team. That isn't necessarily a bad thing -- every GM has different philosophies -- and Doug Whaley's may not have aligned with Beane's.\n\nBeane's moves could be interpreted in one of two ways: a mad scramble to do whatever he can to claim the team before the season, or a calculated effort in which he realizes that the team as it stands likely isn't a 2017 contender, but has the potential to be in 2018 and onward. These moves, and the timing of them, appear to be the latter case. Transitioning between coaches is a difficult endeavor, transitioning between coaches and GMs is a titanic one. Beane's moves feel chaotic, but beyond surface level they seem to be highly pragmatic.\n\nAll-in-all, the moves leave Buffalo in a pretty good spot. They lose one of their biggest unproven contract obligations in Watkins, and they give the Rams -- a team that probably shouldn't be taking rental players -- a rental player in Watkins while getting back great value for him. The Darby move is a bit more questionable, but he fits the timetable, as Darby would be a free agent in 2019 and could be in position to cash in after following up his excellent rookie season with a solid 2016 performance. The Bills just made cornerback a massive need, what with Darby being gone and Stephon Gilmore heading to the New England Patriots , but they have the means to fill that need (and Gaines can be a stopgap if need be) and do have 2017 first-rounder Tre'Davious White as one long-term piece at the position.\n\nThese are moves made with a long-term plan in mind. Beane doesn't care about Watkins's Fantasy value, but rather what he means to the Bills' outlook, both now and in the future. Trading a player on an expiring contract that has had injury issues for a second-round pick is a practical move, and it sets the Bills up well for the near future. Even though fans might not like it, if Buffalo plays things right (starting in March of 2018), they'll cotton on quickly.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T19:08:00Z", "sim": 0.6549019813537598, "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "title": "CBS Sports", "id": "765"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "19:08:00", "url": "https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/the-bills-are-perfectly-set-up-to-build-a-winner-after-trading-watkins-darby/", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8685337", "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2017/08/04/0c45d364-0c48-4c9c-a2b4-7d8bd530692d/thumbnail/770x433/2e9b2e83c2abb4393f0cb0633f4d66dd/sammy-watkins-2.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "19:08:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

As chance would have it, not only does Darby strengthen a budding young core at the cornerback position, but he also reunites with a handful of players from his time in Buffalo and at Florida State.\n\n\"It's like a comfortable feeling. Not even Nigel (Bradham) and Timmy (Tim Jernigan), but I also know Corey Graham, Ron Brooks. Those guys were with me at Buffalo so it's good to be around people you know,\" Darby said after Saturday's practice.\n\nBrooks and Darby share one of the closer connections on the team after the two spent the 2015 season - Darby's rookie season - on the Bills. He tallied two interceptions, 61 solo tackles, and 21 passes defensed in an impressive first year.\n\n\"He's definitely going to be a big contributor in this defense once he learns it and gets it down,\" Brooks said. \"He's definitely going to be a good addition.\"\n\nAdding to Darby's extensive list of former teammates, safety Terrence Brooks, who played with Darby for two seasons back at Florida State spoke highly of the Oxon Hill, Maryland native.\n\n\"If we're fortunate enough to get on the field together that'll be a great thing,\" the safety said. \"Darby and I had quite a bit of time with each other at Florida State and just to have him here is a blessing too. I mean the kid is a scrapper. He goes out there and he's got tight coverage, he doesn't shy away from contact, and that's like me too. So we all bring that kind of Florida State feel to this defense.\"\n\nThe Eagles' receiving corps received a tremendous upgrade during the offseason by adding the likes of Alshon Jeffery, Torrey Smith, and draft picks Mack Hollins and Shelton Gibson which allowed the team to make a deal that would build up its most questionable position. Head coach Doug Pederson understood the decision to part ways with Matthews was a difficult one, but the trade was made based on what was best for the team.\n\n\"We're getting a tremendous athlete, obviously a two-year starter. What I've seen on tape - obviously I didn't study him when he came out of college - but what I've seen so far and what I'm hearing is (he is) not only a good teammate but a good person,\" Pederson said of Darby. \"Someone that's going to get in and get in the mix and get with a group of guys that know our system. We'll take it day by day with him and see where he's at.\n\n\"By no means are we gameplanning anybody right now. It's very basic on both sides of the ball. Just learning the terminology. We've got a week before we play again. We're hoping that he can be caught up and get some reps in the game.\"\n\nDarby, who did not practice Saturday as Matthews needed to first pass his physical in Buffalo, will likely headline an Eagles cornerback position armed with young talent including second-year player Jalen Mills, second-round pick Sidney Jones, and third-round pick Rasul Douglas. They will have the opportunity to grow and develop together as a secondary.\n\n\"I know it's a young group.

He's moving away from the friends and teammates he had in Philadelphia.\n\nAnother reason for Matthews to be upset is that it seems like Buffalo isn't even super interested in him.\n\nIt's typically standard for a team trading for a player on a one-year deal to start negotiating a long-term contract. But it sounds like the Bills aren't in a rush to keep Matthews. The Eagles' 2018 third-round pick was the real prize of the trade for Buffalo.\n\nContrast that to what's going on in Los Angeles with the Rams. They traded with Buffalo because they really wanted Sammy Watkins. Rams GM Les Snead publicly admitted the team wants to extend his contract.\n\nThe point I'm trying to make here is that this Eagles-Bills trade indicates Matthews' value was not very high. I've seen some question why the draft pick had to included and this trade wasn't just a player-for-player swap: Matthews for Ronald Darby. Now you have your answer.\n\nIt shouldn't be a surprise that Matthews' value wasn't very high. As previously mentioned, he's going into a contract year. The league likely realizes there could be a disconnect between what his agent will be asking for (based on Matthews' inflated stats) and the player's actual value relative to his skill set.\n\nAnother comparison I'd like to make while illustrating this point is the Brandin Cooks trade. Cooks only has 188 more yards and one more touchdown than Matthews does in his career. The Patriots surrendered a first-round pick because they really wanted him. Now compare that to the Matthews trade where he had to be traded in addition to a third-round pick in order for the Eagles to get Darby.\n\nI'm real curious about how he even fits in Buffalo. Anquan Boldin and rookie Zay Jones are already slot guys. That's where Matthews has played in most of his career. Maybe the Bills will try him on the outside, but he hasn't had success there in limited playing time. In 2016, Matthews played on the outside for 32.9% of Philadelphia's offensive snaps, according to Pro Football Focus. Matthews was targeted 40 times when not playing in the slot. He had 20 receptions for 222 yards (a paltry 11.1 average).\n\nIt's a bummer to see Matthews end up in a situation where he's not necessarily wanted long-term. The good news is JMatt will have a chance to find a team who really wants him in free agency after this season.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T09:28:00Z", "sim": 0.6470588445663452, "source": {"uri": "bleedinggreennation.com", "title": "Bleeding Green Nation", "id": "6261"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "14:07:00", "url": "https://www.bleedinggreennation.com/2017/8/13/16140094/jordan-matthews-throw-in-eagles-bills-trade-contract-extension-philadelphia-ronald-darby-watkins", "storyUri": "eng-3355470", "id": "8924713", "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hZ-j2IPCwrdqtML2ZGtif6a4918=/0x0:4017x2260/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56169701/usa_today_9658753.0.jpg", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "09:28:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

Gaines and a third-round pick. They also dealt top cornerback Ronald Darby to the Philadelphia Eagles for receiver Jordan Matthews and a second-round draft choice.\n\nMcDermott and Beane conceded they would need to sell Friday's trades to the locker room and to fans who've waited nearly 18 years for a playoff appearance.\n\n\"I get it,\" McDermott said. \"I absolutely get it. That's why I didn't sleep last night because these are tough decisions. I'm a part of that. When I signed my name to that dotted line, I became a part of that 17-year time period.\"\n\nMcDermott added, \"I'm invested. I feel what they feel.\"\n\nThe draft picks, if used properly, will serve the Bills longer than whatever Watkins and Darby would've contributed in 2017. And those losses are additionally mitigated by obtaining Matthews and Gaines.\n\nBuffalo owns six selections within the first three rounds of next year's draft.\n\nAs one AFC general manager texted to me, second- and third-round picks for players the Bills obviously didn't want is a nice return.\n\nBeane was asked how he'll try to convince Bills veterans -- defensive tackle Kyle Williams needed to be persuaded to return for a 12th season -- they're still trying to field the best possible team and make a playoff run.\n\n\"Well, it's hard,\" Beane said, \"because these guys are talented players. ... They don't necessarily know Jordan or E.J. So hopefully they'll reserve judgment until those guys get in and strap the pads on and jump in with them. We'll see where it goes from there.\"\n\nWhen quarterback Tyrod Taylor re-signed with the Bills this offseason, he expected to throw to Watkins.\n\nTaylor and Watkins took 16 snaps together in Thursday night's exhibition against the Minnesota Vikings at New Era Field. Taylor connected with Watkins on each of the first three plays and sent five of the eight passes he attempted Watkins' way.\n\nFifteen hours after the game, Watkins was gone.\n\nMcDermott was asked how he will explain Friday's decisions to Taylor.\n\n\"I'll take it a step further and how you sell it to the entire team,\" McDermott said before Friday's practice. \"My stance with our football team and the leaders of our football team -- you mention Tyrod, being one of them -- is to be honest and up front with these guys.\n\n\"They know that we're going to do everything possible and make every decision that's in the best interest of this football team short- and long-term. That's my responsibility.\n\n\"I believe in clear and concise communication and developing trust, and that's what I hope has developed over the course of the first six months on the job.\"\n\nHope.

He was slated on the depth charge to start at cornerback this season. You don't know me if you think I'm throwing in the towel.\n\n\"I get it\", McDermott said.\n\nI can imagine the Rams, with no real number one receiver, liked watching that. \"We go with the information that we have since they've been in Eagles uniforms and that wide receiver group has been tremendously competitive throughout the spring and summer\".\n\n\"It doesn't say anything\", Beane said. If we were throwing in the towel, I wouldn't have tried to get a starting receiver back. In the final year of his rookie contract, Matthews will be eager to get on the same page as new quarterback Tyrod Taylor, but with Andre Holmes, Anquan Boldin and rookie Zay Jones now representing his top competitors for targets, the 25-year-old should like his chances of finally topping the 1,000-yard mark.\n\nThe trades caught Bills players by surprise a day after a 17-10 preseason-opening loss to Minnesota. It's a win-now league. \"It's our best interest\". The Bills previously declined his 2018 option.\n\nIf Watkins can live up to Robey-Coleman's assessment, it becomes a worthwhile transaction, even if it also means using the franchise tag to keep him or signing him to a lucrative long-term deal as his contract expires at the end of this season. The Bills were already expected to shift more of a high-percentage passing game this season, which wouldn't have suited Watkins, who averages a lid-lifting 16.1 yards per reception in his career.\n\nWatkins has been hampered by an assortment of injuries and limited to playing just eight games last season after having surgery for a broken left foot. Walt Powell, who caught 14 passes for the Bills in 2016, is the leading returning wide receiver, and he's suspended for the first four games of the regular season. When the trade happened, they had to throw in the third-rounder, because as Roseman noted, it's \"a corner-deficient league\", and prying away a starting-quality corner from anyone in August is a hard feat. \"And teams that have them aren't really ready to move them\".\n\nEJ Gaines, the former sixth-round pick out of Missouri, started over Trumane Johnson in his rookie year back in 2014. The Bills acquired cornerback E.J. Gaines from the Rams. The problem for the Rams is wondering who on earth will be that starting cornerback aside Trumaine Johnson? \"I am excited about how they are going to use me going forward, and I am excited about this year\". Sometimes that's a day-to-day process and sometimes those are not easy decisions from a leadership standpoint.\n\nNOTES: S Bacarri Rambo is listed week to week after hurting his hamstring against Minnesota.\n\nThe Eagles endured their longest workout of training camp at 2 hours, 40 minutes and featured plenty of hitting.\n\nRoseman said he had a \"knot in his stomach\" before talking to Matthews on Friday morning and certainly thought about the possible locker room ramifications a deal like this one might have.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T23:26:00Z", "sim": 0.6431372761726379, "source": {"uri": "expressnewsline.com", "title": "expressnewsline.com", "id": "18917"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "08:57:00", "url": "http://expressnewsline.com/2017/08/13/eagles-trade-jordan-matthews-third-rounder-to-bills-for.html", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8893118", "image": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "23:26:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

If Watkins can stay healthy, this is a player who posted 2,000-plus yards and 15 touchdowns over his first two NFL seasons.\n\nWatkins is in the final year of his pact after the Bills failed to pick up his option, but look for the Rams to extend -- or ultimately tag -- a player they considered drafting back in 2014. Speaking of the draft, the Bills now own Kansas City's 2018 first-rounder along with the second- and third-round selections picked up Friday.\n\nIn Buffalo, Matthews also steps in as the logical No. 1 target for Bills quarterback Tyrod Taylor. The versatile pass-catcher was whispered about for weeks as trade bait, but Matthews -- also in the final year of his rookie deal -- came surprisingly cheap with Philly also gifting the Bills a third-rounder.\n\nBefore Eagles fans go nuts, this is a team -- stocked with veteran wideouts -- that needed help on defense. Landing Darby is a boon on that front, but the move puts pressure on Alshon Jeffery, Nelson Agholor and Torrey Smith to lift up quarterback Carson Wentz come September.\n\nIt's a trade that will be eyeballed all season long for hints about who came out on top.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {"liCnt": 3}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T17:37:00Z", "sim": 0.6431372761726379, "source": {"uri": "nfl.com", "title": "NFL.com", "id": "5624"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "17:37:00", "url": "http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000828580/article/bills-trade-sammy-watkins-to-rams-acquire-matthews", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8672076", "image": "http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/photo/2017/08/11/0ap3000000828582_thumbnail_200_150.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "17:37:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

Gaines and a 2nd-round pick, according to the NFL Network's Ian Rapoport. The Rams also received a 6th-round pick in the deal.\n\nWhen healthy, Watkins is one of the premier deep threats in the NFL. His speed, size, and ability to make catches in traffic should have Rams fans, who watched an abysmal offense last year, excited.\n\nThe move continues LA's effort to put 2016 former one overall pick Jared Goff in the best position to succeed possible. He struggled mightily during his rookie year, but the arrival of new head coach Sean McVay has provided Goff with a system more fit for his skill set. They also improved the offensive line by bringing in veteran Andrew Whitworth, who made 3 Pro Bowls with the Bengals. They signed a solid intermediary receiver in Robert Woods, as well.\n\nE.J. Gaines was an important piece of the Rams' secondary in 2016, but the addition of Kayvon Webster appears to have made him expendable. As Rich Hammond of the OC Register reports, Gaines had been talking to his agent recently.\n\nThe Bills nearly simultaneously traded cornerback Ronald Darby to the Philadelphia Eagles for receiver Jordan Matthews and a 3rd-round pick. So, they essentially swapped Watkins, Darby, and a 6th-rounder for Gaines, Matthews, a 2nd-round pick, and a 3rd-rounder.\n\nNow, Mike Florio of Pro Football Talk speculates that Tavon Austin could be available for a trade with Watkins taking on his role with the Rams. Of course, Austin's bulky contract could prevent a deal from coming to fruition.\n\nJUST IN: NBA News: NFL's highest-paid running back Devonta Freeman makes same salary as NBA backup Kosta Koufos Related TopicsBillsRamsSammy Watkins", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T15:13:00Z", "sim": 0.6431372761726379, "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "title": "ClutchPoints", "id": "18856"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "10:03:00", "url": "https://clutchpoints.com/rams-news-los-angeles-acquires-sammy-watkins-trade-bills/", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8775111", "image": "https://clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/sammy-watkins.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "15:13:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

The Bills dealt a sixth-round pick to the Rams as part of the Watkins trade.\n\nThe shakeup continues an offseason overhaul under new coach Sean McDermott and GM Brandon Beane.\n\nWatkins was a starter since Buffalo traded up five spots in the 2014 draft to select him with the No. 4 pick. He has 153 catches for 2,459 yards and 17 touchdowns in three seasons but topped 1,000 yards just once (2015).\n\nWatkins' future in Buffalo was already in question after the Bills declined to pick up his fifth-year contract option in May.\n\nMatthews, also entering the last year of his contract, was Philadelphia's most productive receiver, averaging 75 catches, 891 receiving yards and six touchdowns in his first three seasons. But the Eagles signed free-agent receivers Alshon Jeffery and Torrey Smith and drafted Mack Hollins and Shelton Gibson.\n\nDarby started 29 games in his first two seasons in Buffalo. He was a second-round pick (50th overall) in the 2015 draft.\n\nRavens lose two more\n\nAiling Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco won't play in the preseason as he continues to recover from a back injury. According to the team, Flacco remains on track to start Sept. 10 when the Ravens open the regular season against the Bengals.\n\nTwo other offensive players, however, won't be playing in that game.\n\nThe Ravens announced starting left guard Alex Lewis and rookie wide receiver Tim White will miss the season with injuries that will require surgery. They become the eighth and ninth players since June 1 that the Ravens have lost for the year because of injury, suspension or retirement.\n\nPackers ask for review of hits\n\nThe Packers submitted videos to the NFL of hits by Eagles players that knocked out Green Bay's Malachi Dupre and Damarious Randall.\n\nCoach Mike McCarthy said he expected the league to evaluate the hits from Thursday's preseason game from the perspective of player safety. When asked to clarify, McCarthy said, \"If I turned them into the league, I don't think they're legal hits.\"\n\nAround the league\n\nRedskins outside linebacker Trent Murphy suffered a torn ACL in his left knee during Thursday's preseason opener and will miss the rest of the season, according to a person with knowledge of the situation. ... A person familiar with the situation said Dolphins rookie linebacker Raekwon McMillan will miss the season with a torn ACL in his right knee. ... A person with knowledge of the diagnosis said Broncos nose tackle Billy Winn will miss the season with a serious right knee injury suffered in Thursday's preseason opener against the Bears. ... The Jaguars released left tackle Branden Albert, who retired then abruptly unretired. The 32-year-old Albert is free to sign with any other NFL team. ... NFL commissioner Roger Goodell watched the Patriots exhibition opener Thursday, his first game in New England since \"Deflategate.\"", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-09-10", "textEnd": 1574, "textStart": 1566}, {"amb": false, "date": "-06-01", "textEnd": 1909, "textStart": 1903}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T05:00:00Z", "sim": 0.6431372761726379, "source": {"uri": "triblive.com", "title": "TribLIVE", "id": "1994"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "05:00:00", "url": "http://triblive.com/sports/nfl/12611698-74/nfl-notebook-bills-trade-receiver-sammy-watkins", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8745557", "image": "http://triblive.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=cdQxWCE_qJt2EPjwZRpvIc$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYuA0lM54EW8gUgKrB70BU7vWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "05:00:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

It has been adapted to reflect Matthews' departure.\n\nBefore we discuss anything, let's call Jordan Matthews exactly what we all know he is: A decent wide receiver.\n\nForget, for a second, his numbers. The ones that, whether like misleading Mark Sanchez completion percentages or rightfully recognized all-time yardage marks from Donovan McNabb, give him good standing in the Philadelphia Eagles record books.\n\n\"Decent\" shouldn't be too generous a title to award Mr. Matthews. We won't even dabble with \"good\" or \"great,\" although you'd be hard pressed to find many \"good\" wide receivers who were as steadily productive, with the same slew of quarterbacks, receiving counterparts and general circumstances, as No. 81 was in Philly.\n\nAnd yet, still, even commending Matthews as mildly competent, let alone making mention of the fourth-year veteran's career highlights, seemed guaranteed to elicit backlash during the dark days of Internet-expert wide-receiver analysis before J-Matt's trip out of town to Eagles North -- er, the Bills -- no less.\n\nIn case you're an Eagles fan who also happens to take up offseason residence beneath a rock, Matthews wasn't exactly a unanimously beloved member of the team leading up to his abrupt departure. Now, the mid-2000s version of all of us -- the ones leeching to every Anquan Boldin trade rumor to hit the streets -- may have embraced a solid, if unspectacular, wideout like Matthews with open arms. Heck, we all did just that in 2014. But there were intriguing opinions out there about why the Eagles should have been willing to move on from Matthews, an impending 2018 free agent.\n\nThen there was me and about three others. (Or so it seemed.)\n\nLet me be clear in noting that, with Ronald Darby (!) now in the fold at a cornerback spot that needed an upgrade like no other, Matthews heading to the Bills isn't sour as much as it is bittersweet -- with a heavy dose of long-term sweetener. Let me also be clear that, come March 2018, I may very well have been OK with the Eagles and Matthews parting ways anyway. By that point, Alshon Jeffery, the big-bodied all-star receiver this city has been craving since the era of everyone's favorite (or disdained) Hall of Fame snub, might turn a Pro Bowl year into a big-money extension.\n\nBut those clamoring for J-Matt to be exiled from the WR depth chart -- for the Eagles to thrust proven depth out of town -- just to prove a point about Matthews being overrated? I hope, now that their scapegoat is actually gone, they will respect who and what Jordan Matthews was for this team and this city. (The fact that he was merely a three-year, semi-starting receiver here should speak volumes, too.)\n\nHow did factions of fans so suddenly develop distaste for Matthews? Maybe, with a glimpse at an unusually talented WR lineup, they saw no need for any remnants of a flawed and underwhelming past. Maybe, for reasons nowhere to be found in other free-agency plunges, they were worried about a future hurdle for Howie Roseman's cap management. Maybe, with some degree of sense, they wanted the Eagles not to overvalue a guy who's had some untimely drops and didn't warrant the No. 1 job he was forced to shoulder early in his career.\n\nBut just because Matthews was an imperfect wideout and has now been shipped elsewhere doesn't mean he isn't worthy of some respect. It doesn't mean Eagles fans shouldn't, you know, be thankful they could root for him. And, really, beyond those statistical debates or financial concerns, was there an Eagle outside of, say, Matthews' handshake buddy Carson Wentz who made himself more likable?\n\nThe in-game hiccups were frustrating, but you're telling me the no-nonsense, team-first attitude that accompanied his 225 catches, 2,673 yards and 19 touchdowns in three years stood for nothing?\n\nIf Matthews were wearing midnight green in 2017, I know I wouldn't have been so bummed about it. Maybe, just maybe, he would've even won back a few fans with a redefined role on a supremely restocked offense.\n\nNow, Jordan Matthews leaves to fill in for Sammy Watkins out in Buffalo, high-fiving the Eagles' newest starting cornerback as he arrives. He departs amid some polarizing and often unnecessary debate, but he leaves behind a trail that I respect.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-03-", "textEnd": 2140, "textStart": 2130}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-10T22:00:00Z", "sim": 0.6392157077789307, "source": {"uri": "bleedinggreennation.com", "title": "Bleeding Green Nation", "id": "6261"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "20:05:00", "url": "https://www.bleedinggreennation.com/2017/8/11/16121912/jordan-matthews-trade-philadelphia-eagles-wide-receiver-nfl-buffalo-bills-ronald-darby-news", "storyUri": "eng-3355470", "id": "8838409", "image": "https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y4fPnQjd2tjequtTihQ7iaw9Xx4=/466x25:3185x1449/fit-in/1200x630/cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9023837/usa_today_9536833.jpg", "date": "2017-08-10", "time": "22:00:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

That's what you do in this business. You put one step in front of the other and you move on. I asked them to continue to trust me and our decisions, in terms of what we're doing, and we need to be focused on what's in front of us.\"\n\nGeneral manager Brandon Beane said Friday he had been receiving trade calls about Watkins since Beane was hired in May, days after the Bills declined Watkins' fifth-year contract option for 2018. Beane presented the Los Angeles Rams' proposal -- a 2018 second-round pick and cornerback E.J. Gaines in exchange for Watkins and a 2018 sixth-round pick -- to McDermott and owner Terry Pegula after the Bills' preseason loss Thursday night to the Minnesota Vikings.\n\n\"I'm always going to listen,\" McDermott said of the trade proposal. \"Brandon's job, and his staff's, is they go out and find players. And it's our job to develop the players. So as a football coach, it's my job as Brandon approaches me with a potential situation, to listen. I'm protective of our players. I'm very protective of our players, and it's got to be the right deal, the right situation for us to do something like this.\n\n\"I feel like we're moving in the right direction, I honestly believe that. And I would end by saying this: I have the ultimate trust in Brandon and his staff.\"\n\nQuarterback Tyrod Taylor, who loses his top receiver in Watkins, and running back LeSean McCoy both echoed McDermott's trust in Beane in making the right deal.\n\n\"I have faith in our management and I have faith in Coach McDermott that they made a decision based on the betterment of this team. Like I said, definitely just surprised that everything happened. It just happened so fast,\" Taylor said.\n\n\"The good thing about that is it's past my pay grade,\" McCoy said. \"Those guys make the decisions for our team. As players and coaches, they coach and we play. That's how it works.\"\n\nMcCoy, who was traded from the Philadelphia Eagles in 2015 for linebacker Kiko Alonso, said he can relate to Watkins in that Watkins was dealt for \"a guy he's probably better than\" in wide receiver Jordan Matthews. The Bills acquired Matthews on Friday along with Philadelphia's 2018 third-round pick for Darby.\n\n\"If you compare the two, it's obvious [that] you can agree who is better,\" McCoy said of Watkins and Matthews.\n\nThe Bills' two trades Friday give the team a total of six selections in the first three rounds of the 2018 draft. However, the deals could weaken Buffalo's chances of improving on their 7-9 record from last season.\n\nAsked Friday if the Bills are better off for the upcoming season after making the moves, Beane said, \"you can make an argument either way.\" Beane also pushed back against the idea that Buffalo is not putting the best team on the field in 2017 in order to move on from quarterback Taylor and find his replacement in the draft next spring.\n\n\"It doesn't say anything,\" said Beane about what the trade means for Taylor. \"Everybody's forgetting [signing Anquan] Boldin last week. This is not a throw-in-the-towel thing at all. Somebody mentioned that somebody said that out there, and honestly, that's annoying to me. You don't know me if you think I'm throwing in the towel. When I go out there and play pingpong, whatever I'm doing, I'm not throwing in the towel. If we're throwing in the towel, we're not trying to get a starting receiver back.\n\n\"To your question on Tyrod, it's nothing. We got Anquan, who we added. I told you, I honestly believe he's a Hall of Famer. He still can play in this league. Jordan Matthews is a starting receiver. If you look at his numbers and what he's done, those aren't anything to laugh at. So Tyrod will get every opportunity to lead this team, and we're all rooting for him. It's our best interest.\"\n\nMcDermott understands Bills' fans frustrations about another potential rebuilding season after the franchise has missed the playoffs for the past 17 seasons.\n\n\"I get it,\" McDermott said. \"I absolutely get it. That's why I didn't sleep [Thursday] night, because these are tough decisions. As I said before, I'm a part of that [playoff drought]. When I signed my name on the dotted line, I became a part of that 17-year time period. I see the RVs pulled out here every game. I heard about it, and then [Thursday night] I experienced it.\n\n\"I'm invested. I feel what they feel. We're building a football team. We're building a football team that we want to compete in the short and the long term and to be good for a long time. Sometimes that's a day-to-day process and sometimes those are not easy decisions from a leadership standpoint. I understand where [the fans] are coming from. That said, we're going to compete like crazy.\"", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T22:28:00Z", "sim": 0.6352941393852234, "source": {"uri": "espn.com.au", "title": "ESPN.com", "id": "5195"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "09:41:00", "url": "http://www.espn.com.au/nfl/story/_/id/20317203", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8772377", "image": "http://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0622%2Fr223116_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "22:28:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

So the Rams have nowhere to go but up on that side of the ball, and while I've long been a Watkins skeptic due to his chronic injury woes, you can understand L.A.'s attraction to the former first-round pick, whom Buffalo traded up for (egregiously) three years ago.\n\nTavon Austin , for all the money he earns, is a gadget guy; when he does make plays, it's often around the line of scrimmage. Kupp will do his best work in the slot, and the Rams had no one to stretch the field vertically and be that persistent outside presence. It's a vital component in any offense and especially in the scheme of Sean McVay, the youngest head coach in the league, so it's hardly surprising the Rams have been monitoring Watkins' availability for months.\n\n\"It probably started a little bit in the spring as you're talking to people and trying to improve your roster,\" Rams GM Les Snead said while meeting with reporters before Friday's practice. \"We started flirting with Buffalo and Sammy probably around the time when they didn't put the fifth-year option on him and we didn't put the fifth-year option on Greg (Robinson, former Rams first-rounder).\n\n\"And over time I had a conversation with Buffalo and then when Brandon Beane got the GM job we rekindled that a little bit during the summer and it came to fruition this week.\"\n\nWhat Watkins brings to the table\n\nWatkins, when he does play and is unencumbered by nagging foot and other injuries, can certainly be explosive. His has legit big-play potential, averaging over 16 yards per catch in his career. Despite being in pedestrian, largely run-dominated offenses, he does have 10 100-yard games in three seasons (in 37 games played, and many of them at less than full strength). Getting him deep early and often will be imperative.\n\n\"When you attack a team in your passing game, you'd like to use the length of the field and the width of the field,\" Snead said. \"And that's what speed can do for you to allow you to attack vertically as well as with the width. So it's trying to open the field up, and it's not just one person. It might be a tight end this week, it might be a slot receiver this down, maybe a running back out of the backfield.\"\n\nIf we're talking deep stuff, yeah, it'll mostly be Watkins among this bunch. His 26 catches of 25 yards or more are tied for 16th in the NFL since 2014 (when Watkins entered the league), though Snead conceded that the durability factor was something he and his medical staff had to explore before pulling off the trade, which also sent corner E.J. Gaines, who became a starter last season, to Buffalo. Watkins has missed 11 games over the past two seasons.\n\n\"We definitely discussed it,\" Snead said, \"and I think it's probably one of the reason they didn't put the fifth-year option on him. But when we dove into it we felt comfort taking the risk and making this move and going forward.\"\n\nRams eye long-term deals for Watkins, Donald\n\nSnead was unequivocal about the Rams' desire to secure Watkins' services beyond this season (he makes just $690,000 in base salary this season at the end of his rookie deal, and is eligible for unrestricted free agency next season unless franchised).\n\n\"Definitely -- he's 24, so you don't just do it for the now,\" Snead said.\n\nThat could prove tricky, however. Watkins might want to play it out, and with Jared Goff coming off such a rocky rookie season, he could prefer other options down the line. And the Rams are still trying to get an extension done with all-world defensive tackle Aaron Donald , still not at camp, and he won't come cheap. Watkins will want top-of-the-market money to commit long-term now, I reckon.\n\nSnead told me the dialogue with Donald is ongoing and they have a substantial offer on the table.\n\n\"Whether it's a holdout or an injury, these are things we have to be able to deal with,\" McVay told me, \"and that's something that we're trying to figure out every day. We want Aaron here and we want to make him a Ram for a long time, and in the little bit of time I've spent with him it doesn't take long to see what kind of a special player he is, based on the tape, and what kind of person he is and how much he loves the game of football and his teammates. That's why we want to get it figured out.\"\n\nThe Rams have been open to other trade options as well, though this deal of Gaines makes it even less likely they move top corner Trumaine Johnson , who is making $17 million this season after being franchised a second straight year. Sources said the Pittsburgh Steelers have been among the teams sniffing around on a possible Johnson trade.\n\nGoff finding early rapport with Kupp\n\nAll eyes here remain on Goff at all times -- it's not unusual for even Snead to be nearby on the practice field when the youngster is running drills -- and from what I've seen of him this week he remains very up and down. He'll miss two or three throws that make you shake your head and then loft a perfect 50-yard parabola for touchdowns a few times in a row. The learning curve remains steep, I imagine.\n\n\"I think he's done a nice job up until this point,\" McVay said, realizing the truer tests don't come until the preseason opener this weekend.\n\nKupp seems to be sparking some early chemistry with Goff as well. Despite having just been drafted, he's smart and savvy enough to play all three receiver spots -- though the slot is where he truly shines with a two-way go -- and even with Watkins flying to L.A. I'd expect plenty of balls to come his way.\n\n\"He's come in and done a really nice job,\" McVay said. \"He's a very mature rookie and he sees the game through the eyes of a quarterback with his understanding of the route concepts and the timing and rhythm.\"\n\nBuffalo Bills building for the future\n\nAs for the Bills, Watkins' former team, they might not be done dealing, either. I love what Beane and rookie head coach Sean McDermott are doing to reshape the roster and culture in Buffalo, both long in disarray. Watkins was a favorite for former GM Doug Whaley and became a polarizing figure there among decision-makers, with his health likely precluding another big deal in Buffalo (they recently dealt quarterback Cardale Jones , another of Whaley's pet projects, to the Los Angeles Chargers ). In another trade Friday, the Bills took a flier on slow-developing receiver Jordan Matthews , who needed a change of scenery, as a potential fill-in for Watkins, and get Gaines to take the spot of Ronald Darby , who was moved in the Matthews deal, at corner.\n\nBuffalo also picked up additional second- and third-round picks in 2018 in the two deals, where they can draft replacements if Matthews and Gaines don't pan out. And the recent signing of uber-veteran Anquan Boldin won't do anything to improve Buffalo's speed sans Watkins, but does give Tyrod Taylor another available target.\n\n\"People forget that we just signed Boldin,\" Beane said during the Bills press conference. \"This isn't a throw in the towel move. You don't know me if you think I'm throwing in the towel.\"", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T00:41:00Z", "sim": 0.6274510025978088, "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "title": "CBS Sports", "id": "765"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "00:41:00", "url": "https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/rams-gm-hopes-to-extend-sammy-watkins-after-exploring-trade-since-spring/", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8725414", "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2017/08/12/af6bed3a-5eca-45fa-a7a9-44d03d762f56/thumbnail/770x433/105bb1566fa67183d5324a3ae9f24394/sammy-watkins-bills.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "00:41:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

Sean McDermott wasn't sure, either. Allow me to help them out here. The Bills didn't get better. They got worse.\n\nIt's understandable that Beane and McDermott wouldn't concede that it was a step back. They have to sell these deals to their team, which expects to contend for a playoff spot this season. They're competitors and believe they can be good this year while building for the future.\n\nThe Bills received a solid veteran wideout, Jordan Matthews and a 2018 third-round pick in the Darby deal. They got cornerback E.J. Gaines and an '18 second-rounder from the Rams in the Watkins trade.\n\nSo this isn't a tank, like the Sabres three and four years ago, or the Browns and Jets the last two seasons. In typical fashion, the Bills are middling it this season, looking to win in the short term while looking to get better down the road.\n\nYou could argue that middling it year after year, trying to appease the fan base and never bottoming out, has held the Bills back over the years, costing them more chances to pick near the top of the draft and get their franchise quarterback. I realized McDermott and Co. were middling it when they brought back Tyrod Taylor and Kyle Williams, and more recently when they signed Anquan Boldin.\n\nBut make no mistake, these deals were more about the future than the present. The Bills now own two picks in each of the first three rounds of the 2018 draft. That's a clear indication that Beane is determined to rebuild a thin roster and reshape the team in his first job as an NFL general manager.\n\nI applaud them for the moves. Fans might object to moving Watkins when he finally appears healthy. The Bills have removed the possibility of Watkins performing like a superstar and making the offense even more dynamic than it was a year ago. Matthews is solid, but not close to what Sammy can be if he's fully healthy.\n\nThe thing is, Watkins has never been fully healthy. He had 10 separate injuries during his three years as a Bill. Beane admitted that was a consideration in dealing him. Another injury would seriously diminish Watkins as an asset, and he'll be a free agent after the season.\n\nBeane presaged such a deal when he decided not to pick up the fifth year of Watkins' original contract. At that point, you figured Watkins might not be in town much longer. You can't blame a GM for moving a player when his value is high, rather than risk losing him for nothing in free agency.\n\nWatkins wasn't their guy to begin with. Beane and McDermott gushed about Watkins in press conferences after the trade, but it seems they didn't believe he would stay healthy or be worth re-signing to a monster free-agent deal.\n\nIn a sense, this marks the official end of the Doug Whaley era. Giving two first-round picks for Watkins in the 2014 draft was a fatal move by the former GM, an ill-advised reach that followed him for the rest of his tenure.\n\nThe new regime has now separated itself from the worst decision of the preceding administration. There will be more to come, I'm sure. Trading away their star receiver was hardly a show of support for quarterback Tyrod Taylor. It's enough to make you believe they wanted to diminish Taylor's weapons so the decision to part ways with him would be easier down the road.\n\nThese deals anticipate a future when Beane rebuilds the roster into a true contender, constructed around a legitimate franchise quarterback. They want to win now, but they have to know they diminished their chances. That means higher draft picks, which is a good thing.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T20:18:00Z", "sim": 0.6196078658103943, "source": {"uri": "buffalonews.com", "title": "The Buffalo News", "id": "16510"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "01:26:00", "url": "http://buffalonews.com/2017/08/11/jerry-sullivans-hot-read-trading-watkins-wise-move-long-run/", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8729135", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/bncore/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/sammy-bills-scull-011.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "20:18:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

Part of the somber vibe, he said, could be attributed to the fact that the Eagles were less than 48 hours removed from a preseason game and were put through a nearly three-hour, fully padded, live-hitting practice by coach Doug Pederson. But there is no question that Matthews' departure was weighing on the minds of many as well.\n\nWentz in particular seemed to be taking it hard.\n\n\"On the personal side, it's tough\" an emotional Wentz said as he was coming off the practice field. \"This is my first time experiencing this with someone that's one of my best friends. Seeing him yesterday, it's tough on him, too. It's kind of out of the blue.\"\n\nThere had been speculation about a possible Matthews trade for weeks now, but the timing \"blindsided\" Matthews, according to one of his teammates. The thought was that the window for a potential trade had passed. Matthews was finally feeling healthy and hitting his stride and expected to play out the final year of his rookie contract with the team that drafted him.\n\nThe Eagles weren't giving the impression that Matthews was in their long-term plans, however. Feeling good about the young receivers in the pipeline and in serious need of an upgrade at corner, executive vice president of football operations Howie Roseman pulled the trigger on a deal that sent Matthews and a 2018 third-round pick to Buffalo for talented defensive back Ronald Darby. The 23-year-old Darby was at practice Saturday but could not participate because Matthews had yet to pass his physical with the Bills.\n\nEagles players expressed optimism about what Darby can bring to the team and, to a man, said they understood the business side of it. For many, though, there was a sense of personal loss.\n\n\"The only way I can really relate it is like when you're in elementary school or middle school and your best friend growing up, you're going to the same school and then one day his parents move to a different city and he's gone,\" Burton said. \"And you're like, 'OK, what the heck do I do?'\"\n\nMatthews was part of a tight faith-based group within the team that attended the same church and regularly got together outside of work, as many did Friday for dinner. He evolved into a leader in the wide receiver room and for the team overall, earning a reputation as a teammate who would bend over backward to assist as many people as he could.\n\n\"From a personal standpoint, basically every time I do one-on-ones it's against Jordan Matthews,\" Jenkins explained. \"If I stay after to do releases with a receiver, it's going to be Jordan Matthews. So for me, even in my daily preparation, I now have got to find a new Jordan Matthews. And I know he's kind of been that guy in a bunch of guys' lives, whether it be Carson Wentz or Trey Burton, Zach Ertz -- he's had a big role in a lot of guys' lives, not only just what he does on the field.\"\n\nShowing just how tight they had become, Wentz was the one who drove Matthews to the airport. He said Roseman did not ask for his input before making the trade and notified him just before it went public.\n\n\"And he told me it was already done, so that's just kind of how that went,\" Wentz said. \"I just said, 'That's part of the business.' Obviously he knew how I felt with Jordan being one of my best friends. On the personal side it's tough, and he knew that. He was prepared for that and I told him that, but keeping business business, that's part of this.\"\n\nWentz said the Eagles have quality options on the roster to help account for Matthews' production. And when it comes to shaping this team, he said he puts his trust in the front office.\n\n\"Ultimately they're the ones that make those decisions, and what they think is best for the team I'm going to be in support of 100 percent,\" he said. \"They haven't let me down or haven't let this team down yet.\"\n\n\"But on the personal side,\" he added, \"it's tough.\"\n\nAccording to a source, the higher-ups were concerned about how a Matthews trade would affect the locker room. Chemistry is a fragile thing, and there's no telling how the dynamics will shift when a key component -- not to mention a best friend of the star quarterback -- is removed. Ultimately they decided to roll the dice in the name of adding balance to the roster. Most players understood the decision, but the football side took a backseat Saturday.\n\n\"For sure, yeah.\" said Burton, when asked if this was something that would take a while to bounce back from. \"Might not.\"", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T20:45:00Z", "sim": 0.6196078658103943, "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "title": "ESPN.com", "id": "4"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "20:45:00", "url": "http://www.espn.com/blog/philadelphia-eagles/post/_/id/21664", "storyUri": "eng-3355470", "id": "8841813", "image": "http://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2016%2F0925%2Fr130975_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "20:45:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

The Bills traded for Matthews immediately after parting ways with Sammy Watkins to the Los Angeles Rams. Matthews has had a good career so far for the Eagles by catching over 285 passes in only three seasons. However, one of the areas that Philly wants to make sure they all bases covered is at the cornerback position.\n\nThe Eagles defense has struggled to find its' way since the death of legendary defensive coordinator Jim Johnson several years ago. They've developed a habit over the years of beating down the field for big plays through the air.\n\nNow that the team seems to have settled all of its' offensive issues with the pieces added during the offseason, they want to make sure they do the same on defense as the regular season starts in less than a month. Ronald Darby's ability to make tackles and record INTs is something Philly hasn't seen since Asante Samuel was a member. So, Darby may just be the perfect fit.\n\nSince the Bills parted ways with their wideout from the last three seasons, Sammy Watkins, picking up Matthews was certainly a good move. He may not possess the same speed of Watkins, but his numbers are practically identical. He's also shown in Philly that he is consistent and works hard to stay in good health. Matthews has posted over 65 catches in all three seasons and has never racked up less than a total of 800 yards receiving yet.\n\nIn the team's first preseason game against the Green Bay Packers, Philly showed everyone that they have depth at the wide receiver position now. Alshon Jeffery and Torey Smith are expected to have huge seasons catching balls from Carson Wentz. Nelson Agholar has received a great deal of praise from the Eagles players and staff members and is believed to finally have a breakout season. Also, first-year wideout Mack Hollins showed some explosiveness when he caught the only touchdown of the game for Philly from Wentz. So, as valuable as Matthews has been, the loss doesn't hurt the Eagles as much, considering what they have to replace him.\n\nThe Bills are hoping to end their 17-year playoff drought this season. They have arguably the best player in the league on their roster in LeSean McCoy thanks to Philly a few years ago. Now, they have a dedicated receiver in Matthews that can help a young QB like Tyrod Taylor's numbers improve throughout the year. More importantly, they get a guy who seems to have high durability.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T22:28:00Z", "sim": 0.6196078658103943, "source": {"uri": "gearsofbiz.com", "title": "gearsofbiz.com", "id": "19218"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "14:07:00", "url": "http://gearsofbiz.com/nfl-news-who-came-out-better-in-the-eagles-bills-trade/7636", "storyUri": "eng-3355470", "id": "8924607", "image": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "22:28:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

Did trading Sammy Watkins and Ronald Darby make the Bills a better team?\n\n\"For the 2017 season?\" the Bills first-year general manager said. \"You could make arguments either way.\"\n\nHe has a point there, but I'll embrace the contrary argument. The trades, which I applaud, made them worse in the short term. You don't deal a starting cornerback and potential superstar wide receiver and get better.\n\nBut it's understandable if Beane and McDermott couldn't concede that it was a step back. They're competitors and genuinely believe they can make a playoff run this season while methodically building for the future.\n\nThe Bills got a solid veteran wideout, Jordan Matthews, and a 2018 third-round draft pick from the Eagles in the Darby deal. They got cornerback E.J. Gaines and an '18 second-rounder from the Rams in the Watkins trade.\n\nThis isn't a tank job, like the Sabres three and four years ago. Considering the grief that the Pegulas received for their hockey team's shameful losing campaign, you can understand why the owners wouldn't have the stomach to repeat it with their NFL franchise.\n\nSo in typical fashion, the Bills are out to win in the short term while hoping to get better down the road. Over the years, I've argued that middling it to placate fans has held the Bills back, costing them more chances to pick near the top of the draft and perhaps get their franchise quarterback.\n\nBeane and McDermott played it down the middle by bringing back Tyrod Taylor, Kyle Williams and LeSean McCoy. I felt stripping down the roster and bottoming out was more advisable, but evidently, they felt they could have it both ways. Friday is further evidence of that.\n\n\"I'm always going to try to win today and win tomorrow,\" Beane said. \"That's the nature, that's how I'm wired. That's how I think you win in this league. If I'm coming off a 14-2 season and someone offers me good capital, and what is a worthy investment, I have to consider it. That's what happened here.\"\n\nBut make no mistake, these deals are more about the future than the present. The Bills now own two picks in each of the first three rounds of the 2018 draft, a clear indication that Beane is determined to rebuild a thin roster and reshape the team in his first go-round as an NFL general manager.\n\nSome fans will object to moving Watkins when he finally appears healthy and appears to have rediscovered a bond with quarterback Tyrod Taylor. The Bills have removed the possibility of Watkins performing like a superstar in Buffalo. Matthews is solid, but not close to what Sammy can be if he's fully healthy.\n\nThe problem is, Watkins has never been fully healthy. Maybe his foot is healed, but he's had 10 separate injuries in his three years as a Bill. By keeping him, the Bills risked him suffering another injury that would seriously diminish his value. Plus, he'll be a free agent after the season.\n\n\"You do have to consider everything,\" Beane admitted. \"It's what he's done in his career over three seasons, how much he's played. You do consider all that. And again, he's going into the last year of his deal. Signability, cap situation, everything honestly went into this decision.\"\n\nThe Bills foreshadowed such an outcome when they decided not to pick up the fifth year of Watkins' original contract. At that point, you figured Watkins might not be in town much longer. You can't blame a GM for moving a player when his value is high, rather than risk losing him for nothing in free agency.\n\nWatkins wasn't their guy to begin with. Beane and McDermott gushed about Watkins and Darby on Friday, but it seemed like stock commentary. They can't have had faith in Sammy to stay healthy, or be worth the sort of monster extension his agent would be seeking if he had a very good year.\n\nThe new guys inherited Watkins, and the attendant issues. He wasn't their guy. So this feels like a curtain falling on the Doug Whaley era. Giving two first-round picks for Watkins in the 2014 draft was a fatal move by the former GM, an ill-advised reach that followed him for the rest of his tenure.\n\nDuring the 17-year drought, there have been too many of those moves, the ones intended to create a big splash and excite the fan base. A succession of GMs gave away high picks for other teams' leftovers. This administration seems intent on the opposite, on stockpiling draft currency.\n\nThe new regime has now separated itself from the Watkins trade, the fatal stroke of the previous administration and quite possibly the worst trade in team history. A separation from quarterback Tyrod Taylor seems inevitable as well. Trading away their star receiver was hardly a show of support for Taylor.\n\nTaylor is playing for another contract, for his future as a franchise QB. One month before the season, the Bills traded his best receiver, the guy who helped establish him as a lethal deep passer when Watkins was healthy and living up to his lofty reputation in the second half of 2015.\n\nHow do you sell this to Tyrod, I asked McDermott? You just traded away his best weapon in a contract year.\n\n\"I'll take it a step further,\" McDermott replied. \"How do you sell it to the entire team? My stance is to be honest and upfront with these guys. They know that we're going to do everything possible and make every decision that's in the best interest of this football team, short-and long term.\"\n\nMaybe Taylor lights it up and the Bills make a playoff push, making Beane look like a genius and giving Taylor bargaining power. I doubt it. These trades anticipate a future where Beane rebuilds the roster into a true contender, constructed around a new, young franchise quarterback. It can't have gone over well with the veterans.\n\nBeane became animated when he was asked what the trades say about Taylor's future in Buffalo.\n\n\"It doesn't say anything,\" Beane said. \"Everybody forgets we signed Anquan Boldin last week. This is not a throw-in-the-towel thing at all. Quite honestly, that's annoying to me. You don't know me if you think I'm throwing in the towel. If we play ping pong, I don't throw in the towel. If we were throwing in the towel, we wouldn't have got a receiver back.\n\n\"Tyrod is the No. 1 quarterback on this team right now,\" Beane said. \"We'll let that play out before we decide how it goes in 2018.\"\n\nStill, you don't accumulate six top picks in a quarterback-rich draft if you don't have designs on getting one. By Friday afternoon, it was becoming even clearer how the quarterback thing would play out.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T00:38:00Z", "sim": 0.6117647290229797, "source": {"uri": "buffalonews.com", "title": "The Buffalo News", "id": "16510"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "00:38:00", "url": "http://buffalonews.com/2017/08/11/make-no-mistake-watkins-trade-nod-future/", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8725123", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/bncore/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/1008349543-McCoy-Sports-B3.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "00:38:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

Here's a look at some of the positives and negatives.\n\nMy grade for this trade is a solid B rating.\n\nI'm not shocked the Eagles traded Matthews. The writing was on the wall. They weren't going to pay him after this year. Even if they wanted to, which I don't think they did, they likely wouldn't be able to afford him considering Philadelphia is tight on cap space after this season.\n\nThe Eagles' young wide receivers have looked good this offseason which made JMatt even more expendable. And the Eagles desperately needed help at corner so Darby is a great addition for Philadelphia's defense. Giving up a draft pick in addition to Matthews isn't ideal but it's not like JMatt had a ton of value since he's a contract year player.\n\nI liked Darby coming out of Florida State. He had a good rookie season in 2015 before suffering somewhat of a sophomore slump last season. I think he has the potential to be a good long-term starter for the Eagles.\n\nCornerback is a position that's plagued the Eagles for forever now. It's hard to blame the team for trying to invest a lot of resources there in order to get it right. The struggles of Philadelphia's current crop of corners in offseason practices necessitated the Eagles do something at the position before the season started.\n\nOverall, I'm quite OK with this trade.

Howie Roseman shipped out both Jordan Matthews and a 2018 third-round pick for the 23-year-old cornerback.\n\nSo, just how good is Darby anyway? In order to answer that question and others, I reached out to our friends at Buffalo Rumblings. Jeff Hunter (@MrJeffHunter) was kind enough to give us a Bills perspective on the Eagles' newest cornerback. Check out my Q&A with him below.\n\n1) How are Bills fans reacting to this trade? How do they feel about losing Darby? How do they feel about getting Jordan Matthews and a 2018 draft pick?\n\nIt's hard to consider this trade in a vacuum, because the Sammy Watkins-to-LA deal came together at the same time and complimented this trade so closely (GM Brandon Beane said as much as his presser about the deals). On that note, it's been hard to unpack the sentiment around Darby because all of the thunder is going to Watkins. Darby was pretty much locked in to be the number one cornerback, and he really hadn't seen much press during the offseason one way or the other. Throw in the fact that he's not due to hit free agency for another two years, and it's really just a huge shock. Nobody saw this one coming.\n\nAs far as the return, Matthews seems like a productive receiver but it's hard to tell where he'll fit with the Bills. Given that the team just signed Anquan Boldin last week, and Zay Jones didn't see much action in the loss to the Vikings on Thursday, it's hard to know what to expect because nobody's sure what he'll be doing besides catching passes. The draft pick, on the other hand, is what really has the fans chattering. After the trades, the Bills will have two picks in each of the first three rounds (as well as the chance to land a compensatory third with some clever roster maneuvers). Beane and Sean McDermott (McBeane, if you will) would never admit to a tank, and the roster seems somewhat competitive for 2017, but these moves were clearly about the future and the third-round pick is a big part of that.\n\n2) What are Darby's strengths?\n\nDarby is what I'd call a low-key lockdown corner; he's not going to get an island named after him, but he's capable of keeping just about any receiver out there in check. He's always been great at breaking up passes, and he's a solid tackler. He was a contender for the Defensive Rookie of the Year award that went to Marcus Peters a couple years ago, and nobody was really worried about his ability to take over for Stephon Gilmore as the team's top cornerback.\n\n3) What are Darby's weaknesses?\n\nThe general assumption that's come out of the trade is that Darby wasn't a fit for McDermott's defense, which usually uses a Cover 3 scheme and relies heavily on zone coverage. Rex Ryan's defense was very man-based, which suited Darby's physicality. It's also worth noting that, while he does have 33 pass breakups in two seasons, he only has two interceptions, both in 2015. A few of those pass breakups could have been interceptions in a different corner's hands (not necessarily better, but different)\n\n4) It seems like Darby had more success in 2015 than he did last year. Is that accurate? Any reason for that?\n\nIt's right on the nose to say that Darby regressed in 2016, but it's hard to say exactly why. The Bills struggled with safety play last year to a huge extent, but even Darby was struggling to hold on to his job near the end of the year. He suffered a concussion and missed a game in December, but his problems were around well before that. I hate to throw out cliches like \"sophomore slump,\" but it's still kind of a mystery and something that could easily right itself moving forward.\n\n5) Do you believe Darby can be a good starting cornerback in the NFL? What's his ceiling? Is he a No. 1 cornerback? One of the better starting corners in the league?\n\nDarby is a clear-cut number one corner on many rosters, and if he weren't he'd be one of the best number two corners in the league. The only thing holding him back from real prominence (aside from the aforementioned slump) is his inability to convert pass breakups into interceptions. If he can start hanging on to the ball, he's a Pro Bowler.\n\n6) To the best of your knowledge, what's your impression of Darby off the field?\n\nDarby seems like a pretty nice guy. He shouldn't be a troublemaker or anything like that, and he was active in the community in Buffalo from what I've seen. He can speak his mind on Twitter sometimes (@realronalddarby), but nothing incendiary.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T11:24:00Z", "sim": 0.6117647290229797, "source": {"uri": "bleedinggreennation.com", "title": "Bleeding Green Nation", "id": "6261"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "17:44:00", "url": "https://www.bleedinggreennation.com/2017/8/12/16138004/ronald-darby-profile-bills-buffalo-cornerback-trade-jordan-matthews-florida-state-seminoles-philly", "storyUri": "eng-3355470", "id": "8824309", "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eU9wBqRk2OwYuqegOhLZ9Ti_8AE=/0x435:2268x1711/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56163563/usa_today_8923519.0.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "11:24:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

Then, the Bills trade everyone. Despite showing flashes of being a star, it didn't work out, as Watkins was often injured. He was the 51st-overall selection of the 2015 NFL Draft. Let's break it down in some fantasy terms to what the landscape might look like after this blockbuster trade. The Rams were certainly aware of this, but it didn't deter them from giving up some capital for the receiver. However, I am not too pleased with it. One that had Sammy Watkins catching the first three passes.\n\nIt appears that the Bills are building for the future, as they now hold the Chiefs' 2018 first-round pick, the Rams' 2018 second-round pick, and the Eagles 2018 third-round pick. \"I think this defense is a great match for my skill set and I'm excited to get out there\". Is Gaines an upgrade over Darby?\n\n\"It's we, not me\", Snead said, echoing McVay's rallying cry for this team. Darby, a man-coverage specialist, is coming off a down sophomore campaign, after his 21 passes defensed as a second-round rookie in 2015 ranked fifth in the NFL.\n\nIt is no secret the Eagles had their concerns with the cornerback position. He was slated on the depth charge to start at cornerback this season. He is capable, but he was not as good as Gaines was in the past.\n\nIt gives them a legitimate No. 1 receiver.\n\nAustin will cost the Rams close to $15 million toward the salary cap this season, after which the Rams can cut ties with him and absorb only $5 million toward the cap. Gaines was a bit of a project and was developing quite nicely. \"We know we were going to have tough decisions to make\". Thus, they're willing to pony up for what they presume is a healthy Sammy Watkins. Kayvon Webster will be the top cornerback and Troy Hill will be the number two corner. However, he needs to listen to his assistants, especially Wade Phillips.\n\n\"I'm invested. I know and feel what they feel\", McDermott said, referring to Bills fans.\n\nAnother major problem is Sammy is in the a year ago of his contract. The risks are outweighing the rewards at this point. Matthews sat out much of the recent offseason minicamps and organized team activities (OTAs) with knee tendonitis, but still accompanied the other wide receivers to North Dakota for a series of informal workouts with Wentz last month. Somebody mentioned that somebody said that out there, and honestly, that's annoying to me. The Rams now weakened a position of uncertainty for a very uncertain receiver. Matthews is also entering the final season of his contract.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T23:26:00Z", "sim": 0.6117647290229797, "source": {"uri": "hitechfacts.com", "title": "hitechfacts.com", "id": "19167"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "08:57:00", "url": "http://hitechfacts.com/2017/08/bills-trade-sammy-watkins-to-rams-land-jordan-matthews-from/", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8892983", "image": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "23:26:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

The club acquired the Kansas City Chiefs' first-round pick in the trade that allowed Kansas City to move up in this year's draft and select QB Patrick Mahomes. Friday's deal with the Rams brought back a second-round choice and CB E.J. Gaines for Watkins and a 2018 sixth-round pick. The trade with Philadelphia netted Buffalo WR Jordan Matthews and a 2018 third-rounder for Darby.\n\nThe draft outcome for Buffalo is that it will have plenty of flexibility to trade up if needed, and for a franchise that has new faces in both the general manager (Brandon Beane) and head coach (Sean McDermott) roles, the timing could be right for a first-round quarterback.\n\nThe 2018 draft is expected to be a very strong one for the quarterback position, although it remains to be seen which underclassmen will file for early draft eligibility. Among the top quarterback prospects in the college ranks are USC's Sam Darnold, UCLA's Josh Rosen, Wyoming's Josh Allen and Louisville's Lamar Jackson. Bills starting QB Tyrod Taylor has steadied the position for the Bills over the last two seasons after the club moved on from its previous first-round quarterback investment, EJ Manuel. But the Bills aren't beholden long-term to Taylor financially, with only $1 million of his contract guaranteed for 2018, per NFL Network's Tom Pelissero.\n\nThe Bills have three quarterbacks on their roster: Taylor, nine-year veteran T.J. Yates and rookie Nathan Peterman, a fifth-round pick from Pitt selected in this year's draft.\n\nThe Bills aren't the only team that has stockpiled early selections in next year's draft. The Cleveland Browns have done so as well, with a pair of first-round selections and three picks in Round 2. The Browns invested a second-round pick at quarterback this year with Notre Dame's DeShone Kizer.\n\nOf course, the Bills aren't necessarily making these moves with spending their top pick in 2018 on a QB in mind.\n\n\"(The Bills are) adding picks just because that's good business,\" said NFL.com analyst Lance Zierlein. \"But they'll have the capital to get a top quarterback if that's the direction they want to go.\"\n\nGiven the talent at the position that could be available, it might be tough to resist.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T16:59:00Z", "sim": 0.6078431606292725, "source": {"uri": "nfl.com", "title": "NFL.com", "id": "5624"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "20:26:00", "url": "http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000827802/article/bills-positioned-as-top-player-for-qb-in-2018-draft-after-trades", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8695707", "image": "http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/photo/2017/08/11/0ap3000000828590_thumbnail_200_150.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "16:59:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

Wentz said Saturday that it won't be easy to replace Matthews in the locker room while adding that he trusted the team's football decisions.\n\n\"It's tough,\" Wentz said, via Philly.com. \"It's one of those things where there's the personal side to things and the football side to things. The football side of things, you just got to trust what they're doing upstairs. Ultimately, they're the ones that make those decisions. And what they think is best for the team, I'm going to be in support of 100 percent. They haven't let me down or haven't let this team down yet.\"\n\nCoach Doug Pederson was asked if he was concerned about how the trade would be received in the locker room.\n\n\"Well, I'm going to tell you this: I lean back on my career and the times that I had and the things, the situations and the people that I see,\" Pederson said in comments distributed by the team. \"Listen, it's decisions you got to make that are tough for the organization, for the individuals involved. But listen, it's like anything that we do in life - the next person steps up and here we go. We can sit and have poor attitudes and all that, but at the same time we're happy for both parties, and we're moving forward. That's business as usual.\"\n\nAny locker room response will likely be affected by how Darby impacts the defense. Ertz and Pederson both said they feel there are players capable of stepping into the slot receiver role left vacant by Matthews, but that wasn't the case at cornerback and strong play from Darby should give the Eagles a better chance of winning games than they had before the trade.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T13:09:00Z", "sim": 0.6039215922355652, "source": {"uri": "profootballtalk.nbcsports.com", "title": "profootballtalk.nbcsports.com", "id": "18457"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "13:09:00", "url": "http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2017/08/13/carson-wentz-its-tough-to-see-jordan-matthews-go/", "storyUri": "eng-3355470", "id": "8918355", "image": "https://nbcprofootballtalk.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/626335710-e1502626266735.jpg?w=640", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "13:09:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

Gaines to the Buffalo Bills.\n\nThe Rams also gave up a second-round pick in the 2018 draft and acquired a sixth-round pick in the 2018 draft in the deal.\n\nWatkins, 24, was the fourth overall pick in the 2014 draft after playing in college at Clemson.\n\nHe caught 65 passes and scored six touchdowns as a rookie, and had 60 catches and nine touchdowns in 2015.\n\n\"He is going to help add some depth to that receiver room,\" coach Sean McVay said during a charity luncheon Friday, adding, \"We want to make sure we are using the width and depth of the field in the pass game and a player like Sammy Watkins definitely gives you the ability to do that.\"\n\n\"Sammy has proven he can be a productive player and an explosive receiver in this league, we look forward to having him in a Rams uniform,\" Rams general manager Les Snead said in a statement. \"We want to thank E.J. for all he has contributed to our organization since we drafted him in 2014.\"\n\nLast season, because of a foot injury, Watkins was limited to eight games. He caught 28 passes, two for touchdowns.\n\nWatkins is coming off January foot surgery. He will earn $3.1 million this season in the final year of his rookie contract.\n\nHis injury problems - he was sidelined for 11 games the last two seasons -- caused the Bills to pass on exercising their fifth-year option, which would have cost about $13.3 million.\n\nWatkins caught four passes - including three on the Bills' first three plays - in Buffalo's 17-10 preseason loss to the Minnesota Vikings on Thursday.\n\nSnead said the Rams had been \"flirting with Buffalo and Sammy\" since spring.\n\nThe talks intensified after the Bills declined to exercise their fifth-year option on Watkins and the Rams declined to exercise their fifth-year option on since-traded offensive tackle Greg Robinson.\n\n\"He's 24,\" Snead said when asked about whether this was a long-range move. \"You don't just do it for the now, although we do think he'll help the now.\"\n\nSnead said the Rams studied Watkins' injury history.\n\n\"When you dove into it, we felt comfortable taking the risk,\" he said.\n\nWatkins, 6-foot-1 and 211 pounds, joins a receiving corps that includes former Bills teammate Robert Woods, Tavon Austin and rookie Cooper Kupp.\n\nAnd he gives the Rams a legitimate deep threat.\n\nThat has been an element sorely lacking during training camp, and one that is important to McVay's offense.\n\nAustin and rookie Josh Reynolds have been sidelined because of hamstring injuries.

The Bills traded for Matthews immediately after parting ways with Sammy Watkins to the Los Angeles Rams. Matthews has had a good career so far for the Eagles by catching over 285 passes in only three seasons. However, one of the areas that Philly wants to make sure they all bases covered is at the cornerback position.\n\nThe Eagles defense has struggled to find its' way since the death of legendary defensive coordinator Jim Johnson several years ago. They've developed a habit over the years of beating down the field for big plays through the air.\n\nNow that the team seems to have settled all of its' offensive issues with the pieces added during the offseason, they want to make sure they do the same on defense as the regular season starts in less than a month. Ronald Darby's ability to make tackles and record INTs is something Philly hasn't seen since Asante Samuel was a member. So, Darby may just be the perfect fit.\n\nSince the Bills parted ways with their wideout from the last three seasons, Sammy Watkins, picking up Matthews was certainly a good move. He may not possess the same speed of Watkins, but his numbers are practically identical. He's also shown in Philly that he is consistent and works hard to stay in good health. Matthews has posted over 65 catches in all three seasons and has never racked up less than a total of 800 yards receiving yet.\n\nIn the team's first preseason game against the Green Bay Packers, Philly showed everyone that they have depth at the wide receiver position now. Alshon Jeffery and Torey Smith are expected to have huge seasons catching balls from Carson Wentz. Nelson Agholar has received a great deal of praise from the Eagles players and staff members and is believed to finally have a breakout season. Also, first-year wideout Mack Hollins showed some explosiveness when he caught the only touchdown of the game for Philly from Wentz. So, as valuable as Matthews has been, the loss doesn't hurt the Eagles as much, considering what they have to replace him.\n\nThe Bills are hoping to end their 17-year playoff drought this season. They have arguably the best player in the league on their roster in LeSean McCoy thanks to Philly a few years ago. Now, they have a dedicated receiver in Matthews that can help a young QB like Tyrod Taylor's numbers improve throughout the year. More importantly, they get a guy who seems to have high durability.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T18:27:00Z", "sim": 0.6039215922355652, "source": {"uri": "us.blastingnews.com", "title": "Blasting News", "id": "6890"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "08:57:00", "url": "http://us.blastingnews.com/sports/2017/08/nfl-news-who-came-out-better-in-the-eagles-bills-trade-001919439.html", "storyUri": "eng-3355470", "id": "8893020", "image": "http://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2017/8/9/660x290/b_1433x630/eagles-trade-jordan-matthews-to-the-bills-image-credit-youtubecbs-sports_1503863.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "18:27:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

Gaines and a 2018 second-round pick from the Rams and wide receiver Jordan Matthews and a 2018 third-round pick from the Eagles, which gives the Bills two picks in each of the first three rounds of next year's draft. That suggests a look toward the future over the present, but General Manager Brandon Beane sees it differently.\n\nIn discussing the trade on Friday afternoon, Beane said \"you could make arguments either way\" about whether the team is better in the short term and was adamant that the team isn't looking past this year.\n\n\"This is not a throw in the towel thing at all. ... You don't know me if you think I'm throwing in the towel,\" Beane said, via Jay Skurski of the Buffalo News.\n\nIt's hard to miss the appeal of getting a bunch of early picks in the first draft that Beane will be running in Buffalo or to fault the Bills for getting something for Watkins when the organization was clearly reluctant to make a long-term commitment to him, but it's also hard to see it as a move that leaves the team likelier to win in 2017. That's not necessarily a bad thing.\n\nThe Bills weren't exactly odds-on favorites to do big things this year and Beane and coach Sean McDermott can now shape the team as they see fit, which provides plenty of rationale for Friday's moves even if you disagree with Beane's take on towel throwing.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T19:52:00Z", "sim": 0.6000000238418579, "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "title": "Yahoo Sports", "id": "2139"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "23:04:00", "url": "https://sports.yahoo.com/brandon-beane-aren-t-throwing-205625585.html", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8715988", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ClN1WypiEUo6_YUIp1x0gw--/aD0xMDI1O3c9MTUxMjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/9dc7cda5827ad9a70d4811f0c7d088ce", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "19:52:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

Watkins and Darby were two of Buffalo's best players, and fans were absolutely startled. Fans immediately began panicking, giving up on a 2017 season that they weren't optimistic for anyway. While 2017 might not be a fun year for the Bills, perhaps 2018 will be. After this off-season, the Buffalo Bills are building for the future.\n\nWhile the Darby and Watkins trades were the flashiest, they weren't the only trades the Buffalo Bills made this off-season. They also traded the 10th overall pick in this year's draft to the Kansas City Chiefs for their first and a third in that draft and a first in next year's draft. They've actually collected quite a few draft picks for next year's draft, and they are as follows.\n\nNot only do they have a ton of draft picks, but they're also set to have $33,847,003 in cap space for free agency. If we're being completely honest, it's not like the Buffalo Bills were going to be serious contenders in 2017 anyway. Tom Brady is still around, and their schedule is forcing them to play against the Oakland Raiders, Kansas City Chiefs, Denver Bronocos, Carolina Panthers, Atlanta Falcons, and several other really talented teams.\n\nA single draft can completely alter the future of a franchise. Just look at what the Oakland Raiders did in 2014, drafting Khalil Mack, Derek Carr, and Gabe Jackson, and they didn't have six picks in the first three rounds like the Bills do.\n\nIt's easy to see why some people are saying the Buffalo Bills are tanking this year, and in a way, they're not wrong. The Buffalo Bills aren't going to win the Super Bowl this year. They'd be overachieving if they managed to break .500 at all. But with so much cap space and so many draft picks, the future looks bright in Buffalo.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-10T22:00:00Z", "sim": 0.6000000238418579, "source": {"uri": "lastwordonprofootball.com", "title": "Last Word on Pro Football", "id": "19195"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "03:32:00", "url": "http://lastwordonprofootball.com/2017/08/11/buffalo-bills-building-future/", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8867626", "image": "http://lwosonnfl.ms.lastwordonsports.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2017/08/674614324.jpg", "date": "2017-08-10", "time": "22:00:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

But there is no question that Matthews' departure was weighing on the minds of many as well.\n\nWentz in particular seemed to be taking it hard.\n\n\"On the personal side, it's tough\" an emotional Wentz said as he was coming off the practice field. \"This is my first time experiencing this with someone that's one of my best friends. Seeing him yesterday, it's tough on him, too. It's kind of out of the blue.\"\n\nThere had been speculation about a possible Matthews trade for weeks now, but the timing \"blindsided\" Matthews, according to one of his teammates. The thought was that the window for a potential trade had passed. Matthews was finally feeling healthy and hitting his stride and expected to play out the final year of his rookie contract with the team that drafted him.\n\nThe Eagles weren't giving the impression that Matthews was in their long-term plans, however. Feeling good about the young receivers in the pipeline and in serious need of an upgrade at corner, executive vice president of football operations Howie Roseman pulled the trigger on a deal that sent Matthews and a 2018 third-round pick to Buffalo for talented defensive back Ronald Darby. The 23-year-old Darby was at practice Saturday but could not participate since Matthews had yet to pass his physical with the Bills.\n\nEagles players expressed optimism about what Darby can bring to the team and, to a man, said they understood the business side of it. For many, though, there was a sense of personal loss.\n\n\"The only way I can really relate it is like when you're in elementary school or middle school and your best friend growing up, you're going to the same school and then one day his parents move to a different city and he's gone,\" said Burton. \"And you're like, 'OK, what the heck do I do?'\"\n\nMatthews was part of a tight faith-based group within the team that attended the same church and regularly got together outside of work, as many did Friday for dinner. He evolved into a leader in the wide receiver room and for the team overall, earning a reputation as a teammate who would bend over backwards to assist as many people as he could.\n\n\"From a personal standpoint, basically every time I do one-on-ones it's against Jordan Matthews,\" Jenkins explained. \"If I stay after to do releases with a receiver, it's going to be Jordan Matthews. So for me, even in my daily preparation, I now have got to find a new Jordan Matthews. And I know he's kind of been that guy in a bunch of guy's lives, whether it be Carson Wentz or Trey Burton, Zach Ertz, he's had a big role in a lot of guys' lives, not only just what he does on the field.\"\n\nShowing just how tight they had become, Wentz was the one that drove Matthews to the airport. He said Roseman did not ask for his input prior to making the trade and notified him just before it went public.\n\n\"And he told me it was already done, so that's just kind of how that went,\" Wentz said. \"I just said, 'That's part of the business.' Obviously he knew how I felt with Jordan being one of my best friends. On the personal side it's tough, and he knew that, he was prepared for that and I told him that, but keeping business business, that's part of this.\"\n\nWentz believes the Eagles have quality options on the roster to help account for Matthews' production. And when it comes to shaping this team, he said he puts his trust in the front office.\n\n\"Ultimately they're the ones that make those decisions, and what they think is best for the team I'm going to be in support of 100 percent,\" he said. \"They haven't let me down or haven't let this team down yet.\"\n\n\"But on the personal side,\" he added, \"it's tough.\"\n\nAccording to a source, the higher-ups were concerned about how a Matthews trade would impact the locker room. Chemistry is a fragile thing, and there's no telling how the dynamics will shift when a key component -- not to mention the best friend of the star quarterback -- is removed. Ultimately, they decided to roll the dice in the name of adding balance to the roster. Most players understood the decision, but the football side of this took a backseat Saturday.\n\n\"For sure, yeah.\" said Burton, when asked if this was something that would take a while to bounce back from. \"Might not.\"", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T20:09:00Z", "sim": 0.6000000238418579, "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "title": "ESPN.com", "id": "4"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "20:09:00", "url": "http://www.espn.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/244176", "storyUri": "eng-3355470", "id": "8838627", "image": "http://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2016%2F0925%2Fr130975_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "20:09:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

The Eagles' first preseason game?) when the Birds suddenly traded wideout Jordan Matthews and a 2018 third-rounder to the Bills for cornerback Ronald Darby.\n\nAt first glance, it's clear Philadelphia was 1) really worried about its group of cornerbacks and 2) didn't plan to (or figured they couldn't) re-sign Matthews after his rookie contract was up.\n\nAnd as the Philadelphia Daily News' Les Bowen tweeted, starting cornerbacks are more valuable than wide receivers, which explains why the Eagles had to add a third-round draft pick to the deal.\n\nMatthews was far and away the only decent wideout for the Birds last season, and his production over his first three years was absolutely solid if not spectaular.\n\nSo his departure means Philly will be even more reliant on newcomer free agents Alshon Jeffery and Torrey Smith, a hopefully rejuvenated Nelson Agholor and rookie Mack Hollins.\n\nDarby, 23, is intriguing, though. The 5-11, 193-pounder, who was a second-round selection by Buffalo in 2015 out of Florida State, earned Pro Football Focus' Defensive Rookie of the Year Award after recording 68 tackles, 21 pass breakups and two interceptions. He permitted 54.3-percent of passes to be completed against him for 660 yards and only four touchdowns.\n\nHis sophomore season, however, wasn't as productive. Among qualifying corners in 2016, he ranked 54th against the pass and 11th against the run, according to Pro Football Focus.\n\nBut unless there's some issue we don't know about, Darby -- a young, talented player with two years as a starter under his belt -- immediately represents an upgrade in the Eagles' secondary.\n\nAnd if 2017 second-rounder Sidney Jones fully recovers from his torn Achilles (which may not be until 2018), he and Darby could form an impressive starting cornerback duo -- something the Birds have lacked for far too long.\n\nPaula Wolf works in the Opinion section at LNP.

While the Eagles had long-term hope at the position, this is a team that should be capable of competing as early as this season. Cornerback was their biggest weakness.\n\nNow they have a promising option in both the short term and long term in Darby, who was stunningly effective during his debut season in Buffalo before slipping badly last season. Defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz has done excellent work with undersized corners in years past, notably launching Cortland Finnegan's career in Tennessee. It's too early to suggest Darby's a reclamation project, but dealing a wide receiver the Eagles were unlikely to sign for a likely starter at cornerback is a totally logical move, even if it did hurt to give up a third-round pick in the process.\n\nNext up, Jeff Hunter of our SB Nation sister site, Buffalo Rumblings, checks in.\n\nI'm entirely blindsided by it, not in the least because the Bills also just shipped Sammy Watkins out to LA. Darby had a monster rookie season, but he definitely hit something of a lull last year. His ball skills aren't great, but he's generally a solid cover corner who isn't going to give up a ton of receptions. He's under contract for two more years ... he was a second-round pick, so no fifth-year option decision to worry about. He's definitely starter material, but it's hard to say whether he can return to the shutdown potential he showed in his rookie year.\n\nHere's an interesting 2015 article from Pro Football Focus. PFF named Darby their Defensive Rookie of the Year that season.\n\nDarby wasn't the most heralded cornerback from this draft class heading into the season, and with another rookie leading the league in interceptions and pass breakups, it's fair to say that he isn't really getting the credit he deserves at the end of the year. In all honesty, we didn't see a better performance by a rookie all year, though. Darby stepped right in and started from day one, instantly becoming Buffalo's best cover corner.\n\nHe allowed just four touchdowns all season, all of which came in a two-game span against the Kansas City Chiefs and Houston Texans. Darby allowed just 660 receiving yards throughout the year, he was tied for fifth amongst cornerbacks with 13 pass breakups, and finished the year with the ninth-highest coverage grade for corners. There is still plenty of room for Darby to grow, with just two interceptions over the course of the year, and a reception of 20 yards or more allowed in six games in 2015. Nevertheless, it was an impressive rookie campaign that has Bills fans eager for the future, and rightfully so.\n\nIn case you missed it, here's the reaction from us right here at Bleeding Green Nation.\n\nAgain: wow. This certainly came out of nowhere.\n\nThen again, the writing was always on the wall in the Matthews situation. He was entering a contract year and it was very unlikely the Eagles could or would pay him after this season. Philadelphia decided to get value now by shipping him out.\n\nIn return for Matthews, the Eagles get some desperately needed help at cornerback.

He's been the team's best player at the position in recent seasons so it seemed somewhat inconceivable that general manager Howie Roseman would want to deal the three-year pro. Well, it didn't take long for the team to find a partner. But the key here is that Doug Pederson's club got something that the team needed in return - even if the price was a little on the steep side.\n\nVia ESPN Adam Schefter's Twitter account, the Philadelphia Eagles acquired some much-needed help at cornerback.\n\n\"Eagles acquire CB #Ronald Darby from Buffalo for WR #Jordan Matthews and a 2018 third-round pick.\" The two-year defender enjoyed a solid rookie season in 2015 under head coach Rex Ryan. But like so many other players that were members of the Buffalo Bills in recent years, the new regime chose to make them available. You will recall that the club watched wideout Robert Woods sign with the Los Angeles Rams this offseason. And not long after the Matthews deal was announced, Schefter had some more news to share about head coach Sean McDermott's team. \"Bills have acquired CB E.J. Gaines and Rams 2018 second round pick for WR Sammy Watkins and Bills 2018 sixth round pick.\"\n\nThe moves reunites Woods and Watkins, giving new head coach Sean McVay more options for still-learning quarterback Jared Goff.\n\nBut let's not bury the lead when it comes to Pederson's team.\n\nA year ago, the Philadelphia Eagles hired longtime coach and former sideline leader of the Detroit Lions Jim Schwartz to be their defensive coordinator. The team made strides but was still looking for some help at cornerback. Nolan Carroll left the City of Brotherly Love for the NFC East rival Dallas Cowboys via free agency. Understandably, Roseman has brought in his share of former Bills' players the last two years who played under Schwartz in 2014, when he was Buffalo's DC. Recently, the team signed cornerback/safety Corey Graham [VIDEO] (released by the Bills this offseason) to aid their cause.\n\nMeanwhile, Darby was a second-round pick in 2015. While he did not play under Schwartz, he should adapt very quickly to his new unit. The addition of the young defender along with the recent pickup of Graham is very good news for an Eagles' team that appears to be on the rise.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T17:13:00Z", "sim": 0.5960784554481506, "source": {"uri": "us.blastingnews.com", "title": "Blasting News", "id": "6890"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "10:03:00", "url": "http://us.blastingnews.com/sports/2017/08/philadelphia-eagles-cb-ronald-darby-now-a-member-of-the-birds-001922705.html", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8774844", "image": "http://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2017/8/10/660x290/b_1433x630/photo-credit-benphotos-wikimedia-commons_1503493.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "17:13:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

Time will tell. In many cases, no matter how popular or inspirational a player may be, his departure has little residual impact on the team dynamic.\n\nNFL rosters are too large. Football is too cut-throat, and typically on-the-field performances often overshadow off-the-field intangibles for there to be adverse consequences once a beloved player leaves. Even at quarterback.\n\nBut Matthews wasn't your typical teammate. The wide receiver was as well-liked as any player because he could relate to many different personalities. He was as respected as any player because he worked harder than most and played through injuries.\n\nAnd, oh yeah, he also happened to be the quarterback's best friend on the team.\n\n\"It's tough,\" Carson Wentz said on Saturday. \"It's one of those things where there's the personal side to things and the football side to things. The football side of things, you just got to trust what they're doing upstairs. Ultimately, they're the ones that make those decisions. And what they think is best for the team, I'm going to be in support of 100 percent.\n\n\"They haven't let me down or haven't let this team down yet.\"\n\nWentz said that Howie Roseman told him of the trade after it was completed but before it was announced. The second-year quarterback shouldn't have been consulted before the move, but the Eagles' de facto general manager likely took his well-being into account.\n\nRoseman did this offseason - at least on the field -- when he surrounded Wentz with several new receiving and running pieces. He did so at the expense of the secondary, and eventually the inadequacy of the cornerbacks came home to roost.\n\nSeeming to have depth at receiver, and particularly the slot, the Eagles packaged Matthews with a 2018 third-round draft pick to the Bills for Darby, a two-year starter who has two years left on his contract.\n\nThe jury is still out on whether the 23-year-old cornerback will perform more as he did as a rookie (good) or last season (not so good). But he should instantly become the No. 1 corner, which may say as much about Jalen Mills and Patrick Robinson as it does Darby.\n\nMatthews' production had waned in 2016. Coach Doug Pederson had initially tried him on the outside that spring, but his inability to get separation against man coverage resulted in a return to the slot. He was a zone beater in the middle of the field, however, and his route running often him made him Wentz's safety valve.\n\n\"We were so close off the field that on the field that helped,\" Wentz said.\n\nCrazy part of this business. J-Matt was the best teammate and friend you could ask for. Crazy how close you can get with someone in a year. Love you bro. I'll definitely miss doing this with you!\n\nA post shared by Carson Wentz (@cj_wentz11) on Aug 11, 2017 at 10:17am PDT\n\nNelson Agholor, who has seemingly improved this offseason, is expected to take most of Matthews' snaps inside. He was primarily in the slot during Saturday's practice. Rookie Mack Hollins, who made an impression by scoring the Eagles' only touchdown in their preseason opener, should also get opportunities.\n\nBut the versatility of tight ends Zach Ertz and Trey Burton and running backs Darren Sproles and Donnel Pumphrey should also give Pederson alternatives if Agholor reverts to his old self.\n\n\"The good news,\" Ertz said, \"is that on paper we got a lot of guys that can fill the spot.\"\n\nThe Eagles should have enough leaders to fill Matthews' void, although the receivers room doesn't have a replacement quite as stirring. Alshon Jeffery is quiet. Torrey Smith has those qualities, but he is new and more reserved than Matthews. Agholor may have the additional pressure of stepping into those leadership shoes.\n\nBut it's not just the receivers who will be affected. Safety Malcolm Jenkins, who routinely faced off against Matthews in 1-on-1 drills and sought the receiver out for post-practice work, said that he would have \"to find a new Jordan Matthews ... and I know he's been kind of that guy for a bunch of different guy's lives.\"\n\nNFL rosters are ever-changing. But only 25 of the 90 players on the Eagles' roster were here before the 2016 offseason.\n\n\"That amount of transition,\" Jenkins said, \"it definitely puts a little bit of pressure on your leaders and guys in the locker room to set the culture.\"\n\nAsked if Matthews' exit would have any resonance in the locker room, Pederson said that he would he lean on his experience as a former player. But the rest of his response seemed to be lacking in emotional intelligence.\n\n\"We can sit and have poor attitudes and all that, but at the same time we're happy for both parties, and we're moving forward,\" Pederson said. \"That's business as usual.\"\n\nWhile it may have been business as usual for the coach - and Saturday's grueling practice two days after playing in Green Bay suggested as much - several players said the trade was still reverberating at the NovaCare Complex.\n\n\"And then have a 2-hour, 40-minute practice, full pads, live [tackling],\" Jenkins said. \"Yeah, the mood is a little bit down today.\"\n\nMatthews was part of Wentz's core group of friends on the team. The six of them - Ertz, Burton, linebacker Jordan Hicks and safety Chris Maragos were the others - attended church on Sundays together and socialized away from football.\n\nOn Friday, the group went out to dinner at Bar Amis in the Navy Yard and then drove Matthews to the airport.\n\n\"It was emotional,\" Ertz said.\n\nThere is a lot about football that is easy to quantify. Locker room harmony is not one, although some believe it has as much importance as yards and touchdowns.\n\n\"Replacing a guy like that in the locker room,\" Wentz said, \"is definitely not going to be easy.\"\n\nWill it ultimately matter in the win-loss column?\n\nRead more by Jeff McLane Published: August 12, 2017 \u00e2\u0080\" 3:01 AM EDT | Updated: August 12, 2017 \u00e2\u0080\" 7:26 PM EDT\n\nThanks for your continued support...\n\nWe recently asked you to support our journalism.

What does it mean for the fantasy value of Watkins, Matthews and all the other players affected?\n\nLet's start with Watkins and the Rams. As it stands, Watkins is getting a QB downgrade going from Tyrod Taylor to Jared Goff. Watkins has averaged 8.9 yards per target and scored a TD on 6.2% of his targets; Goff has averaged only 5.3 yards per attempt and thrown a TD on 2.4% of his attempts. On the plus-side, however, Watkins and Goff will be operating under new Rams coach Sean McVay, whose offensive wizardry as the Washington offensive coordinator transformed QB Kirk Cousins. It's not out of the question that Goff makes a Year 2 leap.\n\nWatkins' arrival should help Rams RB Todd Gurley by distracting defenses near the line of scrimmage. But a new No. 1 WR in town hurts sleepers Robert Woods and Cooper Kupp, who were previously vying for the Rams' top receiving role.\n\nAs for Watkins himself, his outlook doesn't change as much as you would think. The Bills were already expected to shift more of a high-percentage passing game this season, which wouldn't have suited Watkins, who averages a lid-lifting 16.1 yards per reception in his career. Watkins, pegged as the No. 21 WR in standard leagues and the No. 28 WR in PPR leagues in 4for4 rankings, is an added risk in PPR leagues because of the uncertainty surrounding the QB change, and of course, Watkins' health; he has missed 11 games over the past two seasons.\n\nMoving on to the Bills, Matthews's fantasy stock increases because he leaves the Eagles' crowded receiving corps to become the automatic No. 1 option in Buffalo. But the increase is slight. 4for4 projects Matthews for under five TDs, which results in him being best served as a fantasy WR4/5 on your bench.\n\nWhy is Matthews' outlook as bleak as a blustery December day in Buffalo? Matthews is predominantly a slot receiver, but Tyrod Taylor notoriously struggles to throw over the middle -- it's one of the main reasons why he almost wasn't re-signed by Buffalo this season. And then there's the fact that Matthews lacks upside because he'd be over his head if Buffalo tries to turn him into an outside WR. Matthews has struggled mightily throughout his career when asked to play on the outside, and couldn't even crack 6 yards per target while playing one-third of his snaps there last season.\n\nAll you have to do is compare Watkins' career stats to Matthews' to see that Taylor's fantasy value takes a hit as well. As mentioned earlier, Watkins has produced 8.9 yards per target in his career/ Matthews, meanwhile has managed only 7.7. And when Watkins has been out of the lineup over the past two seasons, Taylor's yards per attempt suffers a devastating drop: 8.8 to 6.6. Despite finishing as the No. 8 fantasy QB in each of the past two seasons, Taylor has tumbled to No. 14 in the 4for4 QB projections. The combination of losing Watkins and a new scheme may be too much to overcome for Taylor to be an every-week starter in 2017.\n\nAs for the Eagles, Matthews' departure opens the slot up for Nelson Agholor, who has by all accounts enjoyed a career rebirth in that role after a disastrous first two years in the league. While Matthews departure may be viewed by some as a reason to bump Alshon Jeffery's target total up, the Eagles face a murderer's row of No. 1 cornerbacks this season, including Patrick Peterson, Josh Norman (twice) and Richard Sherman. With Jeffery likely to struggle in Year 1, Zach Ertz stands to benefit most from Matthews being gone. 4for4 has Ertz projected for 70 catches this season and a top-10 finish at the position.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T01:11:00Z", "sim": 0.5921568870544434, "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "title": "Yahoo Sports", "id": "2139"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "04:45:00", "url": "https://sports.yahoo.com/sammy-watkins-rams-jordan-matthews-204521550.html", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8744269", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/LrRFiffacuS3moquwenRHA--/aD03MjQ7dz0xMzAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/sports_illustrated_941/b4bc605bcfc42f7d740f63b56e4f38a6", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "01:11:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

their wheeling and dealing with two teams: the Philadelphia Eagles and Los Angeles Rams.\n\nMultiple players (several stars) and picks traded hands, massively shaking up the fantasy outlook for the wide receiving corps and quarterbacks of all three teams.\n\nThree teams were involved in these trades so the fantasy ripple effect is massive. below I'll go team-by-team to assess the impact.\n\nEarlier this offseason the Bills declined Sammy Watkins' fifth-year option on his rookie deal, making this a make-or-break season for the talented but oft-injured star receiver as he'll hit free agency in 2018. So it makes sense then why the team would want to trade him now, as the returns from their deal with the Rams were greater than what they would have received as a compensatory selection.\n\nAs for fantasy, the swap of Watkins for Jordan Matthews is not a 1-to-1 move, as they're vastly different players. Matthews plays predominantly in the slot and is more likely a replacement for Robert Woods (signed with the Rams this offseason) than Watkins. In 2016, Matthews played 58 percent of his snaps in the slot, which is also where most of his production came from (84 targets, 54 receptions, 604 yards, two touchdowns). For Buffalo last year, Woods accumulated 54 percent of his targets and 62 percent of his yards from the slot.\n\nThis move is also interesting after the Bills just signed veteran Anquan Boldin, who played 81 percent of his snaps last year in Detroit either in the slot or tight to the line. Matthews will likely lead the team in targets, while Zay Jones will be tasked with providing an outside/deep threat like Watkins used to. This move is a good one for Matthews' fantasy stock as he escapes the crowded Eagles wide receiver room, but it can't be seen as a positive for Tyrod Taylor. With the Bills already featuring a low-volume passing attack (32nd and 31st in the league in pass attempts in the last two years), losing the big-play ability of Watkins depresses Taylor's fantasy ceiling. He'll still be able to rack up points with his legs, but this is bad news for Taylor's late-round quarterback credentials.\n\nLast year, the Eagles featured one of the worst wide receiving corps in the league. Life comes at you fast in the NFL. Now this group is loaded and thanks to the trade, offers more clarity from a fantasy perspective. Alshon Jeffery, the crown jewel of the free agent wide receivers, should no doubt lead this team in targets now. With Matthews out of the picture, Jeffery is the unquestioned No. 1 option. I was previously concerned with his draft price, but now I feel much better about him going in the WR15-20 range. He might even be a bargain.\n\nDaniel Jeremiah's declaration last week that Nelson Agholor -- and not Matthews -- would be the Eagles starting slot receiver seems to be more of a premonition now. Jeremiah spoke to Agholor's evolution as a player and how he was far more dynamic than Matthews in the slot. After disappointing thus far in his career, the former first-round pick could be a trendy sleeper to target later in fantasy drafts. Matthews saw 113 targets last year, and 84 of them came in the slot. Volume might be reduced all around this year for the Eagles, but Agholor is now worth a dart throw.\n\nSpeaking of dart throws, Torrey Smith lives to fight another day. It's hard to put too much fantasy stock into him right now after his disappointing year in San Francisco in 2016, but Smith is still just 28. Keep an eye on his role in this revamped passing attack leading up to the season. Zach Ertz will dominate December once again if you're into that sort of thing. personally, I feel there are better, higher upside tight ends to target late than Ertz, including Jack Doyle, Eric Ebron, and Coby Fleener. As for Carson Wentz, this is probably a move that has little impact on his outlook. He gets perhaps a slight upgrade in the slot (if Jeremiah's predictions continue to stay true), but overall the Eagles will likely pass less in 2017, putting Wentz in the low-end QB2 range.\n\nOK, finally, we land in Los Angeles with Watkins. We've spent all offseason wondering how new head coach Sean McVay would shape the Rams offense, and now we're seeing the fruits of his labors. While in Washington, McVay's offenses thrived on having a 1-2 punch at wide receiver with a reliable possession receiver and a dangerous downfield threat. He now seems to have that by reuniting former Bills teammates Robert Woods and Watkins. Woods should be the leader for the possession work, while Watkins will fill the DeSean Jackson role from McVay's Washington offenses.\n\nWhile this is excellent news for the Rams as a whole and Jared Goff's future (you've got weapons now, kid, time to perform), it's really terrible news for the fantasy prospects of this entire bunch. Watkins went from having breakout potential to now being a massive risk by putting his suspect injury history into the Rams suspect offense. Woods had late-round appeal as a potential target hog, but with Watkins, Cooper Kupp and Tavon Austin all in the mix, his piece of the passing game pie just shrunk significantly. Plus, their fantasy outlooks are tied to the right arm of a quarterback who last year completed just 54.6 percent of his passes for 4.26 adjusted yards per attempt and a touchdown rate of 2.4 percent. I have faith in McVay to invoke some offensive wizardry at times, but right now, it's hard to believe in any sort of magical season for Woods or Watkins in Los Angeles ... unless they make frequent trips to Disneyland", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T17:41:00Z", "sim": 0.5921568870544434, "source": {"uri": "nfl.com", "title": "NFL.com", "id": "5624"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "18:07:00", "url": "http://www.nfl.com/fantasy/story/0ap3000000828602/article/sammy-watkins-jordan-matthews-fantasy-fallout", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8676222", "image": "http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/photo/2017/08/11/0ap3000000828599_thumbnail_200_150.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "17:41:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

Buffalo addressed both positions by acquiring receiver Jordan Matthews from Philadelphia and cornerback E.J. Gaines from the Rams.\n\nThe Bills also continued looking to the future by further stockpiling 2018 draft selections. They acquired a second-round pick from L.A. and a third-rounder from the Eagles, while also sending a sixth-round pick to the Rams. Buffalo now has two picks in each of the first three rounds next year after acquiring the Kansas City Chiefs first-round selection in April.\n\nThe additional picks provide Bills general manager Brandon Beane assets in a draft that looks as if it will have several top-end quarterback prospects. Bills starter Tyrod Taylor's future is uncertain beyond this season.\n\nCowboys: The NFL suspended star Dallas running back Ezekiel Elliott for six games, concluding after a yearlong investigation that the league's leading rusher injured his former girlfriend in three separate incidents last summer. According to the letter Elliott received informing him of the suspension, the NFL believed he used \"physical force\" three times in a span of five days in a Columbus, Ohio, apartment last July resulting in injuries to Tiffany Thompson's face, neck, shoulders, arms, hands, wrists, hips and knees. She was his girlfriend at the time. Prosecutors in Columbus decided nearly a year ago not to pursue the case in the city where Elliott starred for Ohio State. In announcing the suspension under the NFL's personal conduct policy, the league said its investigation was based on photographs, text messages and other electronic evidence. Commissioner Roger Goodell made his decision based on the findings and in consultation with four advisers, including Hall of Fame player Ken Houston. Elliott posted a statement on his verified Twitter account Friday night, saying that he was \"both surprised and disappointed\" by the NFL's decision and that he strongly disagrees with the league's findings. Elliott's ban means the Cowboys will have four players suspended when last year's NFC East champions start the season in a month.\n\nDolphins: Ryan Tannehill has decided surgery can no longer be avoided. The Miami quarterback will undergo an operation to repair the torn ACL in his left knee and will miss the entire season, a person familiar with the decision said Friday. The person confirmed the decision to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the Dolphins hadn't disclosed it publicly. Tannehill will be placed on injured reserve, the person said.\n\nBroncos: A person with knowledge of the diagnosis says Denver nose tackle Billy Winn will miss the entire 2017 season with a serious right knee injury. The person, speaking on condition of anonymity Friday because the team hadn't announced results of Winn's medical tests, said Winn tore ligaments in his right knee, including the anterior cruciate ligament, on Thursday night.\n\nBengals 23, Buccaneers 12: Ryan Fitzpatrick made a good initial impression with Tampa Bay, completing his first series with a six-yard touchdown run, before Cincinnati pulled away. The 34-year-old quarterback signed a one-year deal for a chance to back up Jameis Winston. Fitzpatrick had mixed results after his TD, going 6-for-13 overall with an interception.

And with just one year left on his rookie deal, the odds were that Matthews time in Philly would not last much longer.\n\nMatthews led the Eagles in receiving in each of the last two seasons but was pushed down on the depth chart as the team acquired Torrey Smith and Alshon Jeffery. While neither Jeffery nor Smith's contracts have the players in the team's long-term plans, two draftees in Mack Hollins and Shelton Gibson did make the wide receivers room extremely competitive and cramped.\n\nThe move makes room on the roster for one of the younger up and coming receivers competing in camp and also gives Agholor a bigger opportunity to attempt to carry his spectacular play in training camp to the regular season.\n\nAs for the cornerback situation, Darby was a starter in Buffalo and there seems to be a lack of them in Philly. At just 23-years-old and entering his third season he has a bright future. Darby nabbed his first two interceptions as an NFL player last season and deflected 21 passes in 15 starts.\n\nDarby becomes likely the de facto No. 1 cornerback, ahead of Patrick Robinson, Jalen Mills, C.J. Smith and rookie Rasul Douglas.\n\nIn a related and seperate trade, the Bills shipped their stud receiver Sammy Watkins to the Rams in exchange for cornerback E.J. Gaines and the Rams' 2018 second-round pick. The interesting swap of players between the three teams, trading wide receivers and cornerbacks is an interesting move, and one which will also have big fantasy football impact.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T15:11:00Z", "sim": 0.5843137502670288, "source": {"uri": "metro.us", "title": "Metro", "id": "354"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "18:09:00", "url": "http://www.metro.us/sports/philadelphia/eagles-trade-wr-jordan-matthews-to-bills-cb-ronald-darby", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8676404", "image": "http://www.metro.us/sites/default/files/main/articles/gettyimages-502796464.0.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "15:11:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

a pair of moves Friday in an attempt to turn the page from the prior administration and build for their future.\n\nThe Bills never bottomed out as badly as the Browns in recent years, but Buffalo's impressive stash of draft selections rivals that of Cleveland, which is in full-blown rebuilding mode.\n\nAfter Friday, it looks like Buffalo is chasing the Jets in a race to the bottom this season - and the top of the 2018 draft. That's a lot of draft capital in short order. The Bills did however, acquire two players who could potentially fill those roles in Jordan Matthews and E.J.\n\nWatkins, a Clemson alum, joins the receiver-starved Rams who are looking for capable targets for last year's top-overall pick Jared Goff, who struggled while the offense finished dead last in both yardage and scoring. In 37 career games in Buffalo, Watkins had 153 catches and 17 touchdowns, although he missed 11 matches over the last two seasons. The Bills now have six picks in the first three rounds of the 2018 draft. He has one year remaining on his rookie contract. Landing Darby is a boon on that front, but the move puts pressure on Alshon Jeffery, Nelson Agholor and Torrey Smith to lift up quarterback Carson Wentz come September.\n\nIn 2015 when Watkins played in 13 games, he had 60 receptions for 1,047 yards and nine touchdowns.\n\nThus, what these trades would seem to indicate is that quarterback Tyrod Taylor can expect to be the Bills quarterback this season, but shouldn't make any plans beyond this year.\n\nBut the main focus here should be on the Bills, who are making an aggressive effort to change their organization.\n\nRelated News: 12 August 2017 Buffalo Bills Agree To Trade Sammy Watkins 12 August 2017 Markets Right Now: Stocks drift lower on Wall Street 11 August 2017 Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor 'safe' after saying she's suicidal 12 August 2017 Stocks plunge amid growing North Korean-US tensions, gold continues rise 12 August 2017 Knicks reportedly hire Michelle Obama's brother for front office role 12 August 2017 Manchester United negotiate Zlatan Ibrahimovic's return 12 August 2017 Big-spending Guardiola leads chase of Chelsea 12 August 2017 LA City Council Votes Unanimously To Approve 2028 Olympics 12 August 2017 Fifth Harmony: \"There's Nothing We Can't Get Through Together\" 12 August 2017 Grandfather found dead in elevator called for help twice 12 August 2017 See how renovations at the White House are progressing 12 August 2017 Salma Hayek cooks, babysits for Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-08-12", "textEnd": 1671, "textStart": 1657, "freq": 11}, {"amb": false, "date": "2017-08-11", "textEnd": 1797, "textStart": 1783}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T23:28:00Z", "sim": 0.5803921818733215, "source": {"uri": "xnewspress.com", "title": "xnewspress.com", "id": "19050"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "09:41:00", "url": "http://xnewspress.com/2017/08/3-questions-surrounding-los-angeles-rams-trading-for-sammy/", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8772359", "image": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "23:28:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

They acquired Jordan Matthews from the Philadelphia Eagles after sending Sammy Watkins to the Los Angeles Rams. Both moves will have a direct impact on the wide receivers' fantasy football value for the 2017 season.\n\nLos Angeles has lacked a legitimate No. 1 wideout in recent years. It's a role Watkins is capable of filling if he's able to stay healthy, which was rarely the case during his time in Buffalo.\n\nMeanwhile, Matthews should be given every opportunity to become the top target with the Bills following the move. That puts him in line to receive more looks than would have been the case in Philly alongside Alshon Jeffery and Torrey Smith.\n\nLet's take a closer look at the outlook for both players after Friday's flurry of activity.\n\nThe Bills traded up to select Watkins with the fourth overall pick in the 2014 NFL draft. They never received the return on investment you expect from a top-five pick, in large part because he wasn't able to shake off lingering foot problems.\n\nHe's coming off a season where he racked up 28 catches for 430 yards and two touchdowns while being limited to just eight games.\n\nAdd in the fact he's being slotted into an offense being led by the unproven Jared Goff and he becomes one of the biggest boom-or-bust options available at the position.\n\nBrad Evans of Yahoo Sports believes fantasy owners should steer clear of the big-play receiver.\n\n\"Trading in Tyrod Taylor for Jared 'Where does the sun rise/set again?' Goff is a fantasy death knell,\" he wrote. \"Though improvements should be made, the Rams passer completed a disgusting 54.6 percent of his attempts last year. Watkins, who garnered 23.1 percent of the targets share in '16, will be the vertical centerpiece, but his unsightly catch rates and Goff's inaccuracy spell doom.\"\n\nIt's a fair argument, but there's an alternative outcome: Watkins stays healthy, Goff takes a step forward in his second season, and the Clemson product rides a ridiculous amount of targets to a monster fantasy season in a contract year.\n\nUltimately, it's probably best to view the Rams' newest addition as a No. 2 fantasy wide receiver. But the extreme range of potential outcomes doesn't make him a good choice for the faint of heart.\n\nMatthews' situation is a little more straightforward. He's played 46 of a possible 48 games since the Eagles drafted him in the second round three years ago, and he's made at least 67 catches every season, a streak that should continue despite Buffalo's run-first scheme.\n\nWide receiver is a position of weakness for the Bills. The team's other top options, Zay Jones and Anquan Boldin, are a rookie and a 36-year-old veteran who's best utilized as a red-zone and third-down possession weapon at this stage of his career.\n\nThat should equate to Matthews having a chance to take over as the team's No. 1 receiver right away, depending on how well he picks up the playbook during the rest of the preseason.\n\n\"Likely with renewed energy, I believe he returns at or near the WR2 level exhibited two seasons ago,\" Evans wrote on Yahoo Sports. \"Recall in that campaign, Matthews was a red-zone machine posting a 66.7 percent catch rate inside the 20. Boldin and Jones will push for targets, but it's conceivable he churns out a line around 75-900-7 this season.\"\n\nThat's a fair projection and he could push for double-digit touchdowns if Boldin isn't able to fend off Father Time for another year.\n\nSo Matthews should be a major winner from Friday's trades, at least from a fantasy perspective.

What do we expect from the Buffalo Bills in 2017?\n\nIt's safe to say we're not shy when it comes to getting you ready for the upcoming NFL season. Since March, we have strung together four different series in preparation for the fall. We just concluded looking at all 32 teams' most improved area. That was preceded by pieces on a club's best offseason addition, some facts, figures and feats for each squad, as well as an up-and-coming player for each roster.\n\nSo call this one for the thumb. With the regular-season rapidly approaching, we'll take a look at what we could expect from each team. Every team wants to win the Super Bowl. However, 31 teams will obviously be disappointed. So we have been taking a look at all 32 clubs (in original 2017 draft order) and doing a little analysis. You can play catch up right here. So what are we really expecting from the Buffalo Bills in 2017?\n\nIt's been quite the few days for the franchise that owns the longest current playoff drought in the league. The Buffalo Bills haven't made a postseason appearance since the team was stunned by the Tennessee Titans via the \"Music City Miracle\" in the 1999 AFC Wild Card Playoffs.\n\nNow led by new head coach Sean McDermott, the club is also now being guided by general manager Brandon Beane. This month alone, the Bills signed veteran wideout Anquan Boldin - ninth in NFL history with 1,076 career receptions. Even more recently, the club acquired wide receiver Jordan Matthews from the Philadelphia Eagles and cornerback E.J. Gaines from the Los Angeles Rams in separate deals. No longer with the club are wide receiver Sammy Watkins (Rams) and cornerback Ronald Darby (Eagles).\n\nThis is the No. 1 rushing offense in the league each of the past two seasons. Getting more from the passing game is vital. The Bills have basically overhauled their wide receiving corps in attempt to be more productive in this area.\n\nOn defense, McDermott brings back the 4-3 scheme back to Orchard Park. It's perfect for the personnel as former coordinator Jim Schwartz found out in 2014. End Jerry Hughes and tackles Marcell Dareus and Kyle Williams are all back, while 2016 first-rounder Shaq Lawson rounds out a potent front four.\n\nSummation:\n\nThere's a lot of excitement surrounding the Buffalo Bills' defensive unit. There are some concerns at linebacker but the pass rush has the potential to be great. However, the team can't afford to be so porous vs. the run - as was the case this past season. Meanwhile, quarterback Tyrod Taylor must continue to progress as a field general. It's been quite the drought for this franchise in terms of the postseason. But don't be surprised if the Bills bump the Miami Dolphins for second place in the AFC East this year. And a 10-win season along with a playoff berth are real possibilities.\n\nRussell S.

Jamie Germano\n\n5 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nBoth Sammy Watkins and Ronald Darby, who were traded by the Buffalo Bills on Friday, were high picks in the NFL Draft.\n\nWatkins, who was traded to the Los Angeles Rams, was the fourth overall pick in the 2014 draft. Darby, who was traded to the Eagles, was a second-round pick in 2015.\n\nMore: Bills trade Sammy Watkins to Rams, Ronald Darby dealt to Eagles\n\nHow well will these players do for their new teams? Who knows? However, there are several players over the years who were drafted by the Bills but enjoyed more success after leaving the team either via free agency, trades or just being cut. Here are the top five that I chose in 2016:\n\n1. Gary Anderson\n\nThe kicker was drafted in the seventh round in 1982 out of Syracuse, but he couldn't make anything in the preseason and the Bills cut him. He signed with Pittsburgh and was the Steelers kicker for 13 seasons, then later played for the Vikings, Eagles, Titans, and 49ers. He played in 353 games and scored 2,454 points, both figures the second-most in NFL history.\n\n2. Marshawn Lynch\n\nThe running back was Buffalo's first-round pick in 2007, and he had back-to-back 1,000-yard seasons. However, the Bills picked C.J. Spiller in the first round in 2010, which made Lynch expendable, and they traded him to Seattle, where he had four straight 1,000-yard seasons, won a Super Bowl, and should have won another if he had been given the ball on the 1-yard line at the end of Super Bowl XLIX against New England.\n\n3. Antoine Winfield\n\nThe cornerback was a first-round pick in 1999 who played five years for the Bills and made six interceptions, then left to join the Vikings in 2004 and played nine more years, making 21 interceptions while appearing in three Pro Bowls.\n\n4. Daryle Lamonica\n\nThe quarterback was a 24th-round pick in 1963 and was primarily the backup to Jack Kemp during the AFL championship years. It wasn't until he was traded to Oakland that he truly blossomed. He led the Raiders to Super Bowl II, which where they lost to Green Bay, and he was the AFL's No. 1 passer in 1969, when he threw for 3,302 yards and 34 touchdowns. He was 4-0 as a starter in Buffalo, and went 62-16-6 as a starter in Oakland.\n\n5. Pete Gogolak\n\nGogolak revolutionized the art of placekicking as a Bill as he was the first man to kick soccer style. The 12th-round pick in 1964 spent only two years in Buffalo, won a pair of championships, and then bolted to the NFL and the New York Giants, where he kicked another nine years.\n\nSammy Watkins FullscreenBuy Photo Bills receiver Sammy Watkins is tackled by Vikings Terence Newman (23).

Gaines can make an impact on the Bills roster in 2017.\n\n\"We're building a football team. And we're building a football team to compete in the short and long term. And to be good for a long time,\" said Sean McDermott on Friday, August 11.\n\nShort and long term. Two different visions, but not necessarily competing visions. That's what the Bills decision makers keep in the back of their minds as they put together the roster and make decisions about the team.\n\nThe blockbuster trades for WR Jordan Matthews and CB E.J. Gaines are the talk of the football world mostly because of what Buffalo gave away to get them -- starting WR Sammy Watkins and starting CB Ronald Darby.\n\nThere are premium draft picks coming Buffalo's way next year as a result of the deals -- the Rams second rounder and the Eagles third rounder. But McDermott says without the players, Matthews and Gaines, the deals wouldn't happen.\n\n\"Getting the players that we were able to get back - that's important,\" he said late Friday afternoon.\n\nMatthews is a talented, productive, possession-type receiver. He's averaged 75 catches in his first three seasons in the league with an average of six touchdowns per season.\n\nHe's been very productive with the Eagles as noted Friday afternoon by Philadelphia's Vice President of Football Operations Howie Roseman.\n\n\"We weren't picking up the phone and calling teams on Jordan because of his value to our team,\" Roseman told reporters in Philadelphia. \"Certainly we know the production he had.\"\n\nThe Eagles were desperate for help at cornerback which made them pull the trigger. And Roseman admitted he was concerned about the Eagles ability to re-sign Matthews after 2017 as he could become a free agent next spring.\n\nMatthews is also reliable. The four-year vet has played in 46 of his team's 48 games the last three years, missing two last season.\n\npic.twitter.com/S9M4XXuQUd -- John Murphy (@JohnMurphyShow)\n\nAugust 11, 2017\n\n\"He's a tough kid,\" says Bills GM Brandon Beane. \"I think he's one of five players in the first three years of his career have 65 receptions and 800 yards. It's a pretty good group he's in. He knows how to play.\"\n\nJordan Matthews size (6-3, 212 lbs.) and talent provides a different sort of skill set to Buffalo's wide receiver corps.\n\nHe'll be a nice complement to veteran WR Anquan Boldin who was just acquired four days ago. And Watkins departure opens the door for a speedy wide out currently on the roster to provide some explosive plays downfield.\n\nCB E.J. GAINES ADDS COMPETITION AMONG DEFENSIVE BACKS\n\nThe Rams drafted Gaines in the sixth round in 2014 and he immediately made an impact. He started 15 games in his rookie season and was named to the PFWA All-Rookie Team.\n\nAnd after losing Darby in the Eagles deal, the Bills are looking for Gaines to vie for a starting spot in Buffalo.\n\n\"E.J. has started 25 games in this league,\" Brandon Beane says. \"He was on the NFL All-Rookie team. So he has some pedigree. He's not walking in here not knowing what to expect. He'll compete with the other corners. He's not guaranteed a spot, but he'll come in and we'll see where it goes\"\n\nGaines was sidelined for the entire 2015 season with a Lis Franc injury. But he came back last year to start 10 games for the Rams.\n\nWith Darby gone, the competition for the starting cornerback spot is likely to come from veteran free agent Shareece Wright. He started 43 games in his seven seasons in the league with the Ravens and Chargers. Buffalo's second year cornerback Kevon Seymour may also figure into some playing time outside.\n\nE.J. Gaines should fit into Buffalo's zone-based secondary scheme right away and is likely to battle with Wright, Seymour, and maybe some others for the starting role opposite Tre White.", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textEnd": 303, "amb": false, "date": "2017-08-11", "textStart": 294, "freq": 2}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T23:13:00Z", "sim": 0.572549045085907, "source": {"uri": "buffalobills.com", "title": "buffalobills.com", "id": "11281"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "10:03:00", "url": "http://www.buffalobills.com/news/article-1/How-WR-Jordan-Matthews-and-CB-EJ-Gaines-fit-the-Bills-roster-plans-for-2017/a8f5eaad-e924-4e00-84e2-4e3af9981a94?campaign=buf:fanshare:facebook", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8774785", "image": "http://prod.static.bills.clubs.nfl.com//assets/thumb/2017/08/th-0811-matthews-gaines.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "23:13:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

They're making decisions that they feel is best for this team.\"\n\nUndoubtedly, more change is on the way.\n\n\"I don't like the word 'untouchable,' \" General Manager Brandon Beane said. \"I'm not actively shopping guys, selling guys, anything like that. That's the honest-to-God truth. It's just, you're always looking in this business to help yourself now, and tomorrow.\n\n\"That's the facts. I can't stand up here and say I would never trade another guy in the next three weeks, but I'm not actively shopping anybody.\"\n\nBeane aggressively pushed back against the idea that under his leadership, along with coach Sean McDermott, the Bills are systematically ridding themselves of players brought in under former General Manager Doug Whaley.\n\n\"I'm not one that believes that 'I didn't draft him, so I don't care about him.' That is zero,\" he said. \"If they're a good player and they can help us win a game today, then I'll love them and I'll take them every time. It's not about getting the guys only that Sean and I brought in here versus the regime before we got here. There's a lot of guys that have jumped right on board, doing the things that Sean and his staff have asked and we look forward to continuing to work with those guys.\"\n\nShipping out Watkins and Darby, however, is a reminder that it's a new era in Buffalo. Watkins was Whaley's signature move as GM, while Darby was the first draft pick used by the team after Rex Ryan took over as coach in 2015. Symbolically or not, trading them both - on the same day - is turning the page on the the last few years.\n\n\"People ask about different players all the time around this league. You never know what's serious or what's just bait,\" Beane said. \"Again, I was not and we were not actively shopping either of these guys. We're not actively shopping anybody, but L.A. got very serious about Sammy and Philadelphia got very serious about Ronald and the timing worked out.\"\n\nThe Bills' new general manager and coach have drastically rebuilt the roster in short order. Consider: Just 36 of the 90 players on Buffalo's roster were acquired by a previous front office.\n\n\"If you've been around, you've seen stuff like this around the league,\" defensive tackle Kyle Williams, the Bills' longest-tenured player, said. \"I think for some other guys it may have hit home: the things they've heard about the NFL are true.\"\n\nOne of the natural questions to ask after trades like we saw Friday is: Who might be next?\n\nWith an eye on some of those 36 players who predate Beane and McDermott, here are the possibilities:\n\nWould-be blockbusters\n\n* QB Tyrod Taylor - No chance, right? Well, that's what most would have said about trading Watkins before Friday. Taylor is signed through 2018, but the Bills could get out of the deal after the upcoming season with a manageable cap hit.\n\n\"Tyrod is the No. 1 quarterback on this team right now and we'll let that play out before we decide how it goes into 2018 and beyond,\" Beane said Friday.\n\nBy getting wide receiver Jordan Matthews and cornerback E.J. Gaines back as part of the trades - two potential starters - the Bills are not in \"tank\" mode. The signing of veteran wide receiver Anquan Boldin last week also goes against that notion.\n\n\"It doesn't say anything,\" Beane said when asked what the trades mean for Taylor's future. \"Everybody's forgetting we signed Anquan last week. This is not a 'throw in the towel thing at all. Somebody mentioned that somebody said that out there and that quite honestly, that's annoying to me because you don't know me if you think I'm throwing in the towel.\n\n\"If we're throwing in the towel, I wouldn't have been trying to get a starting receiver back so to your question on Tyrod, it's nothing. We've got Anquan, who we added and I told you, I honestly believe he's a Hall of Famer and he still can play in this league. Jordan Matthews is a starting receiver and you look at his numbers, what he's done and those aren't to be laughed at, I guess to say. Tyrod will get every opportunity to lead this team and we're all rooting for him. It's in our best interest.\"\n\nTrading Taylor would be an undeniable \"tank\" move, so that makes it unlikely. But if the Bills get off to a horrendous start, and another team has an injury and a big need - thus making a big offer - would Beane say no? In rookie quarterback Nathan Peterman, the team has a player the coaching staff could want to get a better look at.\n\n* RB LeSean McCoy - The Bills' best player recently turned 29. That's getting up there at his position, but McCoy still looks to be in his prime.\n\nTrading him would also be a \"tank\" sign, so it's just as unlikely as a Taylor deal would be. McCoy also makes big money for a running back, with cap hits of more than $8 million in each of the next three seasons. There is no obvious replacement on the roster, but running back is generally looked at a position that can be filled easily through free agency or the draft.\n\nIf the Bills were to move McCoy through trade, there would be a minimal cap savings this season, but significant space would be freed up for 2018. The expected return for running backs being so low -- even when a player of McCoy's caliber is involved -- is another reason a deal would be a huge shock.\n\nMoney makes it tough\n\n* DT Marcell Dareus - The Pro Bowl defensive tackle is schedule to count $16.4 million against the cap. Trading him would give the Bills a $10 million cap savings this year, but he would count $14.2 million next year. Dareus' trade value is also at an all-time low considering he's coming off a down season marred by a drug suspension and injuries. There is no obvious replacement for Dareus on the roster.\n\n* TE Charles Clay - Clay's cap hit would drop from $9 million to $4.5 million this year if he were traded, but he would still count $9 million against the 2018 cap. He's also dealing with a chronic knee condition that could scare potential trade partners away. Depth behind Clay is another reason the Bills might be hesitant to move him.\n\nThey're productive veterans, but ...\n\n* C Eric Wood - The veteran center is entering the final year of his contract and his release would save more than $4 million on this year's salary cap. That number would stay the same if Wood was traded. There is a ready replacement already on the roster in Ryan Groy.\n\n* LT Cordy Glenn - Cutting Glenn doesn't seem like an option since doing so would cost the Bills more than $15 million on this year's cap and nearly $10 million next season. Trading him would bring about a $9 million cap savings in 2017, but would cost the team $9.6 million in cap space in 2018. When Glenn was out during the spring, rookie second-round draft pick Dion Dawkins got all the work as starting left tackle. If Dawkins develops the way the team hopes, he most certainly could take over for Glenn sooner than later.\n\n* LG Richie Incognito - The Pro Bowl left guard has two years left on his contract and is playing at a high level at age 34. He's seemingly put his \"BullyGate\" past behind him, but McDermott might not see him as a good fit in the type of locker room he's trying to build. Trading or releasing Incognito would save the Bills $3.275 million against the cap.\n\nYoung players who might interest other teams\n\n* CB Kevon Seymour - A sixth-round pick in 2016, Seymour was expected to challenge for the starting slot cornerback job, but the Bills signed Leonard Johnson in the offseason and he has played there. Johnson has experience in McDermott's defense from last year in Carolina. Seymour is on a cheap contract and provides decent depth, but if a team were to make an offer the Bills like, there's evidence now that they won't be shy to act. The addition of E.J. Gaines, acquired from the Rams as part of the trade for Watkins, helps with cornerback depth.\n\n* LB Reggie Ragland - Consider this one likely. Acquired by Whaley with a second-round pick, Ragland actually cost the Bills three draft picks - their original 2015 second-rounder and the two fourth-round picks Whaley included to move up to get Ragland. Currently running with the third team, Ragland does not look like a natural fit for McDermott's defense.\n\n\"I wouldn't comment,\" Beane said Friday when asked if the team has taken calls about Ragland. \"We have lots of inquiries, so I don't want to go into who's asked about what players.\"\n\n* RG John Miller - The Bills signed veteran Vlad Ducasse in free agency and surprisingly mixed him in with the first team during the spring. That has continued some in training camp, although Miller seems to be ahead in the competition to start. Nevertheless, he's on a cheap contract that has two seasons remaining, making him potentially attractive to another team if the Bills wanted to go with Ducasse (or someone else) at the position.\n\n\"We have to continue to move forward,\" McDermott said Friday. \"We've got to continue to move forward and that's what you do in this business.\"\n\nThat point was driven home by the departures of Watkins and Darby.\n\n\"It's just the nature of this business,\" Taylor said, \"you can never predict things.\"", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T21:50:00Z", "sim": 0.572549045085907, "source": {"uri": "buffalonews.com", "title": "The Buffalo News", "id": "16510"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "21:50:00", "url": "http://buffalonews.com/2017/08/12/trades-send-clear-message-bills-nobodys-spot-secure-next/", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8847489", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/bncore/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/1008357050-McCoy-Sports-B2-e1502506792587.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "21:50:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

The Bills sent cornerback Ronald Darby for Matthews and a third-round draft choice.\n\n\"I'm still trying to dissect what's real and what's true as I move forward.\"\n\nThe trade caught Matthews unawares. His contract is up after this season. He said the Bills before executing the trade did not make overtures to his agent about any willingness to sign an extension.\n\nOne opinion Matthews didn't hesitate to deliver regarded his new quarterback.\n\nMatthews leaves on-the-job trainee Carson Wentz in Philly and will catch passes from Tyrod Taylor.\n\n\"Tyrod's a great asset to the Bills,\" Matthews said. \"To be able to play with him is going to be awesome because I already know what kind of person he is.\"\n\nLeSean McCoy can relate to Sammy Watkins getting traded for 'a guy that he's probably better than'\n\nMatthews two years ago participated in offseason workouts with Taylor, running back LeSean McCoy and left guard Richie Incognito in Arizona. Matthews also has experience training in Florida with Bills receiver Anquan Boldin.\n\n\"Tyrod works hard,\" Matthews said. \"He was always the first guy in the building whenever we were training in Arizona.\n\n\"He definitely has a savvy about him, and he understands people. He's not one of those guys who was modeled to be a quarterback but has no people skills. He knows how to lead a locker room. He knows how to talk to the receivers, the rest of the offense and get everybody pulling in the same direction.\"\n\nMatthews, a 2014 second-round draft choice, went through four starting quarterbacks in Philly: Nick Foles, Mark Sanchez, Sam Bradford and Wentz. The Eagles went 24-24 in those three seasons, never reaching the playoffs.\n\nTaylor will be Matthews' first quarterback who is a dangerous runner, a trait Matthews praised.\n\n\"And I also think he has a chip on his shoulder,\" Matthews said. \"When you go through history, the best quarterbacks always have a chip on their shoulders.\n\n\"I'm excited to see what he's going to do.\"\n\nTim Graham: Bills leaders admit they'll need to sell trades to team, fans\n\nMatthews is coach Sean McDermott's and GM Brandon Beane's type of man: a self-made overachiever.\n\nMatthews studied economics at non-football factory Vanderbilt, the only Division I school to offer a scholarship.\n\nHe finished his career as the most prolific receiver in Southeastern Conference history, setting records with 262 catches for 3,759 yards. He caught a record 112 passes his senior season.\n\nThen he became one of the more productive players from the legendary 2014 draft class that also produced Sammy Watkins, the Bills' fourth overall draft choice. The Bills on Friday traded Watkins and a sixth-round pick to the Los Angeles Rams for cornerback E.J. Gaines and a second-rounder.\n\n\"It's an interesting conversation because I thought about coming out the year before,\" Matthews said of the 2014 draft. \"I probably would've gotten picked higher if I did, but I don't regret going in the class I did.\n\n\"Being amongst that group of guys definitely makes you elevate your level of play.\"\n\nTim Graham: Bills leaders admit they'll need to sell trades to team, fans\n\nMatthews is aware his stats will be measured against Watkins' on a weekly basis even though they're not the same type of receiver.\n\nMatthews claimed he won't worry about that comparison, but he did describe the healthy rivalries within the 2014 receiver class, headlined by Odell Beckham, Mike Evans, Allen Robinson and Jarvis Landry.\n\n\"There's a lot of talent, a lot of guys vying for position,\" Matthews said. \"You look at Brandin Cooks' situation. Brandin wants to solidify himself with the guys at the top of our class along with the other guys who have made waves like Odell and Mike. Brandin wants to make that move, and he's in a good position with the Patriots to show what he can do.\n\n\"Odell and Jarvis -- I knew both of those guys coming out -- have always been competitive against each other. Then when you lump them in with the names like Kelvin Benjamin in Carolina, Allen Robinson and Marqise Lee with Jacksonville, even Quincy Enunwa who was about to be the Jets' No. 1 until he got his neck injury.\"\n\nThe 7 most memorable moments from Sammy Watkins' time in Buffalo\n\nMatthews ranks fourth in catches, sixth in yards and fifth in touchdowns among receivers from the 2014 draft class. Watkins ranks eighth, seventh and sixth in nine fewer games because of injuries.\n\nImagine the upcoming free-agent market. So many quality receivers are nearing the ends of their rookie deals.\n\n\"There hasn't been a receiver in our class to sign a second contract yet,\" Matthews said, \"so when that kind of stuff happens that increases the competitiveness that much more.\"\n\nTurning his focus back to Buffalo, Matthews bemoaned the time he has missed, all those voluntary practices, minicamp, a couple weeks of training camp and Thursday night's preseason opener.\n\n\"The beginning of training camp is always the most fun part, where you build a lot of camaraderie,\" Matthews said. \"Once you get to the preseason games, you start knowing what the season's going to look like.\n\n\"In that aspect, I'm behind the 8-ball. So I'm concerned with learning what I need to know.\n\n\"I'm just thinking about getting my playbook and getting to work.\"", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T17:19:00Z", "sim": 0.5686274766921997, "source": {"uri": "buffalonews.com", "title": "The Buffalo News", "id": "16510"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "17:19:00", "url": "http://buffalonews.com/2017/08/12/jordan-matthews-eager-play-tyrod-taylor-keep-representing-2014-wr-draft-class/", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8821848", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/bncore/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/MatthewsGetty.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "17:19:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

He has elite speed and quickness and boasts rare leaping ability to catch balls in the air, both down the sideline and over the middle.\n\n\"We went into this draft saying we were going to be bold, and we made a bold move,\" said Russ Brandon, Bills president and chief executive officer.\n\n\"Very high cost, but we thought it was a calculated risk and a risk we were willing to take,\" Bills General Manager Doug Whaley said. \"The high cost of not making the playoffs is something we weighed, and we thought this guy's going to get us to the playoffs.\"\n\nWhaley stopped short of guaranteeing the playoffs this year but made it clear the team's 14-year playoff drought weighs heavily on the team's decision-makers.\n\n\"In football terms, we're willing to give up not making the playoffs again for Sammy,\" Whaley said. \"That's what we looked at. We want to make the playoffs. Being 14 years and not making the playoffs. That's the tradeoff we expect.\"\n\nThe pick continues the team's effort to bolster the supporting cast of second-year quarterback EJ Manuel. The Bills' pass offense ranked 28th in the NFL last season. Buffalo's 16 touchdown passes tied for second fewest in the league.\n\nWatkins will join second-year man Robert Woods as the Bills' starting outside receivers.\n\nVeteran Stevie Johnson spent most of last season working out of the slot.\n\nHowever, the addition of Watkins makes it a strong probability the Bills will shop Johnson on the trade market.\n\nThe Bills own two picks on Day Two of the draft, which begins at 7 tonight. Buffalo's second-round pick is 41st overall. Its third-rounder is 73rd overall. An edge pass rusher could be a target of the Bills with one of those picks.\n\nThe last time the Bills gave up a future No. 1 in the draft was when they took quarterback J.P. Losman in 2004.\n\nThe last time they gave up a future No. 1 in what could be considered a \"win-now\" deal was when they acquired Drew Bledsoe in 2002.\n\nWatkins owns 23 Clemson records, including career receptions (240), receiving yards (3,391) and touchdowns (27).\n\nLast season he caught 101 passes for 1,464 yards and 12 touchdowns. In the Orange Bowl against Ohio State, he had 16 catches for 227 yards and two touchdowns.\n\n\"I'm very excited,\" said Watkins, who turns 21 in June. \"It's a blessing to be a Buffalo Bill now, just to get started with the young guys on the team.\"\n\nThe Bills brought Watkins to Buffalo for a pre-draft visit last month. Watkins said Whaley told him at the time the Bills were going to pick him.\n\n\"I didn't really think they would come up to get me, but I had my interview with them and Mr. Doug just kept telling me he was going to get me,\" Watkins said. \"I was thinking it was all fun and games.\"\n\nWhaley on Watkins' strengths:\n\n\"The total body of work. If you look at his resume, it's pretty impressive. We believe he's got great ball skills, he's explosive, he can get in and out of cuts. He'll be able to separate with his quickness and burst. But he also attacks the ball and he plays much bigger than his size. So that will be an added benefit, for him being open when he's covered. That elongates the target for EJ.\"\n\nAdded Whaley: \"Dynamic playmaker, and that's what this game's all about, making plays and surrounding our quarterback with playmakers. He's automatically going to make our quarterback better. He's going to make us better as a team.\"\n\nBoth Brandon and Whaley maintained that the fact the team will be sold this year did not make them more willing to give up future picks, given the fact a new owner could decide to change management.\n\n\"Not at all,\" Brandon said. \"From that standpoint we've been very up front about that. It's business as usual. I'm not worried about anything relative to the sale of the franchise when it comes to the football operation. This trade was made as a football decision that's focused on the 2014 season.\"", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T19:06:00Z", "sim": 0.5686274766921997, "source": {"uri": "buffalonews.com", "title": "The Buffalo News", "id": "16510"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "19:06:00", "url": "http://buffalonews.com/2014/05/08/bills-nab-watkins-with-bold-move/", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8684819", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/bncore/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/154156-2.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "19:06:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

"id": "493164", "type": "person"}], "body": "The Friday news dump is always interesting, but the NFL offered up a whole new level of madness this week as folks prepare for their weekend activities.\n\nIn case you missed the big news of the day, here's a brief overview.\n\nThe NFL handed down a six-game suspension to Dallas Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott, citing some very serious findings (read more about that here).\n\nThen, as everyone discussed that big event, the Buffalo Bills engaged in two huge trades. First they sent wide receiver Sammy Watkins packing to Southern California. Then they acquired another receiver to take his place, landing Jordan Matthews in a trade with the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nThat's a heck of a lot of activity going on before the first weekend of preseason games wraps up. We're taking a look at these three big-time events to determine who benefits the most, and vice versa.\n\nWinner: NFC East teams not named Cowboys\n\nThe NFC East was going to be a battle to the end, even if Elliott had not been suspended. Now that he's out until Week 8 (Dallas has its bye in Week 6), the rest of the division has a huge chance to take advantage of this situation.\n\nThe New York Giants have the best chance of all to get ahead of the 'Boys with a Week 1 tilt in Dallas that could have long-lasting ramifications. Remember, the Giants handed the Cowboys two of their three losses last year. If Dallas gets off to a slow start (something that was possible even with Elliott, as we'll cover shortly), then things will get very interesting indeed.\n\nLoser: Cowboys in trouble with Zeke gone for almost half a season\n\nLet's take a look at the veritable gauntlet facing Dallas to open the season, shall we?\n\nThe Cowboys will host the Giants in Week 1 before hitting the road for two games -- one in Denver and one in Arizona. All three of these opening games were going to be huge tests, even with Elliott behind Dak Prescott in the starting lineup. Following this early road trip, the 'Boys will host the Rams and Green Bay Packers before their Week 6 bye. Then they'll hit the road once again for a Week 7 tilt in Santa Clara against the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nSo it won't be all that shocking if Dallas opens the season with just two wins, or worse. This is amplified all the more when you consider Dallas has injuries and suspensions up front on defense that will make it much easier for opposing offenses to do work.\n\nThough, we'd be remiss if we didn't point out that Elliott might end up playing out the season if his appeals case goes to court (more on that here). But even if he's there, the media swarm that will encompass the 'Boys throughout the ordeal will be suffocating.\n\nWinner: Jared Goff finally has weapons\n\nThe Rams did a solid job adding talent to the offense in the draft and free agency. Goff was hamstrung as a rookie without protection up front and without reliable weapons in the passing game. The Rams have solidified their offensive line, and after adding Watkins in the trade Friday they have quite a potent offensive arsenal, too.\n\nWatkins will join rookie Cooper Kupp, possession specialist and former Bills teammate Robert Woods and speedster Tavon Austin, not to mention rookie tight end Gerald Everett. This group should give Goff a much better chance to succeed in his second year.\n\nLoser: LeSean McCoy will see a ton of eight-man boxes\n\nWith deep threat Sammy Watkins in Los Angeles, suddenly the Bills' passing game has shrunk significantly. After the team signed Anquan Boldin on Monday and Watkins leaving town, the Bills suddenly have no real outside threat. Essentially, with Boldin, Matthews and rookie Zay Jones, Buffalo has three slot receivers as its three top receiving options.\n\nNow, Charles Clay can still get down the field from the tight end spot, but he's not a reliable playmaker. This means that opposing defenses can really ratchet down into the box to shut down McCoy and the running game. That's not good news for a running back who's entering the stage of his career in which decline is already inevitable. Fantasy owners beware. Shady might end up disappointing in a major way this upcoming season.\n\nWinner: Bills doing work on the rebuilding front\n\nTrading Sammy Watkins away was a pretty stunning move by rookie general manager Brandon Beane. After all, when healthy, Watkins is a terror to defend and has been Tyrod Taylor's go-to guy for big plays. But when you look at what Beane is doing as far as a long-term view, it's pretty darn impressive.\n\nAfter making the two big trades on Friday, Buffalo now has two first-round picks, two second-round picks and two third-round picks in the 2018 NFL Draft.\n\nThis is exactly what NFL teams need when it's time to rebuild. And make no mistake about it, despite what Rex Ryan would have you believe, the Bills aren't making the playoffs in 2017. It's not happening. Period. Instead, this is a year to stock up on talent, build that talent up and then make big moves for players that will help this team in the future once it's draft time next year.\n\nLoser: Arizona Cardinals stuck in middle of NFC West\n\nLooking at the NFC West after Los Angeles made the trade for Watkins, there are no easy games for the Cardinals. A team that is already in a very bad way at the cornerback position, suddenly it has to contend with some dangerous receivers playing for its NFC West foes.\n\nAs we detailed before, Watkins joins what could be a dangerous receiving group in Los Angeles. Seattle is always tough, featuring the underappreciated Doug Baldwin, Tyler Lockett, tight end Jimmy Graham and whoever else is out there with them from play to play. Then there's the San Francisco 49ers, who have a very intriguing group, led by Pierre Garcon.\n\nNo matter how you slice it, Arizona has its hands full with every team in the NFC West and could be staring at another disappointing campaign.\n\nWithout an offensive line or a semblance of a passing attack to keep opposing defenses from crowding the line of scrimmage, Gurley was awful last year. He gained just 885 yards on the ground at a 3.2 yards-per-carry clip, scoring six touchdowns. Things should be a heck of a lot different for the talented running back this year. Not only does he have some receivers who can make big plays, but he's got an improved offensive line in front of him.\n\nThis should get him back on track in a big way. Fantasy owners take note.\n\nLoser: Tyrod Taylor setting up to be fall guy during rebuilding year\n\nThe Bills brought Taylor back to Buffalo after spending months debating about the prospect of letting him go. In the end, he had to take a massive pay cut to remain with the team. Already, there have been reports indicating Taylor has not performed well overall in training camp. Now he's lost his top receiver.\n\nBuffalo now enters the 2017 season with three top receivers who excel in the slot and none who do not. It's going to really impact Taylor's ability to make plays down the field, which has been a big part of his game. It certainly appears Taylor is being set up as a fall guy this year. We don't expect him to have the kind of year that screams, \"I'm your franchise quarterback!\" This will give Buffalo license to move on without any real issues from its fan base next year.\n\nWinner: Nelson Agholor's time to shine as slot specialist for Eagles\n\nWith Jordan Matthews now in Buffalo, there's no doubt about Agholor's future with the Eagles this year. He's going to be the team's primary slot specialist. And based on every single report that's emerged going all the way back to OTAs, he's on a mission to succeed.\n\nOffensive coordinator Frank Reich hinted even before Matthews was dealt that Agholor would be in line for more work in 2017 than he got last season. The former USC star has hauled in 59 passes for 648 yards and three touchdowns in his first two seasons in the NFL. If Agholor can stay healthy this year, he'll easily exceed that two-year total with a big-time campaign.\n\nLoser: Les Snead continues to gamble with future of Rams\n\nShort term, what Snead has done to give his young passer a chance to succeed is pretty darn cool. Long term, however, what Snead has done the past couple of years could very well cripple the Rams from keeping the rest of the roster up to snuff. The Rams gave up a king's ransom to move up in last year's draft for Goff.

No starting players remain at any position entering the 2017 season.\n\nSammy Watkins was the only starting receiver left from last season before Buffalo shipped him to the Los Angeles Rams on Friday. In Los Angeles, Watkins will be reunited with Robert Woods, the Bills' leading receiver in receptions and yards in 2016. The Rams signed Woods to a 5-year, $34 million deal in free agency.\n\nBuffalo's starting receivers weren't the only two to leave the team. The Bills also lost Marquise Goodwin and Justin Hunter in free agency.\n\nGoodwin will see Watkins and Woods two-times per year in the NFC West after signing a 2-year, $6 million contract with the San Francisco 49ers. Goodwin dealt with injuries throughout his tenure with the Bills, but he finished third in receiving yards last season after career-highs in catches (29) and yards (431). Hunter joined the Pittsburgh Steelers in free agency after catching 10 passes for 189 yards and four touchdowns in Buffalo.\n\nBuffalo's top four receivers from 2016 are gone and the only receivers who recorded a reception in Buffalo last season are Walter Powell and Brandon Tate. The two combined to catch 22 passes for 259 yards. Buffalo will look to replace their former top four with Zay Jones, Jordan Matthews, Anquan Boldin and Andre Holmes.\n\nThe changes at wide receiver are stunning, but it pales in comparison to the secondary.\n\nBuffalo let Stephon Gilmore leave in free agency to the Patriots and traded away Ronald Darby to the Eagles for the aforementioned Matthews and a 2018 third round pick. Buffalo's starting nickel cornerback in 2016, Nickell Robey-Coleman, is also gone after the team released him in the offseason. Other cornerbacks who aren't on the roster from one year ago include Corey White and Marcus Roberson.\n\nThe only returning cornerback from Buffalo's 2016 53-man roster is Kevon Seymour. It's possible that Seymour competes with recent acquisition E.J. Gaines for the outside cornerback job opposite rookie Tre'Davious White or defeats Leonard Johnson for the slot cornerback job, but Buffalo's top three cornerbacks may be completely different this season.\n\nSafety will also look completely different in 2017. Aaron Williams and Corey Graham, Buffalo's starting duo in 2016, were both released. They were replaced in free agency when the team signed Micah Hyde and Jordan Poyer. Other safeties who played for the Bills in 2016 that aren't on the team's current roster include Robert Blanton, Duke Williams, Jonathan Meeks, James Ihedigbo and Sergio Brown. Colt Anderson and Shamiel Gary are the only safeties remaining from 2016 and neither is a complete lock to make the team's final roster.\n\nTurnover is expected when teams bring in new regimes, but the Bills will essentially be starting over at wide receiver, cornerback and safety in 2017.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T18:02:00Z", "sim": 0.5529412031173706, "source": {"uri": "newyorkupstate.com", "title": "NewYorkUpstate.com", "id": "18847"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "03:32:00", "url": "http://www.newyorkupstate.com/buffalo-bills/index.ssf/2017/08/buffalo_bills_starting_over_at_wide_receiver_and_secondary_in_2017.html", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8867533", "image": "http://image.newyorkupstate.com/home/nyup-media/width620/img/buffalo-bills/photo/2017/08/12/23222836-standard.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "18:02:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

Gaines for Watkins in this deal and if I am Buffalo, I am happy with that haul. You now have two picks in the first three rounds in the 2018 draft, so you can have options going into the next season. That part is a great deal for them. Getting E.J. is great for them as well.\n\nBuffalo had just traded Ronald Darby, so getting Gaines to start in his place is key. They won the trade I would say. The Rams get an injury-prone receiver for two potential starters (we don't know what the second round pick will be). The problem for the Rams is wondering who on earth will be that starting cornerback aside Trumaine Johnson?\n\nIf the Rams had stability at the cornerback position, this would probably be okay. However, the Rams have lacked depth at that position for a while now. Looking at the depth chart, they will probably start Kayvon Webster. He is capable, but he was not as good as Gaines was in the past. The Rams will need to sign or trade for another corner now because they have little to no depth at that position, considering Lamarcus Joyner is a safety now.\n\nLooking at the future with this trade, the Rams are shaping up to be more about win now rebuilding. That needs to stop. The Rams are not close to winning now. Gaines was a bit of a project and was developing quite nicely. Then, the Rams pull the seat out from underneath us and do this trade. Watkins has proven he can't stay healthy, and to a certain extent, Gaines has shown that too. The difference is that the Rams do not have long-term stability at the cornerback position. It is a fluid situation.\n\nLet's not forget, the Rams have refused to pay Trumaine Johnson for the past two offseasons. He is probably fed up with the Rams and wants to leave. Where does that leave the Rams in the defensive backfield if he walks? Kayvon Webster will be the top cornerback and Troy Hill will be the number two corner. That is a recipe for disaster right there. E.J. gave the Rams a solid defensive backfield and now that part of the team has become a potential liability.\n\nAlso, this could be a problem with Sean McVay. It is his first head coaching job, so he is inclined to go more offense heavy than defense heavy. He wants to rebuild this Rams offense. However, he needs to listen to his assistants, especially Wade Phillips. I cannot imagine Phillips is happy with this trade. McVay wants to get this Rams offense back to its greatness, but getting a receiver that is injury-prone and probably will play only 10 games a year will not get you there.\n\nAnother major problem is Sammy is in the last year of his contract. So, not only are you risking it by getting an injury-prone receiver, but you're getting him at a high price with no guarantee of him coming back the following season. The risks are outweighing the rewards at this point.\n\nAs much as I say I dislike this trade, there is one positive: the Rams finally have a number one receiver. They have lacked that since Torry Holt was gone and it is nice to know that they have that number one target again. It gives the offense a little excitement, something that it has lacked for years. If Sammy can stay healthy, I will retract everything I said because that will be exciting as a Rams fan.\n\nOverall, this trade is not the best. The Rams now weakened a position of uncertainty for a very uncertain receiver. It is a big risk considering Watkins is in his last year of his contract. Now, the Rams have to go address their cornerback concern more than they needed to before the trade. Watkins could turn out to be a great trade, but as it stands now, this was a bad trade for the Rams.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T15:32:00Z", "sim": 0.5490196347236633, "source": {"uri": "isportsweb.com", "title": "isportsweb", "id": "4620"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "18:08:00", "url": "http://www.isportsweb.com/2017/08/11/reaction-sammy-watkins-trade/", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8676326", "image": "http://www.isportsweb.com/wp-content/uploads//2017/08/USATSI_9726154.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "15:32:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

Here are the earliest implications from the three moves.\n\nEzekiel Elliott, RB, Cowboys\n\nEzekiel Elliott will reportedly be suspended for six games this NFL season but he will assuredly appeal the suspension. Which makes things murkey for fantasy purposes. If he appeals, how long will it take? Will he be able to play for the entire season during the appeals process, much like Tom Brady did before his 2016 suspension for Deflategate? If so, his stock remains the same and he'll go as a top 4 pick. However, if he serves the entire suspension or received a ruling on the appeal during the season, he will miss time.\n\nWhether that time is lessened to two games or four games there still lies uncertainty that Elliott could miss valuable time for the Cowboys -- and if it's early in the season that's a problem for fantasy owners.\n\nWhether or not he's worth a gamble in the first round is up to team owners, but the best advice is to take a calculated risk on him if he's still around in the second or third round.\n\nJordan Matthews, WR, Bills\n\nMatthews went from being in a tight competition to earn a spot in the slot (against Nelson Agholor) to being, perhaps, the No. 1 guy in Buffalo in a manner of minutes. Anquan Bolden will likely flank Matthews on the outside with rookie Zay Jones vying to play in the slot. Other contenders at wideout for Buffalo include Rod Streeter and Corey Brown.\n\nThe competiton isn't exactly fierce, and the big bodied Matthews could easily become Tyron Taylor's top target. Matthews, entering his fourth NFL season, was a mid-round target at best but should beg consideration more toward the top part of your fantasy draft, perhaps in the first five or six rounds.\n\nMatthews will not be the deep threat Watkins was, as the No. 11 projected receiver, but he will command possession as he has made more than 220 catches in his first three seasons and will be valuable in a PPR league.\n\nSammy Watkins, WR, Rams\n\nThe Rams will also gain a No. 1 wideout with Watkins' move to the Rams. Will a change of scenery help the oft-injured speedy wideout stay on the field? That is unlikely. The injury risk is always in play for Watkins, but he reamins the top option and will be a gift for former first overall pick Jared Goff. Tavon Austin, Robert Woods and Mike Thomas will flank him at wideout in Los Angeles.\n\nAs Goff's top target Watkins is worth taking in the top half of a fantasy draft but could take a half step backwards with a novice quarterback throwing to him. His stock is slightly down as Matthews' ticks way up.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T15:39:00Z", "sim": 0.545098066329956, "source": {"uri": "metro.us", "title": "Metro", "id": "354"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "18:08:00", "url": "http://www.metro.us/sports/fantasy-football-jordan-matthews-stock-rise-after-trade-sammy-watkins-ezekiel-elloitt-stock", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8676315", "image": "http://www.metro.us/sites/default/files/main/articles/2014/11/21/sptn_sammy_watkins.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "15:39:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

They also picked up a third-round draft pick for Darby.\n\nRelated News: 12 August 2017 Bigg Boss Tamil and Telugu Conquering Rating Charts 12 August 2017 Former Uber CEO sued for fraud Beyond the fiery words, United States quietly pursues diplomacy with North Korea 12 August 2017 Stocks Remain Firmly Negative In Mid-Day Trading 12 August 2017 Thierry Henry raves over Arsenal signing Alexandre Lacazette 12 August 2017 Trump better president than Obama 12 August 2017 Trump's war threats against North Korea 'the art of the bluff': Zakaria 12 August 2017 Investment Banker Arrested, Denies Pushing Woman Into London Bus Path 12 August 2017 Most say time to end effort to repeal Obama health law 12 August 2017 Elon Musk confirms Tesla Model 3 performance version coming next year Liberty Media Corporation - Ser (NASDAQ:FWONK) Sees Significantly Higher Trading Volume 12 August 2017 China slams US Navy's new 'provocation' in South China Sea", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-08-12", "textEnd": 1473, "textStart": 1459, "freq": 10}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T13:02:00Z", "sim": 0.545098066329956, "source": {"uri": "xnewspress.com", "title": "xnewspress.com", "id": "19050"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "03:32:00", "url": "http://xnewspress.com/2017/08/are-the-rams-just-trying-to-recreate-the-2016-bills/", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8867618", "image": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "13:02:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

The tenuous starter of the Bills cannot have a good season, and he has been put in a position where he cannot capitalize on his leverage as a serviceable starter. You may take a passing interest in Taylor, but the loss of Sammy Watkins is a death knell for his tenure in Buffalo.\n\nTyrod Taylor is a gifted football player from Virginia Tech, and he has done a lot with very little in Buffalo.\n\nHowever, the Bills moved heaven and earth to get Sammy Watkins, under-utilized him, and traded him to L.A. Taylor has no one of consequence to throw the ball to, and he cannot create a good resume without weapons. This will cause problems for him going forward because the philosophy in Buffalo does not favor him.\n\nThe Bills appear to be fixing the mistakes of the past. They fired their GM days after the draft, and they are treating the team like a rebuild. They have a young quarterback who cannot afford a rebuild when his contract leaves him open to being waived at the drop of the hat. The result of a rebuilding year could be Taylor's exit from Buffalo.\n\nThe Bills could fall in love with a new prospect at any time, and they could leave Taylor out to dry simply because they want to start over.\n\nNew regimes tend to bring in their own people, and they will draft their own prospects.

There are no teams vying for his services, and it does not help the Bills to trade him.\n\nTyrod has only one way to keep his job in Buffalo for the years to come. He must have the best year of his career, and he must prove to the Bills that drafting another quarterback for development will set them back further than they want to go. The Bills have not been to the playoffs in ages, and they cannot string along their fans forever. Keeping Taylor will provide stability, but he must play in a way that convinces them to keep him.\n\nTyrod has all the physical gifts to be a great NFL quarterback, but he is in a bad situation in Buffalo. He must be given more weapons, more time, or a staff that believes in him.

Buffalo addressed both positions by acquiring receiver Jordan Matthews from Philadelphia and cornerback E.J. Gaines from the Rams.\n\nThe Bills also continued looking to the future by further stockpiling 2018 draft selections. They acquired a second-round pick from L.A. and a third-rounder from the Eagles, while also sending a sixth-round pick to the Rams. Add in the acquisition of the Kansas Chiefs' first-round pick in trade completed in April, and the Bills now have two picks in each of the first three rounds next year.\n\nThe additional picks provide Bills new general manager Brandon Beane assets in a draft that looks like it will have several top-end quarterback prospects. Bills starter Tyrod Taylor's future is uncertain beyond this year.\n\nBeane disputed the notion he's strictly looking ahead to next year.\n\n\"This is not a throw-in-the-towel thing at all,\" Beane said. \"If we were throwing in the towel, I wouldn't be trying to get that starting receiver back.\"\n\nThe deals, however, involve more changes to a team with just 28 players who opened training camp on Buffalo's roster a year ago. The Bills also have just 14 players whom they've drafted, not including this year's six-player class.\n\nWatkins' future in Buffalo was already in question after the Bills declined to pick up his fifth-year contract option in May. He is entering the final year of his deal. Matthews is also entering the final season of his contract, so the Eagles also faced the possibility of losing him in free agency.\n\nWatkins showed glimpses of being a dynamic threat when healthy in three seasons with Buffalo since being selected in the first round of the 2014 draft. He has 153 catches for 2,459 yards and 17 touchdowns in three seasons, but topped 1,000 yards just once, in 2015.\n\nWatkins has been hampered by an assortment of injuries and limited to playing just eight games last year after having surgery to repair a broken left foot. He required a second operation in January after aggravating the injury last season.\n\nHe joins a revamped group of receivers on a Rams offense that has ranked last in the NFL in each of the past two seasons.\n\nThe change for the Bills came four days after signing veteran free agent Anquan Boldin . Matthews was Philadelphia's most productive receiver, averaging 75 catches, 891 receiving yards and six touchdowns in his first three seasons. But the Eagles signed free-agent receivers Alshon Jeffery and Torrey Smith and drafted Mack Hollins and Shelton Gibson.\n\nDarby started 29 games in his first two seasons in Buffalo. He was a second-round pick (50th overall) in the 2015 draft.\n\nAP source: Tannehill to miss season\n\nRyan Tannehill has decided surgery can no longer be avoided.\n\nThe Miami Dolphins quarterback will undergo an operation to repair the torn ACL in his left knee and will miss the entire season, a person familiar with the decision said Friday.\n\nThe person confirmed the decision to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the Dolphins hadn't disclosed it publicly. Tannehill will be placed on injured reserve, the person said.\n\nTannehill, who missed the final four games of last season with two sprained ligaments in his knee, reinjured it a week into training camp on Aug. 3. The Dolphins consulted with specialists before the team and Tannehill decided surgery was the best option.\n\nTannehill opted not to have surgery after last season's injury, and instead rehabilitated the partially torn ligaments and underwent stem cell treatments.\n\nJay Cutler, who parted with the Chicago Bears after eight seasons, agreed to delay his fledgling network TV career and signed a $10 million, one-year contract Monday to replace Tannehill. Cutler, 34, might make his Dolphins debut in their second exhibition game next Thursday.\n\nTannehill won the No. 1 job for Miami's opener in his rookie season of 2012 and made 77 consecutive starts before his injury last season. He's expected to be ready for the start of training camp next season.\n\nAP Source: Broncos' Winn out for 2017 with knee injury\n\nA person with knowledge of the diagnosis says Denver Broncos nose tackle Billy Winn will miss the entire 2017 season with a serious right knee injury.\n\nThe person, speaking on condition of anonymity Friday because the team hadn't announced results of Winn's medical tests, said Winn tore ligaments in his right knee, including the anterior cruciate ligament, on Thursday night.\n\nWinn was caught under the pile on a Bears run in the first quarter of the Broncos' exhibition game in Chicago.\n\nWinn, a sixth-year pro from Boise State, played in all 16 games last season in his first year in Denver. He was set to rotate with newcomers Domata Peko and Zach Kerr, among others, on the Broncos' rebuilt D-line.\n\nAP source: Dolphins rookie to miss season\n\nPromising Miami Dolphins rookie linebacker Raekwon McMillan will miss the entire season with a torn ACL in his right knee, a person familiar with the situation said Friday.\n\nThe person confirmed the diagnosis to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the Dolphins had not disclosed the severity of the injury. McMillan was the front-runner to win the starting job at middle linebacker until he was hurt covering a punt early in Thursday's exhibition opener against Atlanta.\n\nMcMillan was taken in the second round with the 54th overall pick in the April draft after making 275 tackles in three seasons at Ohio State.\n\nThe loss of the rookie is the latest blow for the Dolphins in an injury-filled training camp. Quarterback Ryan Tannehill suffered a knee injury that will likely sideline him for the entire season, running back Jay Ajayi is recovering from a concussion, and guard Ted Larsen will miss significant time with a torn biceps muscle.\n\nLinebacker Koa Misi's season ended two days before the start of training camp when he was placed on injured reserve because of a lingering neck injury. With McMillan now also out, Miami is in the market to add a linebacker and shore up an area that was already thin.\n\nJaguars release vet Branden Albert\n\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars have released left tackle Branden Albert, ending a strange saga that lasted nearly two weeks.\n\nThe 32-year-old Albert is now free to sign with any other NFL team.\n\nThe Jaguars and Albert had been locked in a stalemate over how the sides would part ways. Albert left the team Aug. 31, telling coach Doug Marrone he planned to retire.\n\nThe Jaguars responded by placing Albert on the exempt/left squad list, meaning he had five days to return or he would forfeit his current contract and be unable to play in the league in 2017.\n\nThe relationship seemingly became more strained when the Jaguars considered going after a prorated portion ($3.4 million) of Albert's $8.5 million signing bonus even though Miami paid it in 2014.\n\nNot surprisingly, Albert then told the team he changed his mind and wanted to return.\n\nJacksonville, which was clearly ready to part ways with a player who looked out of shape and past his prime during three training camp practices, responded by placing him on the reserve/retired list. That meant Albert's contract was paused, and Jacksonville retained his rights.\n\nReleasing him Friday quite possibly was a reaction to Albert planning to show up for practice this weekend. Whether Albert really wants to play in 2017 probably will become evident if he signs with another team in the coming days or weeks.\n\nIt was never completely clear why Albert considered retirement after nine NFL seasons, but it appears he didn't want to play in Jacksonville.\n\nThe Jaguars acquired Albert in a trade with the Dolphins in March, giving up a conditional seventh-round pick in 2018. Jacksonville gets the pick back if Albert fails to be on a 53-man roster for at least three regular-season games in 2017.\n\nAlbert skipped most of Jacksonville's offseason program because he wanted a new contract. Jacksonville negated Albert's bargaining power when it selected Alabama left tackle Cam Robinson in the second round of the NFL draft.\n\nAlso Friday, the Jaguars signed veteran running back Jonathan Grimes and waived/injured running back Tyler Gaffney.\n\nGrimes has appeared in 53 games, totaling 619 yards rushing and two touchdowns.

That's what you do in this business. You put one step in front of the other and you move on. I asked them to continue to trust me and our decisions, in terms of what we're doing, and we need to be focused on what's in front of us.\"\n\nGeneral manager Brandon Beane said Friday he had been receiving trade calls about Watkins since Beane was hired in May, days after the Bills declined Watkins' fifth-year contract option for 2018. Beane presented the Los Angeles Rams' proposal -- a 2018 second-round pick and cornerback E.J. Gaines in exchange for Watkins and a 2018 sixth-round pick -- to McDermott and owner Terry Pegula after the Bills' preseason loss Thursday night to the Minnesota Vikings.\n\n\"I'm always going to listen,\" McDermott said of the trade proposal. \"Brandon's job, and his staff's, is they go out and find players. And it's our job to develop the players. So as a football coach, it's my job as Brandon approaches me with a potential situation, to listen. I'm protective of our players. I'm very protective of our players, and it's got to be the right deal, the right situation for us to do something like this.\n\n\"I feel like we're moving in the right direction, I honestly believe that. And I would end by saying this: I have the ultimate trust in Brandon and his staff.\"\n\nQuarterback Tyrod Taylor, who loses his top receiver in Watkins, and running back LeSean McCoy both echoed McDermott's trust in Beane in making the right deal.\n\n\"The good thing about that is it's past my pay grade,\" McCoy said. \"Those guys make the decisions for our team. As players and coaches, they coach and we play. That's how it works.\"\n\nMcCoy, who was traded from the Philadelphia Eagles in 2015 for linebacker Kiko Alonso, said he can relate to Watkins in that he was dealt for \"a guy he's probably better than\" in wide receiver Jordan Matthews. The Bills acquired Matthews on Friday along with Philadelphia's 2018 third-round pick for Darby.\n\n\"If you compare the two, it's obvious [that] you can agree who is better,\" McCoy said of Watkins and Matthews.\n\nThe Bills' two trades Friday give the team a total of six selections in the first three rounds of the 2018 draft. However, the deals could weaken Buffalo's chances of improving on their 7-9 record from last season.\n\nAsked Friday if the Bills are better off for the upcoming season after making the moves, Beane said, \"you can make an argument either way.\" Beane also pushed back against the idea that Buffalo is not putting the best team on the field in 2017 in order to move on from quarterback Tyrod Taylor and find his replacement in the draft next spring.\n\n\"It doesn't say anything,\" said Beane about what the trade means for Taylor. \"Everybody's forgetting [signing Anquan] Boldin last week. This is not a throw-in-the-towel thing at all. Somebody mentioned that somebody said that out there, and honestly, that's annoying to me. You don't know me if you think I'm throwing in the towel. When I go out there and play ping pong, whatever I'm doing, I'm not throwing in the towel. If we're throwing in the towel, we're not trying to get a starting receiver back.\n\n\"To your question on Tyrod, it's nothing. We got Anquan, who we added. I told you, I honestly believe he's a Hall of Famer, he still can play in this league. Jordan Matthews is a starting receiver. If you look at his numbers and what he's done, those aren't anything to laugh at. So Tyrod will get every opportunity to lead this team, and we're all rooting for him. It's our best interest.\"\n\nMcDermott understands Bills' fans frustrations about another potential rebuilding season after the franchise has missed the playoffs for the past 17 seasons.\n\n\"I get it,\" McDermott said. \"I absolutely get it. That's why I didn't sleep [Thursday] night, because these are tough decisions. As I said before, I'm a part of that [playoff drought]. When I signed my name on the dotted line, I became a part of that 17-year time period. I see the RVs pulled out here every game. I heard about it, and then [Thursday night] I experienced it.\n\n\"I'm invested. I feel what they feel. We're building a football team. We're building a football team that we want to compete in the short and the long term and to be good for a long time. Sometimes that's a day-to-day process and sometimes those are not easy decisions from a leadership standpoint. I understand where [the fans] are coming from. That said, we're going to compete like crazy.\"", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T23:58:00Z", "sim": 0.5411764979362488, "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "title": "ESPN.com", "id": "4"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "23:58:00", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/20317203", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8721613", "image": "http://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0622%2Fr223116_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "23:58:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

Rather, the focus was predictably on the fallout from the Eagles' decision to trade Jordan Matthews to the Buffalo Bills.\n\nAs you can imagine, a number of Eagles players were bummed that Matthews is gone, including starting quarterback Carson Wentz. Wentz was one of several players who took Matthews out to dinner last night after news of the trade broke. He also drove his former teammate to the airport.\n\nHere's what Wentz had to say about JMatt after practice on Saturday, via ESPN:\n\n\"On the personal side, it's tough\" an emotional Wentz said as he was coming off the practice field. \"This is my first time experiencing this with someone that's one of my best friends. Seeing him yesterday, it's tough on him, too. It's kind of out of the blue.\"\n\nAgain, it's hardly surprising to see this somber reaction to Matthews being traded. He worked very hard. He was a fun, engaging personality. He seemed like a genuinely good dude to have in the locker room.\n\nIt's never ideal to make a move that upsets the team's franchise quarterback. Matthews wasn't just one of Wentz's best friends -- he was also one of his favorite targets on the field.\n\nBut just as Carson said, the NFL is a business. JMatt is hardly the first well-liked player to be traded. The mood may have been \"down\" in the Eagles locker room on Saturday, as Malcolm Jenkins described it, but these guys are professionals. There's a job to be done and they'll get over it with time.\n\nAnd while the timing of Matthews' trade may have been a surprise, it's not like there was anything ensuring his long-term future in Philadelphia. He's a free agent at the end of this season. There's no guarantee the Eagles would or could have re-signed him.\n\nMaybe I lack the proper \"emotional intelligence\" but I think some of what's been said/written about the locker room missing Matthews is being overstated. There's no doubt the players are really bummed. I just have a hard time believing it'll have some kind of meaningful long-term impact on the team.\n\nIs Wentz going to throw an interception in Week 3 because he was too busy thinking about how sad he is that JMatt isn't here anymore? I don't think so.\n\nLet's assume the Eagles don't make this trade. And let's rightfully assume the cornerbacks are getting torched all game long. At least Wentz feels good because JMatt is still on the team, right? Doubtful.\n\nWentz is a super competitive dude who ultimately wants to win. You don't decide to become a professional football player with the primary objective of making friends.\n\nFurthermore, NFL franchises don't build winning teams by solely operating on emotional decisions. The Matthews trade wasn't personal. Howie Roseman acknowledged it was a tough deal to make. But the Eagles had an opportunity to improve the team and they took it.\n\nThe mood in the locker room will eventually improve, especially if the team is winning. And acquiring a talented, young cornerback could make success more easily achievable.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T07:28:00Z", "sim": 0.5411764979362488, "source": {"uri": "bleedinggreennation.com", "title": "Bleeding Green Nation", "id": "6261"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "14:07:00", "url": "https://www.bleedinggreennation.com/2017/8/13/16140018/eagles-players-carson-wentz-jordan-matthews-trade-ronald-darby-philadelphia-reaction-zach-ertz-wr-qb", "storyUri": "eng-3355470", "id": "8924668", "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l3ib4dTmuVQLJXr5KBOiJdqbfCw=/0x183:4157x2521/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56169563/usa_today_9565628.0.jpg", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "07:28:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

Jordan Matthews joins the Bills.\n\nEzekiel Elliott's on the shelf for the first six weeks, after playing chicken with an NFL suspension and finally losing.\n\nSee, this why you don't do fantasy football drafts before the first week of preseason. After Friday's developments, I put fantasy managers in two buckets: the people who've already picked Elliott and are sticking pins in a hastily made voodoo doll, and the rest of us, who are throwing bricks through our draft boards.\n\nThanks, NFL. Next you'll pull the rug on us by not lifting Martavis Bryant's suspension. Oh well, no use crying over spent draft picks, let's just run down how to adjust to each situation from a fantasy football perspective.\n\nThe NFL suspend Elliott suspend for six weeks on the heels of its domestic violence investigation.\n\nI'm not going to lie: It's not pretty. It's not Adrian Peterson 2014 bad, but it's a predicament. Elliott was a top-three pick.\n\nThe best option would be a trade. One idea: Swing a two-for-one deal for two solid, mid-level players or a solid player and a sleeper (though at least one player in either package should be a running back). You could also wait until you get closer to Elliott's reinstatement when his value will be higher and you can better assess potential trade partners' rosters.\n\nFor standard-league drafts to come, Elliott drops to the fifth or sixth round, depending on your league size. Ideally he's your third running back, or if he's your RB2, you have at least two blue chips at other positions.\n\nThe Bills ship Watkins to the Rams and acquire fellow wide receiver Jordan Matthews from the Eagles.\n\nWe won't get into the other details of the trades, just how they affect the principals on each team.\n\nWatkins: Congratulations, Sammy, you leave one middling quarterback (Tyrod Taylor) and gain another middling quarterback (Jared Goff). Goff does appear to have a higher trajectory, but this trade shouldn't affect Watkins draft status. Matthews: On the one hand, he leaves a budding star in Carson Wentz, but on the other hand, he's the clear go-to receiver in Buffalo. He'll probably see a slight uptick in production than he would've in Philadelphia, but it's not enough to move up draft boards to get him. Taylor: Being a good fantasy producer and being a good quarterback aren't one and the same. He barely cracked 3,000 yards last season and doesn't get as many opportunities as many starters, but here's one way Matthews give him an upgrade versus Watkins: durability. Matthews has missed two games in his three-year career compared to Watkins' 11 over the same span. Wentz: It's never good to lose your favorite target to another team but Wentz will compensate. Nelson Agholor, Mack Hollins and others have had strong camps. Still, new main man Alshon Jeffery already has a shoulder, as Dave Wannstedt would say -- Bears fans know where I'm going with this. Goff: You can debate whether Taylor's better off with Watkins or Matthews, but there's no arguing Watkins is an improvement over Tavon Austin and Robert Woods, who incidentally was Watkins' teammate last year (Geez, are the Rams collecting Bills now?). Goff's still no better than a No. 3 option, but at least Watkins (if he can stay healthy) makes Goff draftable.\n\nplthompson@chicagotribune.com\n\nTwitter @_phil_thompson", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T19:27:00Z", "sim": 0.5333333611488342, "source": {"uri": "chicagotribune.com", "title": "Chicago Tribune", "id": "1697"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "19:27:00", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/ct-fantasy-football-ezekiel-elliott-suspension-20170811-story.html", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8688109", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-598e00be/turbine/ct-fantasy-football-ezekiel-elliott-suspension-20170811", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "19:27:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

However, there's another topic I should hit on first.\n\nThe Eagles traded wide receiver Jordan Matthews and a future third-round pick to the Buffalo Bills in exchange for cornerback Ronald Darby, a 23-year-old former second-round selection with outstanding top-end speed and a reputation around the league as one of the up-and-coming corners in the NFL. What does Darby bring to the table and how can he help this Eagles defense in 2017? I went back to my notes on him coming out of Florida State in 2015 and went through a boatload of his tape from his NFL career to help tell the story.\n\nWith the Seminoles, Darby was an immediate impact player on a team destined for glory. After being named the ACC Defensive Rookie of the Year in 2012 as a true freshman (on a unit that led the conference in points and passing yards allowed), Darby started nine games for the BCS National Champions in 2013. He was a third-team All-ACC pick as a junior in 2014 when, according to NFL.com, he allowed fewer than 42 percent of the passes thrown in his direction to be caught.\n\nAt Florida State, Darby played a ton of press man coverage, and that's where he looked at his best. They played some Cover 3 and some quarters, but he looked like a pure man-to-man corner in college. Whether he was at the line of scrimmage or backed up in off coverage (which he is also capable of doing at a high level), his athleticism allowed him to consistently compete at the catch point in man coverage. He's a top-level athlete at the cornerback position, and it starts with his recovery speed.\n\nAt the 2015 Combine, Darby ran a 4.32 40-yard dash. Exactly three cornerbacks picked in the last 10 (!) seasons have bested that time, and all of them were Day 3 picks. This, to me, says that none of them were anywhere near the kind of football player that Darby, a top-50 selection that April, has the ability to be. When I studied him out of FSU, I wrote that Darby was \"extremely light on his feet and showed great deep speed downfield with the ability to carry vertical receivers with ease.\"\n\nAt the cornerback position, speed is a great starting point because it gives you the ability to stay \"in-phase\" at all levels of the field. When I say \"in-phase,\" I'm referring to a defender's ability to stay shoulder to shoulder with a receiver downfield, close enough where he can grab the opponent's wallet out of his hip pocket. From this in-phase position, a cornerback can properly and effectively keep his eyes on the quarterback and, more importantly, the football, allowing him to go up and make a play in the air. Here are two examples of Darby doing just that.\n\nShot 1 - 2 picture perfect examples of Darby's ability to stay 'in-phase', keeping him in position to play the ball. All starts w/ his SPEED pic.twitter.com/6shK0QhqW8 -- Fran Duffy (@fduffy3)\n\nAugust 12, 2017\n\nWhen you have the kind of speed that Darby has, it makes it much easier for you to stay in-phase, because you can stay hip to hip with a receiver much more effectively and comfortably. Remember, a corner is at an immediate disadvantage before the snap of the ball because more often than not he has to turn and run with a receiver, who merely has to run straight ahead. Darby's speed gives him a really good starting point to stay in the right position to make the play.\n\nIn the NFL, however, things don't always go as planned when you play on the outside at this position. You're going to get beat a handful of times (or more) in any game. Having great speed gives you the ability to recover, meaning that when you're \"out of phase\" (trying to catch up to the receiver downfield), you can catch up and get back into phase at a much quicker pace.\n\nShot 2 - Speed not only lets you stay in-phase from the snap but it also gives you the chance to recover. This is outstanding makeup speed pic.twitter.com/isXtQdBd14 -- Fran Duffy (@fduffy3)\n\nAugust 12, 2017\n\nThis is exactly what I'm talking about. There appears to be some pre-snap confusion, and the secondary is not set before Colts quarterback Andrew Luck gets the ball. Darby's man runs right by him early in the down. Luck thinks he's got an easy touchdown, but this is where the recovery speed comes into play. Darby catches up to the receiver - one of the most explosive weapons in the league in T.Y. Hilton - gets his eyes back to the ball and is able to finish in the air for the interception. Darby doesn't have the greatest hands in the league, as his two career interceptions would attest. Was this play picture-perfect from snap to whistle? No, but Darby's raw speed can help make up for a lot of things.\n\nThat speed and explosiveness don't just show up on vertical routes. I mentioned earlier that Darby did play a good amount of off coverage with the Seminoles, and he's done it in Buffalo as well. In my notes, I wrote how his feet \"were very clean in his pedal, showing the ability to click and close with ease on throws in front of him.\"\n\nWhat does \"click and close\" mean? Imagine a corner in off coverage drop in his pedal. The receiver in front of him breaks off his route, and the corner sticks his foot in the ground and immediately breaks forward on the throw. Some call that \"clicking and closing,\" others may say \"plant and drive.\" No matter what you call it, Darby's got the ability to do it at a high level.\n\nShot 3 - Watch Darby 'click & close' on this slant route from OBJ. This is also where his ease of movement and explosiveness come into play pic.twitter.com/7n6u8Af2Uu -- Fran Duffy (@fduffy3)\n\nAugust 12, 2017\n\nThis is a shot from 2015 against Odell Beckham Jr., who runs a quick slant right in front of Darby. From an off coverage position, Darby pedals in reverse, and right when he sees Beckham break inside you see him plant his inside foot, open up at a 45-degree angle, and explode to the catch point. The ball is thrown to the receiver's back shoulder, and Darby shoots his hands through Beckham's to get it on the ground. This was a third-down play that resulted in a punt for the Giants. We haven't been able to see any corners this summer for the Eagles with those kinds of explosive traits, which is why the addition of Darby complements the skill sets of the other corners on the depth chart so well.\n\nAs Eagles fans are aware of, being the smart football fans that they are, it takes more than just athleticism, quickness, and change of direction to be a good man coverage player, regardless of whether you play cornerback, safety, or linebacker. A large part of that success comes from instincts, route recognition, and discipline in coverage. There are times, both in college and in the NFL, where Darby was undercut by a receiver because he was a bit too far over the top, or where he was a bit late to break off with the receiver at the top of his stem on, say, a comeback route. He gets his hips flipped too easily and turned around in coverage at times. Does he have the athleticism to lock down the most talented receivers on a consistent snap-to-snap basis?\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nLast year, I thought there were a few contributing factors to what many analysts have referred to as a \"down year.\" Some of the receptions he gave up came in situations like I stated above, some came on great routes on double moves by receivers, and others were plays where he was just beaten at the catch point.\n\nAs he said in his introductory press conference, he believes that he needs to \"finish\" better, and when he said that I absolutely thought back to some of those plays. There are plenty of examples of where that dynamic athleticism shows up at the top of routes and he breaks on throws EXACTLY how you want at the position. When it happens, it's a pretty sight to see.\n\nShot 4 - Darby's quickness and COD skills are also apparent at the top of route breaks. Watch him here against Kenny Stills / Nuk Hopkins pic.twitter.com/v4cm2t4hf0 -- Fran Duffy (@fduffy3)\n\nAugust 12, 2017\n\nIn the first shot above, Darby is matched up on speedster Kenny Stills at the top of the screen. This is actually a great route by Stills, who sells the vertical route HARD, even looking back at the quarterback for a split second to try and pretend he's looking for the ball. Darby doesn't bite, and you see him sink his hips and drive back to the sideline step for step with Stills to force the incomplete pass. Darby faces a similar route from DeAndre Hopkins on the next shot, and again stays right in the receiver's hip pocket to break up the throw. Darby has had some issues with these kinds of routes in the past, but it's not for lack of ability. He's got the skill set to cover any receiver in this league one-on-one.\n\nShot 5 - There are times where Darby can get turned around in coverage, but watch how well he recovers here for the PBU. Top-end athleticism pic.twitter.com/uUDAXnBIHW -- Fran Duffy (@fduffy3)\n\nAugust 12, 2017\n\nOn this play against Jacksonville, Darby faces another strong route, this time from wide receiver Allen Hurns, who sells the vertical route by feigning an outside release before undercutting Darby on a dig route. Darby shifts his wheels, gets back in position, and is able to take advantage of a bad throw to force a pass breakup. The athleticism helps in a big way here and can help mask any false steps in the secondary. When you face good receivers in this league, it's bound to happen.\n\nOne thing I noticed last year was that receivers seemed to throw a lot of double moves at Darby and, as to be expected with those kinds of routes, they had some success. Whether they were stutter-and-go routes, post-corner routes or fade stops, I saw a good amount of catches on concepts like that to try and get him leaning one direction before breaking back the opposite way. That being said, he got more than his share of pass breakups on those kinds of routes, and this one was the most impressive.\n\nShot 6 - You're not supposed to break up passes against routes that look like this. Unbelievably athletic play by Darby here. #Eagles pic.twitter.com/87YM5dMP3h -- Fran Duffy (@fduffy3)\n\nAugust 12, 2017\n\nThis is a shot against Julian Edelman, one of the craftiest route runners in the league, and the Patriots last year. Edelman runs a route that I'd venture to guess over 98 percent of the corners in the NFL couldn't break up. Edelman runs a double move out-and-up route before breaking the route off back to the sideline. It was, in essence, a triple move. I've seen these routes run in one-on-one drills before in practice where the defender screams at the receiver, \"You'll never run that in the game!\" Well, Edelman did, and thanks to Darby's fluid hips, easy change of direction, and impressive burst to close on the throw, he breaks up this pass on third-and-6 to force fourth down.\n\nGoing back to look at my notes from his college days, there were was one area that I may have been most intrigued to see before turning on the tape with Buffalo.\n\nI was pleased with what I found.\n\nIn college, Darby played as the \"field corner,\" meaning he played to the wide side of the field on every play (remember the hashmarks are farther apart in college), but I thought he had the skill set to play both inside and outside in the NFL if given the opportunity. Well, in Buffalo he was.\n\nShot 7 - Darby slid into the slot at times with Buffalo, giving him an extra layer of versatility when transitioning to the #Eagles defense pic.twitter.com/lUF18AeIkA -- Fran Duffy (@fduffy3)\n\nAugust 12, 2017\n\nThere are two examples of Darby lined up in the slot, once against Danny Amendola and another against Brandon Marshall. Why is that important? Well, it certainly gives him the ability to \"shadow\" an opposing receiver. If the Eagles choose to match him up against a player like Beckham or Dez Bryant or Julio Jones, Darby could (in theory) follow him all over the field. It also gives the team flexibility in the future with this group of young corners. With Jalen Mills, Rasul Douglas, and, last but not least, Sidney Jones already in the pipeline, there are several combinations the staff could use when deploying their corners in subpackages.\n\nI was concerned with Darby's ability against the run coming out of Florida State because I didn't always see a committed tackler in college. This is an area where I thought he looked much improved since arriving in the NFL, and I think his experience working with a tough-minded coach like Rex Ryan certainly helped in his development in that area of his game.\n\nShot 8 - Last look at Darby, who impressed me as a tackler from his NFL tape. Didn't see that at FSU; he's much improved there now #Eagles pic.twitter.com/GNnKysBlEp -- Fran Duffy (@fduffy3)\n\nAugust 12, 2017\n\nDarby is an impact tackler, meaning he uses his speed and burst to explode into ball carriers. I saw a lot more willingness from him as a tackler, whether it was on passes to the flat or in the perimeter run game, than I had seen from him at Florida State.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-08-12", "textEnd": 3023, "textStart": 3008, "freq": 8}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T21:37:00Z", "sim": 0.5333333611488342, "source": {"uri": "philadelphiaeagles.com", "title": "philadelphiaeagles.com", "id": "5290"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "23:04:00", "url": "http://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/news/article-1/Eagle-Eye-Ronald-Darby-Can-Cover-Any-Wide-Receiver-In-The-NFL/930cb3b4-fc03-4d25-98a6-7d642953f03d?campaign=phi:fanshare:facebook", "storyUri": "eng-3355470", "id": "8852494", "image": "http://prod.static.eagles.clubs.nfl.com//assets/images/imported/PHI/photos/app_thumbnails/2017/Darby_Ronald_2_580App_081217.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "21:37:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

The Bills made two franchise changing trades, sending Sammy Watkins to the Rams, and Ronald Darby to the Eagles.\n\nThere were few hints leading up to these moves, and naturally the entire Buffalo fan base was shocked. The Bills managed to bring back an impressive haul which included WR Jordan Matthews, CB EJ Gaines, and two draft picks, a second and a third, in the upcoming draft.\n\nThe Bills had already shown that they had big plans for the 2018 NFL Draft, as they acquired Kansas City's first round pick on draft night. Now, with the additions yesterday, the Bills will have six picks in the first three rounds, an absolute gold mine by NFL standards.\n\nClearly, the Bills are collecting assets to use in their pursuit of a franchise QB, the type of player they haven't seen since Jim Kelly hung up the cleats. However, while that vision seems clear now, previous moves put somewhat of an obstacle in their path.\n\nThe Bills have said time and time again that they are trying to win this year, and they've proven it's more than just talk. The Bills brought back Tyrod Taylor, Kyle Williams, and Lorenzo Alexander with the goal of winning in 2017. However, after the draft night trade, and these trades, there's a clear contradiction in their actions. Why trade for all these picks, if you're trying to field the best team you can in 2017?\n\nUnless you truly walk around with the rose colored glasses on, it was clear that the Bills ceiling this season sat somewhere between 7-8 wins. Lack of depth in the secondary, a scheme switch, and a new staff make it tough for a team to win big out of the gate. Sure, things could've gone their way, McCoy and Sammy dominate, and they could've hit that ten win mark, you never know, justification enough to bring these guys back.\n\nHowever, while you didn't get significantly worse after yesterday's moves, you certainly didn't get better. Jordan Matthews is a nice player, but no one is going to put him in the same class, talent wise, as Sammy Watkins. Gaines and Darby are both average corners in the league. So, if your team, as constructed, was already a long shot to make the playoffs, why make these moves, and still attempt to compete for a playoff spot?\n\nThe Bills clearly don't want to tank. You don't bring back Tyrod, Kyle, and Lorenzo if you plan on bottoming out. It appears their plan is to try and win, and use these picks to trade up for a franchise QB. That's a great plan, if you can get someone to bite, and good luck with that.\n\nThe 2018 QB class is supposed to be one of the best in a long time. There's 3-4 guys who could go in the top five, and if these guys are as good as advertised, there's no guarantee any collection of picks will work in a trade. Say the Jets, Browns, and 49ers finish in the bottom three. Do you see any of them trading out of their spot if a franchise QB is staring them in the face?\n\nThe Bills have to hope a team that already has a QB stumbles on some bad luck, and ends up with a top five pick. That would give them a potential trading partner, who's fans aren't bringing out the pitchforks for not taking a QB. But, why take your chances on that scenario, when you could've been one of those bottom teams to begin with?\n\nIf you want a guaranteed shot at a QB, why not let Tyrod walk, along with Kyle and Lorenzo, and really commit to the plan? I understand Beane and McDermott don't want to look weak in their first year, but fans would likely understand the goal.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I like the moves. Getting picks for a player who was likely walking in a year, and a CB who doesn't fit the new scheme, is a big win. The Bills have a plan, and that plan is to walk out of the 2018 draft with a shiny new QB, and a sense of hope that Buffalo hasn't had in a long time.\n\nThe only problem is, they've made their path harder than it needs to be, all for a couple of extra wins. Sure, a 1-15 season is crushing for all those involved, but what's the difference between winning one game, or winning six? Neither gets you that playoff spot.\n\nMaybe the Bills will shock us all, and get that playoff spot they've been chasing for so long. They'll find a trading partner, get that top pick, and snag that QB. Or, maybe even as currently constructed, they'll bottom out, and have their pick of the litter. However, at the current moment, the Bills want to have their cake and eat it too, and that slice of cake could lead to that franchise QB slipping away.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T16:02:00Z", "sim": 0.5333333611488342, "source": {"uri": "isportsweb.com", "title": "isportsweb", "id": "4620"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "03:32:00", "url": "http://www.isportsweb.com/2017/08/12/2381897/", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8867563", "image": "http://www.isportsweb.com/wp-content/uploads//2017/07/USATSI_9709574watkins.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "16:02:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

So the column was put back a day and, not surprisingly, the roof nearly blew off the old mailbox.\n\nPeople are all over the place about the trades, though the overall sentiment is positive. Bills fans are understandably conflicted. Many agree it's in the long-term interest of the franchise, but they're sick of suffering and feel betrayed after investing hope in this year's team.\n\nOne person said trading Watkins was the stupidest thing the Pegulas could have done. Someone actually said Sammy was punished for saying NFL players should be paid as much as NBA guys. One found it suspicious that the deal was made when fans could no longer cancel season tickets. On to the Mailbag.\n\nCharles Z asks: So why didn't they opt for the 5th year? Watkins would be worth a lot more with two years left on his contract.\n\nSully: It's a decent point, one that I also received from @behrnsie. Keep in mind, the decision not to exercise Sammy's fifth-year option was made two days after the Bills fired Doug Whaley and a week before they hired Brandon Beane as general manager.\n\nSo it seems Sean McDermott didn't believe Watkins would be healthy this season and wanted him to prove it on the field. They could have slapped a franchise tag on Sammy if he had a big year. That suggests that they weren't planning to trade Watkins all along, as a lot of skeptics now believe.\n\nBeane might have taken a harder line on Watkins when he became GM. He admitted on Friday that Sammy's injury history was a factor in the trade. Watkins was a diminished asset, and Beane was obviously open to moving him\n\nThe Rams might have given more if Watkins had that extra year on his deal. But if Watkins has a big year, they're likely to be talking about a big extension, anyway. So I'm not sure it would have made a huge difference.\n\n***\n\nJoseph Genco asks: If Matthews plus Gaines equals Sammy plus Darby, the Bills get draft choices, too. Doesn't that make an instant trade win?\n\nSully: Easy, Joe. I liked the trades, but it's a stretch to call it even on the players alone. Watkins is a potential superstar - if he stays healthy. It's a risk the Bills were no longer willing to take, but that doesn't make Matthews his equal. Matthews is solid and reliable, but he's no Sammy.\n\nDarby slipped a year ago, but he's a potential No. 1 cornerback in the league and has achieved more than Gaines, who has struggled to stay healthy. So on raw talent alone, the Bills come out behind in the deals.\n\n***\n\nMike Kickbush asks: Will the o-line improve? Or can any additions be made to help it? For pass protection?\n\nSully: The O line is a mixed bag, same as last year. They're very good in the running game, but shaky in pass protection. It's an issue, because teams will be even more prone to load up against the run to take away the team's strength and make Tyrod Taylor beat them with the pass.\n\nThey need to improve, but Thursday was not a good sign. The Vikings got pressure early, got a big hit on Taylor, and briefly knocked him out of the game. The Bills, who have no reliable backup, cannot afford to lose Taylor. But if they can't tighten up the pass blocking, Taylor is bound to get hurt.\n\nCordy Glenn's lingering left foot is a major concern. Sean McDermott admitted as much. He held Glenn, the team's franchise left tackle, out of the preseason opener. Glenn has ankle and foot woes that date back to last season. He's overpaid as it is, but they need him on the field.\n\nVeteran Seantrel Henderson has looked good in camp, but he got abused in the opener. Henderson also has to sit out the first five weeks of the season on a suspension for using marijuana during his recovery from Crohn's Disease.\n\nThe right side is a mess. The Bills traded up in the draft to get rookie Dion Dawkins in the second round, but he hasn't seized the opportunity to unseat the ordinary Jordan Mills at right tackle. Vlad Ducasse is pushing veteran John Miller at right guard.\n\nDespite blocking for the league's top rushing attack, the Bills' offensive line is a bit overrated. You can't be an average pass blocking line in today's NFL and consider yourself elite. Taylor isn't the only reason the coaches were conservative in the passing game the last two years.\n\n***\n\nBills_Fan_In_San Diego asks: Is there a chance Reggie Ragland gets cut based on a poor performance Thursday night?\n\nSully: It's too soon to give up on a man the Bills moved up to take 41st overall in the 2016 draft. As McDermott is quick to remind us, Ragland is coming off a knee injury that cost him his entire rookie season.\n\nBut injury or not, it seems the old regime overestimated Ragland's ability to thrive in the NFL. His shortcomings in coverage were well-known. There's a reason he was sitting there in the second round of the draft. I don't see him getting cut, but it wouldn't shock me if Beane traded him.\n\nThe Bills picked him to play in Rex Ryan's 3-4. He's struggling to fit into McDermott's 4-3, which requires more dropping into coverage and making plays in space. Ragland is more of a straight-on run stopper. Linebackers need to be versatile in today's pass-happy NFL.\n\nRagland, who was expected to push Preston Brown for the starting job at middle linebacker, is now third string behind Gerald Hodges. He had an uneven game against the Vikings, playing against backups.\n\n***\n\n@Buffalodad asks: Being a young, first-year head coach, will McDermott try something new and different or do you anticipate the same old same old?\n\nSully: Football coaches generally come from the same mold, regardless of age. McDermott strikes me as a typical coach, talking about process and toughness and discipline and the importance of team. I've heard it all by now.\n\nThat doesn't mean he won't surprise us. McDermott seems organized and has a plan. That puts him ahead of Rex Ryan. But the real test will come on game days. Will he be another coach who is stuck in old-time thinking, or one who isn't afraid to try things that defy time-honored coaching conventions?\n\nThe Bills' starting defense looked good on Thursday. It was an encouraging sign. McDermott's expertise is on defense and it should become evident over time. He doesn't need to reinvent the sport, he needs to get the most out of his roster.\n\n***\n\n@lissmoe asks: Eight straight wins, pitching looking good, bats making a comeback at the right time. Another duckboat parade this year?\n\nSully: Way to jinx my Red Sox, who blew a late lead and lost to the Yanks on Friday. Thank heavens for Chris Sale, who should be a top candidate for Most Valuable Player, not just Cy Young. But Rick Porcello has been awful and David Price is hurt, so don't schedule any parades just yet.\n\nBoston is entering a rough stretch of the schedule. Beginning with Friday's loss, they play the Yankees six times in 10 days. Then they have four at Cleveland and three at home against Baltimore. The Sox should make the playoffs, barring a 2011-type collapse. They blew a nine-game lead in September that year. Hey, I've a lifelong Red Sox fan, a chronic worrier. Let's see how the pitching holds up.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T15:26:00Z", "sim": 0.5333333611488342, "source": {"uri": "buffalonews.com", "title": "The Buffalo News", "id": "16510"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "08:57:00", "url": "http://buffalonews.com/2017/08/12/sullys-mailbag-wide-range-reactions-watkins-trade/", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8892978", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/bncore/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/1005870133-billsJets-scul2.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "15:26:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

Sammy Watkins and Jordan Matthews were the headliners, but some sleepers -- namely, rookie Zay Jones and veteran Anquan Boldin -- emerged from the fray and should be highlighted on 2017 cheat sheets.\n\nThe important parts of the deals, at least for fantasy owners, are Watkins going to the Rams and Matthews going to Buffalo. Because the Rams and the Bills have new offensive schemes this year, it's tough to really evaluate how these receivers will fare in their new homes, but obviously that's not going to stop us from trying.\n\nDOMINATE YOUR DRAFT: Ultimate 2017 fantasy football cheat sheet\n\nSammy Watkins (slightly) moves down in WR rankings after trade\n\nWatkins was already a difficult player to evaluate after a disappointing, injury-plagued 2016. Based on talent, his outlook was bright, but there were obvious worries. Now in L.A., he'll have to deal with a downgrade at quarterback, if for no other reason than unfamiliarity. Watkins will finally be in an offense that likes to throw, though, and new Rams coach Sean McVay had a lot of success while offensive coordinator with the Redskins. Watkins should see ample targets and opportunities to make plays.\n\nUltimately, the QB change knocks Watkins down a few pegs, from No. 16 to No. 18 in our WR rankings. His talent provides enough reason to be optimistic in any situation, but a tougher schedule (four games against Arizona and Seattle, with Week 17's game against San Francisco not counting in most fantasy leagues) certainly doesn't help matters either.\n\n2017 FANTASY FOOTBALL RANKINGS:\n\nQuarterback | Running back | Wide receiver | Tight end | D/ST | Kicker | Top 200\n\nFantasy Football Sleepers: Zay Jones, Anquan Boldin\n\nJones was already our pick for Buffalo's breakout player this year, but his outlook improves even more now. Even with Matthews and Boldin in town, Jones, who holds the FBS record for career receptions (399), is in a better spot. Boldin, too, who after racking up 24 red-zone targets with Detroit last year, is in position to continue to be a goal-line beast while adding more work between the 20's.\n\nAgain, the Bills' passing game is very much a mystery. New offensive coordinator Rick Dennison oversaw a passing attack in Denver that threw six more times per game than the Bills last year, and given that all three of Buffalo's projected top receivers are new, it's almost impossible to guess who QB Tyrod Taylor will click with and how he'll perform.\n\nJordan Matthews moves up fantasy rankings\n\nMatthew seemed miscast as a WR1 last year in Philadelphia, but he was also working with an inconsistent rookie QB. Drops are an issue, but it's worth noting that Matthews has had at least 800 receiving yards in all three seasons, and he scored eight TDs in his first two campaigns. The talent is there, and now that he's a No. 1 again, he should see more targets than he was going to get in Philadelphia with Alshon Jeffery in town.\n\nTorrey Smith, Robert Woods also affected by trades\n\nWith Matthews gone, Smith should get an opportunity to be Philadelphia's No. 2, though he'll have to compete with Nelson Algohor, among others. A disappointment the past two seasons in San Francisco, Smith has upside with the Eagles.\n\nThe addition of Watkins to the Rams means his old teammate, Robert Woods, figures to see fewer targets than expected, which all but takes him off the fantasy radar. Tavon Austin's outlook remains the same considering his role isn't that of a traditional wide receiver.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-10T22:00:00Z", "sim": 0.529411792755127, "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "title": "Sporting News", "id": "1722"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "06:09:00", "url": "http://www.sportingnews.com/ca/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-update-sammy-watkins-trade-jordan-matthews-bills-zay-jones-sleeper-rankings-anquan-boldin-torrey-smith/19y7pcvectuu3141ngyth5dkk2", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8878028", "image": "http://images.performgroup.com/di/library/sporting_news/ce/e7/sammy-watkins-120716-getty-ftr_h7vn1b8xaiie18xlvhqs5q4hu.jpg?t=-628278808", "date": "2017-08-10", "time": "22:00:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

If he needs help with anything, I'm definitely here to help him,\" Robinson said.\n\nHow daunting a task will learning the defense be less than a month before the start of the season?\n\n\"I don't think it takes that long, to be honest,\" said Robinson, who came from the Colts as a free agent this offseason. \"For the [outside] corner, it's a lot more simple, than for a safety or a nickel. There's not like a huge learning curve that you would come into, being a corner here.\"\n\nMost likely, when the Eagles open the regular season Sept. 10 at Washington, Jalen Mills will man one corner and Darby the other. Ron Brooks was in the lead at the slot position until he tweaked a hamstring covering a punt in Thursday's preseason opener.\n\nBrooks - another Florida State alum, though he, like Robinson, predated Darby - played with Darby in Buffalo during the 2015 season, when Darby was runner-up for NFL defensive rookie of the year.\n\n\"Not really,\" Brooks said, when asked his level of surprise. \"When you hear all the talk, people putting into question our secondary, I mean, it didn't shock anybody.\"\n\nBrooks said he would describe Darby as \"just a technical cornerback. He's going to be a great addition to this defense.\n\n\"You can't overlook his speed ... he doesn't get lost when a lot of receivers take off downfield. He's stride-for-stride with most everybody.\n\n\"I think with his work ethic, the way he practices, he'll be all right. He won't have an issue with learning the defense.\"\n\nSafety Malcolm Jenkins - who worked at nickel corner Saturday, with Brooks sidelined and Aaron Grymes excused to attend to a personal matter - said that Darby has \"shown a lot of potential to lock down receivers. It definitely makes us better on the back end.\"\n\nBut Jenkins noted that Matthews was among the locker room leaders, and that even if a trade for a corner wasn't a surprise, \"it's always a big deal when you lose one of your key contributors. He's got all the respect from his teammates.\"\n\nWhen the Eagles drafted corner Rasul Douglas in the third round last spring, the hope was that he could mature into a rookie starter. Douglas definitely has showed promise, but as has been noted here and in just about every other media outlet, coaches feel neither Douglas nor any of the other youngsters competing has established starter-level consistency.\n\n\"I don't think that's up to me, to say we need a corner or we don't. We're adding a guy that's good, I guess,\" Douglas said. \"Everyone's here to compete and try to play. It doesn't matter if there's another corner here, 10 more corners come here - football's all about competition anyway. You like that. The room gets better.\"\n\nAlso showing promise, but not enough to merit a starting job, has been second-year corner C.J. Smith, who played strictly on special teams last year.\n\n\"I'm not really focused on what they do upstairs,\" said Smith, who acknowledged he was not surprised to see a pedigreed corner come in.\n\nSmith gave up a 20-yard Green Bay touchdown pass Thursday, when quarterback Brett Hundley and wideout Jeff Janis fooled him into thinking Janis was running a slant, then Janis broke upfield, leaving Smith treading water.\n\nAsked what he thought he could have done differently, Smith said: \"Just known that they're in the '[take a] shot' zone. I think it was second down and 5 or 6. Just be more aware. Awareness has to go up. Know that they're already in field-goal range, [I] don't have to be so aggressive on the slant route.\"\n\nMills said he was surprised only in that he thought Matthews really played well in the offensive starters' lone series Thursday night. Mills noted that Matthews kept the touchdown drive going with a fourth-down catch.\n\n\"I woke up next morning and I saw it on the ESPN ticker and I was kind of shocked,\" he said.\n\nMills said Darby will raise the level of the corner group.\n\n\"You want to see what guys are really hungry for that spot. Bringing in a guy like that definitely raises the level of competition,\" he said.\n\nMills said he thinks Darby will learn what Schwartz wants from his corners pretty quickly - the coverages aren't anything unique. He said what takes time is developing a sense of where your teammates are going to be, how they play the coverages.\n\n\"That goes with having full-speed reps in practice,\" he said.\n\nDarby presumably will begin that process Sunday. He watched Saturday's workout in a sweatsuit.\n\nRead more by Les Bowen Published: August 12, 2017 \u00e2\u0080\" 3:01 AM EDT | Updated: August 12, 2017 \u00e2\u0080\" 5:42 PM EDT\n\nThanks for your continued support...\n\nWe recently asked you to support our journalism.

He paints his team's portraits in fluorescent colors with a floor mop and he doesn't care if you like how it looks.\n\nRoseman on Friday traded Jordan Matthews, plus a third-round pick in next year's draft, to Buffalo for Ronald Darby. With two career interceptions, Darby instantly became the team's best cornerback.\n\nYes, that is faint praise.\n\nThis is not: Matthews' 225 catches in his first three seasons is an Eagles record and ranks sixth in NFL history. He is very good.\n\nTo be fair, so is Darby; fast and tenacious and fundamentally sound.\n\nClearly, Roseman & Co. believe that, in today's NFL, a very good cornerback has considerably more value than a very good slot receiver. Of course, it's been years since Roseman & Co. have seen a very good cornerback play for them, so maybe they overestimate the value of such a beast.\n\n\"This is a cornerback-deficient league,\" Roseman said.\n\nHe certainly had a cornerback-deficient roster.\n\nFor the purpose of this discussion, though, it doesn't really matter if the trade was brilliant or foolish. What matters is that the trade was seismic, and that Roseman pulled the trigger. Again.\n\nIt's been 20 months since he overthrew Chip Kelly, but Kelly's takeover was possible because Howie had been passive. Old, timid Howie is gone forever. The new Roseman whispers through a bullhorn. Howie 2.0 might have a few bugs -- remember, he traded Eric Rowe -- but it's much more interesting.\n\n\"I don't think there's any question,\" Roseman said when asked if he'd changed. \"With experience, and when you take a step back, you see what works and what doesn't.\"\n\nRoseman's decisions might not work. Without question, his story has taken a turn. It might end badly but he's writing it in all-caps.\n\nHe has given contract extensions worth about $250 million to Fletcher Cox, Lane Johnson, Jason Peters, Zach Ertz and Vinny Curry, because he believed they'd be worth even more one day soon. He also gave Sam (yawn) Bradford $36 million after a season of essentially being Sam (yawn) Bradford.\n\nBradford signed for just 2 years, so when he balked at a long-term deal Roseman rolled up his sleeves to fortify the franchise. He traded a truckload of assets to move up in the 2016 draft and take Carson Wentz ... to be a third-stringer. Roseman then trumped his own plan to let Wentz sit and learn when he traded Bradford ... eight days before the season started.\n\nThis offseason Roseman rented fragile Alshon Jeffery for $14 million. He used a second-round pick on blue-chip cornerback Sidney Jones, who is damaged enough to miss the season (the Hinkie crowd was elated). Now, with Jeffery comfortably injured, Roseman traded Matthews.\n\nBoom.\n\nRoseman was more reclusive and more reserved in his first incarnation as GM, from 2010-14. Sure, he made splashes. He built the Dream Team around cornerbacks Nnamdi Asomugha and Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie and Michael Vick, whom he gave a $100 million contract extension. He then hired Kelly, who was riding was high atop a gimmicky college offense and his Sports Science Ph.D.\n\nThose moves were major, but they had a different flavor, and they didn't make you wonder if Roseman was sipping from a hip flask. Asomugha was a top free agent. DRC should have been able to play nickel. Vick seemed viable. Kelly possessed true genius. Besides, those changes did not come in such a rapid succession. These days, Howie wheels and deals. He has more press conferences than a typical President; or, for that matter, an atypical one.\n\nAgain, not all of these bold moves will be the right moves. Curry had 2 1/2 sacks in 2016. Johnson, who served a four-game PED suspension in 2014, was suspended for 10 more when he got popped for PEDs again last offseason.\n\nThree years from now, if Matthews has 450 career catches for 38 career touchdowns -- that's his current pace -- and if Darby has just three more interceptions (he averages one per season), then this trade will likely be criticized.\n\nThe same is true if Jeffery and Torrey Smith, also a free-agent addition, don't produce. Consider: Matthews has 158 catches and 11 touchdowns in the past two seasons. Jeffery and Smith have combined for 159 catches and 13 touchdowns in the past two seasons.\n\nStill, Matthews, a second-round pick, is a free agent after this season, which diminishes his trade value. He's also a slot specialist, which diminishes his value in the Eagles' eyes. Darby, a second-round pick, plays on the outside, and is under contract for two more seasons.\n\nThen again, so does Rowe, who also is a second-round pick that Roseman traded to the Patriots 11 months ago for a conditional pick in 2018. Roseman then watched Rowe win a Super Bowl ring. By the time Rowe hits the market he might have two more.\n\nOh, well. You're not going to knock it out of the park every time.\n\nThat doesn't mean you shouldn't swing from your heels.\n\nRead more by Marcus Hayes Published: August 11, 2017 \u00e2\u0080\" 3:01 AM EDT | Updated: August 11, 2017 \u00e2\u0080\" 7:43 PM EDT\n\nThanks for your continued support...\n\nWe recently asked you to support our journalism.

If they do, it makes Watkins the best receiver not named Larry Fitzgerald in the division... now can their quarterback get him the ball?\n\nI have my doubts, but maybe that's just my Cardinals fandom.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T15:18:00Z", "sim": 0.5176470875740051, "source": {"uri": "revengeofthebirds.com", "title": "Revenge of the Birds", "id": "4831"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "18:08:00", "url": "https://www.revengeofthebirds.com/2017/8/11/16135162/los-angeles-rams-trade-sammy-watkins", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8676300", "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T9zd0aUqOJUKnwee4Psh52suv6Q=/0x0:3655x2056/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56155373/630500884.0.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "15:18:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

As The News' Jerry Sullivan has said over and over the past decade (and no doubt will say again), the Bills' management finally has stopped \"middling it.\"\n\nUnlike so many of their predecessors, Sean McDermott and Brandon Beane aren't trying to build for the future with their right hand and see if they can sneak into the playoffs with their left.\n\nMcDermott and Beane never are going to have more clout and a longer leash than they have now in Year One (at least until some day in the rose-colored future when they've won a bunch of playoff games.)\n\nStockpiling draft picks makes perfect sense. Bills fans should be thrilled that the new regime has two No. 1s, two No. 2s and two No. 3s in next year's draft.\n\nNow is the most ideal time - maybe the only ideal time - to deal Watkins and still get pretty good return. Watkins might become an All-Pro for the Los Angeles Rams. But given his health history and the worrisome nature of foot injuries, I have no problem with the Bills deciding they do not want to fill Terry Pegula's yacht with money and tie it to Watkins' dock next spring.\n\nRonald Darby? You've seen it all before. New regime comes in, and a slew of guys don't fit the system. Darby is a good man-cover corner (despite his iffy results last season). McDermott's defense values zone corners, which is why Carolina let Josh Norman walk after 2015. Reggie Ragland, a 3-4 Rex Ryan linebacker, will be another victim of the regime change. Changing coaches causes short-term suffering. There's almost no way around it.\n\nSo why feel bad? A lot of loyal fans are shelling out $100 a ticket and up. Can we have a moment of silence for them? Chalk up another season in which they're going to games in order to catch glimpses that make them feel good about how the team is going to look two years down the road. That's not McDermott and Beane's problem. But it's not something to just dismiss. It stinks.\n\nAnother person I feel bad for: Kyle Williams. He came back for another year at age 34 and surely realizes the new regime is playing for the future, if there was any doubt. Williams is a pro and will give his all. But one of McDermott's challenges as a new coach now will be getting all the veterans excited and believing, even if the losses start to pile up.\n\nObviously, the new regime has seen enough of Tyrod Taylor on video to know he's not the long-term answer. Newly acquired Jordan Matthews is a good possession receiver and a very high-character guy. Love him as a locker-room presence. Philadelphia deemed him expendable because of the emergence of slot receiver Nelson Agholor, who was going to eat into his snaps, at the least. Obviously, if the Bills had a fair amount of belief in Taylor, they would have kept Watkins around to give the QB more chance to show what he could do with an elite receiver. Matthews is not elite.\n\nWill all of this planning for the future land a rookie franchise quarterback to succeed Taylor next season? Buckle your seatbelts and get ready for eight months of gnashing of teeth over that question.\n\nThe quarterback situation could play out a lot of different ways in next year's draft, and no one knows how it's going to turn out.\n\nThe \"McBeane duo\" deserve credit for giving themselves a ton of options and flexibility for the 2018 Draft. They will have a great chance to get one of the top three QBs in what everyone thinks and hopes will be a good class. It includes Southern Cal's Sam Darnold, UCLA's Josh Rosen, Oklahoma State's Mason Rudolph, Wyoming's Josh Allen and maybe more.\n\nWill there be four top-10 caliber QBs in the draft? Or will a few of them drop off upon closer NFL inspection, as happens sometimes?\n\nThere's a good chance there will be three QB-desperate teams worse than the Bills this season - the Jets, the Browns and the 49ers. I think the Bills are better than those three teams, even without Watkins. I still believe McDermott is going to get a good amount more out of the defense than Ryan got last year.\n\nSo much can happen, it's hard to worry about it during the season. Redskins QB Kurt Cousins could play out his contract and decide to reunite with new 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan. That likely would be good for the Bills, one less team ahead of them in the QB hunt. Darnold, a red-shirt sophomore, could decide he hates the idea of going to the Jets and could stay in school another year (unlikely, but something for obsessive fans to worry about).\n\nThere's still 20 weeks to the end of the NFL regular season. It pains me to think our attention might increasingly be on the weekly stock market rising and falling of the college QB crop.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T16:32:00Z", "sim": 0.5176470875740051, "source": {"uri": "buffalonews.com", "title": "The Buffalo News", "id": "16510"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "23:04:00", "url": "http://buffalonews.com/2017/08/11/mark-gaughans-hot-read-long-term-good-bills-still-hard-swallow/", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8715973", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/bncore/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/brandon-beane-mccoy2.png", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "16:32:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

It isn't hard to remember the leadup to the draft, the top prospects and the Raiders needs at the time. A quick primer is their top three needs were quarterback, wide receiver, and pass rusher.\n\nWe don't judge these drafts with hindsight on our side. At the time the top quarterback was Blake Bortles, top pass rusher was Jadeveon Clowney, and top wide receiver was Sammy Watkins.\n\nThe first of those to go was Clowney at first overall to the Texans, Bortles went third overall to Jacksonville. That left one more draft slot with the next two top prospects being Sammy Watkins and Khalil Mack and the Browns up.\n\nIt was a pretty good situation for the Raiders because it looked like they really couldn't lose between Watkins or Mack. And the Browns had a need at receiver too, making Watkins a solid pick.\n\nThen the Browns made a trade. With Buffalo. Khalil Mack went to Buffalo. Ruh roh.\n\nBut the Bills went away from local hero Khalil Mack and got the consensus best receiver in the draft in Sammy Watkins. Mack was the obvious pick. Even without the benefit of hindsight.\n\nSince then Watkins has had a decent career, but has not nearly lived up to his potential and his last two seasons were shortened by injury.

Then, less than a hour later, the Buffalo Bills apparently felt jealous of all the attention the Cowboys were getting, and thus shocked the world by trading star wide receiver Sammy Watkins to the Los Angeles Rams:\n\nAnd, that sound you hear is Watkins' fantasy value plummeting.\n\nPrior to the trade, Watkins' average draft position was 34th overall (15th among wide receivers) in standard leagues and 36th overall (17th among wide receivers) in PPR formats.\n\nBefore you completely remove Watkins from your draft board, remember that this is one of the most talented young receivers in the league. Despite battling injuries for a significant portion of his first three years in the league, he has per-16 game averages of 66 receptions, 1,063 yards and seven touchdowns. He can create separation in the middle of the field, but he's also a truly dangerous deep threat, as evidenced by his career average of 16.1 yards per catch.\n\nWatkins, who is healthy in the preseason for seemingly the first time in his career, looked like a prime breakout pick.\n\nBut now, he goes from catching passes from Tyrod Taylor, an emerging talent and a terrific deep-ball thrower, to catching passes from Jared Goff, who last year completed a miserable 54.5 percent of his passes, had a 5-to-7 TD:INT ratio and averaged 5.3 yards per attempt-and is now learning a new offense under Sean McVay. And who is not a terrific deep-ball thrower:\n\nThe upside is always going to be there for Watkins.

But inquiries for Watkins had been relatively steady since June, and interest in Darby gained steam with the Eagles of late. When it became clear that the Rams and Eagles were serious and were offering a player and a draft choice in return, it proved to be a wise investment for 2017 and beyond.\n\n\"We were not actively shopping either of these guys,\" Beane said. \"We're not actively shopping anybody, but L.A. became very serious about Sammy and Philadelphia got very serious about Ronald and the timing worked out. As I realized the timing worked out I was able to acquire Jordan (Matthews) to help fill in for Sammy and add E.J. Gaines to help fill in for Ronald.\"\n\nBeane informed head coach Sean McDermott and owner Terry Pegula that the two trade proposals had reached critical mass after the preseason opener against Minnesota. They just had to mull both deals over and determine whether they would pull the trigger on both.\n\n\"Trying to have these conversations late into the night -- not a lot of sleep last night,\" said McDermott. \"Difficult decision. One that we spent a lot of time discussing. These are the types of conversations that have to be had. Some conversations are easier, some are more difficult -- like this one.\"\n\nRELATED: BILLS TRADE LEAVES CLUB LOADED FOR 2018 NFL DRAFT\n\nWhat made the trades so appealing for Beane and McDermott as they build a foundation for this team in year one is the fact that they could fill the holes left behind by Darby and Watkins with a pair of starting caliber players in Matthews and Gaines, and then were able to add draft capital in the form of a second and third-round pick next spring.\n\n\"We're always going to try to win today and win tomorrow,\" said Beane. \"I said it when we acquired Anquan (Boldin). That's how I'm wired. That's how I believe you win in this league. If I'm coming off a 14-2 season and someone offers me something that I think is good capital and a worthy investment I have to consider it. That's what happened here.\"\n\nBeane admitted he was \"annoyed\" that there was an opinion that the Bills were pulling the rip cord on the 2017 season to stock up for the 2018 draft.\n\n\"This is not a throw in the towel thing at all,\" he said in reference to the 2017 season. \"Somebody mentioned that somebody said that and quite honestly that's annoying to me. You don't know me if you think I'm throwing in the towel. If we go out there and play ping pong or whatever we're going to do I'm not throwing in the towel. If we were throwing in the towel I wouldn't have tried to get a starting receiver back.\n\n\"I'm thrilled in losing a guy like Sammy we were able to acquire a guy like Jordan Matthews who has skins on the wall. E.J. has started 25 games in this league. He was on the NFL All-Rookie team. So he has some pedigree. He's not walking in here not knowing what to expect. He'll compete with the other corners. He's not guaranteed a spot, but he'll come in and we'll see where it goes\"\n\nThe challenge now is to blend Matthews into the offense and Gaines into the defensive scheme with a month before the season opener.\n\n\"The vision at this point is for them to get in and for us to get up to speed on terminology,\" said McDermott. \"That's really where it starts. And the timing of this, these are never exactly how you want it to be. That said, if we were going to do it, it had to happen sooner rather than later because of the timing and getting acclimated to what we do -- the passing game as it relates to Jordan and the quarterback and the terminology for E.J. on defense. That is of utmost importance.\"\n\nWe now have six picks in the first three rounds of the 2018 NFL Draft.\n\nMore on how today's deals impact our future: https://t.co/fsCNc6zQv5 pic.twitter.com/r7U28OJZ92 -- Buffalo Bills (@buffalobills)\n\nAugust 11, 2017\n\nHow that all plays out will be determined come the fall, and in the spring Beane knows his college scouting staff will have to come through for them.\n\n\"I believe in our scouting staff. I definitely do,\" said Beane. \"They just left last week, the college (scouts). You have to draft well in this league to win. That's the financial model. Those players are the most affordable. That helps us to have that kind of currency in the first three rounds and the prices you pay those guys versus paying free agents and other players.\"\n\nFor now, it's the here and now that's of most concern to the fans of the team and the players still on the roster. McDermott addressed his team after the moves were made and was clear that the direction, the vision and the goal hasn't wavered one bit.\n\n\"My stance with our football team and the leaders of our football team is to be honest and up front with these guys,\" he said. \"They know that we're going to do everything possible and make every decision that's in the best interests of this football team -- short and long term. That's my responsibility.\n\n\"I believe in clear and concise communication and developing trust. That's what I hope has developed over the course of the first six and a half months on the job. And we're going to continue to work our tails off to put this football team and this organization in a position to win and sustain success.\"", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-08-11", "textEnd": 4057, "textStart": 4042}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T21:18:00Z", "sim": 0.5058823823928833, "source": {"uri": "buffalobills.com", "title": "buffalobills.com", "id": "11281"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "01:26:00", "url": "http://www.buffalobills.com/news/article-1/Short-and-long-term-benefits-of-trades-led-Bills-to-pull-the-trigger/a528c53d-1e35-46fd-9391-be557017ef1d?campaign=buf:fanshare:facebook", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8729136", "image": "http://prod.static.bills.clubs.nfl.com//assets/thumb/2017/08/beane-8-11-thumb.jpg ", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "21:18:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

The hirings of not one, but both Ryans (Rex and Rob) were among the first glaring signs of eventual chaos.\n\nBut the first major chapter in the demise of Taylor's saga with Buffalo was his benching in the final game of last season.\n\nTaylor's contract involved a clause saying that if he could not pass a team physical on March 11, much after the season had ended, the Bills would be forced into picking up a $30.7 million option year. With the Bills out of the playoffs, the team decided they would keep Taylor out of the last game of the year to avoid the risk of Taylor seriously hurting himself. This sent a message that seemed loud and clear saying the Bills were ready to move on from Taylor.\n\nThat part made sense. If the Bills were not inclined to keep Taylor in 2017, then why would they risk him getting hurt in that last game and possibly activating the injury clause?\n\nDoug Whaley, who was the Bills GM at the time, and Terrence and Kim Pergula, the Bills owners, then proceeded to forego a flurry of perplexing moves and messages to the media, and everything, including Tyrod Taylor's job outlook and the Buffalo Bills' chances in 2017, vanished into the oft-frigid air of upstate New York.\n\nRex Ryan was fired prior to the end of last season. Ryan consistently backed Taylor as Buffalo's head coach and was one of the leaders of the charge against sitting Taylor at the end of the year, believing he should have the opportunity to show off his skills to build contract leverage for his next team. Ryan put off the benching as long as he could but who knows how much earlier ownership would've liked to do so.\n\nRex Ryan, simply put, was not a good coach for the Buffalo Bills (has he been one anywhere?) but part of his firing probably also stemmed from heated debate over the Taylor situation.\n\nThen, at the end of the year, Whaley let the interim head coach, Anthony Lynn, who was very popular among the players, leave to San Diego. He also let the backup quarterback, EJ Manuel, leave to Oakland.\n\nAnd just as it appeared the Bills were ready to clear house, something changed.\n\nHaley decides to hire Rick Dennison as his new offensive coordinator. Dennison served as the QB coach in Baltimore, where Taylor served as Joe Flacco's backup for several years. Upon hearing the news, speculation surfaced questioning whether the Bills now intended to keep Taylor as their starter.\n\nThen, news broke: Whaley and Taylor restructured a contract to a team-friendly, two-year deal. With a deal like that, Taylor was essentially saying he'll stick around and take less money so the team could equip him with the right weapons and give him a chance at winning a title; trusting that he could rely on the GM to work the cap and find the pieces. Trusting that he would have a starting job on a team that could contend.\n\nDraft night later came and went and the Bills took a quarterback in the middle rounds; No one that would be a threat to Tyrod's job so it wasn't perceived as anything major.\n\nUntil GM Doug Whaley, seemingly out of the blue, was fired shortly after the draft.\n\nIt isn't clear where the miscommunication was between ownership and Whaley, whether they were unhappy with the decision on Taylor's contract or the decision to take yet another mid-round quarterback to be someone of little real competition to Taylor, or a farrago of reasons, Whaley was let go.\n\nAnd then the story really gets interesting.\n\nWe fast-forward to early May and to an interview with Peter King of The MMQB and the Bills new head coach Sean McDermott, and newly appointed general manager Brandon Beane. He asked the duo \"whether or not the team's quarterback of the future is currently on the roster\". The question wasn't supposed to be a difficult one, but McDermott and Beane panicked and, as one writer put it, \"verbally short-circuited\" and gave probably the worst kind of an answer possible.\n\n\"And then when you look at the competition we have behind him,\" McDermott continued. \"We've drafted Nathan Peterman, we've added T.J. Yates, and then Cardale Jones in the draft a year ago.\"\n\n\"We have open competition everywhere,\" added Beane, \"Let them fight it out and earn the right to start on this team.\"\n\nHold on a second.\n\n\"Can we guarantee he is on our roster right now?,\" McDermott continued as he dug his ditch even deeper into the ground, \"That remains to be seen and that is true at a lot of positions on our roster.\"\n\nThere's a lot to take away from that.If Taylor is the future, why immediately mention those two younger quarterbacks? Especially considering T.J. Yates' is barely skilled enough to put on a pro uniform and Peterman was viewed as a project QB at best.\n\nIf Taylor is the future, why immediately mention those two younger quarterbacks? Especially considering T.J. Yates' is barely skilled enough to put on a pro uniform and Peterman was viewed as a project QB at best.\n\nIn that interview, the duo spun a complete 180, deriving from \"decisive quarterback of the future\" to \"might not make the roster\" in regards to Taylor. Confusion set ablaze within the Buffalo media as yet another big red flag started to wave in front of the Buffalo QB.\n\nTaylor took that restructured deal back in the offseason trusting he'd be repaid with a stronger roster and a starting job. In return, he lost the GM who made him all of those promises, the assurance of a starting job, any faith from the front office...\n\nand just this week, he lost his no.1 wide receiver. 5-star talent, 4th overall pick from three years ago and favorite target of Taylor's, Sammy Watkins was traded to the Los Angeles Rams. The trade of Watkins to LA, which was analyzed by several of the fine writers here if you're looking for more details, should be the final straw for Taylor.\n\nThe Bills are now officially engaging in a rebuild. They've accumulated several picks towards the top of next years draft and, apparently, have zero faith in Taylor's ability to help lead them to the playoffs this year.\n\nWhich is odd, even if we disregard the Taylor situation, because the Bills roster really wasn't that bad. LeSean McCoy. Sammy Watkins. One of the best defensive lines in the league. An improved coaching staff, including an old mentor of Taylor's. The team was inconsistent, but they weren't the Jets. Tanking didn't appear to be right on the horizon.\n\nThere is already speculation Taylor will be traded this year (watch out Jets and Broncos fans), or, at the very least, cut before the start of next season.\n\nMaybe the school of thought is that if the Bills can't beat the Patriots now, why not build for the future? I don't know.\n\nBut what I do know is that Tyrod Taylor must be furious with the Buffalo Bills.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-03-11", "textEnd": 725, "textStart": 717}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T21:02:00Z", "sim": 0.501960813999176, "source": {"uri": "isportsweb.com", "title": "isportsweb", "id": "4620"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "03:32:00", "url": "http://www.isportsweb.com/2017/08/12/the-tumultuous-saga-of-tyrod-taylor-and-the-buffalo-bills/", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8867546", "image": "http://www.isportsweb.com/wp-content/uploads//2017/08/USATSI_9491841.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "21:02:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

They also both have enough football acumen to look at the roster they inherited and make honest evaluations about what will help the team now and in the future. On Friday afternoon, the Bills traded Sammy Watkins to the Rams and cornerback Ronald Darby to the Eagles, igniting an immediate national reaction that the Bills are \"throwing in the towel\" on the 2017 season.\n\nAfter all, the 2018 draft class is considered strong at the quarterback position, and the Bills now have two first-round picks, two second-round picks and two third-round picks in that draft. If they want to draft a quarterback, they would seem to have plenty of ammunition to do it.\n\nBeane, however, objected to the idea that the Bills are throwing in the towel. The Bills didn't just get draft picks in the deal. They brought in a starting wide receiver in Jordan Matthews and a potential starter at cornerback in E.J. Gaines. And no, the move doesn't say anything about Tyrod Taylor's future as the team's quarterback.\n\n\"It doesn't say anything,\" Beane said. \"Everybody's forgetting we signed Anquan (Boldin) last week. This is not a 'throw in the towel' thing at all. Somebody mentioned that somebody put that out there. Quite honestly, that's annoying to me. You don't know me if you think I'm throwing in the towel. We can go out there and play ping pong, whatever I'm doing, I'm not throwing in the towel. If we were throwing in the towel, I wouldn't have tried to get a starting receiver back. To your question on Tyrod, it's nothing. We got Anquan who we added. I told you, I honestly believe he is a Hall of Famer and can still play in this league. Jordan Matthews is a starting receiver. You look at those numbers and what he's done, those aren't to be laughed at. Tyrod will get every opportunity to lead this team and we're all rooting for him. It's in our best interest.\"\n\nBetting on himself: Inside Brandon Beane's unlikely rise to Buffalo Bills GM\n\nThe move sent a shockwave through the team. It's a delicate balancing act for Beane and McDermott. They made the team better in the long term but have to keep players pushing in the right direction in the short term.\n\n\"I'll take it a step further and how do you sell it to the entire team: My stance with our football team and the leaders of our football team, as you mentioned Tyrod being one of them, is to be honest and up front with these guys and they know that we're going to do everything possible and make every decision that's in the best interest of this football team short and long term,\" McDermott said. \"That's my responsibility. I believe in clear and concise communication and developing trust and that's what I hope has developed over the course of the first six months, six and a half months on the job and we're going to continue to work our tails off to put this football team and this organization in a position to win and sustain success.\"\n\nNeither Beane or McDermott wants to listen to any notion that the Bills are \"tanking\" or \"throwing in the towel.\" At the same time, McDermott understands the angst fans are feeling as they watch two key players leave the team. He said he didn't sleep much last night.\n\n\"I'm invested and I feel what they feel,\" McDermott said. We're building a football team and we're building a football team that we want to compete in the short and the long term and to be good for a long time. Sometimes, that's a day to day process and sometimes those are not easy things, easy decisions from a leadership standpoint and I understand where they're coming from. That said, we're going to compete like crazy. We're not going out there - I think you guys know me well enough now, that's not what we're doing.\"", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T23:45:00Z", "sim": 0.4901960790157318, "source": {"uri": "newyorkupstate.com", "title": "NewYorkUpstate.com", "id": "18847"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "04:45:00", "url": "http://www.newyorkupstate.com/buffalo-bills/index.ssf/2017/08/brandon_beane_annoyed_by_those_who_think_buffalo_bills_are_throwing_in_the_towel.html", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8744267", "image": "http://image.newyorkupstate.com/home/nyup-media/width620/img/photo-gallery/photo/2017/06/21/22964310-standard.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "23:45:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

In his short career, Matthews has recorded 225 receptions for 2,673 and 19 touchdowns. Buffalo seems to be stockpiling picks for next year's draft.\n\nBut with his impending free agency, the additions of Alshon Jeffery, Torrey Smith and Mack Hollins, and the more glaring need at cornerback, the Eagles decided to make a deal. In exchange, they will get a veteran, Ronald Darby, to help their beleaguered cornerback corps in which have struggled in training camp and in Thursday's first preseason game.

In Philly, Alshon Jeffery and Torrey Smith were both brought in during the offseason, Zach Ertz is a steady target at tight end, Nelson Agholor is still hanging around and rookie Mack Hollins looks like a legitimate talent. Though Buffalo isn't exactly a pass-heavy team, Matthews' major threats for targets at WR are 36-year-old Anquan Boldin and rookie Zay Jones.\n\nThe only problem. They're all slot receivers:\n\nNevertheless, the opportunity to carve out a consistent target share in Buffalo is far greater than it would have been in Philly. Moreover, Tyrod Taylor is an emerging talent at QB, totaling 37 touchdowns, 12 interceptions and 7.4 yards per attempt over the last two years.\n\nThere are still some unknown variables that prevent Matthews' stock from really taking off. There are targets available, but how will they be distributed? Can he learn the offense quickly? Or, more importantly, can he earn Taylor's trust quick enough? Will he remain in the slot, or will he have to play a bunch on the outside, where he has struggled?\n\nUltimately, though, this is a player who has per-16 game averages of 78 receptions, 930 yards and seven touchdowns through three seasons. He's entering his prime at 25, and he's entering an upgraded situation from a fantasy perspective.\n\nHe has intriguing sleeper potential and should be considered right around pick No. 100, making him a late-eighth, early-ninth round target.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T15:52:00Z", "sim": 0.4862745106220245, "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "title": "Heavy.com", "id": "4362"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "18:08:00", "url": "http://heavy.com/sports/2017/08/jordan-matthews-fantasy-outlook-with-bills-wr-rankings/", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8676295", "image": "https://heavyeditorial.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/gettyimages-623039912-e1502473742459.jpg?quality=65&strip=all", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "15:52:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

After the injury trouble Watkins has had, the sight of him on the field in a preseason game is too much for some to handle.\n\nBut after the Bills' preseason loss to the Vikings on Thursday night, Watkins was all smiles. The first three offensive plays for the Bills were all throws to Watkins, who caught all three. He finished with four catches for 39 yards on five targets.\n\n\"It felt great,\" Watkins said after the game. \"Just to be getting hit. That was the best feeling to get back on the field. I think that's all it took was getting tackled, a couple of balls. The first game is like flying bullets out there. I just had to get acclimated.\"\n\nNo, this was not some master plan devised to get Watkins the ball. Watkins and quarterback Tyrod Taylor both insist the coverage was right for him to get targets.\n\n\"I think we just got the perfect reads,\" Watkins said. \"They played a certain look. I was open and Tyrod did a great job getting the ball out.\"\n\n\"I always say the coverage definitely dictates where the ball goes,\" Taylor added. \"Sammy has done a good job winning his matchups early on. He had a couple of coverages where they were press. He's going to win most of those. So it was a good thing to get him going early. Preseason of course you want to go out there a little long. So I think we built some good chemistry in the couple plays we had. Definitely got to build on that.\"\n\nOutside of a minor tweak of his ankle in one training camp practice, Watkins has shown no ill-effects from his offseason surgery. He's starting to look like himself again.\n\n\"This was the best I've ever felt,\" Watkins said. \"Practice was grinding. Today, I was free. I was just out there running my routes, having fun, just looking to get the ball. I wasn't pressing or anything. I was just trying to score honestly.\"\n\nWatkins didn't score, but if he stays healthy, that will come. For now, he cleared another mental hurdle.\n\n\"I get butterflies in practice, but the game, for some reason I was just out there and felt free,\" Watkins said. \"I was running my routes and felt good, blocking. Everything is starting to come together.\"\n\nThe Bills' first-team offense failed to score a touchdown on Thursday night in a 17-10 loss. That didn't put a damper on the mood after the game. Watkins was feeling confident after the early game connection.\n\n\"Felt great,\" Watkins said. \"I think that's the hump I need to get over. Get tackled, get busted up a few plays. That's football. I felt great and I'm just starting a legacy with Tyrod. It felt great.\"", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T02:36:00Z", "sim": 0.4745098054409027, "source": {"uri": "newyorkupstate.com", "title": "NewYorkUpstate.com", "id": "18847"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "08:50:00", "url": "http://www.newyorkupstate.com/buffalo-bills/index.ssf/2017/08/tyrod_taylor_targets_sammy_watkins_early_often_in_buffalo_bills_preseason_opener.html", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8572048", "image": "http://image.newyorkupstate.com/home/nyup-media/width620/img/buffalo-bills/photo/2017/08/10/23215354-standard.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "02:36:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

Feel like we've seen enough. #Bills playing starters a ton in preseason opener.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\" Evan Silva (@evansilva) August 10, 2017\n\nBy Friday afternoon, houses were burning, screams were echoing through the streets, and the cries of fantasy owners could be heard across continents.\n\nOne minute, you've got Tyrod Taylor chucking you taters down the middle of the field, and the next, you're the crutch attempting to loft Jared Goff from the crypt. This is fine.\n\nIn fantasy football, we know that touchdowns mean everything because they account for such a large percentage of the scoring. Going from playing with a competent offense with the Buffalo Bills to a rebuilding Los Angeles Rams team has to put a major dent in Watkins' season-long potential, correct?\n\nIn a way, yes. Of course this change will negatively affect Watkins. But that effect may not be as large as you would think it is off the bat, and it's entirely possible that Watkins is still worth something near his current average draft position.\n\nLet's take a look at Watkins' new team and situation out in Hollywood to see what we should expect from him in 2017. Sure, it's worse, but we shouldn't kick him to the curb just yet.\n\nThere's no hiding the fact that Goff was horrendous in his rookie season.\n\nHe finished the year with -64.56 Passing Net Expected Points (NEP), more than 40 points worse than any other starter in the league. NEP is the numberFire-specific metric we use to track efficiency, showing the expected points lost or gained on every play throughout the season. This helps us to illustrate the difference between a five-yard completion on 3rd and 4 and that same completion on 3rd and 6. For comparison, Colin Kaepernick finished with 14.70 Passing NEP, 79.26 points ahead of Goff, and dude can't find a job.\n\nBut this is looking at the 2016 version of Goff, a guy who entered midseason, saw his coaching staff get canned before the end of the year, and had wretched surroundings. We should expect big differences in the 2017 version.\n\nFirst of all, the team brought in Sean McVay from Washington to be its new head coach. McVay inherited a similar situation when he became Washington's offensive coordinator in 2014, taking over a team that had been spewing incompetence on the offensive side of the ball. McVay helped turn them around.\n\nThis table looks at Washington's offensive ranks the year before McVay took over (2013) through his three years as coordinator. The rankings cited are based on numberFire's schedule-adjusted NEP metrics, which look at a team's overall efficiency throughout the season and account for the strength of their opponents.\n\nWashington went from being the 25th-best passing offense in 2013 to being a top-five unit in each of McVay's final two seasons with the team. There were certainly other factors at play, but McVay's hiring presents reason for hope in the Rams' offense.\n\nThe other big boon over the offseason was the changes along the Rams' offensive line. They kicked things off by signing tackle Andrew Whitworth to a three-year contract in free agency. They later added veteran center John Sullivan, who had worked with McVay in Washington in 2016.\n\nThose two signings are in an attempt to neutralize what was arguably the Rams' biggest weakness in 2016: sacks. Passing NEP includes the expected points each team lost due to sacks throughout the season, and only the Cleveland Browns lost more NEP on a per-drop back basis to sacks than the Rams.\n\nIf Whitworth -- and, to a lesser extent, Sullivan -- can help keep Goff aloft, that would likely play a major role in making his advanced metrics less vomit-inducing. This would lead to more scoring opportunities for the Rams and, thus, more fantasy potential for Watkins.\n\nThat's before you account for the addition of McVay at head coach and all of the other moves the Rams made to support Goff in the offseason. They used three picks in the first four rounds of the NFL draft to add pass catchers and signed Watkins' former-now-current-again teammate, Robert Woods.\n\nThere's abundant ground to make up between what Goff did in 2016 and what Watkins got out of Taylor before that. But simply assuming Goff will stay stagnant at his rookie-year levels seems pessimistic based on all of the changes that were made, and it should help maintain the sanity of those of you who have already added Watkins onto your fantasy rosters.\n\nSo, with all of that in mind, what exactly should we expect out of Watkins heading into 2017? And what does this mean for his fantasy stock?\n\nBecause he's clearly the top option on the Rams' offense, you know he's going to get plenty of targets. That helps give him at least a respectable floor, keeping him in the discussion as being an early-round selection.\n\nThe concern here is around his touchdown potential, and that concern is validated by numberFire's season-long projections. Prior to the trade, Watkins was projected to score 7.44 receiving touchdowns this year. With Watkins now in Los Angeles, that number has dropped to 6.47. We can't ignore that.\n\nBut realisitically, that's not a major dip. Among wide receivers, Watkins is still projected for the 17th-most touchdowns on the season. What's his current average draft position? It's as the 17th-ranked wide receiver, according to Fantasy Football Calculator in 12-team, PPR drafts.\n\nYes, we should be shifting Watkins down our draft boards due to the trade. It would be ignorant not to do so. But we also want to be sure we don't overreact.\n\nIn the same ADP range as Watkins is Allen Robinson, who has similar concerns to those of Watkins. Should we place Watkins below Robinson just because Watkins' sub-par situation is fresher in our minds? It's a question we must ask ourselves, necessitating a longer look at what Watkins provides. You could conduct a similar thought experiment with DeAndre Hopkins, who is going a full round before Watkins.\n\nWatkins should be a target monster in a poor offense. But that poor offense has the potential for growth based on all of the moves made this offseason. With that being the case, you can easily craft an argument in favor of using a fourth-round selection on Watkins in a 12-team, PPR format. That's not much lower than where he's currently going, meaning the impact of this move could be less than it appears on its face.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-08-10", "textEnd": 183, "textStart": 168}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T17:02:00Z", "sim": 0.4666666686534882, "source": {"uri": "numberfire.com", "title": "numberFire", "id": "11841"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "20:26:00", "url": "https://www.numberfire.com/nfl/news/15813/sammy-watkins-is-still-a-fantasy-football-asset-with-the-los-angeles-rams", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8695746", "image": "https://d1tjohjvimcqgl.cloudfront.net/website/articles/15813_a2.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "17:02:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

seasons with the Eagles.\n\nHe wasn't perfect, but he was one of just five players in NFL history with 65-plus catches and 800-plus receiving yards in each of their first three years.\n\nIt's not easy to wave bye-bye to a guy who gave you that kind of consistent production, even if you're getting one of the league's more highly regarded young corners in return. So why did they do it?\n\nMatthews' fate with the Eagles probably was sealed as early as last spring, when new head coach Doug Pederson and offensive coordinator Frank Reich experimented with him on the outside during OTAs and very quickly came to the conclusion that he was strictly a slot receiver.\n\nA really, really good slot receiver. But a guy who essentially could play only inside.\n\nMatthews is entering the final year of his rookie contract. Eagles football-ops chief Howie Roseman said Friday after the trade that the decision to move Matthews \"never came down to [his] asking for too much money.''\n\nHe's right, mainly because the Eagles never had any substantive negotiations with Matthews' agent, Bus Cook.\n\nBut if Matthews has another productive season, which is a pretty good bet, his market value is going to be very high.\n\nAnd the Eagles weren't willing to break the bank for a guy who, despite being one of the league's best slot receivers, doesn't have the inside-outside versatility they want in their wideouts.\n\n\"Jordan's niche in the style of offense I brought [to the Eagles] was a slot receiver,'' Pederson said Saturday. \"He felt comfortable in there. It just worked out that he became and worked extremely well for us in that position.''\n\nBut Pederson is trying to build an offense based on versatility. He has a pair of running backs - Darren Sproles and rookie Donnel Pumphrey -- who can line up all over the formation. During Saturday's practice, Pumphrey frequently lined up in the slot and out wide as well as in the backfield.\n\nHe has three veteran tight ends - Zach Ertz, Trey Burton, and Brent Celek -- whom he also can line up all over the formation.\n\n\"The slot position, we move so many guys around in that position that it's [based] kind of by the design of the offense, by the scheme of the offense,'' Pederson said.\n\n\"With the versatility of some of the running backs we have, like Sproles and Pumphrey, they can utilize that position and create some matchups against the defense. So, the versatility of the [slot] position and flexibility we have personnel-wise as far as who we can put in that spot benefits us offensively.''\n\nSaid Roseman: \"There's one football. We look at all of the skill positions as a whole. We look at the wide receiver position and the tight end position and the running back position [as an interchangeable group].''\n\nThe two primary candidates to replace Matthews in the slot are Nelson Agholor and rookie fourth-rounder Mack Hollins. Unlike Matthews, both of them can play inside or outside, and both of them did at Saturday's practice.\n\nAgholor, who played in the slot his last year at Southern Cal and had 104 catches for 1,313 yards and 12 touchdowns, got a lot of reps in the slot this spring when Matthews was sidelined with tendinitis in his knee, and he played well.\n\nAfter two disappointing seasons, the jury still is out on the 2015 first-round pick. But the Eagles are hopeful.\n\nThe 6-4, 221-pound Hollins, who had an impressive 38-yard touchdown catch and run against the Packers on Thursday night, hadn't been getting a lot of reps in the slot. But that will change. Hollins brings the same kind of size advantage inside against smaller nickel corners that Matthews did. But he also has the speed to move outside that Matthews lacked.\n\n\"The game is about matchups,'' Hollins said. \"If my best matchup is inside against a smaller nickel, then that's where I'll be. If it's outside, then I'll be outside. It's wherever coach sees fit to put me.''\n\nThe advantage of having versatile skill-position players who can line up anywhere in the formation is that it allows the offense to run a plethora of different plays with the same personnel.\n\nIt keeps defenses guessing, forces them to make difficult decisions on whether to use their base defense or a sub-package, and creates mismatches, such as a linebacker or safety trying to cover Pumphrey or Sproles.\n\nDuring Saturday's practice, the Eagles used two-running-back packages with Sproles and Pumphrey that had Sproles lining up in the backfield and Pumphrey lining up out wide and in the slot.\n\n\"You don't have to take guys out for certain plays when they can line up inside or outside,'' Hollins said. \"It's, 'Hey, he's run in the slot before, so we can do this or that.'\n\n\"You don't have to [wonder], 'Hey, I don't know if he can run from the slot, so let's put somebody else in.' Because that gives a lot of plays away to defenses. It's good that everybody's comfortable in the slot.''\n\nErtz was one of Matthews' best friends on the team. From both a personal and team standpoint, he hated to see him go. But he understands the reasoning.\n\n\"He's produced in this league for three years,'' Ertz said. \"He was one of the best slot receivers in the league.\n\n\"The good news is that, on paper, we have a lot of guys who can fill the spot between myself, Trey, Pumphrey, Sproles, Nelson, and some of the young guys.\n\n\"I think the NFL is moving toward multiple offenses and moving guys around and putting them in situations to be successful. I think that's the approach we're going to take.''\n\nRead more by Paul Domowitch Published: August 12, 2017 \u00e2\u0080\" 3:01 AM EDT Thanks for your continued support...\n\nWe recently asked you to support our journalism.

The NFLpocalypse! It's the end of the fantasy draft as we know it!\n\nFirst, mercurial Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott was suspended six games stemming from multiple reported domestic violence incidents. Then, the Bills traded oft-injured leading receiver Sammy Watkins to the Rams, in what can conservatively can be described as a curious move. It made slightly more sense minutes later, when they announced a subsequent deal to acquire Eagles receiver Jordan Matthews.\n\nBut be advised: making \"slightly more\" sense out of something that didn't make much sense is something that still makes little sense.\n\nThe impact of the Elliott suspension has multiple layers. Elliott's fantasy value obviously takes a big hit. We were projecting Elliott's number with a two-game suspension. With an appeal still to come -- remember Greg Hardy had a 10-game ban to start 2015 reduced to four games -- we project Elliott's suspension will be reduced to four games. We will downgrade Elliott accordingly, and if an appeal is denied, then we will adjust to six games.\n\nThat would slot Elliott after early third-round options like Todd Gurley, Leonard Fournette and ahead of less appealing options like Marshawn Lynch, Lamar Miller and Christian McCaffrey. If the six-game ban is upheld, then the fall becomes steeper -- that's nearly half the fantasy regular season. At that point, he will be among more risky options in or around Round 5, behind Carlos Hyde, Dalvin Cook, Joe Mixon C.J. Anderson and Ty Montgomery, but ahead of Spencer Ware, Bilal Powell and any Saints running back.\n\nIt also makes Darren McFadden a middle-round pick, adding at least four games as a feature back to his inherent handcuff value. In deep leagues, it means Alfred Morris becomes a DMC cuff option.\n\nThe Bills deals are interesting, albeit less impactful. We're stunned by how much they must hate Watkins ... and Robert Woods. First, they declined to pick up Watkins' fifth-year option. Then they traded him to one of the worst possible landing spots for a wide receiver. A landing spot where, it just so happens, the former Bills wide receiver Woods can continue a career of irrelevancy behind Watkins (not that Woods needs much help in this regard).\n\nWe weren't especially high on Watkins, based on situation and fragility. Now, he takes that brittleness to a worse situation.\n\nMatthews now arrives in Buffalo to be the ... to be the what? He never has proven to be an effective WR1. He has done his best work out of the slot, but that role presumably was filled with the signing of Anquan Boldin. Do they move Boldin to the outside, where his lack of speed is more pronounced? Do these moves signify a greater confidence in rookie Zay Jones?\n\nWe do think it adds a bump to RB LeSean McCoy's value, expecting the offense to lean even more heavily on the ground game and him getting an increased role in the passing game.\n\nBut the Bills' receiving options, with no clear-cut go-to guy, is a situation we likely will avoid come draft day.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T19:55:00Z", "sim": 0.4549019634723663, "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "title": "New York Post", "id": "13"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "19:55:00", "url": "http://nypost.com/2017/08/11/breaking-down-the-fantasy-impact-of-a-whirlwind-nfl-day/", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8691770", "image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/crazyday.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "19:55:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

I ranked him No. 22 overall, just below Allen Robinson and above Jamison Crowder. Being tied to Jared Goff is obviously a downgrade, but reuniting with Robert Woods adds a level of comfortability. Sammy should work as the team's Z receiver. He'll probably see a few extra targets with Lance Dunbar gone for the season. If anything, the move helps Gurley's stock.\n\nBrad - OVER. Trading in Tyrod Taylor for Jared \"Where does the sun rise/set again?\" Goff is a fantasy death knell. Though improvements should be made, the Rams passer completed a disgusting 54.6 percent of his attempts last year. Watkins, who garnered 23.1 percent of the targets share in '16, will be the vertical centerpiece, but his unsightly catch rates and Goff's inaccuracy spell doom. WR15 in average drafts pre-trade and already a fixture on my \"No go\" list, he's even more unattractive. A few names ranked above him on my sheet: Jeremy Maclin, Tyrell Williams and Eric Decker.\n\nDalton - UNDER. I was pretty bullish on Watkins this year, as he appeared to finally be fully recovered from his foot issue, is one season removed from leading the NFL in yards per target and is just now entering his prime. But this obviously is a major downgrade, as he'll now have to deal with one of the league's worst QB situations. Still, even bumping him down 10 spots on my WR board has him finishing as a top-25 fantasy wideout in 2017. Watkins is going to see a ton of targets.\n\n[Now's the time to sign up for Fantasy Football! Join for free]\n\nMeanwhile, Jordan Matthews escapes purgatory in Philadelphia and lands in Buffalo. OVER or UNDER 69.5 receptions for the receiver in his new digs?\n\nLiz - UNDER. Watkins averaged nearly 4 catches per game over the past 3 seasons in Buffalo. Even if Matthews manages that kind of production, he'll fall short of the given line by 5.5 grabs. Zay Jones and Anquan Boldin will see plenty of looks, and LeSean McCoy figures to be heavily targeted via the air, especially given Rick Dennison's adoration for pass-catching backs.\n\nBrad - OVER. Watkins attracted 23.1 percent of the targets share (6.5 per game) when on the field and working outside last year. Matthews was the primary slot option for Philly a season ago, but I suspect he'll slide to the wing opposite Zay Jones in Buffalo. Likely with renewed energy, I believe he returns at or near the WR2 level exhibited two seasons ago. Recall in that campaign, Matthews was a red-zone machine posting a 66.7 percent catch rate inside the 20. Boldin and Jones will push for targets, but it's conceivable he churns out a line around 75-900-7 this season.\n\nDalton - OVER. It's not easy switching teams so close to the beginning of the season at the wide receiver position, but Matthews should become the Bills' WR1 in no time. Sammy Watkins has been dealt, and Matthews has averaged 75.0 catches per season over his first three years in the league. His value gets a pretty significant boost with this move.\n\nPick your poison. What accessory receiver in Buffalo or Los Angeles would you rather have in light of the giant trade news: Cooper Kupp, Zay Jones, Anquan Boldin, Robert Woods, Nelson Agholor or Torrey Smith?\n\nBrad - AGHOLOR. Jones and Kupp are certainly interesting post-trades and have moved up my cheat sheet, but the former Trojan deserves compliments as well. He's reportedly made plentiful splashy plays in training camp and appears to be locked into the slot role in Philadelphia, a position where Matthews enticed 23.2 percent of the targets share last year. Yes, his first two years in the league were forgettable, but Agholor is now a legitimate borderline WR3 in 12-team leagues, capable of 60-plus receptions, 750-850 yards with a handful of TDs.\n\nLiz - ANQUAN BOLDIN. He's everything the team wished Charles Clay (whose knees are shot) could have been. Perhaps not the sexiest play, but a solid floor and consistent producer at a bargain price.\n\nDalton - NELSON AGHOLOR. The exit of Jordan Matthews frees up plenty of targets for the third-year wideout, who's impressed throughout training camp. Agholor is a former top-20 pick, and don't forget about Alshon Jeffery's past injury problems. Agholor could be in store for a big breakout in 2017.\n\nDisagree?

Management has ripped the band-aid off, and the Sean McDermott/Brandon Beane regime is in full force.\n\nThe team has already shown that they have no problem moving on players who do not fit the management's new philosophy. See: Cyrus Kouandjio.\n\nThe trade of Sammy Watkins and Ronald Darby signal a major step in deconstructing a roster created by mediocre executives.\n\nIt was once thought unfathomable to deal Watkins, a pre-ordained franchise player. In light of the moves, there are other players who are now on the hot seat in Buffalo. This does not mean that the players will necessarily be removed from the roster in the near future, but it does indicate that the leash has been shortened for any mistakes these players may make.\n\nTyrod Taylor\n\nMandatory Credit: Kevin Hoffman-USA TODAY Sports\n\nTyrod Taylor has shown some solid production during his time as the quarterback of the Bills. He has shown some efficient play. However, he has not made the progress that some have wanted to see from a franchise quarterback. While Taylor does have a strong-arm and is extremely mobile, there are some limitations to his game. He's not keen on taking risks, and he's had trouble connecting with receivers in the middle of the field in the past.\n\nHe was pushed to restructure his mega-contract over the summer, and ultimately, Taylor took a $10 million pay cut to stay with the team, according to Mike Rodak of ESPN.\n\nThe trades that Buffalo made on Friday afternoon landed them some additional draft picks in the early rounds of next year's draft. The Bills now have six picks in the first three rounds of the 2018 NFL Draft, and the idea of Buffalo attempting to land a franchise quarterback with one of these picks isn't ludicrous.\n\nWhile Taylor will likely be the team's starting quarterback in 2017, they could trade him if the potential return is a decent draft pick. Nothing is out of the question after trading Watkins and Darby.\n\nCharles Clay\n\n(Photo by Brett Carlsen/Getty Images)\n\nClay has done reasonably well with the Bills throughout his two seasons in Buffalo. His quarterback has had issues passing accurately over the middle, which has hurt Clay's numbers. The team was in need of a playmaking tight end when he signed as a free agent in 2015. Clay is among the top-ten tight ends with respect to base salary. He is just ahead of Rob Gronkowski and Delanie Walker.\n\nHe has put together two solid seasons with the Bills, but he is overpaid for his production. He has missed four games over the past two seasons, and he has been subject to veteran maintenance days during training camp this season. It may be a challenge to keep Clay on this roster beyond this year.\n\nAdolphus Washington\n\nMandatory Credit: Timothy T. Ludwig-USA TODAY Sports\n\nAdolphus Washington's offseason issues do not seem to click with McDermott's refrain of discipline. It is well-reported that he was arrested this summer. At this point, he has become just another guy on the defensive line. He is in a battle with Jerel Worthy to be a part of the defensive tackle rotation. Depending on what happens with Ryan Davis' health and flexibility, Washington may be searching for a new team in the future.\n\nReggie Ragland\n\nMandatory Credit: Mark Konezny-USA TODAY Sports\n\nReggie Ragland was one of the gems of Rex Ryan's drafts, as the talented linebacker fell to the team in the second round of the 2016 NFL Draft. However, the middle linebacker tore his ACL during his first training camp, an injury he is still recovering from. He has worked with the second and third-teams throughout this year's training camp.\n\nThe team must decide if Ragland fits in with their long-term future. Sal Capaccio of WGR550 shared that Ragland may ultimately not fit McDermott's scheme. If this is the case, Buffalo could trade the talented young linebacker to add to their stockpile of 2018 draft picks.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355364", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T13:02:00Z", "sim": 0.4156862795352936, "source": {"uri": "billswire.usatoday.com", "title": "Bills Wire", "id": "19299"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "03:32:00", "url": "http://billswire.usatoday.com/2017/08/12/4-bills-who-may-be-on-the-hot-seat-after-blockbuster-trades/", "storyUri": "eng-3355364", "id": "8867569", "image": "https://usatbillswire.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/usatsi_9781098.jpg?w=640", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "13:02:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

that sent wide receiver Jordan Matthews to Buffalo. Here's what you need to know about Darby:\n\nDarby has played two years in the NFL after being drafted in 2015 by Buffalo out of Florida State. He left the Seminoles after his junior season. As a sophomore in 2013, he was on the team that won the BCS national championship.\n\nHe was the No. 50 overall pick in 2015. As columnist David Murphy noted, the Bills selected Darby three picks after the Eagles drafted Eric Rowe.\n\n(Dave also noted that Darby is the fourth Bills defensive back the Eagles have acquired since the 2015 season, after Corey Graham, Leodis McKelvin and Ron Brooks.)\n\nIn 29 career pro games, Darby has two interceptions, 121 tackles and 16 assists on tackles. Both of his interceptions came in 2015, when Pro Football Focus named him its Defensive Rookie of the Year.\n\nDarby missed one game last year after suffering a concussion in a late-November contest against Jacksonville. It was suffered when Jaguars running back Chris Ivory tried to hurdle him, but ended up slamming his knee into Darby's helmet.\n\nHeading into the 2017 season, Darby has two years left on a four-year, $4.56 million contract. According to Spotrac, he'll earn $800,426 this year and $1,008,139 next year. After that, he'll be an unrestricted free agent.\n\nPublished: August 11, 2017 \u00e2\u0080\" 3:01 AM EDT | Updated: August 11, 2017 \u00e2\u0080\" 1:34 PM EDT\n\nThanks for your continued support...\n\nWe recently asked you to support our journalism.

Tyrod was going through the progressions and Sammy was the open receiver, so it was good to see.\"\n\nTaylor likewise reiterated a favorite line of his.\n\n\"I always say this coverage definitely dictates where the ball goes,\" he said. \"Sammy has done a good job winning his matchups early on. He had a couple coverages where they were press -- he's going to win most of those. So, it was a good thing to get him going early. Preseason of course you want to go out there a little longer. So, I think we built some good chemistry in the couple plays we had. Definitely got to build from that.\"\n\nWhat They Said: McDermott, Taylor, Watkins, Williams\n\nThose first three catches total 30 yards. Watkins would later add one more to finish with four catches for 39 yards.\n\n\"I think we just got the perfect reads,\" he said. \"They played a certain look, and I was open.

But listen, it's like anything that we do in life - the next person steps up and here we go. We can sit and have poor attitudes and all that, but at the same time we're happy for both parties, and we're moving forward.

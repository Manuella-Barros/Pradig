Katrina Jackson-Andrews' Senate Bill 430 passed the Senate with bipartisan support last month but was rejected Tuesday in the House Administration of Criminal Justice Committee, which is dominated by conservatives and has served as a launch pad for much of Republican Gov. Jeff Landry's tough-on-crime agenda.\n\nThe committee's vote means that nitrogen gas hypoxia, a largely-untested method that has come under scrutiny since Alabama executed a man by that method in January, will remain legal in Louisiana as Landry seeks to restart executions of the state's nearly 60 death row prisoners. Landry advocated for that method in his February special session on crime and opposed the bill that died on Tuesday.\n\nJackson-Andrews, D-Shreveport, said she brought the bill in solidarity with Jewish Louisianans, whose concerns over gassing resonated with her in part because of the state's history of lynching. Lynching, too, was wielded as a tool of extrajudicial murder as well as an officially sanctioned execution method in Louisiana, she noted.\n\n\"My people were hung for a number of years throughout this state,\" she said. \"If the death penalty were to include the gallows, I would be here to say that that invokes trauma.\"\n\nRepublican lawmakers and state officials, including representatives of Landry's and Attorney General Liz Murrill's offices, rallied at the state Capitol a day earlier to show solidarity with Israel and protest antisemitism amid Israel's ongoing war in Gaza.\n\nSeveral Jewish faith leaders and activists who rallied with Republicans on Monday arrived in the House criminal justice committee Tuesday to support the bill. The nitrogen gas method \"unmistakably and immediately\" evokes the Holocaust, said Rabbi David Cohen-Henriquez of Shir Chadash Conservative Congregation in Metairie.\n\nBut Republicans on the committee and other opponents of the bill disputed the parallels drawn by Jewish activists between murder by Nazi Germany in the Holocaust and executions carried out by state officials.\n\n\"We're not talking about innocent women and children, we're talking about people convicted by a jury of 12,\" said Rep. Tony Bacala, R-Prairieville, told Cohen-Henriquez and other Jewish activists.\n\nThe committee voted the bill down on an 8-3 vote along party lines with Republicans voting against it and three Democrats voting in favor.\n\nA bill pushed by Landry in his February crime session expanded Louisiana's execution methods to include nitrogen gas hypoxia and electrocution. The state, which has not executed anyone since 2010, has struggled for years to obtain lethal injection drugs -- a problem the bill sought to ameliorate by shrouding details of those drugs' purchase in secrecy. Meanwhile, a recent court challenge has cast doubt on whether Louisiana can execute people using electrocution.\n\nVote on Senate Bill 430:Rep. Debbie Villio, R-Kenner: NoRep.

The bill also shielded companies that provide the drugs for executions from public records.\n\nLouisiana has 56 inmates on death row and it has been over a decade since the last execution.\n\nA group of Jewish community leaders formed a group called Jews Against Gassing in the weeks after the bill passed to push for a bill to remove the gas option. They say the method is too reminiscent of how millions of Jews and non-Jews were killed in the Holocaust.\n\n\"On the experimental form of gassing being added as an execution method in the state of Louisiana.

The day before, elected officials held a rally against antisemitism on the capitol steps. Yet they said the group was wrong for believing the gas suffocation of inmates is the same as Nazi Germany.\n\nSB430 would have still left lethal injection and the electric chair as options for execution. The bill had bipartisan support in the Senate, with multiple senators voting for it who originally supported adding the method.\n\nThe father of a woman who was killed in the 1990's by a Louisiana death row inmate said he has been searching for justice for decades. With the new method added he is hopeful to get closure in his daughter's story.\n\n\"A few months ago, y'all gave us some hope that something could be done about it.

(Photo credit: Jarvis DeBerry/Louisiana Illuminator)\n\nA legislative attempt to pull nitrogen hypoxia from Louisiana's death penalty options failed Tuesday, despite pleas from the Jewish community that it would revisit the trauma their ancestors experienced during the Holocaust.\n\nRepublicans on the House Committee on the Administration of Criminal Justice rejected a proposal from Sen. Katrina Jackson-Andrews, D-Monroe, in a 3-8 vote. It would have eliminated a method of execution state lawmakers approved in January during a special session devoted to criminal justice.\n\nDeath penalty advocates have pushed for the option to be added in Louisiana since January when Alabama became the first state to use it. Since Kenneth Eugene Smith's execution, a lawsuit has been filed against the state with claims that nitrogen hypoxia amounts to cruel and unusual punishment. Witnesses say Smith struggled and appeared to be in distress before dying at the Holman Correctional Center in Atmore, Alabama.\n\nThe coalition Jews Against Gassing quickly assembled once nitrogen became an option in Louisiana. Mississippi and Oklahoma have also approved the method but have yet to execute anyone using it.\n\nJackson-Andrews told the committee Tuesday the concerns of Jewish people over lethal gassing resonated with her.\n\n\"I agree with them,\" the senator said. \"My people were hung for a number of years throughout this state. And if the death penalty included the gallows of hanging, I would be here saying that invokes trauma because that was the method that was used to eradicate ... my ancestors.\"\n\nRabbi David Cohen-Henriquez with the Shir Cadash Conservative Congregation in Metairie told lawmakers he was opposed to \"the use of poison for state-sanctioned murder.\"\n\n\"As a Jew, as a rabbi and as a human being, I cannot stand silent when such a depravity is proposed in our own backyard,\" Cohen-Henriquez said. \"I cannot remain silent against a method of execution that so deeply offends our people and displays such blatant disrespect for our collective trauma.\"\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\nJohn Sinquefield, senior counsel for Attorney General Liz Murrill, took issue with the characterization of nitrogen gas as poison. A former East Baton Rouge Parish prosecutor, he secured the conviction and death penalty for serial killer Derrick Todd Lee in 2004. Lee died in prison in 2016 of heart disease before he could be put to death.\n\nSinquefueld maintained use of nitrogen gas in executions is humane and painted Jackson-Andrews' proposal as a first step toward doing away with the death penalty entirely.\n\n\"This is anti-death penalty,\" Sinquefield said. \"It's a wolf in sheep's clothing meant to eat up the death penalty because they know we don't have the drugs for lethal injection, we don't have a workable electric chair, and it's under litigation.\"\n\nLouisiana last put a condemned prisoner to death using lethal injection in 2010 when convicted murderer and child kidnapper Gerald James Bordelon. Prior to that, the same method was used to kill Leslie Dale Martin in 2002 for rape and murder.\n\nThe electric chair hasn't been used in Louisiana since 1991. After Andrew Lee Jones was executed for murder, the device called \"Gruesome Gertie\" was retired when a lawsuit challenged whether its use constituted cruel and unusual punishment. It's now part of a museum display at the Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola.\n\nState lawmakers also approved lethal injection in 1991, and it has been used eight times. In recent years, the prescription drugs needed to carry out such death sentences have been hard to obtain. Some of the pharmaceutical companies that make them have pulled their products over the resulting bad publicity.\n\nDuring the January special session, state lawmakers approved legislation to exclude records related to drugs used for lethal injections from public records law. It takes effect July 1. No executions have been scheduled in Louisiana as of yet.\n\nFive convicted killers have been executed in the United States so far this year. In addition to Alabama, convicted murderers have been put to death in Georgia, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas -- all through lethal injection.\n\nTen other condemned men are under active death warrants with execution dates set for 2024 in Georgia, Missouri, Ohio, Oklahoma and Texas. Fourteen others have inactive death warrants because their deaths have been rescheduled or they await a new execution date, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.\n\nIn Idaho, the lethal injection of Thomas Creech was halted Feb. 28 because medical personnel failed 10 times to access veins in his arms and legs to administer lethal drugs. Creech, who has confessed to 42 murders, remains on death row without a new execution date.\n\nSUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST.\n\nDONATE\n\nThe post Louisiana lawmakers snub Jewish community's plea to block

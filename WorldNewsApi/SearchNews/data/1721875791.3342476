Wright Museum of African American History and the Detroit Historical Society to ask voters to establish operating millage rates designed to support museums in Detroit. House Bill 4177, introduced by state Rep. Tyrone Carter, D-Detroit, would allow counties to establish historical museum authorities \u2014 and the bill is written to allow the Wright and the Detroit Historical Society to create an authority to ask voters to levy a maximum 0.2-mill tax for up to 10 years. The bill passed 56-53 on Thursday. Leaders from both the Wright and the Detroit Historical Society, which operates both the Detroit Historical Museum in Midtown and the Dossin Great Lakes Museum on Belle Isle, have said additional funding support is needed to maintain the museums. If the bill were to be signed into law, museum leaders have said they would ask to place millage rate proposals on the ballot in Oakland and Wayne counties. \"If this passes, the museums win and receive the critical funding and the support they need and residents can continue to enjoy these museums right in the city of Detroit,\" Carter said in a statement. On the House floor Thursday, Carter stressed that the bill is focused on only Oakland and Wayne counties. A substitute bill was adopted Thursday which reduced the maximum potential millage an authority could ask for \u2014 when it was first introduced, the bill would have allowed for a maximum 0.4-mill tax for up to 20 years. The bill passed along party lines, with House Republicans voting against the legislation. State Rep. Tom Kuhn, R-Troy, said he wanted there to be greater public oversight of the authorities. HB 4177 now advances to the Senate for consideration.

But wherever Kardashian goes, we guess controversy also follows.\n\nKim has now posed next to a white statue of an elephant in a picture. There is nothing wrong with the social media post, but this comes after she was criticised for using a Lord Ganesha idol 'as a prop for her photoshoot'. Sharing her pictures from her India visit, Kim wrote, \"Smiling, thinking about how I really got Khloe out of the house.\"\n\nThe pictures show Kim in a white outfit, and she can be seen posing from different angles. In one of the pictures, Kim also held a plate of red and yellow kumkum.\n\nAlso Read: Kim Kardashian reacts to being mobbed in India, fans excited to see her in a saree\n\nOne of her followers on Instagram wrote, \"Great to see you connect spiritually.\"\n\nAnother follower said, \"You look so pretty while smiling. India brought the best out of You.\"\n\nOne of the Instagram users wrote, \"She is living her Indian princess era.\"\n\nEarlier, Kim shared a picture of herself standing beside a Ganesha idol, which was not liked by many on the internet as they questioned the use of Lord Ganesha as a prop.\n\nIt was Kim's first ever visit to India, where she also went to perform seva at the ISKCON Temple with her sister Khloe and motivational speaker Jay Shetty. Pictures of the visit also went viral, where Kim was seen serving food to the children.\n\nInternet calls Kim Kardashian a 'hypocrite'/IG\n\nKim at the Ambani wedding was seen wearing outfits made by Indian designers for all the events.

Kim didn't fail to steal the show in a dusty rose lehenga adorned with a dazzling 170-carat diamond necklace.\n\nKim Kardashian previously came under fire from fans for wearing red at the wedding, which appears to be against tradition as it's a color reserved for the bride.\n\nOn Wednesday, Kim took to her Instagram account to show off her look for the three-day nuptials of Anant Ambani, son of India's richest man Mukesh Ambani, and Radhika Merchant.\n\nThe SKIMS founder proved why she remains one of the world's most photographed and emulated celebrities as she turned up draped in diamonds and a bedazzled lehenga for the lavish Ambani wedding over the weekend.\n\nShe wore a dusty pink and gold lehenga from Tarun Tahiliani with floral embroidery and Swarovski crystals all over. Her necklace contained 170 carats of diamonds, glittering radiantly under the bright light at the event's location.\n\nKim added an eight-carat maang tikka on top of her head that hung gently over her forehead, as well as a pair of 62-carat diamond earrings and a glittering nose ring.\n\nThe reality TV star perfected the look with chic makeup and styled her hair back into a long braid, allowing it to flow freely down her back.\n\nIn one of Kim's pictures, she is seen posing in front of a jaw-dropping floral arrangement that mostly consists of red flowers. In another snap, she is joined by her sister Khloe Kardashian.\n\nLike Kim, Khloe turned up in style for the lavish nuptials. She wore a vibrant pink lehenga with patterned embroidery and adorned herself with 250 carats of Schwartz diamonds and pearls.\n\nThe Good American founder carried a pink Hermes Kelly Pochette purse in her hand to match the color of her outfit. She styled her hair into a half-updo with some strands flowing down her back.\n\nOther stars, including Priyanka Chopra, Nick Jonas, John Cena, and Justin Bieber, attended the event.\n\nThe mother-of-four garnered the ire of some fans for appearing in red at the wedding event. Kim had just posted the photos of her lehengas on Sunday when some critics blasted her for the look, which happens to be a color traditionally reserved for Indian brides.\n\n\"It looks very cheap [sic] and not Indian at all! Only the bride wears red,\" a fan wrote, while another added that she was \"not supposed to wear red to a wedding in India. That's saved for the bride.\"\n\n\"I'm Mexican & even I know your [sic] NOT supposed to wear Red to an Indian wedding,\" one fan wrote.\n\nOthers criticized Kim for previously mocking Indian cuisine, with a fan saying, \"But you once said their food is disgusting. What changed?\"\n\nAnother fan wrote, \"That's nice, but I remember you saying, 'Indian food is disgusting.' Hopefully, the Ambani's have organized food that you like. Mild continental dishes. Without spices, bland.\"\n\nDuring their time in India, Kim and Khloe were busy with other events besides the wedding.\n\nAccording to photos shared online by the business mogul, she and her sister visited a temple in India where they helped dish out food to kids with British podcaster Jay Shetty and his wife, Radhi Devlukia.\n\nFor the outing, Kim wore a less revealing outfit, donning an orange and pink shawl and a long orange skirt. Her black hair was styled in a tight bun.\n\nSpeaking about the trip to the temple, Kim wrote, \"Thank you @jayshetty and @radhidevlukia for this beautiful experience at the temple and having the opportunity to visit these small souls. I'm forever grateful.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in a new episode on \"The Kardashians,\" Kim explained how she suffered a nasty injury on her left hand, which she claimed was \"more painful than childbirth.\"\n\nAccording to People magazine, the beauty mogul said the incident was caused by \"my big sliding door to my bathroom,\" which she noted has \"no latch,\" so she'd often use her hands to stop it.\n\n\"I pulled it really hard, and then Saint ran in with chips,\" she further shared, referring to her son, whom she shares with her ex-husband Kanye West. \"I'm like, 'It's 8:30 at night, no chips!'\"\n\nDistracted, in an effort to prevent her young son from indulging in his late-night cravings, Kim said the door \"went 'boom,' and I was like, 'Ugh,'\" making a pained face.\n\n\"I literally looked at my hand, and I fell to the ground,\" she said, as a \"graphic images\" warning appeared on the screen.\n\nCalling for help, she explained that she \"didn't do anything but freeze,\" adding that \"you can't even describe the pain, but your whole body goes into shock. It was, like, more painful than childbirth.\"", "source": {"uri": "theblast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Blast"}, "authors": [{"uri": "favour_adegoke@theblast.com", "name": "Favour

Stay tuned for more!\n\nLet's begin with our top story, Joe Russo and Anthony Russo, who have together helmed four of the biggest Marvel films of all time, including the last two Avenger outings, have been tapped to direct Avengers 5 and 6. According to a source quoted by The Hollywood Reporter publication, the Russo brothers will return to the franchise to oversee the next two Avengers outings, a position which earlier also saw Deadpool & Wolverine director Shawn Levy being in contention for. This will mark the return of Russo brothers to Marvel studios after delivering global blockbusters like Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), Captain America: Civil War (2016), Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019).\n\nIn the latest Emmy awards nominations, 'The Bear' has set a record for a comedy series with 23 nominations, while in the drama category, 'Shogun' secured 25 nominations under its name. \"The Bear\" is listed for nominations for its second season which deals with the rag-tag group of sandwich makers who try to build an elite restaurant. Some of the significant nominations include Best Comedy Series, Best Actor in a Comedy Series for Jeremy Allen, and Best Actress for Ayo Edebiri. Shogun dominated in the drama category and gave the FX an overall 93 nominations. Shogun received nominations for Best Drama Series, Best Actress for Anna Sawai and Best Actor for Hiroyuki Sanada.\n\nIn a recent interaction, Actor Ryan Reynolds shared how he gave up his fee for the first Deadpool to bring the film to the screen. Speaking to The New York Times, Ryan said, \"No part of me was thinking when Deadpool was finally greenlit that this would be a success. I even let go of getting paid to do the movie just to put it back on the screen: They wouldn't allow my co-writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick on set.\" Talking about the reason behind Deadpool's success, Ryan stated that one of the great enemies of creativity is too much time and money, and the movie had neither time nor money.\n\nIn some tragic news: American actor Shannen Doherty (aged 53), best known for her role as high school student Brenda Walsh on the hit 1990s television drama Beverly Hills, 90210, died after years of living with cancer on Saturday, 13th July. People magazine cited Doherty's publicist Leslie Sloane and reported, \"It is with a heavy heart that I confirm the passing of actress Shannen Doherty... She lost her battle with cancer after many years of fighting the disease.\" Doherty had been public about her battle with breast cancer, disclosing in 2015 that she was undergoing treatment for the disease. In 2023, she had a brain tumour removed and revealed that the cancer had spread to her bones.\n\nKim Kardashian and Khloe Kardashian attended the big fat Indian wedding of Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant. The Kardashian sisters are among the many global personalities who were invited to the wedding by the Ambanis. For the wedding, the Kardashian sisters were seen dressed in lehenga. While Kim wore a red lehenga, Khloe was seen wearing a lehenga in white and gold. They completed their looks with statement jewellery and matha tikas. Both Kim and Khloe Kardashian have been actively posting photos and videos from their visit to India on their Instagram Stories. They were simultaneously shooting for their reality show Keeping Up With The Kardashians.\n\nReality TV stars Kim Kardashian and her sister Khloe Kardashian recently visited the ISCKON temple, accompanied by renowned life coach Jay Shetty and his wife Radhi Devlukia-Shetty. Khloe shared a series of photos from the visit and wrote, \"Major shout out of appreciation to @jayshetty and his wife @radhidevlukia for being so generous with their time in India. They took us to the most magical temple. So blessed to have the experiences with such beautiful souls.\" Photos shared on social media show the Kardashian sisters holding food buckets and serving local underprivileged children. The children's faces lit up with joy as they received the food.\n\nWhile the Kardashian sisters turned heads in custom-made outfits by renowned Indian designer Manish Malhotra, Kim recently made headlines by posting a picture of herself with a Lord Ganesha idol. However, she soon started receiving flak from social media users for using the idol as a \"prop,\" prompting her to take down the image. The picture went viral on Reddit and one of the users commented, \"Nita Aunty, educate your guests.\" While another user wrote, \"That isn't helping her gain any favours from the Indian audience that she is after.\" Kim rose to fame with the American reality television series Keeping Up with the Kardashians, featuring her family.\n\nLastly, Here is a mini-review of the film Longlegs: There is clearly a dark cloud hanging over FBI agent Lee Harker (Monroe), and it requires no FBI to determine that she is probably not the best of hires for a job requiring one to go after murderous. For 20-plus years, the best the FBI has to offer has been trying to decipher the letters Longlegs has been leaving behind at the homes where families have been found mysteriously slaughtered. Oz Perkins, also the screenwriter, happens to be the son of Anthony Perkins. And this film, even as it hints at the ties that bind families in love and other things, never leans on it. Indian Express rated the film 1.5 out of 5 stars.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Actor Ryan Reynolds discusses giving up his fee for the first Deadpool. Plus, a mini-review of the film Twisters.\n\nLet's begin with our top story: The second teaser of HBO's Dune Prophecy offers a brief glimpse of Bollywood actor Tabu, who plays the pivotal role of Sister Francesca in the series. The series centres on the Harkonnen sisters, Valya and Tula (played by Emily Watson and Olivia Williams), as they strive to protect humanity from emerging threats and lay the foundations for the Bene Gesserit, a powerful all-female order with extraordinary abilities. Dune: Prophecy is inspired by the novel Sisterhood of Dune, written by Dune author Brian Herbert and Kevin J Anderson. The show also stars Jodhi May, who is known for her role in The Witcher, as Empress Natalya.\n\nHere's a mini-review of the film Twisters: The film, directed by Lee Isaac Chung of the Oscar-winning Minari fame, is officially a stand-alone sequel of the 1996 hit that went by a singular Twister. In a quintessential Republican country in the Midwest US, ordinary White folks making a living with their hands, grounded in American values of the rodeo, baseball and the national anthem, are facing a \"tornado outbreak\". Now the storms are getting worse, more frequent and deadlier. While Glen Powell's unruffled charisma survives this wrecker, the talented Daisy Edgar-Jones is too placid for the gathering storm hinted at in their relationship. Indian Express rated the film 2.5 out of 5 stars.\n\nIn some tragic news: American actor Shannen Doherty (aged 53), best known for her role as high school student Brenda Walsh on the hit 1990s television drama Beverly Hills, 90210, died after years of living with cancer on Saturday, 13th July. People magazine cited Doherty's publicist Leslie Sloane and reported, \"It is with a heavy heart that I confirm the passing of actress Shannen Doherty... She lost her battle with cancer after many years of fighting the disease.\" Doherty had been public about her battle with breast cancer, disclosing in 2015 that she was undergoing treatment for the disease. In 2023, she had a brain tumour removed and revealed that the cancer had spread to her bones.\n\nIn the latest Emmy awards nominations, 'The Bear' has set a record for a comedy series with 23 nominations, while in the drama category, 'Shogun' secured 25 nominations under its name. \"The Bear\" is listed for nominations for its second season which deals with the rag-tag group of sandwich makers who try to build an elite restaurant. Some of the significant nominations include Best Comedy Series, Best Actor in a Comedy Series for Jeremy Allen, and Best Actress for Ayo Edebiri. Shogun dominated in the drama category and gave the FX an overall 93 nominations. Shogun received nominations for Best Drama Series, Best Actress for Anna Sawai and Best Actor for Hiroyuki Sanada.\n\nIn a recent interaction, Actor Ryan Reynolds shared how he gave up his fee for the first Deadpool to bring the film to the screen. Speaking to The New York Times, Ryan said, \"No part of me was thinking when Deadpool was finally greenlit that this would be a success. I even let go of getting paid to do the movie just to put it back on the screen: They wouldn't allow my co-writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick on set.\" Talking about the reason behind Deadpool's success, Ryan stated that one of the great enemies of creativity is too much time and money, and the movie had neither time nor money.\n\nNext up: Kim Kardashian and Khloe Kardashian attended the big fat Indian wedding of Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant. The Kardashian sisters are among the many global personalities who were invited to the wedding by the Ambanis. For the wedding, the Kardashian sisters were seen dressed in lehenga. While Kim wore a red lehenga, Khloe was seen wearing a lehenga in white and gold. They completed their looks with statement jewellery and matha tikas. Both Kim and Khloe Kardashian have been actively posting photos and videos from their visit to India on their Instagram Stories. They were simultaneously shooting for their reality show Keeping Up With The Kardashians.\n\nReality TV stars Kim Kardashian and her sister Khloe Kardashian recently visited the ISCKON temple, accompanied by renowned life coach Jay Shetty and his wife Radhi Devlukia-Shetty. Khloe shared a series of photos from the visit and wrote, \"Major shout out of appreciation to @jayshetty and his wife @radhidevlukia for being so generous with their time in India. They took us to the most magical temple. So blessed to have the experiences with such beautiful souls.\" Photos shared on social media show the Kardashian sisters holding food buckets and serving local underprivileged children. The children's faces lit up with joy as they received the food.\n\nLastly, Joe Russo and Anthony Russo, who have together helmed four of the biggest Marvel films of all time, including the last two Avenger outings, have been tapped to direct Avengers 5 and 6. According to a source quoted by The Hollywood Reporter publication, the Russo brothers will return to the franchise to oversee the next two Avengers outings, a position which earlier also saw Deadpool & Wolverine director Shawn Levy being in contention for. This will mark the return of Russo brothers to Marvel studios after delivering global blockbusters like Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), Captain America: Civil War (2016), Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019).", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

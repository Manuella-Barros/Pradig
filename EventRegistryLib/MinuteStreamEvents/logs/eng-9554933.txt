The year over year revenue increase reflects the benefit from significantly better weather in the 2024 first quarter period compared to the same period in 2023. The adjusted EBITDA margin of 22.8% in the quarter demonstrates our fiscal discipline and the success of our initiatives to optimize operations as we continue to track well above historical adjusted EBITDA margin levels.\n\n\"We generated revenue growth across each of our reporting segments in the quarter including a 3.5% increase in Casino revenues as we extended the positive Casino revenue trends that we saw during the last months of 2023. The collective 17.0% increase in Food and Beverage and Other revenues primarily reflects the benefits of our initiatives to position our event center as a leading destination for events of all sizes in the region. While this effort is off to a very strong start, we believe there remains a significant opportunity to grow the awareness and appreciation for our hospitality offerings to deliver even higher financial performance. Pari-mutuel results rose year-over-year primarily due to milder weather and our continued efforts to optimize the operations for this portion of our business.\n\n\"Development at Canterbury Commons continues to significantly transform the lifestyle experience at the property and is proving out our long-term vision for establishing a regional 'Live, Work, Stay, and Play' destination. Development of Swervo Development Corporation's (\"Swervo\") amphitheater continues on schedule and recently, Greystone filed an application for a second 28,000 square foot commercial office building within the Winner's Circle site that is expected to add additional daytime population and a mix of uses to Canterbury. This project would join the already under construction 10,000 square foot commercial building that will be home to BBQ and pizza restaurants and a fitness center. In addition, we are making consistent progress on our barn relocation project and are looking forward to beginning work later this year on a new road that will allow us to unlock approximately 20 additional acres of land that would provide economic upside for Canterbury and our shareholders.\n\n\"As we continue to optimize our operations and are positioned to benefit from the full potential that will be unlocked by the development of Canterbury Commons, we remain equally focused on exploring additional opportunities to create new value for our shareholders. Recently, the Minnesota Racing Commission approved the introduction of 500 on-track ADW historical horse racing terminals at Canterbury Park effective May 21, 2024. This entertainment option would offer our guests the ability to wager on historical horse racing outcomes similar to what is available in multiple jurisdictions. While this approval is currently the subject of a legal challenge and state legislative efforts, we remain fully committed to advocate for the ability to bring new gaming and wagering opportunities, including sports wagering, to Canterbury Park. Expanding the gaming offerings at Canterbury Park would benefit our shareholders and importantly help us secure the long-term viability of Minnesota's horse racing industry, which supports thousands of jobs and generates approximately $400 million in economic benefits to the State. With our solid balance sheet and consistent cash flow generation, we are positioned to return capital to shareholders through our quarterly cash dividend and to continue executing on our strategies to deliver long-term growth.\"\n\nCanterbury Commons Development Update\n\nSwervo continues to make progress on the construction of its state-of-the-art amphitheater which is expected to open in 2025. The Company's barn relocation and redevelopment plan is also underway and is on track for completion in 2025. Canterbury expects to begin work this summer on the road adjacent to the amphitheater which will unlock the development potential of over 20 acres of land in that portion of the site.\n\nResidential and commercial construction updates related to joint ventures include:\n\nResidential and commercial construction updates related to prior land sales include:\n\nDeveloper and partner selection for the remaining 40 acres of Canterbury Commons, including 20 acres that will become available for development following the completion of the new road noted above, continues. Additional uses could include office, retail, hotel and restaurants.\n\nSummary of 2024 First Quarter Operating Results\n\nNet revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2024, increased 6.0% to $14.1 million, compared to $13.3 million in the same period last year. The year-over-year improvement reflects growth of 3.5% in Casino revenues, 3.6% in Pari-mutuel revenues, 17.5% in Food and Beverage revenues and 15.4% in Other revenues. The year-over-year increases are primarily the result of unusually mild winter weather and strong attendance at events and entertainment offerings that occurred during the quarter.\n\nOperating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2024, were $12.3 million, an increase of $590,000, or 5.0%, compared to operating expenses of $11.7 million for the same period in 2023. The year-over-year increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by higher labor and contracted services costs as well as increased costs across the business due to the current continued inflationary environment.\n\nThe Company recorded a net loss of $852,000 and a net gain of $1.9 million from equity investments for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 2024 first quarter loss is primarily related to its share of depreciation, amortization and interest expense from the Doran Canterbury joint ventures while the 2023 first quarter gain is related to insurance proceeds received related to a claim by the joint venture against a third-party developer.\n\nThe Company recorded income tax expense of $0.5 million and $1.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, resulting in an effective tax rate of 31.1% and 27.3%, respectively.\n\nThe Company recorded net income of $1.0 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.20 for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The Company recorded net income of $2.8 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.56 for the three months ended March 31, 2023.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, increased 14.0% year-over-year to $3.2 million in the 2024 first quarter, compared to $2.8 million in the 2023 first quarter.\n\nAdditional Financial Information\n\nFurther financial information for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024, is presented in the accompanying tables at the end of this press release. Additional information will be provided in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on or about May 10, 2024.\n\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nTo supplement our financial statements, we also provide investors with information about our EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, each of which is a non-GAAP measure, and which exclude certain items from net income, a GAAP measure. We define EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest income (net of interest expense), income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, as well as excluding stock-based compensation (which includes our 401(k) match expense as this match occurs in Company stock), gain on insurance proceeds relating to equity investments, depreciation and amortization related to equity investments and interest expense related to equity investments. Neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA is a measure of performance calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income as an indicator of our operating performance. See the table below, which presents reconciliations of these measures to the GAAP equivalent financial measure, which is net income. We have presented EBITDA as a supplemental disclosure because we believe that, when considered with measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, EBITDA gives investors a more complete understanding of our operating results before the impact of investing and financing transactions and income taxes, and it is a widely used measure of performance and basis for valuation of companies in our industry. Other companies that provide EBITDA information may calculate EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do. We have presented Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental disclosure because we believe it enables investors to understand and assess our core operating results excluding the effect of these items and is useful to investors in allowing greater transparency related to a significant measure used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. Adjusted EBITDA has economic substance because it is used by management as a performance measure to analyze the performance of our business and provides a perspective on the current effects of operating decisions.\n\nAbout Canterbury Park\n\nCanterbury Park Holding Corporation (Nasdaq: CPHC) owns and operates Canterbury Park Racetrack and Casino in Shakopee, Minnesota, the only thoroughbred and quarter horse racing facility in the State. The Company generally offers live racing from May to September. The Casino hosts card games 24 hours a day, seven days a week, dealing both poker and table games. The Company also conducts year-round wagering on simulcast horse racing and hosts a variety of other entertainment and special events at its Shakopee facility. The Company is also pursuing a strategy to enhance shareholder value by the ongoing development of approximately 140 acres of underutilized land surrounding the Racetrack that was originally designated for a project known as Canterbury Commons\u2122. The Company is pursuing several mixed-use development opportunities for the remaining underutilized land, directly and through joint ventures.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest income (net of interest expense), income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, as well as excluding stock-based compensation (which includes our 401(k) match expense as this match occurs in Company stock), gain on insurance proceeds relating to equity investments, depreciation and amortization related to equity investments and interest expense related to equity investments. Neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA is a measure of performance calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income as an indicator of our operating performance. See the table below, which presents reconciliations of these measures to the GAAP equivalent financial measure, which is net income. We have presented EBITDA as a supplemental disclosure because we believe that, when considered with measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, EBITDA gives investors a more complete understanding of our operating results before the impact of investing and financing transactions and income taxes, and it is a widely used measure of performance and basis for valuation of companies in our industry. Other companies that provide EBITDA information may calculate EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do. We have presented Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental disclosure because we believe it enables investors to understand and assess our core operating results excluding the effect of these items and is useful to investors in allowing greater transparency related to a significant measure used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. Adjusted EBITDA has economic substance because it is used by management as a performance measure to analyze the performance of our business and provides a perspective on the current effects of operating decisions.\n\nAbout Canterbury Park\n\nCanterbury Park Holding Corporation (Nasdaq: CPHC) owns and operates Canterbury Park Racetrack and Casino in Shakopee, Minnesota, the only thoroughbred and quarter horse racing facility in the State.

Non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from, a substitute for, or superior to GAAP results. Definitions, disclosures, and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial information are included later in the release. Adjusted EBITDA margin is Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenues.Management CommentaryCanterbury delivered strong first quarter 2024 financial results, with net revenues increasing 6.0% to $14.1 million and Adjusted EBITDA rising 14.0% to $3.2 million. The year over year revenue increase reflects the benefit from significantly better weather in the 2024 first quarter period compared to the same period in 2023. The adjusted EBITDA margin of 22.8% in the quarter demonstrates our fiscal discipline and the success of our initiatives to optimize operations as we continue to track well above historical adjusted EBITDA margin levels.\n\nWe generated revenue growth across each of our reporting segments in the quarter including a 3.5% increase in Casino revenues as we extended the positive Casino revenue trends that we saw during the last months of 2023. The collective 17.0% increase in Food and Beverage and Other revenues primarily reflects the benefits of our initiatives to position our event center as a leading destination for events of all sizes in the region. While this effort is off to a very strong start, we believe there remains a significant opportunity to grow the awareness and appreciation for our hospitality offerings to deliver even higher financial performance. Pari-mutuel results rose year-over-year primarily due to milder weather and our continued efforts to optimize the operations for this portion of our business.\n\nDevelopment at Canterbury Commons continues to significantly transform the lifestyle experience at the property and is proving out our long-term vision for establishing a regional ~Live, Work, Stay, and Play' destination. Development of Swervo Development Corporation's (Swervo) amphitheater continues on schedule and recently, Greystone filed an application for a second 28,000 square foot commercial office building within the Winner's Circle site that is expected to add additional daytime population and a mix of uses to Canterbury. This project would join the already under construction 10,000 square foot commercial building that will be home to BBQ and pizza restaurants and a fitness center. In addition, we are making consistent progress on our barn relocation project and are looking forward to beginning work later this year on a new road that will allow us to unlock approximately 20 additional acres of land that would provide economic upside for Canterbury and our shareholders.\n\nAs we continue to optimize our operations and are positioned to benefit from the full potential that will be unlocked by the development of Canterbury Commons, we remain equally focused on exploring additional opportunities to create new value for our shareholders. Recently, the Minnesota Racing Commission approved the introduction of 500 on-track ADW historical horse racing terminals at Canterbury Park effective May 21, 2024. This entertainment option would offer our guests the ability to wager on historical horse racing outcomes similar to what is available in multiple jurisdictions. While this approval is currently the subject of a legal challenge and state legislative efforts, we remain fully committed to advocate for the ability to bring new gaming and wagering opportunities, including sports wagering, to Canterbury Park. Expanding the gaming offerings at Canterbury Park would benefit our shareholders and importantly help us secure the long-term viability of Minnesota's horse racing industry, which supports thousands of jobs and generates approximately $400 million in economic benefits to the State. With our solid balance sheet and consistent cash flow generation, we are positioned to return capital to shareholders through our quarterly cash dividend and to continue executing on our strategies to deliver long-term growth.\n\nCanterbury Commons Development UpdateSwervo continues to make progress on the construction of its state-of-the-art amphitheater which is expected to open in 2025. The Company's barn relocation and redevelopment plan is also underway and is on track for completion in 2025. Canterbury expects to begin work this summer on the road adjacent to the amphitheater which will unlock the development potential of over 20 acres of land in that portion of the site.\n\nResidential and commercial construction updates related to joint ventures include:\n\nResidential and commercial construction updates related to prior land sales include:\n\nDeveloper and partner selection for the remaining 40 acres of Canterbury Commons, including 20 acres that will become available for development following the completion of the new road noted above, continues. Additional uses could include office, retail, hotel and restaurants.\n\nSummary of 2024 First Quarter Operating ResultsNet revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2024, increased 6.0% to $14.1 million, compared to $13.3 million in the same period last year. The year-over-year improvement reflects growth of 3.5% in Casino revenues, 3.6% in Pari-mutuel revenues, 17.5% in Food and Beverage revenues and 15.4% in Other revenues. The year-over-year increases are primarily the result of unusually mild winter weather and strong attendance at events and entertainment offerings that occurred during the quarter.\n\nOperating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2024, were $12.3 million, an increase of $590,000, or 5.0%, compared to operating expenses of $11.7 million for the same period in 2023. The year-over-year increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by higher labor and contracted services costs as well as increased costs across the business due to the current continued inflationary environment.\n\nThe Company recorded a net loss of $852,000 and a net gain of $1.9 million from equity investments for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 2024 first quarter loss is primarily related to its share of depreciation, amortization and interest expense from the Doran Canterbury joint ventures while the 2023 first quarter gain is related to insurance proceeds received related to a claim by the joint venture against a third-party developer.\n\nThe Company recorded income tax expense of $0.5 million and $1.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, resulting in an effective tax rate of 31.1% and 27.3%, respectively.\n\nThe Company recorded net income of $1.0 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.20 for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The Company recorded net income of $2.8 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.56 for the three months ended March 31, 2023.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, increased 14.0% year-over-year to $3.2 million in the 2024 first quarter, compared to $2.8 million in the 2023 first quarter.\n\nAdditional Financial InformationFurther financial information for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024, is presented in the accompanying tables at the end of this press release. Additional information will be provided in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on or about May 10, 2024.\n\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresTo supplement our financial statements, we also provide investors with information about our EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, each of which is a non-GAAP measure, and which exclude certain items from net income, a GAAP measure.

Plus, so many of the best things to do in Canterbury are all within walking distance in and from the city centre. This makes it a perfect city in England by foot; well, once you get there that is.\n\nOver the years, we've visited Canterbury countless times; and it has steeped in history. For instance, people have lived here since Paleolithic times and, even in more recent years, the Romans. This all makes it a perfect city to visit if you're interested in British history.\n\nNot only that, Canterbury is a mere stone's throw from London, taking around 70 minutes by train. This all means you can easily visit for a day whilst visiting the best places in London.\n\nSo, to help you on your way, I'm sharing the top places in Canterbury that you have to visit. This way, you can focus on the all-important exploring. Have an amazing time visiting Canterbury.\n\nAfter arriving at either Canterbury East or West train station, make sure to stroll into the centre of the city and visit Canterbury Cathedral. It's easily one of the best things to do in Canterbury, especially if you want to explore some of the Norman history from the city itself.\n\nNow, you will need to grab these tickets to enter Canterbury Cathedral but it's worth it for sure. Not only that, you'll get to explore Chapter House and the Great Cloister with this ticket.\n\nOnce inside, you'll get to visit the northwest transept where Thomas Becket was martyred and Trinity Chapel, which dates back almost 1,000 years.\n\nA visit will take around 90 minutes and is well worth visiting whilst in Canterbury.\n\nWestgate Gardens is a beautiful place for a stroll, that's right on the banks of the Great Stour River. It's so beautiful and the grounds are kept pristine.\n\nNow, a walk around Westgate Gardens will take about 20 minutes. It's quite small, but perfect if you want some time away from the historic streets of Canterbury itself.\n\nDon't forget, you can easily partner a visit to Westgate Gardens with Westgate Towers Museum.

Once here, you'll get to see the remains of the under-floor heating that Romans perfected., Plus, you'll get to see so many Roman mosaics that are incredibly well-preserved.\n\nA visit will take around 75 minutes and can easily be visited whilst walking the city centre of Canterbury.\n\nBuilt back in the 6th Century, the ruins of St Augustine's Abbey can't be missed when visiting Canterbury. Now, entry costs around \u00a37-10 but it's so worth it whilst in the city, especially as this is the very point where Christianity 'started' in England.\n\nHonestly, even if you're not religious, it's a site that can't be missed as it's one of the most important religious sites in all of Great Britain. Once here, you'll get to wander around the ruins and learn so much about the abbey's influence and importance across all of England.\n\nAfter exploring the ruins of St Augustine's Abbey, make sure to visit nearby St Martin's Church. Yes, it might be small and quite quiet, but this site is hugely important; historically at least.\n\nDating back to the 6th Century, it's the oldest, continually-used, English-speaking church worldwide.\n\nA visit will only take around 10 minutes and easily be visited after exploring St Augustine's Abbey.\n\nOnce upon a time, long ago, Canterbury was a protected city with vast walls that kept its residents safe. Nowadays, the ruins of Canterbury City Walls are well worth seeing, especially if you're already near Canterbury East train station.\n\nTucked away on the High Street, the Beaney House of Art and Knowledge is easily one of the best things to do in Canterbury.\n\nYou see, you'll be able to head inside this 1800s building that houses heaps of local and international artist exhibits that are totally free to see.\n\nIt's the perfect little spot to visit, especially if you're already in the city centre of Canterbury. Visits will take around 30 minutes.\n\nI know I keep harking on about historical sites in Canterbury, but there are honestly so many to see; especially the Norman castle that's ruins still stand within the city itself.\n\nPerched on Castle Street, visiting the castle is one of the best things to do in Canterbury when walking from Canterbury East Train Station.

There were originally only three of these, with Canterbury being one of them.\n\nJust a heads up, at the moment, there is lots of work being undertaken to make the ruins safe to visit.

It's similar to Punting in Cambridge, where you'll get pushed with a stick on a boat trip around the historic centre of Canterbury.\n\nNow, if you're visiting at peak times, make sure to book your punting experience online before visiting. They only have a limited number of punts and you don't want them to be sold out when you visit.\n\nYou can easily choose to join a shared punt (around \u00a310-30) or opt for a private punt (around \u00a3100-\u00a3150). Both are great options, it just really depends on what type of experience you want.\n\nIf you're visiting the wider area around Canterbury, make sure to stop off at Chilham. It's a quaint, and very small village that's a perfect stopping point at lunchtime.\n\nFilled with timber-framed houses and a few little streets, you'll easily stroll around the whole village within 15 minutes. That being said, it's lovely and quaint and they have some great places for lunch, too.\n\nOnce here, stop off at the Church Mouse Tea Rooms for their delicious, homemade, scones. It's so cosy and one spot not to miss if you've worked up an appetite.\n\nAlso, don't forget about the White Horse for a local brew. It's a cosy, and pretty quirky little spot that's perfect for whetting one's whistle.\n\nRead more: Best places in the south of England", "source": {"uri": "todayheadline.co", "dataType": "news",

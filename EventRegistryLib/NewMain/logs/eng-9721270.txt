You never think it is going to happen.

That was the winning shot, really. It was a good shot and it was a bit heartbreaking.\"\n\nAsked if he had spoken to McIlroy about it when they were teammates on Europe's Ryder Cup side two months later, MacIntyre added: \"I asked him one question at some point during the party.\n\n\"I had not spoken to him at all about it since the day it happened, and I always wanted to ask him about the putt (on 18). He thought he had missed it and it went in. So it just shows you, it doesn't have to be perfect for it to work out.\"\n\nMacIntyre's decision to take up his PGA Tour card this season certainly did not look like working out earlier this year, the left-hander openly admitting he was struggling to adapt to being away from home before benefiting hugely from a three-week spell back in Scotland.\n\nRobert MacIntyre tees off on the 14th hole during the final round of the 2023 Genesis Scottish Open at The Renaissance Club in United Kingdom.

I'll maybe take a house for maybe a month, two months when I'm there.\n\n\"I've joined Isleworth so that will always be a place I go and practise in the wintertime, but there's nothing like home. Scotland, this is where I want to be.\"\n\nMacIntyre admitted he was a bundle of nerves when he played alongside McIlroy in the Scottish Open in 2019, but it will be a different story when the pair are joined by Ryder Cup teammate Viktor Hovland for the first two rounds this week.\n\n\"Obviously with the Ryder Cup, being part of a team, I know him a lot better personally,\" MacIntyre said.\n\n\"I'm still miles away from being one of his close pals, but I feel like if I ever need anything or ever want to ask a question, I can pick up the phone and ask. And Viktor I've known since we were 14, 15 years old playing boys' golf.\n\n\"This is probably the most calm I've been (coming into a Scottish Open). It's not been as frantic. Things have been under control. Yeah, my game has been up and down but it's been up and down my whole golfing life.\n\n\"But this is the one that, as a Scot, I really want.\n\n\"Last year I came really close but there may not be another opportunity like that in my career playing golf.

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nBob MacIntyre reckons Andy Murray is an inspiration. But the Oban star is trying to turn down the racket ahead of his big homecoming.\n\nMacIntyre and his European Ryder Cup pals were guests at Wimbledon ahead of the Genesis Scottish Open. He paid tribute to two-time champion Murray, who made his farewell appearance last week. MacIntyre said: \"It's been brilliant for me to watch him and he's an inspiration to not just myself, but many others. Injuries come to most athletes and it's just a shame the way he's gone out, but look at what he's done for British tennis and Scottish tennis.\"\n\nThe Oban ace admits he can't wait for the Claret Jug crack at Royal Troon. And MacIntyre says the next best thing to Major success would be going one better at this year's Renaissance spectacular. The home hero is gearing up for a fabulous double header on his own turf.\n\nVictory in the Canadian Open on the PGA Tour has rocketed expectations around MacIntyre. Having finished in the Top 10 twice in four Open attempts, he's a contender.\n\nBut MacIntyre said: \"I've been working hard on trying to lower the noise around it. I'm going there to perform. All I can do is try to compete as hard as I can and if I do that well, we'll be there or thereabouts. I've only ever played Troon once before and that was just the other day, so I'm looking forward to playing another Major.\"\n\nMacIntyre's first job is in East Lothian as he aims to better his runner-up finish behind Rory McIlroy 12 months ago. He told BBC: \"It was a dream of mine, if I was ever a professional golfer, to compete in a Scottish Open. And, if I could compete in it, I'm going there to win. I'd love to win a Scottish Open.

That was the winning shot, really. But it was a bit heartbreaking.\"\n\nA lot has happened to MacIntyre since that agonising near miss on home turf a year ago. He's made a winning debut in the Ryder Cup, earned his playing rights for the PGA Tour, re-located to the USA and claimed a breakthrough victory on the toughest circuit in the world at the Canadian Open.\n\nEarlier this week, he got to savour another new, eye-opening experience as he hobnobbed with the great and the good in the Royal box at Wimbledon. It's not a bad old life, eh?\n\n\"When I first got the invitation, I was going to say 'no' because it was this (Scottish Open) week but then I thought it was potentially a once-in-a-lifetime experience,\" said MacIntyre, who was pictured supping a cup of tea with the kind of posh pinkie that would've earned a nod of approval from His Royal Highness himself. Providing MacIntyre didn't then slooter it down his tie, of course.\n\n\"I had front row seats,\" he added. \"It was so fast and seeing the athleticism in tennis made me realise that I'd picked the right sport.\"\n\nAll joking aside, MacIntyre is looking to serve up something of an ace himself this week. For the home contingent, the Scottish Open continues to stir the senses and rouse the spirits.\n\nMacIntyre, who is out in the marquee group with McIlroy and Norway's Viktor Hovland for the opening two rounds, is coming into the week in a tranquil, contented frame of mind despite the hype and the heightened expectation.\n\n\"This is probably the most calm I've been,\" said MacIntyre, who admitted he was a bundle of nerves when he first got paired with McIlroy as a rookie in the Scottish Open back in 2019.\n\n\"It's not been as frantic. Things have been under control. Yes, my game has been up-and-down but it's been up-and-down my whole golfing life. This is the one (title) that as a Scot, I really want.\n\n\"Last year, I came really close but there may not be another opportunity like that in my career playing golf. I've just got to try and play it as another event and give it my absolute best, which I will do.\"\n\nWhatever happens this week, a sense of perspective will remain a valuable club in the bag. It's only a game, after all.\n\nDuring yesterday's Pro-Am, for instance, he met Scott Stewart, the Campbelltown man who was diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease last year.\n\n\"It's heartbreaking when you actually see it up close,\" said MacIntyre, who carries the Doddie Weir Foundation livery on his golf bag to aid the MND cause. \"He's speaking to you as a normal guy, and he's going through one of the worst things I could ever imagine.\"\n\nWith two massive events on home soil over the next fortnight - the small matter of an Open at Royal Troon is hurtling towards us - MacIntyre couldn't be happier to be back on Scottish terrain.\n\nHis struggles to adapt to the US way of life have been well-documented this season but having found his feet, and earned an exemption with that thrilling victory in Canada, the 27-year-old revealed that he will be adopting a new approach to his golfing travels.\n\n\"My rent is up on my Florida house at the end of August, and I don't think I'll be getting it renewed to be honest,\" he said of his temporary base in the USA.\n\n\"I'm still going to play over there, I'm just not going to pay a lot of money for a rental that I'm not staying in.

It was a fitting finale to an epic battle for glory with home favourite Robert MacIntyre.\n\nWhile the race for the Claret Jug the following week at Hoylake became a procession for Brian Harman, the Scottish Open had viewers on the edge of their seat until the final putt dropped.\n\nA world-class field once again descends on North Berwick for the co-sanctioned PGA Tour and DP World Tour event, with defending champion McIlroy topping the bill.\n\nThe heroics of his first win in Scotland are of course a far cry from the crestfallen McIlroy who was last seen on a golf course almost a month ago, when the US Open was in his grasp before a catastrophic finish prolonged his 10-year major drought and allowed Bryson DeChambeau to snatch the title.\n\nMcIlroy, no stranger to the glare of the spotlight, will have the eyes of the golf world on him on his return to action, with The Open tantalisingly beckoning next week.\n\nThe Scottish Open tees off a fortnight of golfing nirvana. North Berwick on Scotland's east coast and Royal Troon, roughly 100 miles away on the west, will be the centre of the universe over the next two weeks.\n\nSix of the world's top 10, new US PGA champion Xander Schauffele among them, are in a stellar cast list at The Renaissance Club.\n\nIn a canny move by organisers, McIlroy is joined by MacIntyre and another Ryder Cup star, Viktor Hovland, in a European super grouping for Thursday and Friday.\n\nAnd how about Swedish sensation Ludvig Aberg, former Masters champion Hideki Matsuyama, and former Open champion Collin Morikawa for another trio worth following?\n\nBoasting a $9m (\u00a37m) prize fund, the Scottish Open also provides an ideal opportunity to acclimatise to the intricacies and undulations of links golf before The Open.\n\nAnd then there's the weather. American visitors may well learn a new word in the next few days - 'drookit'. Rain - lots of it - is forecast. Mercifully for the players, winds are expected to be relatively tame, at around the 10mph mark.\n\nWhatever the elements, an appreciative crowd awaits, as acknowledged by 2022 Scottish Open winner Schauffele.\n\n\"Not that all fans don't appreciate golf, but there's a deeper appreciation here. They know what a good shot looks like,\" said the American.\n\n\"It feels like in the US, a few times we get a lot of rain and wind, the course is pretty empty.\n\n\"It could be blowing 25mph and rain here and people will be right by your side in shorts and T-shirt and loving every second of it. That's the appreciation they have for golf and it's awesome to have fans wear the weather with you.\"\n\nFellow American Stewart Cink - the 2009 Open champion - is even giving a senior major - the Kaulig Companies Championship - a miss this week to instead tee it up at Renaissance.\n\n\"I just love coming to Scotland and part of me thinks I should have been born here,\" Cink, 51, told BBC Scotland.\n\n\"It's very important to come and play [before The Open]. Conditions are different, the air treats the ball differently, everything is just a little different. You have to get your body acclimated and its good to get used to the turf and the strike and the distance control.\"\n\nAfter coming so agonisingly close 12 months ago, MacIntyre is \"going there to win\" this year.\n\nThe 27-year-old is now a PGA Tour champion, having memorably triumphed at the Canadian Open last month with dad Dougie on the bag, but the Oban native relishes few things more than playing in front of a home crowd.\n\nHe is not the only Scot making a serious impact. Ewen Ferguson heads to East Lothian fresh from winning the DP World Tour's BMW International Open on Sunday, his first title in two years.\n\nThat success has earned Ferguson, 28, entry to The Open, as well as an eye-catching grouping alongside Jordan Spieth and Matt Fitzpatrick for the first two days in North Berwick.\n\nThere are two further Royal Troon spots up for grabs this week.\n\nIn all, there are seven Scots in the Scottish Open field. Might one of them reign in the rain to become the first home winner since Colin Montgomerie 25 years ago?", "source": {"uri": "bbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BBC"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nBob MacIntyre is quitting his American home and admits he'll only forgive Rory McIlroy once he wins a Scottish Open.\n\nThe Oban star says he'll give up his Florida base at the end of next month and will commute from Scotland for future PGA Tour events. MacIntyre headed for Orlando after earning a place on the circuit Stateside, but has altered plan and will now end the lease. He said: \"My rent is up about the end of August and I don't think I'll be getting it renewed, to be honest. Scotland is my home. Isleworth (in Florida) will always be a place I go and practice in the wintertime, but there's nothing like home, Scotland. This is where I want to be. I'm still going to play over there. I'll maybe take a house for maybe a month, two months when I'm there.\n\n\"Winter in Scotland is not the prettiest, so if I want to compete against the best in the world that are practising in good conditions, good weather, yes, I've got the opportunity to do that. The lifestyle is completely different to back here in Scotland and it was a struggle.\n\n\"Hawaii is the first event of the season. Starts January 2nd. I am preparing as good as I can in Oban from December to January. So there's going to be a time where you have to go maybe a month there, which is probably fine. It's not a big thing. The only thing I'm changing is I'm not going to be paying a lot of rent.\"\n\nMacIntyre is back at Renaissance aiming to go one better than 12 months ago when agonisingly beaten by his buddy McIlroy. The Northern Irishman had a plaque laid on the 18th fairway for his approach to the 72nd hole of the tournament, but the Scot got only pain and quipped: \"I don't think I'll ever forgive him if I don't win a Scottish Open!\n\n\"I've never even seen the plaque. It was an incredible golf shot he hit. That was a winning shot, really. He thought he had missed the putt and, obviously, it kept going and went straight in. It was a bit heartbreaking. At some point during the (Ryder Cup) party, I'd not spoken to him at all about it since the day it happened and I always wanted to ask him about the putt. It just shows you. It doesn't have to be perfect for it to work out.\"\n\nMacIntyre and McIlroy will play the first two days together and, while he was nervous paired with him in 2019, he's at home amongst the elite now. The Scot's build-up has been calm and included an invite into the Royal Box at Wimbledon on Monday. MacIntyre explained: \"At first, I wasn't going to go, but when I thought about it, I was like: This is potentially a once-in-a-lifetime experience. And it was incredible.\n\n\"I didn't know who certain people were until someone told me, but seeing the level of athleticism in the tennis game, I knew it was fast, but I was literally front row, watching the men and women run about. I think I picked the right sport! This is probably the most calm I've been. It's not been as frantic. Things have been under control.\n\n\"My game has been up-and-down, but it's been up-and-down my whole golfing life. This is the one that, as a Scot, I really want.

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nBob MacIntyre was more Hawaii than Haddington.\n\nBut the Oban star just wants his golf to somehow outshout his loud shirts. MacIntyre lit up the Renaissance with both his play and his garish gear. The Scot and his playing partners Rory McIlroy and Viktor Hovland dazzled the day-one galleries in East Lothian. MacIntyre also dazzled the eyes with the latest jazzy number from his sponsors, Nike.\n\nHe joked not even superstar McIlroy could have pulled off wearing his blue blur of foliage and there's plenty more in the cupboard as he laughed: \"There's a few wild ones. I think this is actually quite tame compared to some of the ones I've been wearing already this year, especially the yellow one at the US Open. I pick this week. Next week will be scripted just so me, Rory and all that aren't wearing the same. I don't think Rory would pull this one off, and I'm not either!\n\n\"I might pull this back out in January if I get to Hawaii. You know what I am like. I've got the undertop on because I've not been wearing jumpers much and didn't want to have one on this week.\n\n\"If not, I'd probably have been out here in a short-sleeved shirt. I'd rather my golf did the talking than the shirt.\"\n\nMacIntyre's jovial outlook on the cloth matched his demeanour on the course. Relaxed and focused, he was completely at home alongside his Ryder Cup pals.\n\nIt was a far cry from 2019 when, playing alongside McIlroy and Rickie Fowler, a less-experienced MacIntyre was a nervous wreck. He said: \"I remember I stood on my first tee, the exact same one, and I could hardly get the ball on the tee.\n\n\"This time, my hands were calm and I knew exactly what I was doing. This isn't coming from some magic potion. It's all from experience.\n\n\"I'm 27 and going to be 28 soon. I've got a long career ahead of me and just have to keep learning from everything I do.\"\n\nInstead of being crushed by expectation with the massive crowds, he savoured the situation and continued: \"Aye. It was great. Scottish fans are always kind to me, but the support over the time I've turned pro has been unbelievable.\n\n\"Hopefully I can keep doing them proud throughout my career. They might get lucky to watch me win, but I'm here to perform and all I can do is control myself.\n\n\"I've known Viktor since we were 13 or 14 year old and, obviously, Rory since I came out here in 2019. Two good guys and I've grown a lot closer to them since the Ryder Cup.\n\n\"When you are out with good players, they might hit a certain shot into a pin and it makes you go : That's the way I need to play it. It actually makes life a bit easier.\"\n\nThe calmness belied the clobber and MacIntyre explained: \"To be honest, it's the way I have been playing lately and it's the way I play my best. I am happy in life and that's all you need, really. The game of golf is a job, but, at the end of the day, whether it is good or bad, it's not going to change me.\n\n\"Yes, it might make me work harder at certain points, but I know how good I am and what I can do. It's just about letting it happen.\n\n\"I've had a lot of experiences this year. Myrtle Beach, for example, when I had the chance to win and I made a mistake by pushing to try and win a tournament. I got down on myself as a result of that.\n\n\"Then, in the PGA, I kind of hung in there, had a bit of fun with Mike [Burrow, his caddie] and got the result at the end. It just made me realise that, if I get down on myself and get annoyed and uptight, it ain't helping my golf.\n\n\"So it's the one thing I've really tried to work on. It's about letting the golf happen.\"\n\nIt wasn't all plain sailing. One brutal tug saw him land a ball on the 14th green when he was aiming for the 12th.\n\nAdam Scott and Fowler were in the threeball who had to wait for him to get out of the way. MacIntyre kept that cool head and laughed: \"I was on the 14th green twice. It just went in the wind.\n\n\"You can't [play it off the green] and I thought you could. I asked the rules official, but he said no and I had to take a drop.\n\n\"When he came over, I was praying I was going the way I went as it got me on to a slight upslope and back into the wind. The shot was over a wall, but it was fairly easy.\"\n\nIn the end, MacIntyre's 67, which was the same as Hovland, was two worse than McIlroy. It was only one worse at the end 12 months ago when he was pipped to the title, but he said: \"It wasn't mentioned.\n\n\"I've spent quite a bit of time with him since then and, obviously from The Ryder Cup, I've got to know him personally. He's a good guy. I get on really well with him.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailyrecord.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Record"}, "authors": [{"uri": "craig_swan@dailyrecord.co.uk", "name": "Craig Swan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Hovland", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Hovland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Lothian", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "East Lothian"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East Lothian"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Renaissance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nike, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haddington,_East_Lothian", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Haddington, East Lothian"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Haddington, East Lothian"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oban", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oban"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oban"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickie_Fowler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rickie Fowler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Scott_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adam Scott (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sailing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myrtle_Beach,_South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Myrtle Beach, South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Myrtle Beach, South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article33222617.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_2024-Genesis-Scottish-Open.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721270", "eventUri": "eng-9721270", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

champ MacIntyre, of Oban, Argyll, said: \"I try to support as many charities as I can and the foundation became a strong one for me in 2019.\n\n\"Guys were doing a lot of stuff for Doddie within golf and I thought it was unbelievable.\"\n\nThe home favourite -- who was pipped to last year's Genesis Scottish Open title by McIlroy in a thrilling finish -- wore a cap in the foundation's tartan for the fun pro-am tourney.", "source": {"uri": "thescottishsun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Scottish Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "colan_lamont@thescottishsun.co.uk", "name": "Colan Lamont",

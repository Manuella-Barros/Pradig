Wade in 2022, leaving individual states to choose their legal status on abortion, access to women's health care has waned. While several states have rolled out abortion bans, growing concern over access to contraceptives and abortion continue.\n\nAccording to James' lawsuit, Heartbeat International, an anti-abortion group, and the Crisis Pregnancy Centers allegedly used false and misleading claims in an effort to \"convince pregnant people to get the abortion pill reversal (APR) treatment.\"\n\n\"Attorney General James alleges that making false and misleading claims about APR to convince pregnant people to get the treatment constitutes fraud, deceptive business practices, and false advertising under New York law,\" James' office said in a press release emailed to Newsweek.\n\nNewsweek has reached out to Heartbeat International via email for comment.\n\nAn APR procedure involves a woman who has changed her mind about aborting a pregnancy after taking mifepristone, the first part of a two-drug regimen used for medication abortion, which is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to terminate pregnancy in the first 10 weeks.\n\nAPR involves taking progesterone to offset the effects of mifepristone. However, the course of action has not been approved by the FDA. Additionally, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has said the method is \"not based on science and do not meet clinical standards.\"\n\nOn Monday, James took to X, formerly Twitter, to announce the lawsuit as she warned of the potential danger the treatment can be as abortions cannot be reversed.\n\n\"I'm suing @HeartbeatIntl and 11 crisis pregnancy centers across New York for illegally advertising and promoting an abortion reversal treatment. Abortions cannot be reversed, and this treatment could be incredibly dangerous,\" James wrote on X.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, the crisis pregnancy centers throughout the state advertise the abortion pill reversal method on their websites and through social media. James alleges that some of the centers \"appear to offer or facilitate APR treatment on-site at their offices, while others direct people to obtain APR treatment through Heartbeat's Abortion Pill Rescue Network.\"\n\n\"Abortions cannot be reversed. Any treatments that claim to do so are made without scientific evidence and could be unsafe,\"James said in a statement. \"Heartbeat International and the other crisis pregnancy center defendants are spreading dangerous misinformation by advertising 'abortion pill reversal' without any medical and scientific proof.\n\n\"Amid the increase in attacks on reproductive health care nationwide, we must protect pregnant people's right to make safe, well-informed decisions about their health.

Any treatments that claim to do so are made without scientific evidence and could be unsafe,\" James said in a press statement. \"Amid the increase in attacks on reproductive health care nationwide, we must protect pregnant people's right to make safe, well-informed decisions about their health.\"\n\nMedication abortion works by taking two different chemicals, mifepristone and misoprostol. Mifepristone is a progesterone-blocking agent that essentially cuts off biological support from the mother to the developing fetus. Within 24 to 48 hours of taking mifepristone, the abortion patient is instructed to take four misoprostol pills to induce contractions to expel the fetal remains and other pregnancy tissue.\n\nAnti-abortion organizations, including the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, support the mifepristone abortion reversal protocol of ingesting a high dose of natural progesterone.\n\nHowever, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, a group that supports abortion rights, condemns abortion reversal as \"unproven and unethical\" due to a lack of scientific studies showing the efficacy of the protocols.\n\nA 2012 study that was not reviewed by a human-subjects ethics committee found that four of the six pregnant women who took progesterone after mifepristone continued their pregnancies. Subsequent studies that were more closely monitored for safety and efficacy were canceled due to ethical and safety concerns.\n\nAnother study conducted in 2016 demonstrated very low success of abortion reversal, depending upon the gestational age and the time between the progesterone and original mifepristone dose.\n\nDespite the dearth of scientific study support, AAPLOG argues that the use of progesterone to reverse mifepristone is \"a simple application of common sense.\"\n\n\"Using natural progesterone to reverse mifepristone effects is a logical extension of understanding the biochemical mechanism of action of mifepristone,\" an AAPLOG guidance on the reversal protocol reads.\n\nAnti-abortion organizations also cite the comparatively small sample of women who choose abortion reversal as a reason for the limited scientific support for the theoretical treatment protocol.\n\nA spokesperson for Heartbeat International told the Washington Examiner that the lawsuit is \"a clear attempt to censor speech, leaving women who regret their chemical abortions in the dark, and ultimately forcing them to complete an abortion they no longer want.\"\n\n\"By singling out these organizations solely because they offer an alternative to abortion, she is not only violating their rights but also denying women access to care and support as they seek to try and continue their pregnancies,\" the spokesperson of James's lawsuit said.\n\nJames said that she aimed to protect patients.\n\n\"Your reproductive health care decisions are yours and yours alone, and my office will always protect New Yorkers from those who push a scientifically unproven and potentially life-threatening intervention,\" James said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nAccess to mifepristone has been under the microscope amid legal challenges to the Food and Drug Administration's deregulation of the abortion agent during the COVID-19 pandemic, removing requirements for patients to be examined physically by a physician prior to administration of the pill.\n\nThe Supreme Court heard oral arguments about the FDA's approval of the drug in March.

Several surveys have found evidence that the drug can be effective at halting a medicated abortion.\n\nDownplaying that evidence by pointing to scientific disputes over the studies in question, James in her filing alleged that there is \"no competent and reliable scientific evidence\" to support the abortion pill reversal procedure.\n\nThe defendants \"distort the evidence and mislead New Yorkers\" with claims about the effectiveness and safety of abortion pill reversal, James argued.\n\nThe filing asks that the defendants be ordered to \"remove from their websites, social media accounts, and other promotional materials\" their claims about abortion pill reversal, that they be fined thousands of dollars for their purported violations of state law, and that they be prohibited from making similar claims in the future about abortion pill reversal.\n\nIn a statement announcing the filing, James claimed that abortions \"cannot be reversed.\"\n\nThe state \"must protect pregnant [women's] right to make safe, well-informed decisions about their health,\" she argued in the press release.\n\nThis is not the first time that abortion pill reversal has been targeted by pro-abortion politicians and government officials.\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Rob Bonta in September 2023 sued five pro-life pregnancy centers and Heartbeat International, accusing them of utilizing fraudulent and misleading statements when advertising the abortion pill reversal drug.\n\nIn April 2023, meanwhile, Colorado enacted several new pro-abortion laws including a ban on abortion pill reversal treatments.\n\nA mother-and-daughter team of Catholic nurse practitioners brought suit against the Colorado law in October in order to be allowed to continue their ministry helping women reverse unwanted chemical abortions.\n\nA judge quickly issued an injunction against the reversal ban, allowing the women to continue their medical practice while the lawsuit plays out in court.",

Prosecutors say the centers are falsely promoting what they call \"Abortion Pill Reversal,\" an unproven protocol that they claim can reverse a medication abortion.\n\n\"Abortions cannot be reversed, and this treatment could be incredibly dangerous,\" James said in a statement. \"They claim the treatment is safe and effective, but there's no scientific proof and medical experts warn that it's unsafe.\"\n\nMedication abortion typically requires a two-drug regimen: a dose of mifepristone, which blocks a pregnancy-related hormone called progesterone, followed 24 to 48 hours later by a dose of misoprostol, which causes cramping and empties the uterus.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Heartbeat International and the other defendants seek to persuade pregnant people to skip the second drug and instead take progesterone to supposedly \"reverse\" the process.\n\nHowever, there's no scientific evidence to support the procedure, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.\n\nAn investigation by ACOG concluded that several studies cited by the groups relied on flawed data and highly imprecise methodology.\n\nFor instance, a 2020 study intended to evaluate the procedure was halted early due to safety concerns, after three patients experienced \"severe hemorrhage requiring ambulance transport.\"\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Rob Bonta (D) filed a similar lawsuit against Heartbeat International last September. Colorado banned the unproven treatment in April 2023, the first such action in the country, but a federal judge blocked the state from enforcing the ban hours after it was signed.\n\nIn a statement, Heartbeat International said it is countersuing James \"for egregious violations of fundamental rights, including freedom of speech, free exercise of religion, equal protection under the law, and civil rights violations.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbeat_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Heartbeat International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letitia_James", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Letitia James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Medical abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_of_New_York", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attorney General of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_pregnancy_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crisis pregnancy center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progesterone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Progesterone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Treaty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_College_of_Obstetricians_and_Gynecologists", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misoprostol", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Misoprostol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mifepristone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mifepristone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uterus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hormone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attorney General of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Bonta", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rob Bonta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Protection_Clause", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equal Protection Clause"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fundamental rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Substance_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Substance Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Drugs_and_Alcohol", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Drugs and Alcohol", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/1d6de5e778a8165e0b31d89e10e84a20", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543922", "eventUri": "eng-9543922", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 452726665, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 13, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 13}}}

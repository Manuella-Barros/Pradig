The 43-year-old father was remanded in custody after a brief hearing at Tuen Mun Court on Saturday. He did not ask to be bailed until the case was heard again next month. Acting Principal Magistrate Daniel Tang Siu-hung said prosecutors needed to decide whether the man was fit to enter a plea, and also hear from government psychiatrists if they had any recommendations as to how to proceed The defendant, only identified in court by his initials, \u201cWPT\u201d, was not required to speak apart from confirming he understood the four counts of attempted murder he was facing. A duty lawyer representing him said the father had tinnitus, or ringing in the ears, but did not require a hearing aid for the proceedings. The man allegedly attempted to kill his 44-year-old wife and three daughters, aged 13 to 16, inside a flat at Shan King Estate in Tuen Mun on June 26. He was arrested at around 6.23pm the same day, according to the indictment. A 51-year-old restaurant owner was also listed as a witness in the case.

Rogers and Alan Poul said in a statement. \u201cThey have supported us through thick and thin. Not only did they give us these two seasons, they said yes when we asked to end season one with a series of cliffhangers, and they said yes when we asked for two extra episodes so we could land the plane in the way J.T. had always envisioned.\u201d Rogers, a childhood friend of Adelstein, created the series, while Poul served as a director on the show. The series was laid out for two seasons with Max in its initial planning stages, with the show wrapping up its central arc to close Season 2, while also leaving room open for further stories in the \u201cTokyo Vice\u201d world. \u201cWe\u2019re grateful not only to Max, but to our partners Fifth Season, who sold the show around the world, and made it a global success story,\u201d the producers added. \u201cThey were in the trenches with us always, guaranteeing that we could make the show we wanted to make. The response from both the press and from fans, in particular to Season 2, has been overwhelming.

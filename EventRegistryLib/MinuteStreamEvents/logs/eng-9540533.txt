for by their own admission\n\nAll is not lost as MI's key India players for the upcoming T20 World Cup, Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav and Hardik Pandya would remain in focus for their individual form (Pic: AFP)\n\nA confident Sunrisers Hyderabad will look to produce a dominant show against a frail Mumbai Indians outfit and move up in the Indian Premier League points table when the two teams clash on Monday.\n\nPlaced fourth in the IPL points table with 12 points in 10 matches with six wins and four losses, SRH will be desperate to produce an all-round show and make improvements especially in their bowling department.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Pat Cummins-led side is in the midst of an intense battle between multiple teams who are bidding for spots in the final four, with Rajasthan Royals (16 points), Kolkata Knight Riders (14 points) and Lucknow Super Giants (12 points) placed above SRH.\n\nChennai Super Kings (5th with 10 points) and a resurgent Delhi Capitals (6th with 10 points) are breathing down SRH's neck, a scenario that would force the 2016 winners to shrug off any rust and get ready for an intense mid-table battle.\n\nIf a two-paced pitch at the Wankhede Stadium for the previous clash against KKR was an aberration, the free-flowing SRH batters would look to make merry and pile up a huge score as they have done several times this year.\n\nThe pitches here generally are batting-friendly and short boundary lengths at this venue make scores in excess of 200 a norm, but the MI-KKR contest played out on a sluggish surface last Friday challenged the batters to dig deep.\n\nAlso Read: Win or perish\n\nSRH would be high on confidence having pipped the table-toppers RR by just one run in their previous outing, a game in which their bowlers pulled off a thrilling win.\n\nTravis Head (396 runs), Abhishek Sharma (315) and Heinrich Klaasen (337) remain the enforcers in SRH's batting but South African Aiden Markram would be keen to make a big score of his own, having had a mixed run so far.\n\nNitish Kumar Reddy (219 runs) has emerged as one of the most promising players for SRH in last few games which takes a significant amount of pressure off the key batters.\n\nT Natarajan's (15 wickets) accuracy would be handy for SRH as the left-arm pacer is chasing Mumbai Indians' Jasprit Bumrah (17) for the purple cap.\n\nFive-time winners Mumbai slipped to the bottom of the pool again when Royal Challengers Bengaluru trumped Gujarat Titans on Saturday night.\n\nWith only three wins in 11 matches, MI's challenge is all but over and there is only \"pride and name\" left to play for by their own admission.\n\nHowever, all is not lost as MI's key India players for the upcoming T20 World Cup, Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav and Hardik Pandya would remain in focus for their individual form.\n\nRohit's all-out aggressive approach has not yielded many big scores whereas the world number 1 T20 batter Suryakumar would be eyeing consistency after a fine half-century against KKR a few nights ago.\n\nIndia vice-captain Pandya has being consistently on the receiving end due to his ordinary form with both bat and ball and also his on-field decisions as MI skipper.\n\nThe all-rounder, however, would be keen to make amends and put an end to the criticism that he has been facing ever since this IPL edition got underway.\n\nMumbai Indians: Hardik Pandya

Mumbai Indians won the IPL 2024 match by seven wickets.\n\n11: 02 PM: MI: 149/3 (16)\n\nSuryakumar-Tilak completes 100 runs stand. Mumbai Indians need 26 runs in 4 overs.\n\n10: 54 PM: MI: 128/3 (14)\n\nSuryakumar completes his fifty and Tilak, on the other hand, keeps rotating the strike. Mumbai Indians reach 128 runs after the completion of 14 overs.\n\n10: 42 PM: MI 105/3 (12)\n\nSuryakumar and Tilak take complete control of the match. The hosts are now 105 runs for the loss of three wickets after 12 overs.\n\n10: 32 PM: MI: 84/3 (10)\n\nSRH bowlers have no answers against Suryakumar and Tilak. The duo takes Mumbai to 84 runs after 10 overs.\n\n10: 20 PM: MI: 79/3 (8)\n\nSuryakumar Yadav and Tilak Varma backfire Hyderabad despite losing wickets in a quick session.\n\n10: 10 PM: MI: 52/3 (6)\n\nMumbai Indians' batsmen struggle to score runs against Sunrisers Hyderabad's pace. Naman departs soon after Rohit Sharma's dismissal.\n\n10: 00 PM: MI: 31/2 (4)\n\nCaptain Pat Cummins dismiss Rohit Sharma. Sunrisers Hyderabad are in total control of the match. Cummins bowl his first maiden over in the match.\n\n9: 50 PM: MI: 27/1 (2)\n\nIshan Kishan departs after a fiery start. Naman Dhir joins Rohit Sharma in the run chase of 174 runs.\n\n9:20 PM: 173/8 (20 overs)\n\nA Pat Cummins-cameo of '17-ball 35 takes Hyderabad to a fighting total. SRH post 173 at the end of 20 overs.\n\n9:07 PM: 153/8 (18.2 Overs)\n\nAbdul Samad gets LBW off Chawla's bowling. Mumbai continue to be on top as Pat Cummins is joined by impact player Sanvir Singh. Bumrah and Thushara in the middle for MI.\n\n8:58 PM: 122/6 (15.3 Overs)\n\nShahbaz Ahmed gets caught by Suryakumar Yadav off Pandya's delivery. MI on top of this contest as SRH go six down now. Abdul Samad comes into bat.\n\n8:42 PM: 103/5 (13.2 Overs)\n\nHeinrich Klaasen departs after getting cleaned up by Chawla. MI on a roll as SRH go five down now. Mumbai bring in most trusted pacer Jasprit Bumrah to seal the deal now.\n\n8:35 PM: 92/4 (11.1 Overs)\n\nHosts Mumbai on fire after Head and new batter Nitish Reddy walk back to the pavilion in the same over. After Chawla, it is Pandya who provides a breakthrough.\n\n8:28 PM: 82/2 (9 Overs)\n\n23-year-old all-rounder Anshul Kamboj is the cynosure of all eyes today at the Wankhede. After nearly getting Head out of the equation, the Australian has another lucky escape after being dropped by Nuwan Thushara. Kamboj finally strikes, as he clean-bowls Mayank Agarwal.\n\n8:16 PM: 66/2 (7 overs)\n\nBumrah and Kamboj get Mumbai crucial breakthroughs. Hyderabad still have in-form Head batting on 46 off 27.\n\n8:00 PM: 56/0 (6 Overs)\n\nMI debutant Anshul Kamboj gets the dangerous Travis Head, but it was adjudged a no-ball and Head manages to be off the hook for now. Is another of those Head's centuries underway tonight?\n\n7:57 PM: 29/0 (5 Overs)\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad making the most of the powerplay overs. They start steady with in-form openers Abhishek Sharma and Travis Head in the middle. It looks like a difficult batting wicket at the moment.\n\n7:45 PM: 17/0 (3 overs)\n\nA little different strategy being utilised by the MI management here. Skipper Pandya has used three of his bowlers already with four overs running, leaving fans puzzled. Obly time will tell if this tactic will pay dividends.\n\n7:34 PM: 7/0 (1 Over)\n\nA slow start from SRH, just saying that by the standards of how they have began this season. 7 runs come rom the first over.", "source": {"uri": "mid-day.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mid-day"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suryakumar_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Suryakumar Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardik_Pandya", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hardik Pandya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket-keeper", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wicket-keeper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "T.

Even though Mumbai got three wins in their next four games to bring themselves into the winning track, the environment of the team won't be high going into the MI vs SRH fixture.\n\nWith four defeats, Mumbai are at the foot of the points table with three wins in 11 games and have been knocked out of the ongoing tournament.\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad made a fabulous comeback in their last game against Rajasthan Royals (RR), where a brilliant spell of death bowling helped them earn a one-run victory. This came after their back-to-back losses against Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) and Chennai Super Kings (CSK).\n\nWhat Sunrisers did well was keeping their momentum going at the halfway mark of the competition with four successive wins, which has helped them to secure the fourth place before the MI vs SRH face-off, with six wins in 10 games at a net run rate (NRR) of +0.072.\n\nAlso Read: 'We Don't Talk Much..'- Matheesha Pathirana On MS Dhoni\n\nIf Hyderabad comes on top in the MI vs SRH affair, they will have a great opportunity to hold their position among the top four.\n\nMI Probable XI: Rohit Sharma, Ishan Kishan (wk.), Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Verma, Nehal Wadhera, Naman Dhir, Hardik Pandya (c), Tim David, Gerald Coetzee, Piyush Chawla, Jasprit Bumrah.\n\nMI Impact Sub: Nuwan Thushara, Shams Mulani, Dewald Brevis, Romario Shepherd, Shivalik Sharma.\n\nSRH Probable XI: Abhishek Sharma, Travis Head, Anmolpreet Singh, Heinrich Klassen (wk.), Nitish Reddy, Abdul Samad, Shahbaz Ahmed, Marco Jansen, Pat Cummins (c), Bhuvneshwar Kumar, T Natarajan.\n\nSRH Impact Sub: Jaydev Unadkat, Sanvir Singh, Aiden Markram, Mayank Markande, Umran Malik.", "source": {"uri": "sportzwiki.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportzwiki"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wankhede_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wankhede Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rajasthan Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chennai Super Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_run_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Net run rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nehal_Wadhera", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nehal Wadhera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewald_Brevis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dewald Brevis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matheesha_Pathirana", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matheesha Pathirana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umran_Malik", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Umran Malik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

SRH have already beaten MI once this season in a high-scoring affair at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium. In that game, SRH registered the then-record of highest ever total scored in the tournament - 277, which they later broke. Pat Cummins' side will be confident on Monday as well, having managed to sneak in a lucky win against RR.\n\nHyderabad will be up against MI, who have been in the doldrums this season. Since the arrival of Hardik Pandya, MI have looked like a lost unit, with no one but Jasprit Bumrah performing in a consistent basis. MI will need to up their level against SRH, who have based their game around a strong opening combination - Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma, and then mid-over block led by Pat Cummins.\n\nIPL 2024: SRH hit 277 vs MI\n\nFocus will be on the SRH openers who have let their guard down slightly in the fag end of the group stages. But there is no better ground than Wankhede to aid the batters in the IPL. SRH's acumen with their spin attack still remains in question and that could be tested against the likes of Suryakumar Yadav and Tilak Varma.\n\nIPL 2024 Full Coverage | IPL 2024 Points Table and Standings | 2024 IPL Full Schedule\n\nSRH hammered Mumbai in a high-scoring game at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium earlier in the season. Historically speaking, MI have a slight edge over SRH, and lead the stats 12-10 in the IPL.\n\nSRH have no injury concerns in their camp, but MI have a big call to make. With the team virtually knocked out of the tournament, Mumbai can either opt to rest Jasprit Bumrah ahead of the T20 World Cup, or ask him to play the remaining group-stage matches of the tournament.\n\nThe Mumbai pitch did not offer its traditional characteristics in the match against KKR. The wicket was tricky to bat on, which meant that MI were bowled out for just 145 runs while chasing 170 at the Wankhede Stadium.\n\nThe pitch has generally been flat and has aided the team in batting second on the surface.\n\nMI Predicted XI\n\nIshan Kishan (wk), Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya (c), Naman Dhir, Tim David, Gerald Coetzee, Piyush Chawla, Jasprit Bumrah, Nuwan Thushara\n\nTravis Head, Abhishek Sharma, Anmolpreet Singh, Heinrich Klaasen (wk), Nitish Reddy, Abdul Samad, Shahbaz Ahmed, Marco Jansen, Pat Cummins (c), Bhuvneshwar Kumar, T Natarajan\n\nImpact Player: Jaydev Unadkat\n\nThe toss will be the biggest factor in the game.

The five-time champions sit in bottom place on the IPL 2024 points table with only three wins in 11 matches and the path to the playoffs already seem to be shut down for them. Hardik Pandya's first season as captain of Mumbai Indians has only gone from bad to worse and now he and his side will look to finish off on a high by winning the remaining matches. Up against them is Sunrisers Hyderabad, a side which bagged a one-run win in their last match against the in-form Rajasthan Royals. The battle would not be easy, but again, no clear winner can be predicted in a cricket game until the last ball is bowled.

With 12 points from 10 matches, Sunrisers Hyderabad sit in fourth place on the IPL 2024 points table, behind Chennai Super Kings who too have the same number of points. A win tonight will help them move to the third spot and get one step closer towards booking a place in the last four. It was an absolute run-fest in Hyderabad the last time these two sides met this season, with Sunrisers coming out on top. As they aim a double over the five-time champions, Mumbai Indians would hope to bounce back.

Suryakumar Yadav brought up his second IPL hundred as Mumbai Indians chased the target with 16 balls remaining. With SRH losing the match, things will start getting heated up in the IPL 2024 points table as there are now three teams stuck at 12 points.\n\nAfter winning the toss, Hardik Pandya decided to bowl first on a pitch that looked like a batting surface but had a tinge of green in it. SRH openers, Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma did not get the start they are accustomed to as Mumbai bowlers did well and bowled in the right areas with a fair bit of assistance from the pitch. After a while Travis Head started going after the bowlers and SRH were past the 50-run mark in just five overs but Jasprit Bumrah came and struck with Abhishek Sharma's wicket.\n\nSoon after, debutant Anshul Kamboj picked up Mayank Agarwal's wicket and then Piyush Chawla removed the dangerous-looking Travis Head. Wickets kept falling at regular intervals but it was Pat Cummins' brilliant cameo of 35 runs off 17 balls that helped SRH past the 170-run mark as they finished with 173-8 in 20 overs.\n\nSuryakumar Yadav Wins It For Mumbai Indians\n\nIn reply, Mumbai Indians got off to a flier but SRH bowlers struck back-to-back and got Mumbai 36-3 in five overs. But the new men in, Suryakumar Yadav and Tilak Varma did not let the bowlers settle and kept the boundaries coming at regular intervals. Suryakumar Yadav looked like he was suffering from some groin pain as he was seen limping and his running between the wickets looked inhibited. But that didn't stop the right-handed batter hitting all around the park as he ultimately won the match for his hide in the 17th over by hitting a six over covers, and also bringing up his second IPL century.", "source": {"uri": "news.abplive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "english"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suryakumar_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Suryakumar Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilak_Varma", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tilak Varma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wankhede_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wankhede Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardik_Pandya", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hardik Pandya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasprit_Bumrah", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jasprit Bumrah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayank_Agarwal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayank Agarwal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piyush_Chawla", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Piyush Chawla"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Five-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Five-Pin", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2024/05/06/b1688f509aa7fb8602b9b34b27c9cfa61715018589008936_original.jpg?impolicy=abp_cdn&imwidth=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540533", "eventUri": "eng-9540533", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

The South African wicket-keeper batter is the leading run-scorer for Sunrisers this year, amassing 337 runs in 10 innings at an average of 48.14.\n\nX-Factor:\n\nTilak Varma got dismissed for single digits in the last 2 matches but he is still the leading run-scorer for Mumbai Indians with 347 runs in 11 matches at an average of 38.55 which includes 3 half-centuries.\n\nWhat are the Fantasy Suggested teams for MI vs SRH, IPL 2024, Match 55?\n\n1. Heinrich Klaasen (c), Suryakumar Yadav, Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma, Nehal Wadhera, Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya, K Nitish Reddy, Pat Cummins, Jasprit Bumrah (vc), T Natarajan\n\n2. Heinrich Klaasen, Ishan Kishan, Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav (vc), Travis Head (c), Abhishek Sharma, Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya, Marco Jansen, Pat Cummins, Jasprit Bumrah\n\nPre-Match Analysis:\n\nMumbai Indians fall into their trap after appointing Hardik Pandya as their new skipper despite having Rohit Sharma at their disposal. The outcome has gone wrong and they are on the verge of elimination, sitting at the bottom of the standings with only 6 points to their name.\n\nAs a home side, they exploited the conditions to keep Knight Riders for 169 but the response went wrong as they ended up scoring only 145 and eventually losing the match by 24 runs. Suryakumar Yadav was the lone performer, scoring 56 runs off 35 balls. With 4 matches in hand, they must win all of them to keep their slightest playoff hopes alive.\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad made an improbable comeback to seal a one-run win over Rajasthan Royals to stay in the top half of the standings. Bhuvneshwar Kumar's experience made wonders as the veteran pacer, claimed 3 wickets and even defended 2 runs in the final delivery of the match. Earlier Travis Head's (58), K Nitish Reddy's (76*), and Heinrich Klaasen's (42*) explicit s took them well past the 200-run mark.\n\nThey made a tough call, leaving out Aiden Markram and including tall all-rounder Marco Jansen in his place, and are looking to stick to the same winning combination when they travel to Mumbai for their 11th fixture. T Natarajan will be their main man to watch out for having bagged 15 wickets in only just 8 matches played this season.", "source": {"uri": "in.ign.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IGN India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket-keeper", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wicket-keeper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilak_Varma", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tilak Varma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suryakumar_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Suryakumar Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasprit_Bumrah", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jasprit Bumrah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Klaasen", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Heinrich Klaasen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nehal_Wadhera", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nehal Wadhera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JioCinema", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "JioCinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Sports_(Indian_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Star Sports (Indian TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardik_Pandya", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hardik Pandya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishan_Kishan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ishan Kishan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajasthan Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wankhede_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wankhede Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Century (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T.

Mumbai Indians are on the brink of elimination from the playoff race, yet they strive to secure a victory to maintain the slightest chance. A win for Sunrisers would edge them closer to the playoffs, potentially marking Mumbai as the first team to be eliminated from the IPL 2024 playoffs.\n\nThe last time these two teams met in this year's IPL, SRH set a formidable total of 277 runs for the loss of 3 wickets, while MI managed to score 245 runs in response. MI bowlers would be vary of the threat SRH batters, especially Travis Head, Abhishekh Sharma and Heinrich Klaasen would pose. They would expect to remove them as early as possible or else, winning the match would be a distant dream for the Hardik Pandya-led Mumbai Indians.\n\nMumbai openers, on the other hand, have not been in good form as Rohit Sharma and Ishan Kishan both have not been giving their team good starts. Their inconsistency could be a significant contributor to MI's lackluster performance this season. They are likely to encounter a formidable challenge from SRH pacers, including Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Pat Cummins, T Natarajan, Jaydev Unadkat, and Marco Jansen, all of whom have been in excellent form.\n\nHardik Pandya's performance with bat and bowl both, has aslo been very ordinary and his captaincy too, had been below par. In their last match against Kolkata Knight Riders, MI lost by 24 runs as they failed to chase 170 in 20 overs.\n\nSRH, on the other hand, despite being behind Rajasthan Royals throughout the match managed to defend 201 in a last-ball thriller match on May 2.\n\nConsidering the present form of both teams, SRH are expected to enter tonight's match as the favourite side, and it would be quite hard for Mumbai Indians to outperform them.", "source": {"uri": "news.abplive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "english"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Klaasen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heinrich Klaasen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

SRH defeated MI in the first game played in Hyderabad. Mumbai Indians after their recent loss to KKR are almost on the brink of elimination from IPL 2024.\n\nThe MI vs SRH IPL 2024 match will be played in Mumbai on May 6 from 7.30 pm IST. This is the penultimate game at the Wankhede stadium this season.\n\nMI are still mathematically alive in the playoffs race after the defeat to KKR but practically on the brink of elimination. Apart from winning their remaining games, they need a lot of other results to go their way to make it to the playoffs. Very rarely has a team made it to the IPL playoffs with 12 points.\n\nMI could not chase down 170 on a wicket on which they had already bowled and knew about how the wicket was playing. This loss against KKR was an evident example that the team is not playing as a unit and hence nothing is going right for the side. How they perform now in the remaining three games will be an interesting observation.\n\nMI Squad\n\nHardik Pandya (c), Rohit Sharma, Dewald Brevis, Suryakumar Yadav, Ishan Kishan, N. Tilak Varma, Tim David, Harvik Desai, Arjun Tendulkar, Shams Mulani, Nehal Wadhera, Jasprit Bumrah, Kumar Kartikeya, Piyush Chawla, Akash Madhwal, Luke Wood, Romario Shepherd, Gerald Coetzee, Shreyas Gopal, Nuwan Thushara, Naman Dhir, Anshul Kamboj, Mohammad Nabi, Shivalik Sharma, Kwena Maphaka\n\nTalking about SRH, they came back to winning ways in the last match against RR after losing their previous two games chasing. Hyderabad have been good while batting first but chasing has been their Achilles Heel this season. In the remaining games, the opposition teams might ask them to chase. A win here for SRH will take them to 14 points and take them a step closer to IPL 2024 playoffs.\n\nThe lack of a good spinner has been a problem for the side. In the last match, they used Shahbaz Ahmed for just one over. Against MI, they might be tempted to bring back Mayank Markande the leggie to extract the best out of the conditions.\n\nSRH Squad\n\nPat Cummins (c), Abdul Samad, Abhishek Sharma, Aiden Markram, Marco Jansen, Rahul Tripathi, Washington Sundar, Glenn Phillips, Sanvir Singh, Heinrich Klaasen, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mayank Agarwal, T. Natarajan, Anmolpreet Singh, Mayank Markande, Upendra Singh Yadav, Umran Malik, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Shahbaz Ahmed, Travis Head, Vijayakanth Viyaskanth, Jaydev Unadkat, Akash Singh, Jhathavedh Subramanyan\n\nAlso Read: MI vs SRH: \"Hardik Pandya is drained..looks flat..\"- Aaron Finch's jaw-dropping allegations\n\nFor MI, Rohit Sharma and Suryakumar Yadav hold the key as they are the senior players in the side. With the ball, Jasperit Bumrah and Piyush Chawla will be key. Bumrah is leading the Purple Cap race with 17 wickets.\n\nFor SRH, the usual suspects Travis Head and Abhishek Sharam will be key with the bat. With the ball, they have relied on their seamers to get the job done and hence Cummins, Bhuvi and Natarajan will be key.\n\nThe temperatures will be around 30 degrees in the evening and weather conditions will be partly cloudy. Humidity levels will be almost 75 percent but no chance of rain. We can expect a full game of 40 overs.\n\nTalking about the pitch, it is generally a batting-friendly wicket but the pitch was slow and the ball was gripping off the surface in the MI vs KKR match. It will be interesting to see what kind of strip is laid out for the MI vs SRH contest.\n\nA win for SRH will take them to 14 points and take them a step closer to the playoffs. MI who are virtually out of the race will be officially eliminated if they lose against SRH.\n\nAlso Read: MI vs SRH: Hardik Pandya accused of hiding behind teammates!!

Nitish Reddy, Marco Jansen, and Shahbaz Ahmed also chipped in with crucial runs in the innings.\n\nDefending the target, SRH were off to a great start as they dismissed Rohit Sharma, Ishan Kishan, and Naman Dhir inside 4.1 overs. However, after that, nothing went in their favor as Suryakumar Yadav hit a fantastic century and steered Mumbai Indians to a 7-wicket victory.\n\nSpeaking after the match, Pat Cummins said that they were a few runs short in the match and should have scored more. Pat Cummins said:\n\n\"Probably a couple short, at the Wankhede you want as many as you can get. You always feel like you're in, the wicket had a little bit in it so we were definitely in the game.\"\n\nPat Cummins felt that things didn't work out for Sunrisers Hyderabad in the match and showered rich praise on Suryakumar Yadav for his batting brilliance. Pat Cummins said:\n\n\"I think Sanvir helped us get to that 170 instead of 150, ideally, we'd have a bowler. It's T20 cricket, and it doesn't always work out. SKY played really well. We like playing at home, we'll wait and see what's ahead of us. Hopefully a few more fireworks.\"\n\nIn their first clash in the Indian Premier League 2024, SRH and MI produced a run-fest on March 27 at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, Uppal, Hyderabad. After a normal start to IPL 2024 with 3 200-plus totals in 14 innings, with a highest of 208, SRH decided to raise the bar and showcased what the IPL 2024 is all about - a nightmare for bowlers.\n\nTravis Head (62), Abhishek Sharma (63), Aiden Markram (42), and Heinrich Klaasen (80) decided to go all guns blazing and after a stupendous batting show, they took SRH all the way to 277 for 3. For MI, Hardik Pandya Piyush Chawla, and Gerald Coetzee were among the wickets while Jasprit Bumrah (0/36) was the most economical.\n\nA total that was virtually impossible to chase was made look chaseable when Mumbai Indians came to bat. The 5-time champions reached the halfway mark with a great run rate with the batters playing an attacking brand of cricket.\n\nHowever, SRH bowlers made sure that they didn't let the performance of their batters go in vain and pulled back the game to restrict Mumbai to 246/5 and clinch a 31-run victory. For SRH, Pat Cummins and Jaydev Unadkat picked up two wickets each while Shahbaz Ahmed got one wicket. In the high-scoring match, the young SRH batsman Abhishek Sharma bagged the Player of the Match award for his heroics of 23-ball 63.", "source": {"uri": "cricketaddictor.com", "dataType": "news",

While Mumbai is almost knocked out of the tournament, Hyderabad is in touching distance of the playoffs.\n\nBumrah Vs Head\n\nLast time, Bumrah was introduced late by Hardik Pandya and as a result, Travis Head ruined Mumbai's bowling. This time we might see Bumrah in the early overs and their battle will be quite amazing.\n\nRohit Vs Cummins\n\nPat Cummins has gotten the better of Rohit Sharma twice now. With the T20 World Cup coming, the Indian skipper will be looking to get back in form and this battle will be the exact thing he needs for that.\n\nWankhede has always been a batting-friendly pitch but in the last match, we saw both KKR and MI struggling to score.

This will be the reverse fixture between these 2 sides and the 1st game was played at Hyderabad with SRH breaking all the records with the bat and winning.\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad piled up the highest total in IPL history as they broke RCB's record of 263 runs set in IPL 2013 when they last played against Mumbai Indians. Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma, Heinrich Klassen, and Aiden Markram went all guns blazing after the Mumbai bowlers as they batted first and scored 277 runs.\n\nMumbai were not too far behind as they managed to get 246 runs for the loss of 5 wickets in their 20 overs. Ishan Kishan and Rohit Sharma gave their side a solid start which Tilak Varma and Tim David then carried on towards the end.\n\nAlso Read: MI vs SRH Dream11 Prediction Today Match, Dream11 Team Today, Fantasy Cricket Tips, Playing XI, Pitch Report, Injury Update- IPL 2024, Match 55\n\nWhen Mumbai welcomes SRH at home, we expect another run-fest if the visitors decide to bat first. It's a catch-22 situation for Mumbai Indians as SRH have not done well in the chase in IPL 2024 and the Wankhede Stadium is traditionally a chasing ground.\n\nMI's campaign is all but over with the team not finding balance throughout the tournament. The captaincy switch between Rohit Sharma and Hardik Pandya also played a big role as the team was visibly divided into 2 halves for the majority of IPL 2024.\n\nHowever, they will be playing for their pride now as they hold the reputation of being 5-time IPL champions, a record, which has only been equalled by CSK. For SRH, this game will mean much more than the 2 points on the table.\n\nGiven CSK's win over Punjab Kings and LSG's loss against KKR, Sunrisers Hyderabad find themselves sitting at the 4th spot in the points table. The race for the IPL playoffs is heating up and with KKR and Rajasthan almost on the verge of qualification, it will be a tight fight among SRH, CSK, and LSG for the 3rd and the 4th spot.\n\nA lot will depend on the coin toss and the combinations that these teams opt for. Interestingly, SRH bolstered their bowling attack in the last game, adding Marco Jansen to the mix in place of Aiden Markram. They might continue with the same given the batting prowess the team already possesses.\n\nFor Mumbai Indians, Jasprit Bumrah has been the only good sign this season but there have been murmurs around him resting in future games to be fit and ready for the ICC T20 World Cup 2024. Only time will tell which combination will emerge victorious at the end of the day.

The men in blue of IPL have had a tough outing this season and are sitting at the bottom of the points table.\n\nHardik Pandya and team will be facing an in-form SRH who have been in red-hot form with the bat. The team in orange have scored more than three 250+ scores in this season so far, including the highest IPL team total ever - 287/3 vs Royal Challengers Bengaluru.\n\nMI were on the road for over two weeks. During that away leg, Pandya and Co. played four matches but could only manage to win one of them, against Punjab Kings. After that they went on to lose three consecutive games against Rajasthan Royals, Delhi Capitals and Lucknow Super Giants.\n\nUpon returning to Wankhede stadium, the MI fans were hoping for a change of luck but it wasn't the case. The five-time champions lost to KKR by 24 runs.\n\nMI have mustered just six points in eleven matches so far. Playoff spot is a far-off dream now but there is still something to play for.\n\n\"I don't think that we don't have anything to achieve from here,\" MI's Naman Dhir told the media on the eve of the match. \"We have to play for our fans and our pride. We would want to win all three matches. Atmosphere is positive in the dressing room. Earlier we were playing to win every match and the intensity is still the same.\"\n\nThe biggest takeaway from the previous match was Rohit Sharma's inclusion in the team as an impact player. MI spinner Piyush Chawla told the media after the match that Rohit had some mild stiffness in the back.\n\nNaman gave an update on Rohit's fitness.\n\n\"Before that match, Rohit had a stiff back. World Cup is also around the corner so as a precaution he played as an impact player. But he is here for practice today so I guess all fit and fine,\" said Naman.\n\nRohit batted in the nets for a long time during the practice session.\n\nMI Playing XI vs SRH\n\nIshan Kishan (wk), Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya (c), Nehal Wadhera, Tim David, Mohammad Nabi, Piyush Chawla, Gerald Coetzee/Luke Wood, Jasprit Bumrah, Nuwan Thushara\n\nSRH Team News\n\nSRH have been a revelation under new captain Pat Cummins. Their batting line-up has created a fear in the opponent's minds with their brutal power hitting.\n\nSRH have been consistently posting 200-plus totals and with the kind of conditions they will get at the Wankhede, they might end up crossing 250 for the fourth time this season.\n\nWankhede is known for big scores the flat decks and shorter boundaries helps the batters to put on an exhibition of power hitting.\n\nOn one hand SRH are scoring big totals but on the other had they have been conceding a lot of runs too. Their bowling has been a cause of concern but their last encounter against Rajasthan Royals would have given them some confidence coming into the Mumbai game.\n\nThe match against Rajasthan went down to the wire as Bhuvenshwar Kumar defended two runs on the last ball by dismissing Rovman Powell.

Match 55", "body": "In the head-to-head records of the MI vs SRH clashes, the Mumbai Indians (MI) are slightly ahead of the Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) with a 12-10 margin. However, Sunrisers got the better of Mumbai in their last face-off by 31 runs, in Hyderabad.\n\nWhen it comes to bowling in the powerplay overs, both teams have done a decent job with the new ball. Sunrisers have picked up 16 wickets in 10 innings at an economy of 9.73. On the other hand, Mumbai Indians have collected 17 wickets in 11 innings at an economy of 9.30.\n\nThe 2016 champions have been smacked for 27 sixes so far in this IPL 2024 before the MI vs SRH encounter, while the five-time champions have given away 22 sixes, both of which are average, and sit right in the middle among the ten teams.\n\nHowever, the difference between the two teams lies in their batting in the first six overs. The Hyderabad side has scored the most powerplay runs in the IPL 2024, which is 651 in 10 innings at a strike rate of 180.83, which too is the highest among all the ten franchises.\n\nAlso Read: Graeme Smith Blames This For Mumbai Indians' Struggle In IPL 2024\n\nBefore the MI vs SRH fixture, Mumbai Indians have lost the most wickets (22) in the powerplay and have managed 588 runs in 11 innings at a strike rate of 148.48, which sits in the middle of all the teams. Their 31 sixes in the powerplay have been bettered by the 39 sixes of the Hyderabad batters.\n\nFor putting up a big score in the scorecard, or aiming for a huge chase in the MI vs SRH face-off, the hosts need to put a price on their wickets.\n\nMumbai Indians Probable XI: Rohit Sharma, Ishan Kishan (wk.), Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Verma, Nehal Wadhera, Naman Dhir, Hardik Pandya (c), Tim David, Gerald Coetzee, Piyush Chawla, Jasprit Bumrah.\n\nImpact Sub: Nuwan Thushara\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad Probable XI: Abhishek Sharma, Travis Head, Anmolpreet Singh, Heinrich Klassen (wk.), Nitish Reddy, Abdul Samad, Shahbaz Ahmed, Marco Jansen, Pat Cummins (c), Bhuvneshwar Kumar, T Natarajan.\n\nImpact Sub: Jaydev Unadkat.\n\nAlso Read: 'It's A Tricky Question'- Sanju Samson On His Potential No. 5 Batting Spot In T20 World Cup 2024\n\nBest Batters Prediction: Heinrich Klassen\n\nHeinrich Klassen has been in his beast mode in this IPL mode. Coming in the middle order, he has taken the bowlers to the cleaners, with 337 runs in 10 innings at a strike rate of 189.32, including three fifties. If the track favors the batters, Klassen could be a huge threat to the Mumbai Indians.\n\nBest Bowler Prediction: Jasprit Bumrah\n\nJasprit Bumrah has done a decent job against the Sunrisers Hyderabad at the Wankhede Stadium, with seven IPL wickets in five innings at an economy of 7.35. The veteran has been in exceptional touch in this IPL 2024, with 17 wickets in 11 innings at an economy of just 6.25.

remain in focus for their individual form (Pic: AFP)\n\nA confident Sunrisers Hyderabad will look to produce a dominant show against a frail Mumbai Indians outfit and move up in the Indian Premier League points table when the two teams clash on Monday.\n\nPlaced fourth in the IPL points table with 12 points in 10 matches with six wins and four losses, SRH will be desperate to produce an all-round show and make improvements especially in their bowling department.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Pat Cummins-led side is in the midst of an intense battle between multiple teams who are bidding for spots in the final four, with Rajasthan Royals (16 points), Kolkata Knight Riders (14 points) and Lucknow Super Giants (12 points) placed above SRH.\n\nChennai Super Kings (5th with 10 points) and a resurgent Delhi Capitals (6th with 10 points) are breathing down SRH's neck, a scenario that would force the 2016 winners to shrug off any rust and get ready for an intense mid-table battle.\n\nIf a two-paced pitch at the Wankhede Stadium for the previous clash against KKR was an aberration, the free-flowing SRH batters would look to make merry and pile up a huge score as they have done several times this year.\n\nThe pitches here generally are batting-friendly and short boundary lengths at this venue make scores in excess of 200 a norm, but the MI-KKR contest played out on a sluggish surface last Friday challenged the batters to dig deep.\n\nAlso Read: Win or perish\n\nSRH would be high on confidence having pipped the table-toppers RR by just one run in their previous outing, a game in which their bowlers pulled off a thrilling win.\n\nTravis Head (396 runs), Abhishek Sharma (315) and Heinrich Klaasen (337) remain the enforcers in SRH's batting but South African Aiden Markram would be keen to make a big score of his own, having had a mixed run so far.\n\nNitish Kumar Reddy (219 runs) has emerged as one of the most promising players for SRH in last few games which takes a significant amount of pressure off the key batters.\n\nT Natarajan's (15 wickets) accuracy would be handy for SRH as the left-arm pacer is chasing Mumbai Indians' Jasprit Bumrah (17) for the purple cap.\n\nFive-time winners Mumbai slipped to the bottom of the pool again when Royal Challengers Bengaluru trumped Gujarat Titans on Saturday night.\n\nWith only three wins in 11 matches, MI's challenge is all but over and there is only \"pride and name\" left to play for by their own admission.\n\nHowever, all is not lost as MI's key India players for the upcoming T20 World Cup, Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav and Hardik Pandya would remain in focus for their individual form.\n\nRohit's all-out aggressive approach has not yielded many big scores whereas the world number 1 T20 batter Suryakumar would be eyeing consistency after a fine half-century against KKR a few nights ago.\n\nIndia vice-captain Pandya has being consistently on the receiving end due to his ordinary form with both bat and ball and also his on-field decisions as MI skipper.\n\nThe all-rounder, however, would be keen to make amends and put an end to the criticism that he has been facing ever since this IPL edition got underway.\n\nMumbai Indians: Hardik Pandya (c), Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav, Dewald Brevis, Jasprit Bumrah, Piyush Chawla, Gerald Coetzee, Tim David, Shreyas Gopal, Ishan Kishan (wk),

Travis Head, Mayank Agarwal, Nitish Reddy, Heinrich Klaasen(w), Abdul Samad, Shahbaz Ahmed, Marco Jansen, Pat Cummins(c), Bhuvneshwar Kumar, T Natarajan\n\n9:20 PM: 173/8 (20 overs)\n\nA Pat Cummins-cameo of '17-ball 35 takes Hyderabad to a fighting total. SRH post 173 at the end of 20 overs.\n\n9:07 PM: 153/8 (18.2 Overs)\n\nAbdul Samad gets LBW off Chawla's bowling. Mumbai continue to be on top as Pat Cummins is joined by impact player Sanvir Singh. Bumrah and Thushara in the middle for MI.\n\n8:58 PM: 122/6 (15.3 Overs)\n\nShahbaz Ahmed gets caught by Suryakumar Yadav off Pandya's delivery. MI on top of this contest as SRH go six down now. Abdul Samad comes into bat.\n\n8:42 PM: 103/5 (13.2 Overs)\n\nHeinrich Klaasen departs after getting cleaned up by Chawla. MI on a roll as SRH go five down now. Mumbai bring in most trusted pacer Jasprit Bumrah to seal the deal now.\n\n8:35 PM: 92/4 (11.1 Overs)\n\nHosts Mumbai on fire after Head and new batter Nitish Reddy walk back to the pavilion in the same over. After Chawla, it is Pandya who provides a breakthrough.\n\n8:28 PM: 82/2 (9 Overs)\n\n23-year-old all-rounder Anshul Kamboj is the cynosure of all eyes today at the Wankhede. After nearly getting Head out of the equation, the Australian has another lucky escape after being dropped by Nuwan Thushara. Kamboj finally strikes, as he clean-bowls Mayank Agarwal.\n\n8:16 PM: 66/2 (7 overs)\n\nBumrah and Kamboj get Mumbai crucial breakthroughs. Hyderabad still have in-form Head batting on 46 off 27.\n\n8:00 PM: 56/0 (6 Overs)\n\nMI debutant Anshul Kamboj gets the dangerous Travis Head, but it was adjudged a no-ball and Head manages to be off the hook for now. Is another of those Head's centuries underway tonight?\n\n7:57 PM: 29/0 (5 Overs)\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad making the most of the powerplay overs. They start steady with in-form openers Abhishek Sharma and Travis Head in the middle. It looks like a difficult batting wicket at the moment.\n\n7:45 PM: 17/0 (3 overs)\n\nA little different strategy being utilised by the MI management here.

Image: X / @IPL\n\nMumbai Indians vs Sunrisers Hyderabad preview: It's a do-or-die situation for five-time champions Mumbai Indians (MI) as they take on Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in Match 55 of IPL 2024. MI are languishing at the bottom of the 10-team points table with just six points from 11 games, and even three victories in their remaining three games may not ensure qualification for the playoffs.\n\nWinning all three matches, however, will give Hardik Pandya and Co another lifeline, especially given the fact there would still be three teams with 12 points.\n\nSimply put, MI have failed to excel as a unit this season. Jasprit Bumrah (17 wickets) has largely been their biggest positive as far as bowling is concerned, whereas MI have also struggled in terms of consistency in batting. Tilak Varm, with three fifties, has been a silver lining for MI with 347 runs, whereas Rohit Sharma, despite the century against CSK in mid-April, has perished for low scores recently.\n\nSuryakumar Yadav has also scored three fifties but has failed to maintain consistency.\n\nSRH, meanwhile, are thriving under skipper Pat Cummins. They have found a fearless opener in Travis Head and a similarly fearless batter in Abhishek Sharma. The duo have scored a combined tally of 733 runs. SRH were enjoying a run of four wins on the trot before suffering defeats to RCB and CSK.\n\nThe Sunrisers, however, are coming fresh off a one-run win over Rajasthan Royals in Hyderabad, with Bhuvneshwar Kumar starring in the final over.\n\nSquads:\n\nMI: Akash Madhwal, Arjun Tendulkar, Dewald Brevis, Ishan Kishan, Jason Behrendorff, Jasprit Bumrah, Kumar Kartikeya Singh, N.

SRH is at fourth spot with six wins and five losses, giving them 12 points.\n\nIn the run-chase of 174 runs, the five-time champions Mumbai were off to a poor start as they lost their top-order of Ishan Kishan (9), Rohit Sharma (4) and Naman Dhir (0) one-by-one to the pace trio of Marco Jansen, Pat Cummins and Bhuvneshwar Kumar. MI sank to 31/3 in 4.1 overs.\n\nThe duo of Suryakumar Yadav and Tilak Varma took it upon themselves to rebuild the innings. At the end of six overs, MI was 52/3, with Suryakumar (11*) and Tilak (9*) unbeaten. In the final over of the powerplay, Suryakumar and Tilak brought some momentum to MI by smashing Cummins for two fours and a six.\n\nSuryakumar continued his assault on pace, looting 20 runs in four balls against Jansen in the next over, with two fours and two sixes. 22 runs came from the over number seven. Surya and Tilak reached their 50-run stand in 27 balls.\n\nHalfway through the innings, MI was 84/3, with Suryakumar (33*) and Tilak (19*) unbeaten. Mumbai reached the 100-run mark in 11.4 overs with a boundary by Suryakumar towards fine-leg region. Suryakumar reached his fifty, his fourth this season, in 30 balls, with five fours and three sixes.\n\nIn the remaining six overs, MI was left with 46 runs to chase at 128/3, with Suryakumar (66*) and Tilak (28*) unbeaten. In the 15th over, Surya continued to keep MI in the hunt with two brilliant boundaries, bringing down the deficit to 35 runs needed in 30 balls. MI was 139/3 in 15 overs. The duo brought up their century partnership in just 62 balls.\n\nIn the next over by T Natrajan, MI got some more boost in the form of two boundaries, one each by Surya and Tilak, which pulled down the deficit to 25 runs in the final four overs. MI reached the 150-run mark in 16.1 overs. In the final three overs, MI needed just seven runs, with Surya blasting Cummins for two fours and a six on the final three balls of the 17th over to reach the score of 96.\n\nSurya hit Natrajan for a huge six in the 18th over's second delivery, ending his innings at 102* in 51 balls, with 12 fours and six sixes. MI ended their innings at 174/3 in 17.2 overs, with Tilak also unbeaten at 37 in 32 balls, with six fours.\n\nCummins, Jansen and Bhuvneshwar got a wicket each.\n\nEarlier, Hardik Pandya and Piyush Chawla's three-wicket hauls restricted Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) at 173/8 against Mumbai Indians (MI) in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024 at the Wankhede Stadium on Monday. Batting sensation Travis Head and skipper Pat Cummins were the two highest run scorers for the Sunrisers as they helped the visitors put 173/8 on the scoreboard against the hosts on Monday.\n\nAfter winning the toss, MI skipper Hardik Pandya sent the Sunrisers to bat first, and their decision did go in their favour as they dominated the visitors in the first inning. Travis Head (48) and Abhishek Sharma (11) opened for Sunrisers Hyderbad and played a 56-run partnership. However, MI pacer Jasprit Bumrah made the first breakthrough of the game after he removed Abhishek in the 6th over.\n\nSoon after losing the first wicket, SRH failed to make a solid partnership as the MI bowlers dominated the game. Before reaching the 100-run mark in the 13th over, SRH lost four more wickets and stood at 96/5. The second wicket of the inning came after debutant Anshul Kamboj removed Mayank Agarwal (5) in the 8th over.\n\nPiyush Chawla bagged an important wicket after he removed the dangerous Head in the 11th over. The Australian batter missed his half-century for just two runs. Skipper Hardik Pandya's first wicket came after he dismissed Nitish Reddy (20) in the 12th over.\n\nAfter losing early wickets, the Sunrisers must have thought Heinrich Klaasen (2) would take care of the middle order but the Proteas cricketer was removed from the crease in the 13th over by Chawla. The batters failed to stay on the crease for a longer time after the MI bowling attack kept on taking wickets. Shahbaz Ahmed (10) and Marco Jansen (17) were dismissed by Pandya in the 16th over. Later in the 17th over, Chawla picked Abdul Samad's (3) wicket in the 17th over\n\nIn the end, Pat Cummins (35*) and Sanvir Singh (8) were unbeaten on the crease and took SRH to 173/8. Pandya and Chawla picked up three wickets each in their respective spells and led the Mumbai bowling attack. While Anshul Kamboj and Jasprit Bumrah picked one wicket each. Nuwan Thushara was the only MI bowler who failed to pick wickets in the game.\n\nBrief score: Sunrisers Hyderabad (Travis Head 48, Pat Cummins 35*, Nitish Reddy 20; Hardik Pandya 3/31) lost to Mumbai Indians: 174/3 in 17.2 overs (Suryakumar Yadav 102*, Tilak Varma 37*, Bhuvneshwar Kumar 1/22).\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by DNA staff and is published from PTI/ANI)",

With 12 points from 10 matches, including six wins and four losses, SRH currently sits fourth on the IPL 2024 points table and is keen to put on a strong performance, especially focusing on strengthening their bowling unit.\n\nMumbai Indians (MI) and SRH are set to play the 55th match of IPL 2024. This article focuses on MI vs SRH Dream11 Prediction Today Match, MI vs SRH Dream11 Team Today, Playing 11s, and Pitch Report. Mumbai Indians will face Sunrisers Hyderabad for the second time in IPL 2024.\n\nIn the history of the IPL, Mumbai Indians have often dominated against Sunrisers Hyderabad, enjoying a stronger head-to-head record with 12 wins out of 22 encounters, including one victory via a Super Over. However, in their recent match in IPL 2024, it was Sunrisers Hyderabad who came out on top, defeating Mumbai Indians by 31 runs in a high-scoring game in Hyderabad.\n\nMayank Agarwal, Rahul Tripathi, Aiden Markram, Heinrich Klaasen (wk), Abdul Samad, Shahbaz Ahmed, Marco Jansen, Pat Cummins (c), Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mayank Markande, Abhishek Sharma\n\nMayank Agarwal, Rahul Tripathi, Aiden Markram, Heinrich Klaasen (wk), Abdul Samad, Shahbaz Ahmed, Marco Jansen, Pat Cummins (c), Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mayank Markande, T Natarajan\n\nImpact Players Option: Reddy, Washington, Malik, Phillips and Abhishek Sharma\n\nIshan Kishan, Rohit Sharma, Naman Dhir, Dewald Brevis, Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya, Tim David, Shams Mulani, Gerald Coetzee, Piyush Chala, Jasprit Bumrah.\n\nIshan Kishan, Rohit Sharma, Naman Dhir, Dewald Brevis, Mohammad Nabi, Hardik Pandya, Tim David, Shams Mulani, Gerald Coetzee, Piyush Chala, Jasprit Bumrah.\n\nImpact Players Option: Dewald Brevis, Romario Shepherd, Vishnu Vinod, Nehal Wadhera, Mohammad Nabi\n\nWankhede Stadium, renowned for its support for batsmen and offering some assistance to fast bowlers, has historically seen an average first innings total of around 160s across 114 IPL matches. However, in IPL 2024 games, this average has risen significantly to an impressive 186. Teams batting first have slightly had the upper hand at this venue, leading captains winning the toss to choose to set a target.\n\nThe evening weather forecast for Mumbai suggests overcast conditions with a humidity of 71 percent. The temperature is expected to be around 31\u00b0C, accompanied by a wind speed of 13 km/h.\n\nBoth teams lost a closely fought encounter in their first games of the tournament, respectively. However, the SRH team appeared much more compact and collected than the MI. If SRH could perform to their potential, they would win this game.\n\nPat Cummins (c), Abdul Samad, Abhishek Sharma, Aiden Markram, Travis Head, Wanindu Hasaranga, Marco Jansen, Rahul Tripathi, Washington Sundar, Glenn Phillips, Sanvir Singh, Heinrich Klaasen, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mayank Agarwal, T.

During the run-chase, MI lost 3 quick wickets but a batting masterclass from Suryakumar Yadav ensured MI successfully chased the target. The batter slammed 102 runs off 51 balls and finished the match in 17.2 overs.\n\nAt the post-match presentation ceremony, Hardik Pandya lauded his batters but wasn't satisfied with the performance of his bowling unit. Hardik Pandya stated:\n\n\"We want to focus on playing good cricket, still think we gave 10-15 runs extra. The way our batters batted, that was excellent.\"\n\nHardik Pandya further talked about his bowling and said that he likes to bowl in the right areas and it worked for him against SRH. Hardik Pandya also lauded veteran leg-spinner Piyush Chawla for his heroics. Hardik Pandya said:\n\n\"My bowling, I like to bowl in the right areas, I bowl according to the situation. Bowled in the right areas today and it worked. I was like Chawla had to bowl from the shorter side. He (Chawla) had to be accurate, the margin of errors have become smaller these days for the bowlers.\"\n\nHardik Pandya was left in awe of Suryakumar Yadav's unbelievable batting performance and credited him for the victory over Sunrisers Hyderabad. Hardik Pandya said:\n\n\"It's unbelievable, the best past of SKY is that he puts the bowlers under pressure. It's sheer confidence, his game has changed, is one of the best batters. He can change a game in a different way, lucky to have him (SKY) in our side.\"\n\nBefore the second match of the IPL 2024 between Mumbai Indians and Sunrisers Hyderabad, the head-to-head record between the teams stood at MI 12 - SRH 10 out of 23 matches with one match being tied.

SRH is at fourth spot with six wins and five losses, giving them 12 points.\n\nA brilliant counterattack by Suryakumar Yadav and Tilak Varma following a quick loss of wickets powered the Mumbai Indians (MI) to a seven-wicket win over Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in their Indian Premier League (IPL) game at Wankhede Stadium on Monday. MI is at the ninth spot with four wins and eight losses, giving them eight points. SRH is at fourth spot with six wins and five losses, giving them 12 points.\n\nIn the run-chase of 174 runs, the five-time champions Mumbai were off to a poor start as they lost their top-order of Ishan Kishan (9), Rohit Sharma (4) and Naman Dhir (0) one-by-one to the pace trio of Marco Jansen, Pat Cummins and Bhuvneshwar Kumar. MI sank to 31/3 in 4.1 overs. The duo of Suryakumar Yadav and Tilak Varma took it upon themselves to rebuild the innings. At the end of six overs, MI was 52/3, with Suryakumar (11*) and Tilak (9*) unbeaten. In the final over of the powerplay, Suryakumar and Tilak brought some momentum to MI by smashing Cummins for two fours and a six.\n\nSuryakumar continued his assault on pace, looting 20 runs in four balls against Jansen in the next over, with two fours and two sixes. 22 runs came from the over number seven. Surya and Tilak reached their 50-run stand in 27 balls.\n\nHalfway through the innings, MI was 84/3, with Suryakumar (33*) and Tilak (19*) unbeaten. Mumbai reached the 100-run mark in 11.4 overs with a boundary by Suryakumar towards fine-leg region.\n\nSuryakumar reached his fifty, his fourth this season, in 30 balls, with five fours and three sixes. In the remaining six overs, MI was left with 46 runs to chase at 128/3, with Suryakumar (66*) and Tilak (28*) unbeaten.\n\nIn the 15th over, Surya continued to keep MI in the hunt with two brilliant boundaries, bringing down the deficit to 35 runs needed in 30 balls. MI was 139/3 in 15 overs. The duo brought up their century partnership in just 62 balls. In the next over by T Natrajan, MI got some more boost in the form of two boundaries, one each by Surya and Tilak, which pulled down the deficit to 25 runs in the final four overs.\n\nMI reached the 150-run mark in 16.1 overs. In the final three overs, MI needed just seven runs, with Surya blasting Cummins for two fours and a six on the final three balls of the 17th over to reach the score of 96. Surya hit Natrajan for a huge six in the 18th over's second delivery, ending his innings at 102* in 51 balls, with 12 fours and six sixes. MI ended their innings at 174/3 in 17.2 overs, with Tilak also unbeaten at 37 in 32 balls, with six fours.\n\nCummins, Jansen and Bhuvneshwar got a wicket each. Earlier, Hardik Pandya and Piyush Chawla's three-wicket hauls restricted Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) at 173/8 against Mumbai Indians (MI) in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024 at the Wankhede Stadium on Monday.\n\nBatting sensation Travis Head and skipper Pat Cummins were the two highest run scorers for the Sunrisers as they helped the visitors put 173/8 on the scoreboard against the hosts on Monday. After winning the toss, MI skipper Hardik Pandya sent the Sunrisers to bat first, and their decision did go in their favour as they dominated the visitors in the first inning.\n\nTravis Head (48) and Abhishek Sharma (11) opened for Sunrisers Hyderbad and played a 56-run partnership. However, MI pacer Jasprit Bumrah made the first breakthrough of the game after he removed Abhishek in the 6th over. Soon after losing the first wicket, SRH failed to make a solid partnership as the MI bowlers dominated the game. Before reaching the 100-run mark in the 13th over, SRH lost four more wickets and stood at 96/5.\n\nThe second wicket of the inning came after debutant Anshul Kamboj removed Mayank Agarwal (5) in the 8th over. Piyush Chawla bagged an important wicket after he removed the dangerous Head in the 11th over. The Australian batter missed his half-century for just two runs.\n\nSkipper Hardik Pandya's first wicket came after he dismissed Nitish Reddy (20) in the 12th over. After losing early wickets, the Sunrisers must have thought Heinrich Klaasen (2) would take care of the middle order but the Proteas cricketer was removed from the crease in the 13th over by Chawla.\n\nThe batters failed to stay on the crease for a longer time after the MI bowling attack kept on taking wickets. Shahbaz Ahmed (10) and Marco Jansen (17) were dismissed by Pandya in the 16th over. Later in the 17th over, Chawla picked Abdul Samad's (3) wicket in the 17th over. In the end, Pat Cummins (35*) and Sanvir Singh (8) were unbeaten on the crease and took SRH to 173/8.\n\nPandya and Chawla picked up three wickets each in their respective spells and led the Mumbai bowling attack. While Anshul Kamboj and Jasprit Bumrah picked one wicket each. Nuwan Thushara was the only MI bowler who failed to pick wickets in the game. Brief score: Sunrisers Hyderabad (Travis Head 48, Pat Cummins 35*, Nitish Reddy 20; Hardik Pandya 3/31) lost to Mumbai Indians: 174/3 in 17.2 overs (Suryakumar Yadav 102*, Tilak Varma 37*, Bhuvneshwar Kumar 1/22).

They have failed to stitch together a complete performance in most of their matches, losing games after excelling in one department of the match.\n\nLike in their clash with Kolkata Knight Riders at the Wankhede Stadium on Friday (May 3) when they bundled out the visitors for 169 as their bowlers used the double-paced wicket to their advantage to restrict them. Jasprit Bumrah and Nuwan Thushara claimed three wickets apiece while Hardik Pandya bagged 2-44.\n\nWith Thushara striking three early blows, KKR were reduced to 57/5 but Mumbai Indians allowed them to recover from there, bringing in spinners Naman Dhir and Piyush Chawla instead of pressing on with the pacers. Venkatesh Iyer scored a valiant 52-ball 70 and shared an 83-run partnership with Manish Pandey (42) as they rescued Kolkata Knight Riders.\n\nChasing 170, Mumbai Indians lost the plot as batters like Ishan Kishan, Rohit Sharma, Tilak Varma, Naman Dhir, and Nehal Wadhera got out cheaply. Suryakumar Yadav waged a lone battle, scoring 56 off 35 balls, and hitting a flurry of shots as he tried to lift them from a precarious 71/6.\n\nHis wicket and the one of Tim David triggered another collapse as Andre Russell and Mitchell Starc shared five wickets between them to hasten the demise of their hopes. Starc claimed three wickets in the 19th over for a final haul of 4-33 as KKR won by 24 runs for their first victory at the Wankhede Stadium in 12 years.\n\nAgreed that the wicket was two-paced but it was also true that some of the MI batters were out to full tosses.\n\nWith six points from 11 matches, Mumbai Indians will hope to win their remaining three matches and salvage their pride even if other results do not go in their favour and help them make it to the Playoffs.\n\nMumbai Indians are going into the match with four successive defeats and considering their up-and-down form, Hardik Pandya's team will have to pull up their socks to restore some pride.\n\nMeanwhile, their opponents for Monday's clash, Sunrisers Hyderabad have everything to play for as they are placed fourth in the standings and still in the running for the playoffs spots.\n\nSRH have 12 points from six wins in 10 matches and are placed fourth in the points table, clubbed together with Lucknow Super Giants behind Rajasthan Royals (16) and Kolkata Knight Riders (14).\n\nSRH need to win their remaining four matches as the race for the playoffs spots is going to be neck-and-neck. The good thing for them is that they have recovered after two successive defeats against Southern rivals Chennai Super Kings and Royal Challengers Bengaluru.\n\nThey travel to Mumbai after a victory over table-toppers Rajasthan Royals. After four successive wins starting with a six-wicket win over defending champions Chennai Super Kings at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad.\n\nUnder the leadership of Pat Cummins, SRH have done well so far in the league with openers Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma in great form and the likes of Nitish Kumar Reddy, Heinrich Klaasen and Aiden Markram complimenting their efforts with superb batting when needed.\n\nReddy has been their find of the season and had struck a 42-ball unbeaten 76 in their last match while Travis Head blasted 58 off 44 balls while Klaasen smashed a 19-ball 42. For them, Travis Head (396), Klaasen (337) and Abhishek Sharma (315) were their top scorers.\n\nT. Natarajan and Pat Cummins are their most successful bowlers so far with 15 and 12 respectively. Bhuvneshwar and Jaydev Undakat have claimed eight wickets apiece.\n\nGoing by the last match played there, the pitch is likely to offer some assistance to the bowlers and considering their strength in this department, the force would be with SRH in Monday's clash.\n\nOverall, Mumbai Indians have dominated the head-to-head series, winning 12 out of the 21 matches played between them while SRH have won nine.\n\nSRH had defeated Mumbai Indians by 31 runs in a high-scoring clash at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium on March 27, scoring 277/3 batting first with Klaasen hammering an unbeaten 80 while Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma scoring 62 and 63 respectively. They then restricted MI to 246/5 with Tilak Varma anchoring the innings with 64.\n\nSquads:\n\nMumbai Indians: Ishan Kishan(w), Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya(c), Nehal Wadhera, Tim David, Mohammad Nabi, Piyush Chawla, Luke Wood, Jasprit Bumrah, Nuwan Thushara, Naman Dhir, Shams Mulani, Dewald Brevis, Kumar Kartikeya, Shreyas Gopal, Harvik Desai, Gerald Coetzee,

If they don't use any tired surface, the MI vs SRH clash could offer high scores. If the Sunrisers come on top, they will hold their spot among the top four for a long time.\n\nQuite surprisingly, even being at the bottom of the points table, Mumbai Indians have done a great job in the middle overs. They have the best team strike rate of 146.97 between the seventh to the 15th over. The 873 runs they have scored in this period is the highest among all the ten teams.\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad too, going into the MI vs SRH clash, have done a fabulous job with the ball in hand, as they have managed to bat at a strike rate of 146.11, the third best among the teams in this IPL 2024.\n\nWhen it comes to cracking the big sixes, none of the teams come close to the Sunrisers side. They have nailed 49 sixes in this period, while Mumbai Indians have the third most sixes (42) in this duration, which provides them the platform of going berserk at the latter half of the innings.\n\nTilak Verma has done a terrific job for the Mumbai Indians, carrying the second most runs (251) in the middle overs with a strike rate of 160.90. For the Hyderabad side, Nitish Reddy has shown great excellence in the middle overs for the Sunrisers.

With their playoff hopes nearly dashed, MI aims to disrupt SRH's chances on their own ground in this upcoming match.\n\nThe pitch at Wankhede Stadium strikes a balance between batting and bowling, initially benefiting fast bowlers with its energetic surface. As the game advances, the pitch often settles down, creating favourable conditions for spinners. Batters who excel in timing can prosper on this typically batting-friendly track. Considering these characteristics, the team winning the toss may opt to field first, aiming to take advantage of the early conditions to limit the opposition's runs.\n\nMumbai Weather Forecast:\n\nThe weather forecast for MI vs SRH match in Mumbai predicts clear skies with no chance of rain, setting the stage for a demanding physical contest. Temperatures are expected to hover around 33 degrees Celsius, with moderate winds at 24 kmph. Nonetheless, with humidity levels at 61%, it may feel even warmer, posing additional challenges for both players and spectators.\n\nAlso READ: IPL 2024, MI vs SRH - My11Circle Prediction, Dream11 Team, Fantasy Tips & Pitch Report | Mumbai Indians vs Sunrisers Hyderabad\n\nSquads\n\nMumbai Indians: Ishan Kishan (wk), Rohit Sharma, Naman Dhir, Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma, Nehal Wadhera, Hardik Pandya (c), Tim David, Gerald Coetzee, Piyush Chawla, Jasprit Bumrah, Nuwan Thushara, Shams Mulani, Shivalik Sharma, Dewald Brevis, Romario Shepherd, Mohammad Nabi, Kumar Kartikeya, Luke Wood, Shreyas Gopal, Harvik Desai, Arjun Tendulkar, Anshul Kamboj, Akash Madhwal, Kwena Maphaka\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad: Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma, Anmolpreet Singh, Nitish Reddy, Heinrich Klaasen (wk), Abdul Samad, Shahbaz Ahmed, Marco Jansen, Pat Cummins (c), Bhuvneshwar Kumar, T Natarajan, Jaydev Unadkat, Umran Malik, Mayank Markande, Aiden Markram, Sanvir Singh, Washington Sundar, Glenn Phillips, Rahul Tripathi, Mayank Agarwal, Upendra Yadav, Jhatavedh Subramanyan, Vijayakanth Viyaskanth, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Akash Maharaj Singh", "source": {"uri": "crickettimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketTimes.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anirudh_singh@crickettimes.com", "name": "Anirudh Singh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wankhede_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wankhede Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nehal_Wadhera", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nehal Wadhera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewald_Brevis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dewald Brevis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumar_Kartikeya", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kumar Kartikeya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akash_Madhwal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Akash Madhwal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fazalhaq_Farooqi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fazalhaq Farooqi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umran_Malik", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Umran Malik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arjun_Tendulkar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arjun Tendulkar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

SRH is at fourth spot with six wins and five losses, giving them 12 points.\n\nAlso Read | ICC T20 World Cup 2024 Jerseys: See Pics of Kits To Be Worn by All Teams During Men's Twenty20 WC.\n\nIn the run-chase of 174 runs, the five-time champions Mumbai were off to a poor start as they lost their top-order of Ishan Kishan (9), Rohit Sharma (4) and Naman Dhir (0) one-by-one to the pace trio of Marco Jansen, Pat Cummins and Bhuvneshwar Kumar. MI sank to 31/3 in 4.1 overs.\n\nThe duo of Suryakumar Yadav and Tilak Varma took it upon themselves to rebuild the innings. At the end of six overs, MI was 52/3, with Suryakumar (11*) and Tilak (9*) unbeaten. In the final over of the powerplay, Suryakumar and Tilak brought some momentum to MI by smashing Cummins for two fours and a six.\n\nAlso Read | Will India Travel to Pakistan for ICC Champions Trophy 2025? Here's What BCCI Vice-President Rajeev Shukla Had to Say (Watch Video).\n\nSuryakumar continued his assault on pace, looting 20 runs in four balls against Jansen in the next over, with two fours and two sixes. 22 runs came from the over number seven.\n\nSurya and Tilak reached their 50-run stand in 27 balls.\n\nHalfway through the innings, MI was 84/3, with Suryakumar (33*) and Tilak (19*) unbeaten.\n\nMumbai reached the 100-run mark in 11.4 overs with a boundary by Suryakumar towards fine-leg region.\n\nSuryakumar reached his fifty, his fourth this season, in 30 balls, with five fours and three sixes.\n\nIn the remaining six overs, MI was left with 46 runs to chase at 128/3, with Suryakumar (66*) and Tilak (28*) unbeaten.\n\nIn the 15th over, Surya continued to keep MI in the hunt with two brilliant boundaries, bringing down the deficit to 35 runs needed in 30 balls. MI was 139/3 in 15 overs. The duo brought up their century partnership in just 62 balls.\n\nIn the next over by T Natrajan, MI got some more boost in the form of two boundaries, one each by Surya and Tilak, which pulled down the deficit to 25 runs in the final four overs.\n\nMI reached the 150-run mark in 16.1 overs. In the final three overs, MI needed just seven runs, with Surya blasting Cummins for two fours and a six on the final three balls of the 17th over to reach the score of 96.\n\nSurya hit Natrajan for a huge six in the 18th over's second delivery, ending his innings at 102* in 51 balls, with 12 fours and six sixes. MI ended their innings at 174/3 in 17.2 overs, with Tilak also unbeaten at 37 in 32 balls, with six fours.\n\nCummins, Jansen and Bhuvneshwar got a wicket each.\n\nEarlier, Hardik Pandya and Piyush Chawla's three-wicket hauls restricted Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) at 173/8 against Mumbai Indians (MI) in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024 at the Wankhede Stadium on Monday.\n\nBatting sensation Travis Head and skipper Pat Cummins were the two highest run scorers for the Sunrisers as they helped the visitors put 173/8 on the scoreboard against the hosts on Monday.\n\nAfter winning the toss, MI skipper Hardik Pandya sent the Sunrisers to bat first, and their decision did go in their favour as they dominated the visitors in the first inning.\n\nTravis Head (48) and Abhishek Sharma (11) opened for Sunrisers Hyderbad and played a 56-run partnership. However, MI pacer Jasprit Bumrah made the first breakthrough of the game after he removed Abhishek in the 6th over.\n\nSoon after losing the first wicket, SRH failed to make a solid partnership as the MI bowlers dominated the game. Before reaching the 100-run mark in the 13th over, SRH lost four more wickets and stood at 96/5.\n\nThe second wicket of the inning came after debutant Anshul Kamboj removed Mayank Agarwal (5) in the 8th over.\n\nPiyush Chawla bagged an important wicket after he removed the dangerous Head in the 11th over. The Australian batter missed his half-century for just two runs.\n\nSkipper Hardik Pandya's first wicket came after he dismissed Nitish Reddy (20) in the 12th over.\n\nAfter losing early wickets, the Sunrisers must have thought Heinrich Klaasen (2) would take care of the middle order but the Proteas cricketer was removed from the crease in the 13th over by Chawla.\n\nThe batters failed to stay on the crease for a longer time after the MI bowling attack kept on taking wickets. Shahbaz Ahmed (10) and Marco Jansen (17) were dismissed by Pandya in the 16th over. Later in the 17th over, Chawla picked Abdul Samad's (3) wicket in the 17th over.\n\nIn the end, Pat Cummins (35*) and Sanvir Singh (8) were unbeaten on the crease and took SRH to 173/8.\n\nPandya and Chawla picked up three wickets each in their respective spells and led the Mumbai bowling attack. While Anshul Kamboj and Jasprit Bumrah picked one wicket each. Nuwan Thushara was the only MI bowler who failed to pick wickets in the game.\n\nBrief score: Sunrisers Hyderabad (Travis Head 48, Pat Cummins 35*, Nitish Reddy 20; Hardik Pandya 3/31) lost to Mumbai Indians: 174/3 in 17.2 overs (Suryakumar Yadav 102*, Tilak Varma 37*, Bhuvneshwar Kumar 1/22).

While MI are all but out of the playoff race with just three wins in 11 outings, SRH are fourth in the points table with six wins in 10 games. SRH beat MI in a high-scoring affair earlier in the season. Here is the match preview.\n\nMumbai's Wankhede Stadium will host this game on May 6. The surface here will help batters. Pacers could receive help from the pitch due to slight seam movement with good carry. The match will start from 7:30pm onward. Fans can watch the game live on the Star Sports Network and stream the same on the Jio Cinema app and website (free).\n\nThe two teams have locked horns in 22 matches as of now, with MI winning 12 of those. Meanwhile, the Orange Army have won 10 encounters in this battle. Earlier this season, SRH racked up 277/3 against MI in Hyderabad before restricting MI to 246/5. SRH's total was then the highest IPL score and is currently the second-highest.\n\nMI would be disappointed as their destructive batting line-up has not delivered consistently. Jasprit Bumrah has been their lone warrior in the bowling department. There have also been questions on Hardik Pandya's leadership.

With the comprehensive triumph, MI kept their slim hopes of qualifying for the playoffs alive.\n\nBowling first after winning the toss, MI did well to restrict SRH to 173-8 as Hardik Pandya and Piyush Chawla claimed three wickets each. In the chase, Suryakumar Yadav (102* off 51) struck a sensational hundred to take Mumbai home in 17.2 overs.\n\nMumbai got off to a disastrous start, losing three wickets for 31 runs inside five overs. Ishan Kishan (9) was caught at slip off Marco Jansen's bowling, while Rohit Sharma (4) chipped one straight up in the air off Pat Cummins. Naman Dhir (0 off 9) tried to go after Bhuvneshwar Kumar, but ended up nicking one to first slip.\n\nSuryakumar, however, turned the contest on its head. He took on Jansen in the seventh over and slapped him for two fours and two sixes. The right-handed batter kept attacking the Hyderabad bowlers and brought up his 50 off only 30 balls.\n\nHaving found his rhythm, he was unstoppable and raced to three figures with flurry of big hits. After smacking Cummins for 4, 4, 6, he clobbered a low full toss from T Natarajan over long-off for a maximum to bring up his hundred and Mumbai Indians' victory. Suryakumar was ably supported by Tilak Varma (37* off 32) in an unbroken fourth-wicket stand of 143.\n\nPandya, Chawla restrict strong SRH batting line-up\n\nHyderabad got off to a typically aggressive start as they reached 51-0 at the end of five overs. There was some luck for Travis Head as he was bowled off a no ball by MI debutant Anshul Kamboj in the fifth over, which eventually ended up going for 19 runs.\n\nThe opening stand was broken when Abhishek Sharma (11) edged a probing delivery from Jasprit Bumrah to the keeper. Mayank Agarwal (5) eventually became Kamboj's first IPL victim as he was bowled attempting a slog. Head's luck soon ran out on 48 as he slog-swept a full ball from Chawla to deep-backward square leg.\n\nNitish Kumar Reddy (20) was the next to go, miscuing a pull off Pandya towards cover. Heinrich Klaasen (2) then inside-edged a full ball from Chawla onto his stumps. Pandya dismissed Shahbaz Ahmed (10) and Jansen (17) in the 16th over to reduce Sunrisers Hyderabad to 124-7. Shahbaz dragged one towards long-on, while Jansen was knocked over by a length ball that came back in sharply.\n\nSRH were eight down when Abdul Samad (3) was trapped lbw as he looked to work a length delivery from Chawla on the leg side, but missed the ball completely. An impressive cameo from skipper Cummins (35* off 17) pushed the team past the 170-run mark.\n\nMI vs SRH: Who won Player of the Match in yesterday's IPL 2024 match?\n\nSkipper Pandya and Chawla did well with the ball for Mumbai Indians, chipping in with three wickets each. In the chase, Suryakumar scored a typically stroke-filled hundred to lift them to victory.\n\nFor SRH, Head top-scored with 48, while Cummins hit a quick-fire 35* and picked up one wicket. Seasoned pacer Bhuvneshwar was economical with figures of 1-22.\n\nSuryakumar was the easy choice for Player of the Match for his scintillating knock.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "renin_wilben_albert@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Renin Wilben Albert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suryakumar_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Suryakumar Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piyush_Chawla", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Piyush Chawla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toss_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Toss (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Jansen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marco Jansen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardik_Pandya", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hardik Pandya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishan_Kishan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ishan Kishan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wankhede_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wankhede Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T.

The two teams in action on Monday find themselves in pretty much contrasting position on the points table with SRH very much alive in the race to the Playoffs and being the team that has grabbed all the attention because of the the way they have performed, MI are just the opposite.\n\nThe Blue and Gold Brigade just haven't got going in IPL 2024. In 11 matches, they have only 3 wins and they are the side that are being talked about because of them losing way too many games after they decided to change their captain before the 2024 season of the IPL. Can MI finish off the season on a high or will SRH complete a double over them after having smashed 277 against them in a reverse fixture?\n\nREAD HERE | Mumbai Indians (MI) OUT Of IPL 2024 Playoffs Race After Losing To KKR? All You Need To Know\n\nThe MI vs SRH IPL 2024 match is set to be played at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. The wicket here is a beautiful surface to bat on with the ball coming on to the bat nicely. Usually, batters can trust the pace on this surface and hit through the line. If it's a traditional Wankhede wicket, expect this to be a high-scoring encounter but if it's like the one which was witnessed in the most recent match which was played here where Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) were bundled out for 169 before MI only managed 145, then it will be a different story.\n\nALSO READ | Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024 Playoff Qualification Scenarios For All 10 Teams\n\nMI vs SRH IPL 2024 Match Prediction- Who Will Win?\n\nAs per Google's Win Probability Metre, MI have a 52% chance of winning this game, compared to SRH who are given a 48% chance. That suggests a pretty evenly contest game. Having said, this hasn't been MI's season at all and they could perhaps give some of the players on the bench a chance, with an eye on the subsequent seasons. Advantage to SRH who have been far more consistent than MI this season but then Mumbai haven't played to their potential either.

In a captivating encounter, MI emerged victorious by comfortably chasing down SRH's target.\n\nBatting first, SRH posted a competitive total of 173/8 in their allotted 20 overs. Travis Head spearheaded their innings with a solid 48 off 30 deliveries, setting a strong foundation. However, despite promising starts, Abhishek Sharma, Mayank Agarwal, Marco Jansen, and Nitish Kumar Reddy struggled to convert their innings into significant scores.\n\nMI's bowlers, Hardik Pandya and Piyush Chawla, shone brightly by picking up three wickets each, curbing SRH's run flow effectively. Despite a late flourish by Pat Cummins, who ended unbeaten on 35 off 17 balls, SRH could only post a challenging yet achievable total.\n\nIn their reply, MI faced early setbacks losing Ishan Kishan, Rohit Sharma, and Naman Dhir cheaply. However, Suryakumar Yadav played a phenomenal innings, smashing unbeaten 102 runs off just 51 balls with 12 boundaries and six massive sixes, guiding MI's chase with authority. Tilak Varma provided crucial support to Yadav, contributing 37 runs off 32 balls. Together, they formed a match-winning partnership that ensured MI comfortably reached the target with 16 balls to spare.\n\nNext up, Mumbai Indians will take on Kolkata Knight Riders at the Eden Gardens on May 11th, while Sunrisers Hyderabad will clash with Lucknow on May 8th at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad.\n\nAlso Read: IPL 2024 Qualification Scenarios: How can Sunrisers Hyderabad qualify for playoffs after loss against MI in Match 55?\n\nAfter the match, Pat Cummins, the captain of Sunrisers Hyderabad, reflected on their performance, stating they were perhaps a couple of runs short at the Wankhede Stadium. Cummins acknowledged the strong performance by Suryakumar Yadav and expressed optimism about their upcoming matches, hoping for more exciting performances ahead, especially when playing at home.\n\n\"Probably a couple short, at the Wankhede you want as many as you can get. You always feel like you're in, the wicket had a little bit in it so we were definitely in the game. I think Sanvir helped us get to that 170 instead of 150, ideally we'd have a bowler. It's T20 cricket, and it doesn't always work out. SKY played really well. We like playing at home, we'll wait and see what's ahead of us.

and move up in the Indian Premier League points table when the two teams clash here on Monday.\n\nPlaced fourth in the IPL points table with 12 points in 10 matches with six wins and four losses, SRH will be desperate to produce an all-round show and make improvements especially in their bowling department.\n\nAlso Read | MI vs SRH IPL 2024 Preview: Likely Playing XIs, Key Battles, H2H and More About Mumbai Indians vs SunRisers Hyderabad Indian Premier League Season 17 Match 55 in Mumbai.\n\nThe Pat Cummins-led side is in the midst of an intense battle between multiple teams who are bidding for spots in the final four, with Rajasthan Royals (16 points), Kolkata Knight Riders (14 points) and Lucknow Super Giants (12 points) placed above SRH.\n\nChennai Super Kings (5th with 10 points) and a resurgent Delhi Capitals (6th with 10 points) are breathing down SRH's neck, a scenario that would force the 2016 winners to shrug off any rust and get ready for an intense mid-table battle.\n\nAlso

Wankhede Stadium for the previous clash against KKR was an aberration, the free-flowing SRH batters would look to make merry and pile up a huge score as they have done several times this year.\n\nThe pitches here generally are batting-friendly and short boundary lengths at this venue make scores in excess of 200 a norm, but the MI-KKR contest played out on a sluggish surface last Friday challenged the batters to dig deep.\n\nSRH would be high on confidence having pipped the table-toppers RR by just one run in their previous outing, a game in which their bowlers pulled off a thrilling win.\n\nTravis Head (396 runs), Abhishek Sharma (315) and Heinrich Klaasen (337) remain the enforcers in SRH's batting but South African Aiden Markram would be keen to make a big score of his own, having had a mixed run so far.\n\nNitish Kumar Reddy (219 runs) has emerged as one of the most promising players for SRH in last few games which takes a significant amount of pressure off the key batters.\n\nT Natarajan's (15 wickets) accuracy would be handy for SRH as the left-arm pacer is chasing Mumbai Indians' Jasprit Bumrah (17) for the purple cap.\n\nFive-time winners Mumbai slipped to the bottom of the pool again when Royal Challengers Bengaluru trumped Gujarat Titans on Saturday night.\n\nWith only three wins in 11 matches, MI's challenge is all but over and there is only \"pride and name\" left to play for by their own admission.\n\nHowever, all is not lost as MI's key India players for the upcoming T20 World Cup, Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav and Hardik Pandya would remain in focus for their individual form.\n\nRohit's all-out aggressive approach has not yielded many big scores whereas the world number 1 T20 batter Suryakumar would be eyeing consistency after a fine half-century against KKR a few nights ago.\n\nIndia vice-captain Pandya has being consistently on the receiving end due to his ordinary form with both bat and ball and also his on-field decisions as MI skipper.\n\nThe all-rounder, however, would be keen to make amends and put an end to the criticism that he has been facing ever since this IPL edition got underway.\n\nTeams (from):\n\nMumbai Indians: Hardik Pandya (c), Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav, Dewald Brevis, Jasprit Bumrah, Piyush Chawla, Gerald Coetzee, Tim David, Shreyas Gopal, Ishan Kishan (wk), Anshul Kamboj, Kumar Kartikeya,

Photograph: BCCI\n\nA confident Sunrisers Hyderabad will look to produce a dominant show against a frail Mumbai Indians outfit and move up in the Indian Premier League points table when the teams clash in Mumbai on Monday.\n\nPlaced fourth in the table with 12 points from 10 matches after six wins and four defeats, SRH will be desperate to produce an all-round show and make improvements especially in their bowling department.\n\nThe Pat Cummins-led side is in the midst of an intense battle between multiple teams who are bidding for spots in the final four, with Rajasthan Royals (16 points), Kolkata Knight Riders (14 points) and Lucknow Super Giants (12 points) placed above SRH.\n\nChennai Super Kings (5th with 10 points) and a resurgent Delhi Capitals (6th with 10 points) are breathing down SRH's neck, a scenario that must force the 2016 winners to shrug off any rust and get ready for an intense mid-table battle.\n\nIf a two-paced pitch at the Wankhede stadium for the previous clash against KKR was an aberration, the free-flowing SRH batters will look to make merry and pile up a huge score as they have done several times this year.\n\nThe pitches at the Wankhede generally are batting-friendly and short boundary lengths at the venue makes scores in excess of 200 a norm, though the MI-KKR contest, played out on a sluggish surface last Friday, challenged the batters to dig deep.\n\nSRH will be high on confidence having pipped the table-toppers RR by just one run in their previous outing, their bowlers pulling off a thrilling win.\n\nTravis Head (396 runs), Abhishek Sharma (315) and Heinrich Klaasen (337) remain the enforcers in SRH's batting but South African Aiden Markram will be keen to make a big score of his own, having had a mixed run so far.\n\nNitish Kumar Reddy (219 runs) has emerged one of the most promising players for SRH in last few games, which takes a significant amount of pressure off the key batters.\n\nT Natarajan's (15 wickets) accuracy will be handy for SRH as the left-arm pacer is chasing Mumbai Indians' Jasprit Bumrah (17) for the 'Purple cap'.\n\nFive-time winners Mumbai Indians dropped to the bottom of the table again after Royal Challengers Bengaluru trumped Gujarat Titans on Saturday night.\n\nWith only three wins from 11 matches, MI's challenge is all but over and there is only \"pride and name\" left to play for by their own admission.\n\nHowever, all is not lost as MI's key India players for the upcoming T20 World Cup, Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav and Hardik Pandya, remain in focus for their individual form.\n\nRohit's all-out aggressive approach has not yielded many big scores whereas world No. 1 T20 batter Suryakumar will be eyeing consistency after a fine half-century against KKR a few nights ago.\n\nIndia vice-captain Pandya has being consistently on the receiving end due to his ordinary form with both bat and ball and also his on-field decisions as MI skipper.\n\nThe all-rounder, however, will be keen to make amends and put an end to the criticism that he has been facing ever since this IPL edition got underway.\n\nTeams (from):\n\nMumbai Indians: Hardik Pandya

The initial seven games of the season were rather standard, with just three instances of teams surpassing 200 runs in 14 innings, the highest being 208. However, Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) shattered expectations by setting a new benchmark, scoring a whopping 277 for 3. Their explosive batting display raised the bar for everyone else. Initially, it seemed like this record might be short-lived, as Mumbai Indians (MI) maintained a brisk pace in their chase, surpassing the required run rate halfway through. Nevertheless, SRH's bowlers managed to hold their ground in the latter half, securing a 31-run victory. However, SRH themselves surpassed this record just 19 days later.\n\nPat Cummins (C), Abdul Samad, Abhishek Sharma, Aiden Markram, Marco Jansen, Rahul Tripathi, Washington Sundar, Glenn Phillips, Sanvir Singh, Heinrich Klaasen, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mayank Agarwal, T.

Having lost eight of their 11 matches so far, MI are currently at the bottom of the points table and are almost out of the playoff race. SRH, on the other hand, have won six of their 10 games and are fourth in the standings, putting them in strong contention for the knockout stage.\n\nThis is the second time this season that the two teams are facing each other and cricket fans will not forget their previous encounter. Records were tumbled in Hyderabad as SRH posted 272 runs on the board - the then-highest-ever IPL total - and MI fought hard to chase it down but fell short by just 31 runs.\n\nSRH have been pulling off similar batting heroics throughout the series, while MI have continued to underperform. Notably, SRH are coming on the back of a thrilling 1-run win over table-toppers Rajasthan Royals, while MI enter after a 24-run loss to Kolkata Knight Riders. The five-time champions will be hoping for a positive result when SRH visit their home turf, the Wankhede Stadium, on Monday (May 6).\n\nIshan Kishan and Rohit Sharma have had a great start to their campaign, often giving the team a blazing start in the powerplay. However, as the tournament progressed, both lost their sharpness in attack, especially Rohit Sharma. The former MI captain has struggled in the last few matches as he has been dismissed for cheap scores.\n\nMeanwhile, Kishan was able to get off to a strong start in most of the matches but failed to capitalize on it. However, the last time MI took on SRH, the two made a powerful start to help their team get closer to the mammoth total.\n\nAlso Check: Orange Cap in IPL 2024- Most Runs\n\nSuryakumar Yadav has had an inconsistent run so far this series, one of the main reasons why MI have struggled to get going. He is considered one of the most reliable batters for MI in the middle order, but this time he did not live up to expectations. Tilak Varma is the leading run-scorer for MI in IPL 2024 with 347 runs. The youngster has been a consistent performer and a major force in MI's middle order.\n\nNehal Wadhera has played some good knocks in the limited opportunities he has had this season. The left-hander brings stability to the middle order and helps them to reach a competitive total. Tim David often bats in the lower-middle order and plays a finishing role. In the previous match against SRH, the Australian big-hitter had scored 42 off just 22 balls.\n\nHardik Pandya is going through a tough time in his comeback season with the Mumbai franchise. His team is currently at the bottom of the table and there has been no significant contribution from his side in either department to lift them up. Notably, his slow knock of 20 off 24 balls was partly the reason why MI were unable to chase down the target of 278 against SRH.\n\nMuhammad Nabi is an experienced campaigner, but his expertise has not been of much use to the struggling MI so far. The Afghanistan cricketer has picked up just one wicket in his last three outings and has not contributed much with the bat as well.\n\nVeteran India spinner Piyush Chawla will lead the spin attack for MI. Chawla recently surpassed Dwayne Bravo's tally of 183 wickets, to become the second-highest wicket-taker of all-time in IPL history. He took a wicket at an economy of just 5.00 in the last match against KKR and will aim to continue his form in the upcoming match as well.\n\nMI's key strength is their pace attack and their spearhead Jasprit Bumrah is in top form, not surprisingly. With 17 wickets from 11 matches, the right-arm pacer is currently the leading wicket-taker in the series. Bumrah had gone for an economy of just 9.00 when SRH batters made a mockery of the bowlers in their previous encounter. Gerald Coetzee is also in decent form but needs to control the run flow. Both will also have the assistance of Sri Lankan pacer Nuwan Thushara, who joins as an Impact Player.\n\nAlso Check: Purple Cap in IPL 2024 - Most Wickets\n\nIshan Kishan (wk), Rohit Sharma,

Suryakumar Yadav and Tilak Varma's scintillating display with the willow then gave Mumbai Indians a rare win in the Indian Premier League 2024.\n\nRiding on Suryakumar's 51-ball hundred and his unbroken third-wicket association of 143 off just 79 balls with Tilak - the third highest partnership of the season, Mumbai Indians overhauled the target of 174 with 16 balls to spare.\n\nAs it happened: MI beat SRH by seven wickets\n\nWhen Tilak took guard in the fifth over, however, Mumbai Indians was in a spot of bother. With the Sunrisers pace battery having reduced the home team to 31 for three, Mumbai Indians was in danger of letting the bowlers' good work down the drain yet again with another poor show by the top-order.\n\nIshan Kishan (straightened up by Marco Jansen to be caught in slips), Rohit Sharma (miscued a pull off Cummins) and Naman Dhir (slashed Bhuvneshwar to point) could not withstand the wrath. Even Suryakumar struggled against Cummins, failing to put a bat to any of his first three deliveries that swung away from his blade.\n\nBut in the seventh over, Suryakumar changed the complexion by taking on Marco Jansen. In what turned out to be a 22-run over, Suryakumar swung Jansen over fine-leg fence twice with his trademark behind-the-wicket innovations. Then on, Tilak played a perfect fiddle as Suryakumar continued to torment the Sunrisers attack.\n\nHad it not been for Chawla and Hardik's partnership with the ball, MI would have been chasing a stiffer target. | Photo Credit: Emmanual Yogini/The Hindu\n\nHad it not been for Chawla and Hardik's partnership with the ball, MI would have been chasing a stiffer target. | Photo Credit: Emmanual Yogini/The Hindu\n\nALSO READ: MI vs SRH, IPL 2024: Who is Anshul Kamboj, the 23-year-old debutant for Mumbai Indians against Sunrisers Hyderabad\n\nHe even settled the score with Cummins with three consecutive pull shots in the 17th over that brought MI on the cusp of a win and himself on the cusp of a hundred. He achieved both the milestones in the next over with the next ball he faced, lofting S. Natarajan over long-off for a six.\n\nHad it not been for Chawla and Hardik's partnership with the ball, MI would have been chasing a stiffer target.\n\nThe duo picked three crucial wickets - of Travis Head, Nitish KumarReddy and Heirich Klaasen - for just six runs in 11 balls to derail SRH from 90 for two to 96 for five. The duo shared another three scalps in the 16th and 17th overs to put MI on top before Cummins' cameo helped SRH cross the 170-run mark.\n\nLatest on SportstarIPL 2024 Purple Cap standings after MI vs SRH: Bumrah continues to stay on top; Harshal on secondTeam SportstarMI vs SRH Highlights IPL 2024: Suryakumar scores second IPL ton, guides Mumbai to seven-wicket win over Sunrisers HyderabadTeam SportstarMI vs SRH, IPL 2024: Surya's century lights up Wankhede, dims Sunrisers' top-four surge Amol KarhadkarIPL 2024 Orange Cap standings after MI vs SRH: Virat Kohli retains lead; Travis Head enters top fiveTeam SportstarSuryakumar Yadav scores second IPL hundred during MI vs SRH game at Wankhede StadiumTeam SportstarREAD MORE STORIES", "source": {"uri": "sportstar.thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportstar"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suryakumar_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Suryakumar Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Jansen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marco Jansen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilak_Varma", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tilak Varma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishan_Kishan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ishan Kishan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hindu", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Hindu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By_Type", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By Type", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://ss-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/z2zz3d/article68147175.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/image%2016.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540533", "eventUri": "eng-9540533", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Since then, his performance has dropped down so much, with only 65 runs coming in his five face-offs, at an average of 13, and a strike rate of 118.1.\n\nIshan Kishan has managed 257 runs in 11 innings at a strike rate of 150.29, but he too has struggled in this latter half of the tournament. Suryakumar Yadav looked in good touch and slowly is getting his mojo back with 232 runs in eight innings at a strike rate of close to 170.\n\nThe only positive for them in the batting department is Tilak Verma, who has collected 347 runs in 11 innings at a strike rate of over 151, with three fifty-plus scores. In the bowling section, it's all about Jasprit Bumrah. An economy of 6.50 in 43.5 overs with 17 wickets at an average of around 16 is nothing just crazy.\n\nGerald Coetzee has taken 13 wickets in 10 innings but his economy of 10.17 never helps the team in the middle phase of the game. The lack of wickets for their spinners hasn't helped them either as is the form of their captain H Pandya, whose eight wickets have come at 11 economy.\n\nMI's line-up vs SRH: Rohit Sharma, Ishan Kisha (wk,), Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Verma, Nehal Wadhera, Naman Dhir, Hardik Pandya (c), Tim David, Gerald Coetzee, Piyush Chawla, Jasprit Bumrah. (Impact Sub: Nuwan Thushara)\n\nAlso Read: IPL 2024: Jos Buttler And England Players To Miss IPL Playoffs\n\nEvery piece of the puzzle has been kept in the right place for the Hyderabad side. Travis Head has managed 396 runs in nine innings at a strike rate of around 194, while Abhishek Sharma has gained 315 in 10 innings at a strike rate of 208.60. Heinrich Klassen too has notched up 337 runs at a strike rate of 189.32.\n\nWith the ball in hand, Thangarasu Natarajan is the highest wicket-taker for SRH with 15 scalps in eight innings at an economy of 8.96, while Pat Cummins has done a special job in the captaincy and breaking the partnership at the crucial juncture of the game with 12 scalps at an economy of 9.05.\n\nSRH's line-up vs MI: Abhishek Sharma, Travis Head, Anmolpreet Singh, Nitish Reddy, Heinrich Klassen (wk.), Marco Jansen, Shahbaz Ahmed, Abdul Samad, Pat Cummins (c), Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jaydev Unadkat (Impact Sub: T Natarajan)\n\nThe MI vs SRH fixture will happen on May 06, 2024, at the iconic Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai.", "source": {"uri": "sportzwiki.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportzwiki"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasprit_Bumrah", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jasprit Bumrah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wankhede_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wankhede Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardik_Pandya", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hardik Pandya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajasthan Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Coetzee", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gerald Coetzee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rinku_Singh_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rinku Singh (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suryakumar_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suryakumar Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishan_Kishan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ishan Kishan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambati_Rayudu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ambati Rayudu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

This season SRH already beat MI once by 31 runs, while MI defeated SRH twice in the last season.\n\nAfter losing four matches in a row, Mumbai is virtually out of the race to the playoffs. The five-time champion is sitting at the bottom with only three wins in eleven matches. In the last match, they lost to KKR at Wankhede after a long 12 years.\n\nOn the other hand, SRH made a comeback after defeating the table-leader RR in the last match. After ten matches, the Nizams are at fourth with 12 points in ten matches.\n\nIPL 2024 MI vs SRH: Bowling Squad Comparison\n\nJasprit Bumrah and Gerald Coetzee are on a wicket-spree this season. Nuwan Thusara was also in decent form and was spot-on in the match against KKR. Skipper Hardik Pandya also bagged eight wickets this season.\n\nPiyush Chawla, the only seasoned spinner in the squad could be useful against the SRH middle-order if the pitch remains the same as the last match.\n\nThis season the Sunrisers have relied heavily on their sheer batting prowess, which also deviates them from formulating a proper plan B. Spinners are the other weak points for them.\n\nPat Cummins, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, T. Natarajan, Marco Jansen, Jayadev Unadkat; all the Hyderabad pacers are in fine form, and make the main bowling attack of SRH. Whereas spinners like Mayank Markande and Shahbaz Ahmed are yet to shine in this season.\n\nIPL 2024 MI vs SRH: Who would be the highest wicket-takers in Match 55?\n\nJasprit Bumrah (MI): The best bowler in this IPL, has bagged 17 wickets in eleven matches, with an economy rate of 6.25. His meagre bowling with the ability to deliver accurate yorkers one after another, made him one of the deadliest bowlers in the limited-overs cricket.\n\nIn the match against SRH, his role will be to cause an upset for the Hyderabad openers, who have been giving explosive starts throughout the season.\n\nNuwan Thushara (MI): The 29-year-old Srilankan right-arm fast bowler has played only four matches in the IPL and picked up four wickets. Being expensive is the only concern for him.\n\nIn the last match against KKR, Thushara single-handedly destroyed the mighty Knights' top-order with three wickets in just two overs. A similar fiery spell against SRH will be expected from this Srilankan international.\n\nT Natarajan (SRH): The 33-year-old left-arm medium-fast bowler has been brilliant this season with 15 wickets in just eight matches. Natarajan currently is the fourth-highest wicket-taker this season. Along with Pat Cummins the Indian pacer will play a vital role in toppling the MI top order.\n\nPat Cummins (SRH): The Hyderabad skipper has picked up 12 wickets this season with a decent economy rate. The Australian right-arm fast bowler has 57 career wickets in IPL. In the match against MI, he will be crucial to get an early breakthrough by scalping Mumbai's opening pairs.\n\nThere is nothing to lose for the Islanders this season as they are virtually out of the race to the playoffs. But for SRH this match is highly important, as they have a neck-to-neck competition with CSK and LSG for the third and fourth spot in the points table.\n\nBoth the teams have posted multiple 200-plus scores this season, and except for the last match the venue is known as a good batting ground. Hence, a high-score drama is expected from this clash of titans.", "source": {"uri": "mykhel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "myKhel.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "prateek_mascharak@mykhel.com", "name": "Prateek Mascharak", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardik_Pandya", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hardik Pandya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasprit_Bumrah", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jasprit Bumrah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wankhede_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wankhede Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Run rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T.

But as skipper Hardik Pandya said at the toss the team needed to play for their pride and their fans, this win would have surely made the supporters happy.\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad (SRH), who had a great start to the season, are slowly starting to falter so close to the playoffs mark. They lost two consecutive matches (against RCB and CSK), won the game against Rajasthan by the barest of margin, and now lost again to the bottom-ranked team. As of now, SRH are positioned fourth with 12 points with a lot to be done to qualify for the knockouts.\n\nSuryakumar Yadav was the difference between both sides on the field on Monday night. The flamboyant 360-degree batter finished the match off with a six, notching up his second century this season off just 51 balls.\n\nMumbai started the chase of 174 with a good pace but soon lost their first wicket when Ishan Kishan edged the ball towards the first slip in the second over. SRH captain Pat Cummins came into the attack and wasted no time in taking his first scalp, dismissing Rohit Sharma in the 4th over as wicket-keeper Heinrich Klassen took a brilliant catch running backwards.\n\nCummins' first four deliveries to Suryakumar Yadav felt like a proper Test cricket battle with all the play-and-miss action taking place. SRH was successful in building the pressure in that over, aiding Bhuvneshwar Kumar in the next to dismiss Naman Dhir for a duck.\n\nStay updated with the latest from IPL 2024, including top contenders for the IPL 2024 ORANGE CAP and IPL 2024 PURPLE CAP. Explore the complete IPL 2024 SCHEDULE, IPL 2024 POINTS TABLE and players with the MOST SIXES, MOST FOURS and MOST FIFTIES in IPL 2024\n\nSoon after the powerplay, SKY decided to take on Marco Jansen and shift the momentum in the home team's favour. He smashed 22 runs in Jansen's second over which included two fours and two sixes.\n\nSKY completed his half-century in 30 balls with a four to Jansen in the 13th over. Suryakumar also became the 2nd batter after Rohit Sharma to record 25 scores of 50+ for Mumbai Indians in the IPL.\n\nOnce Suryakumar got going, there was no looking back. He scored his second IPL hundred and led Mumbai Indians to their fourth win of the season with the help of Tilak Varma on the other end. The duo built a match-winning partnership of 143 off 79 balls.\n\nEarlier, Mumbai Indians had a good start after winning the toss and choosing to field first. The expectations were high from SRH's dynamic opening pair of Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma to give them an explosive start yet again. But the home team managed to keep them to the score of 32 in the first four overs.\n\nDebutant Anshul Kamboj took his first IPL wicket in the form of Travis Head but as luck would have it, it turned out to be a no-ball. All the celebrations turned to disappointment and Head added salt to the wounds by hitting a four on the very next ball which was a free hit.\n\nMI's most lethal weapon, Jasprit Bumrah gave the team the first breakthrough by dismissing Abhishek in the last over of the powerplay. The southpaw tried cutting the short delivery but the ball found an edge and Ishan Kishan took a brilliant flying catch behind the wickets.\n\nTravis Head got a third life and again on the same bowler Anshul as he was dropped on 44 by Nuwan Thusara at deep third man. After coming too close to his first IPL wicket twice, Anshul finally got his first scalp in the same over as he castled Mayank Agarwal.\n\nHyderabad had a very quite first half, especially from their standards. They could only manage 88 runs in the first 10 overs of their innings with two wickets. Head's luck finally ended as he was dismissed by leg-spinner Piyush Chawla in the 11th over. The SRH opener tried slogging one over the mid-wicket boundary but ended up handing an easy catch to Tilak Varma on the boundary.\n\nSkipper Pandya came back for his third over and dismissed in-form Nitish Reddy in the very next over.\n\nPiyush came back and took another wicket of SRH, castling the explosive South African Heinrich Klassen with a googly. Pandya gave two breakthroughs to MI in his final over. Shabaz and Marco Jansen were his victims.\n\nYoungster Abdul Samad also didn't make much of a difference to the scorecard as he was dismissed Piyush at a score of 3.\n\nWith only 136 runs on the board at the 17-over mark and already 8 wickets down, SRH had to bring in their impact player. All-rounder Sanvir Singh replaced opener Abhishek Sharma. SRH ended their innings with a little cameo from skipper Pat Cummins (35*) which helped the team to reach a total of 173/8 in their 20 overs.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news",

SRH posted a record-shattering 277/3 and MI also gave a great account of themselves to get to 246/5. The Orange Army emerged victorious by 31 runs in what was only their second game in Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024.\n\nMore than a month later, the two teams are placed contrastingly on the points table. Sunrisers are stationed at No. 4, having won six and lost four out of their 10 matches. Meanwhile, Mumbai are languishing at the bottom of the table with just three wins and eight losses from 11 games.\n\nMumbai's highest run-getter this season has been Tilak Varma. He has scored 347 runs from 11 innings at an average of 38.56 and a strike rate of 151.53. Former captain Rohit Sharma is the second in the list of leading run-getters for Mumbai this season, having scored 326 runs at an average of 32.60 and a strike rate of 154.50. However, skipper Hardik Pandya's form with both bat and ball has been pedestrian.\n\nIn the bowling department, Jasprit Bumrah is holding the Purple Cap, with 17 wickets from 11 matches at an average of 16.12. He has been well-supported by Gerald Coetzee, who is playing his first season in the cash-rich league. The South African bowler has bagged 13 wickets from 10 matches at 26.23.\n\nAlso Check: IPL 2024 Points Table\n\nSunrisers have been the most dangerous batting unit in the tournament. They have amassed a 200-plus score five times in their 10 matches. The likes of Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma, and Heinrich Klaasen have been in scintillating form. Head is the leading run-getter for the former champions, having scored 396 rruns from nine innings at an average of 44 and a strike rate of 194.12.\n\nOn the bowling front, T Natarajan sits at No. 2 on the Purple Cap list, having accounted for 15 wickets in eight games at 19.13. He has received decent support from SRH captain Pat Cummins. Bhuvneshwar Kumar rolled back the years by picking up a three-for against a dominant Rajasthan Royals side in the last game. Sunrisers will be brimming with confidence after beating table toppers Royals recently by a solitary run and would want to consolidate their position in the top four with a win on Monday.\n\nAlso Check: IPL 2024 Schedule\n\nFive games have been played at the Wankhede Stadium in IPL 2024 and two have been won by the chasing teams, while three by the teams batting first. The average first innings score is 186. The ball tends to swing for the first couple of overs at the Wankhede. In the last game, the pitch was slower than normal and the spinners got a good amount of assistance, even with some dew around. Kolkata Knight Riders managed to defend a target of 170, which felt below-par. However, it has to be mentioned that the Mumbai batters, from Suryakumar Yadav, didn't apply themselves at the crease. Winning the toss and opting to bowl first could be a good option. It will give the chasing team a chance to assess the conditions.\n\nClick Here: MI vs SRH Live Score, Match 55\n\nMumbai played with just three overseas players in the last game, leaving Mohammad Nabi out for Naman Dhir. The experienced Afghan all-rounder could come back for this encounter. Rohit had a minor back niggle in the last game and came out to bat as the Impact Player. The Indian captain could walk back into the starting XI and Nuwan Thushara can come in later as the Impact Player.\n\nPredicted XI: Ishan Kishan (WK), Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma, Nehal Wadhera, Hardik Pandya (C), Tim David, Mohammad Nabi, Gerald Coetzee, Piyush Chawla, Jasprit Bumrah\n\nImpact Player: Nuwan Thushara\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad have given Anmolpreet Singh a couple of chances at No. 3 and the right-handed batter registered scores of 0 and 5. The visitors could look to bring back Aiden Markram, who was dropped for the last game, and leave out Marco Jansen, who conceded 44 runs and went wicketless in his four overs. Leg-spinner Mayank Markande can come back in place of Anmolpreet.\n\nPredicted XI: Abhishek Sharma, Travis Head, Aiden Markram, Heinrich Klaasen (WK), Nitish Kumar Reddy, Abdul Samad, Shahbaz Ahmed, Pat Cummins (C), Mayank Markande, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jaydev Unadkat", "source": {"uri": "crictracker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricTracker"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wankhede_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wankhede Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilak_Varma", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tilak Varma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T.

IPL 2024 Match 55", "body": "The MI vs SRH IPL 2024 reverse fixture will be played in Mumbai on Monday, May 6. The match starts at 7.30 pm IST with SRH looking to get to 14 points, The campaign is almost done for MI after their recent loss to KKR.\n\nMI lost to KKR for the first time in 12 years at the Wankhede stadium. They could not chase 170 which was a well-getable total for the mighty Mumbai batting lineup. However, their innings were derailed first by the spinners and then by Mitchell Starc who closed the game for KKR as they won by 24 runs.\n\nA comeback from here looks impossible for MI. They have not been led well by their skipper Hardik Pandya and their batters also have not stepped up in crunch situations. MI conceded 277 against SRH in the previous match. The next match is against the same side and MI are looking in an uncomfortable position at the moment.\n\nSRH managed to win a thriller against RR. Bhuvneshwar Kumar defended 13 off the final over to give Hyderabad two crucial points, A win like that can unite a team big time, especially with their sights on the playoffs. SRH will travel to Mumbai for a match against the MI side.\n\nHaving beaten MI comfortably in the last match, SRH will be confident about replicating the heroics. SRh's spin attack is a concern and they might want to bring in someone like Mayank Markande for this match instead of Shabaz Ahmed with the leg spiners getting more purchase from this wicket.\n\nThe MI pitch had a very different look in the MI vs KKR game. The pitch was slow and the ball was stopping as the KKR batters pointed out after the game. It was the undoing of the home side in the end. It will be interesting to see whether the pitch goes back to normal in the next game with the batters looking for some runs on this wicket.\n\nThere are no fitness and injury concerns from both teams. Both sides have rotated their players keeping in mind the conditions and the opposition.\n\nForm-wise, the MI batters lack confidence while the SRH batters especially their openers have played with an aggressive intent throughout the season. The batting intent might make the difference in the end. The SRH bowling attack has been a much more cohesive unit while for MI, they have relied heavily on Jasprit Bumrah.\n\nAlso Read: LSG vs KKR Match Prediction- Who Will Win Today IPL Match? IPL 2024 Match 54\n\nHardik Pandya's captaincy has been constantly questioned in the matches lost by MI. Against KKR, Hardik pushed himself down the order when he needed to bat himself up the order. With the ball, he did owl his quota of overs but did not complete Piyush Chawla his quota of overs.\n\nFor Pat Cummins, he has been very methodical with the ball and his use of bowlers. His batters are giving him runs at the top order as well.\n\nWho Will Score Most Runs For MI: Rohit Sharma / Suryakumar Yadav\n\nWho Will Take Most Wickets For MI: Jasprit Bumrah / Piyush Chawla\n\nWho Will Score Most Runs For SRH: Travis Head / Abhishek Sharma\n\nWho Will Take Most Wickets For SRH: Buvneshwar Kumar / T Natarajan\n\nGiven MI's recent form, they have a tough opposition to face next with Sunrisers Hyderabad having. a better chance to end up as the winning side. The win prediction is tilted towards SRH.\n\nMI are still mathematically in with a chance but practically they have no chance of making the playoffs as they need a lot of things to go their way in the remaining matches. SRH have their future firmly in their hands to control from here on.\n\nAlso Read: MI vs SRH: \"Hardik Pandya is drained..looks flat..\"- Aaron Finch's jaw-dropping allegations", "source": {"uri": "cricketaddictor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketAddictor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wankhede_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wankhede Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Run rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Starc", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mitchell Starc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayank_Markande", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayank Markande"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardik_Pandya", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hardik Pandya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhuvneshwar_Kumar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bhuvneshwar Kumar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

The Orange Army are placed fourth and will want a victory in their final away game of the league stage to put some pressure on the Chennai Super Kings (CSK), who are currently third.\n\nMumbai are virtually out, but they have pride to play for. The five-time IPL champions are a decorated franchise, and being embarrassed in the way they have been so far in IPL 2024 won't sit right with the players and the team management.\n\nCan Pat Cummins and Co. silence another home crowd? Or will the Mumbai Indians finally wake up?\n\nIPL 2024, MI vs SRH Win Probability: Close contest on the cards\n\nEven though MI have been hugely disappointing so far in IPL 2024, their clash against SRH isn't easy to predict.\n\nThe SunRisers' batting fragilities have been exposed in the last few games. When Travis Head, Heinrich Klaasen and Abhishek Sharma haven't got going, the Orange Army haven't been able to do enough with the bat even though Nitish Kumar Reddy has put the team on his back a couple of times.\n\nRahul Tripathi, Anmolpreet Singh and Mayank Agarwal have flopped, while Shahbaz Ahmed doesn't offer enough to the side in either department. If MI can produce a couple of early breakthroughs in the powerplay, Hyderabad could struggle.\n\nThe Wankhede Stadium produced a bowler-friendly wicket in the last game, and if that happens, both teams will need to rethink their team combinations. MI might want to bring Mohammad Nabi back to threaten the SRH opening pair, while Cummins might want former Mumbai leggie Mayank Markande in his ranks.\n\nMumbai's fortunes could hinge heavily on their opening pair, with both Rohit Sharma and Ishan Kishan enduring a lean run lately. Things won't be easy against the likes of Bhuvneshwar Kumar and T Natarajan, and SRH have the options needed to continue the strangle in the middle overs.\n\nOn the whole, the two teams are evenly matched on paper, even if their displays so far in IPL 2024 haven't reflected that. While anything could happen on Monday, SRH might start as the slight favorites.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sai_krishna@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Sai Krishna", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chennai Super Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajasthan Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

Rohit Sharma vs Marco Jansen", "body": "The Mumbai Indians (MI) will lock horns with the SunRisers Hyderabad (SRH) at the Wankhede Stadium on Monday, May 6, in match number 55 of the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL 2024).\n\nThe Hardik Pandya-led Mumbai are languishing at the bottom of the points table. They have managed to secure just three wins from 11 outings and need a miraculous turnaround at this stage.\n\nPat Cummins' Hyderabad, on the other hand, have six victories to their name after 10 matches. The 2016 champions are currently placed fourth in the standings. A win here would take them to the third position.\n\nThis will be the second time that Mumbai and Hyderabad will face each other this season. When the two teams met earlier, SRH registered a massive 277-run total at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium.\n\nMI did not go down without a fight despite the daunting target. The five-time champions finished 246/5 in 20 overs, suffering a 31-run defeat. The reverse fixture between the star-studded teams is also expected to be a high-octane one.\n\nHere, we take a look at three match-ups from the MI vs SRH match that could have a significant impact on the result.\n\n#1 Rohit Sharma (MI) vs Marco Jansen (SRH)\n\nFormer MI skipper Rohit Sharma has struggled to score runs consistently this season. The ace opener has scored 326 runs from 11 innings at an average of 32.60 and a strike rate of 154.50.\n\nSharma has also been troubled by left-arm fast bowlers, getting out five times to them. SRH captain Pat Cummins could use tall left-arm pacer Marco Jansen up front in search of an early breakthrough.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that Sharma has gotten out six times within the powerplay in IPL 2024, making the contest between the veteran batter and Jansen would be crucial for both sides.\n\n#2 Jasprit Bumrah (MI) vs Travis Head (SRH)\n\nMumbai's pace bowling spearhead Jasprit Bumrah has been in spectacular form this year. The speedster is currently the Purple Cap holder of IPL 2024, picking up 17 wickets from 11 innings at a brilliant economy rate of 6.25.\n\nThe onus will be on Bumrah to provide his team with an impressive start against Hyderabad's explosive opener Travis Head. The southpaw has set the stage ablaze with his blistering batting exploits.\n\nHead has amassed 396 runs from nine innings at a strike rate of 194.11. Bumrah is yet to dismiss the left-handed batter in the T20 format and has conceded 23 runs in 17 balls.\n\n#3 Suryakumar Yadav (MI) vs Pat Cummins (SRH)\n\nSuryakumar Yadav notched up a half-century in Mumbai's previous match against Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), scoring 56 runs off 35 balls in a losing cause.\n\nThe home team would want the swashbuckling batter to come up with a stunning performance against the dangerous Hyderabad team. Captain Pat Cummins could back himself to do the job against the batting star.\n\nCummins has dismissed Suryakumar twice in the T20 format. The MI batter has been out eight times this season, and all his dismissals have come against seamers.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aditya_suketu_desai@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Aditya Suketu Desai", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Jansen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marco Jansen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wankhede_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wankhede Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasprit_Bumrah", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jasprit Bumrah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economy rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suryakumar_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suryakumar Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerplay_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Powerplay (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Left-Handed_Products", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Left-Handed Products", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/fa5b1-17149834656679-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540533", "eventUri": "eng-9540533", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 110, "textEnd": 115}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

This was Mumbai Indians' fourth win of the season.\n\nSuryakumar Yadav owned the night with a scintillating hundred as he paved the way for Mumbai Indians' victory over Sunrisers Hyderabad in IPL 2024. Having won just three matches in 11 outings before this, Mumbai Indians had their backs stacked against the wall. On top of that, a batting failure had seen them succumb to a loss at home in their last match. They were up against a side that had struck what is now the second-highest IPL total earlier this season. With every odds stacked against them, the five-time champions found a way to bounce back and hand the Sunrisers Hyderabad, one of the teams in contention to make the playoffs, a seven-wicket defeat. Probably such a performance, especially from the bat of Suryakumar Yadav, has come a bit late, but Indian cricket fans would be happy that it has arrived in time with the ICC T20 World Cup approaching. IPL 2024 Points Table Updated With Net Run Rate.\n\nHaving won the toss, Mumbai Indians opted to bowl first and Sunrisers Hyderabad's fiery opening partnership between Abhishek Sharma and Travis Head yielded 56 runs before the former had to make his way back to the crease after edging behind to a Jasprit Bumrah delivery. Debutant Anshul Kamboj thought he had Travis Head only for the no-ball siren to go off and turn his happiness to gloom. He did manage to get the wicket of Mayank Agarwal, who made his comeback in this match. Mumbai Indians kept picking up wickets at regular intervals, not allowing the Sunrisers' batting to gain any momentum whatsoever. Hardik Pandya (3/32) and Piyush Chawla (3/33) did the bulk of the damage in the middle overs before a 19-ball 37-run stand between Pat Cummins and Sanvir Singh saw the visitors post 173/8. Viral Moments From MI vs SRH IPL 2024 Match: Rohit Sharma's Dejected Reaction, Suryakumar Yadav's Flying Kiss and Other Highlights From Mumbai Indians vs Sunrisers Hyderabad Clash.\n\nIn response, Mumbai Indians' lost their top three with just 31 runs on the board, giving fans a flashback of what happened at this venue against KKR few days ago. This time, though, Suryakumar did not fail to take his team over the line. He and Tilak Varma stitched an undefeated 143-run partnership off 79 balls, which helped Mumbai Indians chase down the target in 17.2 overs. Suryakumar completed the run chase with a six over covers which also fetched him a century, his second in the IPL off 51 balls, a knock that included 12 fours and six sixes. As Mumbai Indians gain confidence from this win, Sunrisers Hyderabad's chances of finishing inside the top four took a blow and now they would look to do their best in the three remaining matches.

MI are currently last on the points table, while SRH are placed fourth.\n\nSRH were involved in a thriller for the ages against RR in their last match. Fifties from Travis Head and Nitish Kumar Reddy followed by a final impulse from Heinrich Klaasen pushed SRH to 200. RR then lost two wickets in the first over, before fifties from Yashasvi Jaiswal and Riyan Parag then put them back on the track, before some amazing death bowling by Pat Cummins and T Natarajan gave SRH a foot in the door. Bhuvneshwar Kumar who had taken two wickets in the first over itself, successfully defended 13 off the last over as SRH won by just one run.\n\nMI started their latest game, at home against KKR amazingly having reduced them to 57/5. Venkatesh Iyer and Manish Pandey then set on to recover, until a death overs burst only restricted MI to 167. Sunil Narine, Varun Chakravarthy, Andre Russell and Mitchell Starc then shared in the bowling spoils as no batter other than Suryakumar Yadav did anything of note for MI slumping them to their fourth consecutive defeat.\n\nThe reverse fixture at Hyderabad was the first in a very long line of matches that tumbled batting records left right and centre. The record for the fastest IPL fifty for SRH was broken twice in the same innings, first by Travis Head, then by Abhishek Sharma. SRH broke even more batting records, but most importantly, broke the then record for the highest team total in IPL(a record they would once again break further in the season). MI tried to fight and put on a fine batting display losing only by 31 runs given the huge target in front of them. MI will look to move away from the bottom of the table and break their losing streak.\n\nWankhede Stadium is known to be a batter-friendly pitch, but in the last match, it showed a new form where it was heavily helping the bowlers and posing challenges to the batters. This may not necessarily persist, but it is likely that it will stay thereabouts. This pitch will not necessarily churn out a surface that will let SRH post 277 again, but typical batting friendliness associated with the Wankhede Stadium will stay.\n\nOut of 114, 61 matches have been won by the team batting second. The average first innings score at this venue is 170 without any no results.\n\nThe Wankhede is very likely to provide support to the bowlers more than it has been. The bowlers will be heaving a sigh of relief as they will be able to contribute to the match. The batters need to be careful rather than just throw their wickets away as batters from both sides did here in the last match. MI's bowling form issues will also be plaguing them. While SRH's bowling will be brimming with confidence after some excellent showing at the death propelled them to a 1-run win. The important matchups are Jasprit Bumrah vs Abhishek Sharma, Piyush Chawla vs Heinrich Klaasen, Rohit Sharma vs Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Suryakumar Yadav vs Pat Cummins, Tim David vs T Natarajan.\n\nKumar has dismissed India's all-format captain just once in the IPL. Rohit though, has scored 81 runs in 61 balls at an average of 81 and strike rate of 132.78. This match-up will be crucial in the powerplay.\n\nThe other Sharma of note in this contest has managed only 8 runs in 10 balls at a strike rate of 80 while being dismissed once at an average of 8. Sharma is currently leading the strike rate charts this season, and this battle will again put his skills to the test.\n\nOn a pitch that wouldn't be extremely helpful to batters, MI's most consistent and arguably the most skilled batsman Suryakumar Yadav will be key to their chances. If he had received some support in the last match, the story could have been different.\n\nHeinrich Klaasen's good form will again be the fulcrum of SRH's batting considering the recent drop in form of all their other batsmen. His impetus towards the end is very crucial for SRH.", "source": {"uri": "crictracker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricTracker"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhuvneshwar_Kumar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bhuvneshwar Kumar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wankhede_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wankhede Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "T.

The 2016 champions have already beaten the five-time champions this season and are looking to make the scoreline 2-0.\n\nMumbai, who are currently at the bottom of the points table, are mathematically alive in the tournament but their chances of qualifying for the next round are almost over. They will host the upcoming match at the Wankhede Stadium on Monday (May 6) and hope to give their fans something to cheer about.\n\nMI and SRH have locked horns in 22 matches since the latter made their IPL debut in 2013. Mumbai have a slight edge in this head-to-head record with 11 wins against SRH who have completed 10 wins including one in the ongoing season.\n\nAlso Read: Sunrisers Hyderabad strongest predicted XI against Mumbai Indians\n\nDavid Warner, who led SRH to their only title win in 2016, is the highest run-scorer against MI. The former SRH opener has amassed 524 runs in 12 matches, including five half-centuries. Shikhar Dhawan is second on this list with 436 runs, followed by Manish Pandey with 215 runs.\n\nVeteran pacer Bhuvaneshwar Kumar tops the list of bowlers who have taken the most wickets (19 scalps in 15 matches) for SRH against MI.

In the 8th match of the ongoing 2024 IPL, SRH smashed 277 for the loss of three wickets. Openers Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma's blistering fifties at a strike rate of over 250 and Heinrich Klaasen's 34-ball 80 were the major forces behind the second-highest score in IPL history.\n\nSRH's lowest total against MI was in the 2019 edition. After electing to field first, SRH bowlers put in a brilliant display to restrict their opponents to a paltry total of 136/7. However, MI, known for defending low scores, bowled out SRH for just 96 runs to win the game by 40 runs.\n\n1. SRH's 277/3 against MI in Hyderabad in the 2024 season is the second-highest total in IPL history.\n\n2. Abhishek Sharma in 16 balls and Travis Head in 19 balls scored the fastest and second-fastest fifties for SRH respectively in the above-mentioned match. Abhishek's strike rate of 273.91 in his 63(23) in this match is the 4th highest in an IPL innings of a minimum of 40 runs for SRH.\n\n3. Aiden Markram and Heinrich Klaasen's unbeaten partnership of 116 is the highest for the 4th wicket for SRH, and the second-highest for the 4th wicket against MI.\n\n4. In Visakhapatnam in 2016, Naman Ojha made 4 dismissals as a wicketkeeper, which is the most dismissals for SRH and joint-most against MI.\n\n5.

Later in the 17th over, Chawla picked Abdul Samad's (3) wicket in the 17th over.\n\nIn the end, Pat Cummins (35*) and Sanvir Singh (8) were unbeaten on the crease and took SRH to 173/8.\n\nPandya and Chawla picked up three wickets each in their respective spells and led the Mumbai bowling attack. While Anshul Kamboj and Jasprit Bumrah picked one wicket each. Nuwan Thushara was the only MI bowler who failed to pick wickets in the game.\n\nThe Mumbai-based franchise need to make 174 runs to win the match infront of their home crowd.\n\nBrief score: Sunrisers Hyderabad (Travis Head 48, Pat Cummins 35*, Nitish Reddy 20; Hardik Pandya 3/31) vs Mumbai Indians.

Travis Head top-scored for them with a knock of 48 (30), while Pat Cummins played a brilliant cameo of 35* (18) to finish the innings on a high. Hardik Pandya and Piyush Chawla starred for MI with the ball, scalping three wickets apiece.\n\nSRH pacers then bowled magnificently with the new ball and reduced MI to 31/3 in 4.1 overs. Rohit Sharma (4), Ishan Kishan (9), and Naman Dhir (0) were back in the dugout without scoring much.\n\nSuryakumar Yadav and Tilak Varma joined hands at this juncture and weathered the storm by batting sensibly.

Tilak Varma supported him with a handy knock of 37* (32).\n\nFans on social media enjoyed the IPL 2024 match between MI and SRH on Monday night.

Little bit in there on the wicket early. I always thought that the wicket had something about it. Having Sunny out there helped us get to 170.\"\n\nHe added:\n\n\"A quick bowler would have been great but I don't think that would have made a difference. It's T20 cricket and doesn't really work out the way you want. SKY took the game away for us.

MI are languishing at the bottom of the points table with only three victories in 11 games. In their last game, the bowling unit did well to bundle out KKR for 169. Nuwan Thushara and Jasprit Bumrah took three wickets each.\n\nDespite the impressive knock from Suryakumar Yadav (56), MI were all-out for 145 and lost by 24 runs.\n\nMeanwhile, SRH are doing well with six wins in 10 appearances and are fourth in the table. Their latest outing saw them post a formidable total of 201 against the Rajasthan Royals.\n\nNitish Reddy (76*) top-scored for the side and Travis Head (58) and Heinrich Klaasen (42*) were impressive as well. Thereafter, the bowling unit, especially Bhuvneshwar Kumar (3/41), held their nerve to seal a one-run victory.\n\nAs per head-to-head records, Mumbai hold an edge with 12 victories in 22 games against SRH. It has been a close contest in the last five games, with MI winning three of them.\n\nOn that note, let's look at the action that transpired in the last IPL game between MI and SRH at Wankhede.\n\nMI secured a dominant victory over SRH at Wankhede in IPL 2023\n\nMumbai Indians and SunRisers Hyderabad clashed in the penultimate league game of IPL 2023 at the Wankhede Stadium. The home side opted to bowl first in the day game, which initially looked like the right decision.\n\nSRH were off to a strong start with the opening duo of debutant Vivrant Sharma and Mayank Agarwal. They helped the SunRisers cross the 50-run mark in the powerplay overs and then continued their acceleration.\n\nIn just 11 overs, the prolific pair added 100 runs, demonstrating their ball-striking abilities. However, a few overs later, Akash Madhwal broke the 140-run stand by dismissing Sharma (69 off 47). Interestingly, Sharma registered the record for scoring the most runs by a debutant in an IPL innings.\n\nAlthough Agarwal looked in great touch after his partner's dismissal, Madhwal also sent him to the pavilion in the 17th over. The veteran batter slammed 83 off 46 balls, with eight fours and four sixes.\n\nThe rest of the batting unit couldn't provide a final flourish for the visitors, as SRH finished on 200/5. Madhwal was the pick of the bowlers with figures of 4/37 for MI.\n\nIn response, Mumbai lost Ishan Kishan (14) early in a big chase, courtesy of Bhuvneshwar Kumar. However, Rohit Sharma and Cameron Green were imperious with their timing and positive intent, as MI reached the 50-run mark in less than six overs.\n\nThe duo continued their dominance to add a 128-run stand before Rohit (56) was dismissed by Mayank Dagar. Nevertheless, Green looked at his dominating best and justified his high price tag by slamming 100* off 47 balls, with eight fours and as many sixes.\n\nAlong with Suryakumar Yadav (25*), he remained unbeaten as MI romped to victory in 18 overs.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tejas_rathi@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Tejas Rathi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wankhede_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wankhede Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasprit_Bumrah", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jasprit Bumrah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajasthan Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivrant_Sharma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vivrant Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suryakumar_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suryakumar Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayank_Agarwal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayank Agarwal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhuvneshwar_Kumar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bhuvneshwar Kumar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Klaasen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heinrich Klaasen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akash_Madhwal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Akash Madhwal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishan_Kishan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ishan Kishan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Not out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayank_Dagar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayank Dagar"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/726e1-17149869247556-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540533", "eventUri": "eng-9540533", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 125, "textEnd": 130}], "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

It was largely due to a stroke of luck that Rovman Powell missed a full toss to hand SunRisers Hyderabad a one-run victory in the SRH's previous game. The win underscores the unpredictability or, as they say, the funny nature of the Twenty20 format. The Royals needed 12 runs off the last over, and two off the last ball.\n\nThat win may have put their campaign back on the rails. Still, SRH have been one of the standout sides this season with their explosive openers - Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma - setting the stage on fire and fast bowling unit, led by Pat Cummins, working like an optimally functioning apparatus. The best feature yet has been the inspiring captaincy of Cummins, who has managed to handle the young Indian players efficiently.\n\nA rare vulnerability for the Hyderabad side, as it's been observed, is their lack of a Plan B, rather contingencies. They normally rely heavily on aggressive batting, particularly through their openers. And in instances where this approach doesn't produce the expected yields, they've struggled to adapt and recalibrate their gameplan. Spin bowling has emerged as another notable weakness, despite the presence of legend Muttiah Muralitharan in the coaching staff. As they prepare to face Mumbai Indians at the Wankhede on Monday evening, these are areas the home team look to exploit.\n\nThe Wankhede Stadium has traditionally been a high-scoring pitch, except for the recent exception seen in the last game, versus Kolkata Knight Riders. It wouldn't be surprising if Monday's match turns into a run-fest, reminiscent of their season's initial encounter in Hyderabad where Mumbai Indians had mounted a strong assault on SRH total and had come close to chasing down the record-breaking total of 278.\n\nA lot will depend on the performance of the openers from both teams.\n\nFor Mumbai Indians, their openers have struggled to survive the PowerPlay overs in numerous games. Rohit Sharma and Ishan Kishan have been dismissed early too often, with Rohit falling six times and Ishan seven times within the first six overs. This inconsistency might be one of the key factors to their underwhelming performance this season. They may face a stronger challenge from SRH pacers, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Pat Cummins, T Natarajan, Jaydev Unadkat and Marco Jansen, who have all been in good nick. How the MI openers, mainly Rohit, handle the quality SRH pacers will be a point of interest from MI point of view and Indian point of view as well.\n\nFor SRH, this match holds significant importance in their quest to qualify for the playoffs. Currently standing within striking distance with 12 points from 10 games, they require at least two more victories in their remaining four matches. As for MI, with their playoff chances now virtually over, the big question is whether they will opt to rest Jasprit Bumrah, arguably the standout bowler of this IPL season.\n\nWhen: Monday, May 6, 19:30 IST\n\nWhere: Mumbai Indians vs Sunrisers Hyderabad, IPL 2024, Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai\n\nWhat to expect:A lot depends on the nature of the pitch. Otherwise a batting strip, the Wankhede surface was tricky to score in the last game a couple of nights ago. Easy or difficult to bat, the captain winning the toss will choose to field because of the dew factor.Anything less than 200 will not be easy to defend.\n\nHead to Head: MI 12 - 10 SRH. The face-off figures, overall, are not too stark but Mumbai Indians enjoy an edge at the Wankhede Stadium, 5-2. But the Surrisers have been a different side this season.\n\nTeam Watch:\n\nMumbai Indians\n\nInjury/Availability: No injury concerns for the home team.\n\nTactics & Matchups: Skipper Hardik Pandya will prefer to bowl Jasprit Bumrah, the best bowler of the league, upfront given the explosive starts that SRH openers, Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma, have been providing. An early breakthrough will go a long way in restricting the visitors.\n\nProbable XI:Ishan Kishan (wk), Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya (c), Naman Dhir, Tim David, Gerald Coetzee, Piyush Chawla, Jasprit Bumrah, Nuwan Thushara [Impact Substitute: Nehal Wadhera]\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad\n\nInjury/Availability: All players are available for Pat Cummins.\n\nTactics & Matchups: With Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Pat Cummins, T Natarajan, Jaydev Unadkat and Marco Jansen all in fine form, the pace will be the main form of attack.\n\nProbable XI:Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma, Anmolpreet Singh, Heinrich Klaasen (wk), Nitish Reddy, Abdul Samad, Shahbaz Ahmed, Marco Jansen, Pat Cummins (c), Bhuvneshwar Kumar, T Natarajan [Impact Substitute: Jaydev Unadkat/Umran Malik]\n\nWhat they said\n\nWe have a huge fan base and they want to see us win. Our approach, from the beginning, has been to play each game to win and it will not be any different tomorrow - MI batter Naman Dhir, when asked about their approach to the game when their chances of a play-offs berth are bleak\n\nLook, that's, that's [Possibility of Umran Malik's inclusion]. That's always going to be an ongoing conversation. The way that we pick our team is very much a game-to-game situation. We know the quality that someone like Umran has and we're obviously at a new venue tomorrow, new opposition tomorrow, and I'm sure through the course of the day his name may come up in selection conversation - SRH pace bowling coach James Franklin on whether Umran Mailk will get to play a game", "source": {"uri": "cricbuzz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cricbuzz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vijay_tagore@cricbuzz.com", "name": "Vijay Tagore", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhuvneshwar_Kumar", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bhuvneshwar Kumar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rovman_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rovman Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wankhede_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wankhede Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muttiah_Muralitharan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Muttiah Muralitharan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T.

Later in the 17th over, Chawla picked Abdul Samad's (3) wicket in the 17th over.\n\nIn the end, Pat Cummins (35*) and Sanvir Singh (8) were unbeaten on the crease and took SRH to 173/8. Pandya and Chawla picked up three wickets each in their respective spells and led the Mumbai bowling attack. While Anshul Kamboj and Jasprit Bumrah picked one wicket each. Nuwan Thushara was the only MI bowler who failed to pick wickets in the game.\n\nThe Mumbai-based franchise need to make 174 runs to win the match infront of their home crowd. Brief score: Sunrisers Hyderabad (Travis Head 48, Pat Cummins 35*, Nitish Reddy 20; Hardik Pandya 3/31) vs Mumbai Indians.

Chasing a target of 174 runs, MI chased down the total with ease, securing a win by 7 wickets.\n\nMumbai Indians encountered early setbacks in their chase, losing three wickets within the first 5 overs for just 31 runs on the board. Ishan Kishan (9), Rohit Sharma (4), and Naman Dhir (0) departed early in the innings. However, Suryakumar Yadav's aggressive strokeplay helped stabilize the innings, with MI reaching 52/3 at the conclusion of the powerplay.\n\nSuryakumar Yadav continued his onslaught against the SRH bowlers, particularly punishing Yansen in the seventh over, which leaked 22 runs. At the halfway mark of their innings, MI had reached 84/3, with Yadav and Verma forming a crucial partnership. The duo brought up their 50-run stand off just 27 balls and continued to dominate the SRH bowling attack, reaching a formidable 100-run partnership in 63 balls.\n\nTheir relentless assault guided MI to a comfortable 7-wicket victory over Sunrisers Hyderabad, with Yadav reaching his century off just 51 deliveries, cementing MI's win.In the first innings, Sunrisers Hyderabad posted a total of 173/8 in their 20 overs, setting a target of 174 for Mumbai Indians to chase in the second innings. SRH commenced their batting innings with a slow and steady approach, but they struggled to maintain partnerships and lost wickets at regular intervals, hindering their progress towards a higher total. Hardik Pandya and Piyush Chawla impressed with the ball, each claiming 3 wickets and maintaining an impressive economy rate.\n\nWinning the toss, Mumbai Indians elected to field first, inviting Sunrisers Hyderabad to bat. SRH began cautiously, starting off slower than their usual scoring rate. However, the momentum shifted in the fifth over bowled by Kamboj, where Head was dismissed but saved by a no-ball call. The subsequent delivery also resulted in a no-ball, offering two free hits to SRH, which helped them accumulate 8 runs and reach 51 runs in 5 overs. Kamboj claimed the wicket of Mayank Agarwal for 5 runs. Travis Head received his second chance as he was dropped on 44 by Thushara, once again off Kamboj's bowling in the eighth over. At the end of 10 overs, SRH reached 88/2 with Head and Reddy at the crease.\n\nHowever, Head fell for 48 runs, dismissed by Piyush Chawla. Nitish Reddy departed for 20 runs, with Pandya taking his wicket. Klaasen managed only 2 runs before being dismissed by Piyush Chawla for his second wicket. Shahbaz resisted briefly but was caught by SKY off Pandya's bowling for 10 runs. Yansen (17) and Samad (3) were swiftly dismissed, leaving SRH at 136/8 after 17 overs. Hardik Pandya claimed 3 wickets for 31 runs in 4 overs, while Piyush Chawla also took 3 wickets, conceding 33 runs in his 4 overs, providing crucial breakthroughs and controlling SRH's scoring rate.

But will that help the five-time champions make the playoffs? Well, it looks like their doors are almost closed, but they can spoil the party for other teams like they did against SRH at the Wankhede Stadium tonight (Monday, May 6).\n\nMI captain Hardik Pandya won the toss and elected to field first, a brave move considering SRH's scintillating form when batting first. However, the MI bowlers did well to reduce the opposition to 125/7 at the end of the 16th over. Although Abhishek Sharma struggled to get going, his opening partner Travis Head managed to give a decent Powerplay score of 56.\n\nThe trouble started for the visitors after the first six overs as MI tightened the screws in the middle overs, taking wickets frequently. A brilliant cameo from SRH captain Pat Cummins, however, took the team to a respectable score of 173. In reply, although the hosts had the advantage of the dew factor, their openers failed to capitalize on it and again went cheaply inside the powerplay.\n\nNaman Dhir's promotion was unsuccessful as the youngster was dismissed for a nine-ball duck. However, MI's most reliable batters, Suryakumar Yadav and Tilak Varma, ensured that they did not lose more wickets in the chase. The two went on to a 140+ partnership for the fourth wicket and crossed the finish line in 17.2 overs. Surya, in the process, notched up his maiden century in this season.\n\nAlso Check: Sunrisers Hyderabad 1st innings highlights against MI in Match 55\n\nAll this while in the tournament, SRH were struggling with the bat when batting second. But today they were outclassed in Mumbai while batting first. It is true that batting first and an ultra-aggressive approach has been their strength so far, but that cannot be a winning formula every time.\n\nHad Travis Head not had a bit of luck, he wouldn't have been able to give SRH a good powerplay and their team total would have fallen below par. SRH batters always look for quick scoring. Instead of that approach they should understand the situation and play smart.\n\nMarco Jansen featured in the SRH XI in a couple of matches. He performed well in the last season, but this time it looks like the team is not benefitting much from him. The Proteas pacer leaked 45 runs in his three overs against MI today and conceded an economy of 11 in the last match against RR.\n\nSRH have good fast-bowling options on their bench and they can replace Jansen in the upcoming match. Express pacer Umran Malik hasn't played any matches for SRH this season. He can trouble the opposition with his blistering pace as Lucknow Super Giants' Mayank Yadav did in the initial matches.\n\nAlso Check: Mumbai Indians 2nd innings highlights against SRH in Match 55\n\nHyderabad's batting mainly relies on three batters - Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma and Heinrich Klaasen. They replaced the struggling Aiden Markram at No.3 and brought back an out-of-touch Mayank Agarwal against MI. However, the Indian batter failed to find any resistance and was dismissed for cheap runs.\n\nA power-hitter Glenn Phillips is warming the bench for SRH. He can bring more stability to the middle order and address a lot of concerns. If Umran Malik is brought in to replace Jansen, an overseas slot will be vacant and Phillips could easily make the cut.", "source": {"uri": "crictracker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricTracker"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerplay_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Powerplay (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardik_Pandya", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hardik Pandya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wankhede_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wankhede Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toss_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toss (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilak_Varma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tilak Varma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suryakumar_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suryakumar Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Duck (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umran_Malik", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Umran Malik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Jansen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marco Jansen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aiden_Markram", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aiden Markram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayank_Agarwal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayank Agarwal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting order (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Africa national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Phillips_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glenn Phillips (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Klaasen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heinrich Klaasen"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.crictracker.com/media/attachments/1715017933024_SRH-mp-1.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540533", "eventUri": "eng-9540533", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 340, "textEnd": 345}], "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

The gamble taken by Hardik Pandya and Co. did pay off as the bowlers did a great job in the match and picked up wickets at regular intervals.\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad lost their first wicket at the score of 56 as Abhishek Sharma departed and then they lost quick wickets with SRH being at 124/7 in 15.5 overs. After that, Pat Cummins pulled things back by playing an exceptional cameo of 35 runs in 17 balls to power his team to a fighting total of 173/8. Hardik Pandya and Piyush Chawla picked up three wickets each while Anshul Kamboj and Jasprit Bumrah got one wicket each.\n\nChasing the target, Mumbai Indians, as usual, were off a to poor start and once again lost three wickets inside the powerplay with Rohit Sharma, Ishan Kishan, and Naman Dhir back in the hut.\n\nMumbai Indians found themselves in a tricky situation and a loss of any further wicket might have resulted in MI facing yet another defeat in the Indian Premier League 2024. That was when the No.1 T20 batsman Suryakumar Yadav stepped up and showcased a stupendous batting performance.\n\nSuryakumar Yadav played his natural attacking brand of cricket and smashed the bowlers all over the park. Suryakumar Yadav's Mr.360 avatar was witnessed by fans and he stitched up 143* runs with Tilak Varma in 79 balls to lead Mumbai Indians to an amazing 7-wicket victory with 16 balls remaining.\n\nEn route to win, Suryakumar Yadav hit his 6th T20 century and smashed a six to take MI past the finish line.

The two teams came into the season with opposing moods around them. While SRH fans were feeling good about their side going all out to get World Cup-winning Australian captain Pat Cummins and then making him skipper, MI fans were dumbfounded by five-time title-winner Rohit Sharma being suddenly replaced by the returning Hardik Pandya in the position The way MI handled the situation with regards to stopping certain questions from being asked angered fans even more and this led to boos ringing out around the stadium almost every time the focus fell on Pandya.\n\nA number of key players, including Pandya himself, have been woefully out of form for MI. In fact, it could be argued that only pace maestro Jasprit Bumrah has delivered for the five-time champions consistently in every match. And yet, MI seem determined to give Bumrah just one over in the first 10 overs, thus often allowing opposition teams to recover from any damage that he did in the middle overs and often running away with the game.\n\nALSO READ: KL Rahul laments LSG's 'poor performance overall' after Lucknow Super Giants script embarrassing record vs KKR in IPL\n\nPandya cut a rather beleaguered and frustrated figure at the end of MI's stunning defeat to Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in their last game. It marked the first time since 2012, and just the second time in the history of the IPL, that MI had lost to KKR at the Wankhede Stadium. KKR have been one of the teams to beat this season and now, MI face yet another well-oiled machine in the form of SRH. The Sunrisers come into this match on the back of a thrilling one-run win over the Rajasthan Royals, thus condemning the latter to just their second loss of the season. LSG's loss to KKR on Sunday meant that SRH have climbed up to fourth on the league table going into this match.

The five times champions have seen their season fall apart as they have lost four straight games to fall to bottom position on the table.It is scarcely believable that the Mumbai star studded team have performed so poorly. SRH on the other hand are in fourth place and are in strong contention to clinch a playoff position. They narrowly won their last match against the Royals, a result that ended a two game losing run.\n\nDate and Time: May 06, 7.30PM IST Venue: Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai\n\nPARIMATCH- BET NOW\n\nMumbai Indians vs Sunrisers Hyderabad Betting offers\n\nWithin our match predictions articles, we'll provide you with the best odds and offers available at India's Premier Betting Site Parimatch.Choose one of the following offers,\n\nMumbai Indians vs Sunrisers Hyderabad Betting Odds\n\nMumbai Indians: 1.75\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad: 2.08\n\nPARIMATCH- BET NOW\n\nMI vs SRH Coin Toss Odds\n\nMumbai Indians: 1.90\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad: 1.90\n\nMumbai Indians vs Sunrisers Hyderabad Top Run scorer Mumbai Indians Top Run Scorer Sunrisers Hyderabad Top Run Scorer Suryakumar Yadav Travis Head Ishan Kishan Heinrich Klassen Rohit Sharma Aiden Markram\n\nPARIMATCH- BET NOW\n\nMI vs SRH Top Wicket Taker\n\nMumbai Indians Top Wicket Taker Sunrisers Hyderabad Top Wicket Taker Odds Jasprit Bumrah Bhuvneshwar Kumar Gerald Coetzee Pat Cummins Piyush Chawla Washington Sundar\n\nPARIMATCH- BET NOW\n\nMumbai Indians vs Sunrisers Hyderabad Best Betting Offer MI vs SRH Match Prediction: who will win?\n\nThe obvious strength of the Sunrisers team is their destructive batting lineup, especially after they started the IPL season by twice smashing the highest ever team totals. Since those exploits, opposition teams have bowled better to Travis Head and company by mixing up their delivery speeds. The pitches are also no longer as flat as they were in the earlier games. Mumbai will have to look at picking up early wickets otherwise the match can be taken away from them very quickly. Their opening pair of Rohit and Ishan Kishan owe their teams some runs. If they can put together a big partnership then they could upset Sunrisers.\n\nMumbai Indians vs Sunrisers Hyderabad Toss Prediction\n\nThe Wankhede Stadium has always been an excellent chasing ground as the dimensions of the boundaries are very small. Both teams will bowl first if they win the toss as dew will be a problem for the team bowling second.\n\nMumbai Indians vs Sunrisers Hyderabad Top Run Scorer Prediction\n\nWe are tipping Suryakumar Yadav to be the top run scorer in this match as he looked in great form in his last innings.\n\nMumbai Indians vs Sunrisers Hyderabad Top Wicket Taker Prediction\n\nWe are backing Jasprit Bumrah to be the top wicket taker in this match.\n\nMumbai Indians vs Sunrisers Hyderabad Betting Preview\n\nIn recent matches for Mumbai, Sky and Tilak Varma have been the only batsmen that have posted any substantial scores which has meant the team have struggled to set or chase down totals. Arguably the biggest disappointment for the home side has been the form of Captain Hardik Pandya. If ever he needed to find form, this is the time as there is no pressure of chasing a playoff position. SRH have shown their weakness when their openers fail, therefore it is crucial for the likes of Aiden Markram to find some form.

This is MI's fourth win of the Tata Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024, and it was powered by a scintillating century by Suryakumar Yadav and vital support from Tilak Varma during the run-chase.\n\nGoing by the general trend of the TATA IPL 2024, MI won the toss and chose to bowl against a power-packed SRH batting line-up. MI introduced Anshul Kamboj, the right-arm medium pacer, in their lineup. SRH brought back the experience of Mayank Agarwal to bolster their batting.\n\nTravis Head and Abhishek Sharma were attacking during the powerplay and picked boundaries at regular intervals. There was real drama in the fifth over of the innings when Kamboj came on to bowl. Head was intent on attacking and hit a six off the second ball. However, Kamboj then had him bowled, only to see that it was a no-ball. Head then smashed the free-hit for a four and then hit another four. Just before the powerplay got done, Jasprit Bumrah got MI their first success when he got Abhishek (11 off 16) caught behind.\n\nIn the eight over, Mayank was dismissed as he was bowled by the debutant Kamboj. That was the problem with SRH's innings as they kept losing wickets at regular intervals. Apart from their opening partnership of 56, none of the other partnerships got past 50. Numerous batters got starts but couldn't convert them into big ones. When Head was dismissed for 48 in the 12th over, MI had got a big wicket. At one stage, they were 136 for eight in the 17th over, which forced them to introduce the batter, Sanvir Singh as the impact player.\n\nAt the end, it was Pat Cummins' aggressive batting which helped SRH cross 170. He scored 35 off only 17 balls, with two sixes and two fours, which took SRH to 173. The 37-run partnership for the last wicket was extremely crucial for SRH as it gave their bowlers something to defend. It also gave them heart considering the fact that KKR defended a similar score against MI at the same venue. The most successful bowlers for MI were their captain Hardik Pandya with three for 31 and Piyush Chawla also had a big role for three for 33.\n\nMI's run-chase had started very well as the openers raced to 26 inside two overs, with both Ishan Kishan and Rohit Sharma looking good. However, SRH then struck back by dismissing Ishan, who edged to slip off Marco Jansen. In the fourth over, Rohit top-edged one and it was caught by the wicketkeeper. Naman Dhir too was dismissed early when he edged to first slip off Bhuvneshwar Kumar in the fifth over. At 31 for three in the fifth over, MI were in big trouble.\n\nSuryakumar then unleashed his class and took matters into his own hands, showing that attack is the best form of defence. It all started with a drive for four off Bhuvneshwar early in his innings. Tilak also joined in when he took the attack to Cummins in the sixth over. At the end of the powerplay, MI were 52 for three.\n\nWhen the field spread out, it did not hamper Suryakumar's approach as he picked 22 runs off Marco Jansen in the seventh over - smashing two sixes and two fours.\n\nThereafter, it was completely dominated by Suryakumar, who gave SRH bowlers no chance to make a comeback. Tilak held up one end, and it allowed Suryakumar to express himself at the other. Last year, Suryakuamr scored his maiden century in the TATA IPL at the same ground while batting first. This time, he dominated a run-chase and took his team home. Tilak had the best seat in the house as Suryakumar unleashed his best shots on the day to entertain the MI fans.\n\nIt took Suryakumar 30 balls to get to his fifty. What followed was an exhibition of some attacking T20 batting as he raced to his next fifty in only 21 balls. Victory was achieved when he smashed T Natarajan for a six in the 18th over to get to his century and take MI home to victory.\n\nMI won with 16 balls to spare. Suryakumar was the star with a memorable century.", "source": {"uri": "pragativadi.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pragativadi: Leading Odia Dailly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "yajati_keshari_rout@pragativadi.com", "name": "Yajati Keshari Rout", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayank_Agarwal", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mayank Agarwal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerplay_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Powerplay (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilak_Varma", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tilak Varma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "No-ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suryakumar_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suryakumar Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wankhede_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wankhede Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanvir_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sanvir Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Jansen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marco Jansen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardik_Pandya", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hardik Pandya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasprit_Bumrah", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jasprit Bumrah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piyush_Chawla", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Piyush Chawla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhuvneshwar_Kumar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bhuvneshwar Kumar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caught", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caught"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

Over the last few seasons though visiting sides have found a way to beat Mumbai Indians in their home turf.\n\nAlso Read: Mumbai Indians' strongest predicted playing XI against Sunrisers Hyderabad, Match 55\n\nHighest Team Total at this venue - 235/1 by RCB vs MI in IPL 2015\n\nLowest Team Total at this venue - 67 by KKR vs MI in IPL 2008\n\nHighest score by a batter - 133 not out by AB de Villiers vs MI in IPL 2015\n\nBest bowling figures -5/18 by Harbhajan Singh vs CSK in IPL 2011 and Wanindu Hasaranga vs SRH in IPL 2022\n\nBest Run Chase at this venue -214/4 by MI vs RR in IPL 2023\n\n- 4th highest partnership for the 1st wicket for SRH, 140 by Vivrant Sharma and Mayank Agarwal also came against MI at the Wankhede in 2023.\n\n- Umran Malik's 5/22 against GT in 2022 is the second-best bowling for SRH in IPL.", "source": {"uri": "crictracker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricTracker"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat_Titans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gujarat Titans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivrant_Sharma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vivrant Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umran_Malik", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Umran Malik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanindu_Hasaranga", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wanindu Hasaranga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayank_Agarwal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayank Agarwal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chennai Super Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AB_de_Villiers", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AB de Villiers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbhajan_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harbhajan Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Run rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_analysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowling analysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.crictracker.com/media/attachments/1714674019694_Sunrisers-Hyderabad.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540533", "eventUri": "eng-9540533", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

IPL clash against frail MI", "body": "Placed fourth in the IPL points table with 12 points in 10 matches with six wins and four losses, SRH will be desperate to produce an all-round show and make improvements especially in their bowling department.\n\nThe Pat Cummins-led side is in the midst of an intense battle between multiple teams who are bidding for spots in the final four, with Rajasthan Royals , Kolkata Knight Riders and Lucknow Super Giants placed above SRH.\n\nChennai Super Kings and a resurgent Delhi Capitals are breathing down SRH's neck, a scenario that would force the 2016 winners to shrug off any rust and get ready for an intense mid-table battle.\n\nIf a two-paced pitch at the Wankhede Stadium for the previous clash against KKR was an aberration, the free-flowing SRH batters would look to make merry and pile up a huge score as they have done several times this year.\n\nThe pitches here generally are batting-friendly and short boundary lengths at this venue make scores in excess of 200 a norm, but the MI-KKR contest played out on a sluggish surface last Friday challenged the batters to dig deep.\n\nSRH would be high on confidence having pipped the table-toppers RR by just one run in their previous outing, a game in which their bowlers pulled off a thrilling win.\n\nTravis Head , Abhishek Sharma and Heinrich Klaasen remain the enforcers in SRH's batting but South African Aiden Markram would be keen to make a big score of his own, having had a mixed run so far.\n\nNitish Kumar Reddy has emerged as one of the most promising players for SRH in last few games which takes a significant amount of pressure off the key batters.\n\nT Natarajan's accuracy would be handy for SRH as the left-arm pacer is chasing Mumbai Indians' Jasprit Bumrah for the purple cap.\n\nFive-time winners Mumbai slipped to the bottom of the pool again when Royal Challengers Bengaluru trumped Gujarat Titans on Saturday night.\n\nWith only three wins in 11 matches, MI's challenge is all but over and there is only \"pride and name\" left to play for by their own admission.\n\nHowever, all is not lost as MI's key India players for the upcoming T20 World Cup, Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav and Hardik Pandya would remain in focus for their individual form.\n\nRohit's all-out aggressive approach has not yielded many big scores whereas the world number 1 T20 batter Suryakumar would be eyeing consistency after a fine half-century against KKR a few nights ago.\n\nIndia vice-captain Pandya has being consistently on the receiving end due to his ordinary form with both bat and ball and also his on-field decisions as MI skipper.\n\nThe all-rounder, however, would be keen to make amends and put an end to the criticism that he has been facing ever since this IPL edition got underway.\n\nTeams :\n\nMumbai Indians: Hardik Pandya , Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav, Dewald Brevis, Jasprit Bumrah, Piyush Chawla, Gerald Coetzee, Tim David, Shreyas Gopal, Ishan Kishan , Anshul Kamboj, Kumar Kartikeya, Akash Madhwal, Kwena Maphaka, Mohammad Nabi, Shams Mulani, Naman Dhir, Shivalik Sharma, Romario Shepherd, Arjun Tendulkar, Nuwan Thushara, Tilak Varma, Harvik Desai , Nehal Wadhera, Luke Wood.\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad: Abhishek Sharma, Travis Head, Heinrich Klaasen , Aiden Markram, Abdul Samad, Nitish Reddy, Shahbaz Ahmed, Pat Cummins , Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jaydev Unadkat, T Natarajan, Mayank Markande, Umran Malik, Anmolpreet Singh, Glenn Phillips , Rahul Tripathi, Washington Sundar, Upendra Yadav , Jhathavedh Subramanyan, Sanvir Singh, Vijayakanth Viyaskanth,

The game will get underway at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai on May 6, Monday at 7:30 PM (IST).\n\nWhen both teams faced each other in the reverse fixture this season, as many as 523 runs were scored on the match day, in what was one heck of a run-fest.\n\nThe Sunrisers had the last laugh in the battle as they won the game by 31 runs. Mathematically, MI are not eliminated from the tournament yet and also have an outside chance of qualifying.\n\nAs things stand, they are at the bottom of the points table with six points whereas SRH are fourth on the table with 12 points. Let's take a glimpse at the four batters who can muster the most runs in the match 55 of the tournament.\n\n1. Suryakumar Yadav: Suryakumar Yadav who is known for his potential to play a wide range of shots is expected to go all guns blazing against SRH. He missed the first leg against SRH owing to sports hernia recovery. Overall, he played 8 games for MI this season, mustering 232 runs at an average of 29 including three fifties.\n\n2. Travis Head: Travis Head was at his impressive best in the reverse fixture against MI in Hyderabad. The left-hander scored runs at a rate of knots by chipping in with a quickfire 62 off just 24 deliveries, where he hammered as many as 9 fours and 3 hits over the fence at a strike rate of 258.33\n\nIPL 2024 Full Coverage | IPL 2024 Points Table | IPL 2024 Stats\n\n3. Tilak Varma: Tilak Varma top-scored for MI in the reverse fixture against SRH where he chipped in with 64 off 34 balls including 2 fours and 6 sixes at a strike rate of 188.24. The youngster will be looking forward to posing a threat to the SRH side in the upcoming game.\n\n4. Heinrich Klaasen: SRH's wicket keeper-batter Heinrich Klaasen played a whirlwind knock against MI in the first leg in Hyderabad by scoring a blistering 80* off 34 balls. He constructed his innings with the help of 4 fours and 7 sixes at a strike rate of 235.29. Klaasen who failed to operate at a high level in the last few games will be hoping to turn up the ante this time.", "source": {"uri": "mykhel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "myKhel.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chaithanya_g@mykhel.com", "name": "Chaithanya G", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suryakumar_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suryakumar Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wankhede_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wankhede Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Run (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilak_Varma", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tilak Varma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Klaasen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heinrich Klaasen"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.mykhel.com/img/2024/05/mivssrh-1714957514.jpg?06052024131510", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540533", "eventUri": "eng-9540533", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 175, "textEnd": 180}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Just like their last game against Kolkata Knight Riders, MI bowlers gave it their all with the bat. Travis Head was the top scorer with 48 runs while Pat Cummins ended the innings with 35 not out.\n\nFor the home team, it was skipper Hardik Pandya and Piyush Chawla who did the damage with the ball with three wickets each. Anshul Kamboj picked one wicket on his IPL debut while Jasprit Bumrah was his economical self.\n\nSRH skipper Pat Cummins employed Test Match fields as the three seamers dismissed the top three Mumbai Indians batters. Ishan Kishan fell for 9 while Rohit Sharma's alarming form continued when he was out for. Naman Dhir could only score a duck to leave his side in deep trouble.\n\nTilak Varma and Suryakumar Yadav kept attacking the SRH bowlers and didn't let the opposition dictate terms. The two played a few shots as Suryakumar Yadav hit a lucky six off Pat Cummins.\n\nMumbai Indians players and fans found their voices again as Suryakumar Yadav started to attack the Hyderabad bowlers. The best shot of the first eight overs was a straight drive down the ground against Marco Jansen to leave the crowd gasping.\n\nThe SRH bowlers couldn't do much with the ball after getting rid of the MI top three. Suryakumar Yadav and Tilak took the score past 100 as SKY hit Nitish Reddy past the square leg region for a boundary.\n\nIndia's leading T20 batter Suryakumar Yadav batted well once again to reach his 25 IPL fifty and his second in successive games. There was one moment in the game where the 33-year-old seemed in trouble as far as fitness is concerned and had a grimace on his face.\n\nBy the time the second time-out came into play, it almost looked as if the SRH bowlers and fielders had given up. The pair of Suryakumar Yadav and Tilak Varma took the team to comfort as MI just needed 25 runs from 4 overs left to play with both batters playing well.\n\nJust when his team needed it, Suryakumar Yadav stood up and played an innings to remember. The 33-year-old scored his 2nd IPL century and got to the mark with a sumptuous six off T Natarajan much to the delight of the crowd.\n\nMumbai Indians and its fans finally heaved a sigh of relief as they won their 4th game of the season. The win came with 16 balls left to play as SKY hit a six not only to reach his ton but also his MI win by 6 wickets and get to ninth place in the table.", "source": {"uri": "crictracker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricTracker"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suryakumar_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Suryakumar Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardik_Pandya", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hardik Pandya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasprit_Bumrah", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jasprit Bumrah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishan_Kishan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ishan Kishan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piyush_Chawla", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Piyush Chawla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Jansen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marco Jansen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilak_Varma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tilak Varma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Duck (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

Kolkata's innings ended at 169/10 in 19.5 overs. Mumbai got bundled out for 145.\n\nIn the evening, the temperature will be around 29 degrees in Mumbai. The real feel will be 35 degrees. The humidity will be around 76%.

SRH's failure to replicate KKR's success with the ball was down to Suryakumar and his boundary-hitting ability as MI were far better at it than their opponents on the evening. Suryakumar's counterattack blew SRH away after Hardik Pandya and Piyush Chawla picked three wickets each to keep the visitors down to 173/8.\n\nWhere was the game won?\n\nIn the middle-overs. SRH lost their way after an early wobble and just struggled for boundaries. MI on the hand, suffered a worse start but were offered a counter-attacking resurrection by Suryakumar.\n\nParameters SRH MI Runs 64/4 87/0 RR 6.4 8.7 4s/6s 4/1 11/3\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad\n\nPowerPlay: SRH fly, but Bumrah strikes\n\nPhase score - 56/1 [RR: 9.34, 4s/6s: 6/2]\n\nThe MI pacer got the ball to swing and kept the SRH openers relatively tied down for the first half of the PowerPlay. Debutant Anshul Kamboj nearly had a moment to savour when he cleaned up Travis Head, only for the umpire to strike it out as a no-ball. 19 came off that over and Head rode his luck a little with inside edges but Bumrah snuffed out Abhishek Sharma in the last over of the PowerPlay.\n\nMiddle-overs: SRH lose Head, Nitish and Klaasen\n\nPhase score - 64/4 [RR: 6.40, 4s/6s: 4/1]\n\nHead's luck ran till the halfway stage as Kamboj nearly had him again, only for Nuwan Thushara to drop a sitter at third man. In the same over, however, Kamboj had his first-ever wicket in the IPL when Mayank Agarwal was cleaned bowled. Piyush Chawla and Hardik Pandya then put a big dent on one of the best batting sides of the tournament with the wickets of Head, Nitish Reddy and Heinrich Klaasen. Head looked to sweep against Chawla and hit to backward square leg and Klaasen missed one while looking to slog. Between these two dismissals, Hardik Pandya bounced out Nitish. SRH went 35 balls without a four or a six before Marco Jansen got one each off successive balls to close out the middle-overs.\n\nDeath-overs: Cummins pushes SRH to 173/8\n\nPhase score - 53/3 [RR: 10.60, 4s/6s: 2/2]\n\nHardik continued to reap rewards off hard lengths and Piyush picked his third wicket to cripple SRH further but Pat Cummins added a valuable cameo to give his bowlers a total to work with. When Abdul Samad fell in the 17th over, SRH brought in Sanvir Singh as their impact substitute to push past 150. Sanvir kept his skipper company who swung his bat around with some success. Nuwan Thusara was erratic at the death, and conceded 29 off his two overs in that phase as Cummins hit him for a four and a six in the 20th to finish with a 17-ball 35*.\n\nMumbai Indians\n\nPowerPlay: SRH quicks wipe out MI's top-three\n\nPhase score - 52/3 [RR: 8.67, 4s/6s: 10/1]\n\nIn a phase where boundaries came easy for the hosts, they still lost their top-three to top-class bowling. Marco Jansen started badly with a wide four but made up for it by getting Ishan Kishan to nick to Mayank Yadav at first slip. Pat Cummins then took out Rohit Sharma - for the fourth time in IPL - with an innocuous leg-stump ball that Rohit tried to flick and edged. Heinrich Klaasen covered ground behind him to complete the take. Cummins completed that over without conceding a single run, beating the outside edge of Suryakumar Yadav's bat at will. Bhuvneshwar Kumar bounced back from a poor first over too, to dismiss Naman Dhir for a nine-ball duck. Suryakumar and Tilak Varma shrugged off the poor start as they took 16 off Cummins to end the PowerPlay fairly well.\n\nMiddle-overs: Suryakumar puts MI back on track\n\nPhase score - 87/0 [RR: 8.70, 4s/6s: 11/3]\n\nDew made life tough for SRH and Suryakumar added to the misery with a fine counterattack. Jansen erred in lengths and earned his wrath, with two fours and two sixes in a 22-run over. T Natarajan bowled a good first over and Nitish Reddy started well too but Suryakumar was still able to toy with SRH's fields to blaze away. He struggled a little between overs but got to a 30-ball 50 in the 13th over. Jansen's bad day got worse as Cummins's hopes of getting another over from the South African didn't end well. Suryakumar hit two fours in a 14-run over. By the 13th over, MI had a total of 18 boundaries (15x4, 3x6) equalling SRH's entire tally. With Jansen going for runs, Cummins brought on left-arm spinner Shahbaz Ahmed for an over, who was also taken apart by Surykumar via two sweep shots. With that, he brought up the 100-plus run stand with Tilak off just 64 deliveries.\n\nDeath-overs: Suryakumar completes century and chase\n\nPhase score - 25/0 [RR: 10.71, 4s/6s: 4/2]\n\nCummins, who'd barely put a foot wrong on the day, brought himself back for his last over early at the death in a desperate search for a breakthrough. Suryakumar fronted him, smashing two fours and a six to get into the 90s. In the 18th over from Natarajan, Suryakumar brought up his three-figure milestone - second in IPL - off 51 balls with a majestic six over extra cover and wrapped up the chase with 2.4 overs to spare.\n\nBrief Scores: Sunrisers Hyderabad 173/8 in 20 overs (Travis Head 48, Pat Cummins 35*; Hardik Pandya 3-31, Piyush Chawla 3-33) lost to Mumbai Indians 174/3 in 20 overs (Suryakumar Yadav 102*, Tilak Varma 37*; Bhuvneshwar Kumar 1-22) by 7 wickets\n\nWhat next?\n\nSRH's time on the road this season is done. They head home for a four-pointer against fellow top-four aspirants LSG on May 8. MI have a four-day gap before playing KKR away from home.", "source": {"uri": "cricbuzz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cricbuzz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suryakumar_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Suryakumar Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardik_Pandya", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hardik Pandya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piyush_Chawla", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Piyush Chawla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Jansen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marco Jansen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "No-ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayank_Agarwal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayank Agarwal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Run (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umpire_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Umpire (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Klaasen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heinrich Klaasen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Samad_(Indian_cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abdul Samad (Indian cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanvir_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sanvir Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishan_Kishan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ishan Kishan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

SRH had recovered to post 173 for eight. The win lifted Mumbai Indians from the bottom of the points table to the ninth spot while SRH, despite the loss, remained fourth with 12 points in 11 games.\n\nJoining forces inside the powerplay with MI left reeling at 31 for three, the pair of Suryakumar and Tilak Varma (37 not out off 32) did a superb recovery job with 143-run unbeaten stand to script a comprehensive victory. Suryakumar's sensational knock included 12 fours and half a dozen sixes.\n\nFor that matter, MI could have been reduced to 31/4 had a Bhuvneshwar Kumar delivery in the fifth over not pitched outside the leg stump with the veteran seamer pinning Varma in front of the wickets.\n\nIshan Kishan (9) perished early once again while Naman Dhir (0) endured a nine-ball duck.\n\nWith their backs against the wall, Suryakumar picked Marco Jansen to attack as he collected 22 runs off the seventh over with two sixes and two fours to begin his job.\n\nBut shortly after he completed his fifty off 30 balls, Suryakumar was seen stretching and wincing in pain while looking to manage a strain, presumably to his groin -- one of the reasons why he missed cricket for nearly four months from late last year.\n\nHowever, to his credit, the world No 1 T20 batter hung around till the end to take MI over the line as he finished the game with a flurry of boundaries -- two sixes and as many fours off his last four balls.\n\nApart from Suryakumar's struggles while batting, the decline in Rohit Sharma's form also came to the fore with the India captain mistiming one to be dismissed for a mere four -- his fourth score in single digits this IPL in last five outings.\n\nEarlier in the first half, Pandya struck form before the T20 World Cup while veteran Chawla also bagged three wickets as Mumbai Indians restricted Sunrisers Hyderabad for a below-par total.\n\nPandya found rhythm and momentum to return 4-0-31-3 while Chawla (4-0-33-3) produced an impactful performance to trouble the SRH batters.\n\nHowever, to his credit, SRH skipper Pat Cummins chipped in with a 17-ball 35 (2x4s, 2x6s) late in the innings to take them past the 150-run mark.\n\nIn complete contrast to last time these teams met earlier in this IPL when SRH hammered 277/3, their usually free-flowing batters struggled for momentum and lack of initiative meant they could never really trouble the Mumbai bowlers.\n\nTravis Head top scored with 48 while skipper Pat Cummins made a quick 17-ball 35 not out.

He added they are not thinking much about their upcoming matches.\n\n\"Got Agarwal coming back to the side, will bat at three. Dew is a factor here, but we have been batting well.

Mumbai Indians clash with Sunrisers Hyderabad in match 55 of IPL 2024 on Monday, May 6 in what promises to be a high-voltage, high-scoring game.\n\nMumbai are reeling at the bottom of the table after Royal Challengers Bengaluru registered a big win on Saturday, May 4 against Gujarat Titans in the garden city. Despite winning only three out of 11 matches the home team is still in with a mathematical, but improbable, chance to qualify for the Playoffs. They did not have a good outing in their previous match, which was at the same venue, against Kolkata Knight Riders. After having the opposition on the mat (57/5), Mumbai let the advantage slip away and conceded a total of 169 runs.\n\nIn response, the batting unit failed big time. Apart from Suryakumar Yadav (56 runs off 35 balls), nobody from the top and middle order got into double figures. MI were 71/6 and Suryakumar's and Tim David's (24 runs off 20 balls) partnership gave the home team hope, but alas, it was extinguished by smart bowling from the KKR unit.\n\nMumbai would be looking for a turnaround of their fortunes in this match to continue to have whatever chances they can get to qualify.\n\nAfter a couple of losses, SRH finally managed to win again. They beat Rajasthan Royals by the barest of margin of one run at home to bring their campaign back on track. SRH are currently placed at fourth position on the points table with six wins out of 10 matches. With the competition for the four playoff spots tight, they would not want to lose momentum.\n\nNotably, SRH have not been able to play the way they had been earlier in the tournament. In the last match, despite scoring 201 in the first innings they did not look their fluent best. When they came on to bowl Bhuvneshwar Kumar gave the team an inspired start, claiming two massive wickets of Buttler and Samson in the first over itself. However, a 134-run partnership followed between Riyan Parag and Yashasvi Jaiswal almost putting the game in RR's pocket until Natarajan, Cummins and Bhuvneshwar again brought the game back to equilibrium with the latter winning it for his side off the last ball.\n\nThe last time MI and SRH clashed, the latter scored the then highest innings total ever of 277/3 with MI falling short by 31 runs. They would be looking for not just revenge but also momentum to turn their campaign around.\n\nPredicted XI: Ishan Kishan (WK), Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma, Nehal Wadhera, Hardik

Marco Jansen tried to do some things with the bat, but it wasn't until skipper Pat Cummins' (35* off17) late burst that pushed SRH to 173. Both Piyush Chawla (3 for 33) and Hardik Pandya (3 for 31) were at their best with the ball.\n\nAlso Check: MI's 2nd innings highlights vs SRH\n\nSRH did start waywardly with the ball, giving away too many extras, but ultimately taking three wickets before the 5-over mark. But then began the SKY show. Suryakumar Yadav (102* off 51) then stole the show without giving the SRH bowlers an inch of breathing space as he simply continued to plunder with some much-needed support from Tilak Varma. MI then chased the target off in 17.2 overs.\n\nHere are some interesting stats from the match:\n\n1 - Hardik Pandya's bowling figures of 3/31 are the best by a Mumbai Indians captain in the IPL. The previous record was 3/32 by Harbhajan Singh against PBKS in 2008.\n\n1 - Pat Cummins and Sanvir Singh's unbeaten partnership of 37 for the ninth wicket is the highest for that wicket for SRH. The previous record was 36 by Umran Malik and Abdul Samad against RR in 2022.\n\n1 - Ishan Kishan made his 48th dismissal as a wicketkeeper for MI. This is the highest for the 5-time champions going past Quinton de Kock's 47.\n\n3 - Naman Dhir's 9-ball duck, is the joint third longest in IPL history. The full list of players who scored a duck in as many or more balls is:\n\n13 balls - Nayan Doshi vs Kochi, Indore, 2011\n\n10 balls - Davy Jacobs vs Delhi Capitals, 2012\n\n10 balls - Shane Watson vs RCB, Chennai, 2019\n\n9 balls - Shane Wayson vs DC, Chennai, 2019\n\n9 balls - Nicholas Pooran vs RR, Pune, 2022\n\n9 balls - Naman Dhir vs SRH, Wankhede, 2024\n\n1 - Suryakumar Yadav and Tilak Varma's unbeaten partnership of 143 is the highest for MI for the fourth wicket. The previous record was an unbeaten 131 by Rohit Sharma and Corey Anderson against KKR in 2015.\n\n4 - Taking 51 balls, Suryakumar Yadav's hundred was the fourth fastest for MI.\n\n2 - Suryakumar Yadav became the second player to score two centuries for Mumbai Indians. Rohit Sharma is the only other one with two while Cameron Green, Lendl Simmons, Sanath Jayasuriya and Sachin Tendulkar have one each.\n\n6 - Suryakumar Yadav registered his sixth T20 century. Among Indian players, only Rohit Sharma(8) and Virat Kohli(9) have more. Both KL Rahul and Ruturaj Gaikwad have as many.", "source": {"uri": "crictracker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricTracker"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Jansen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marco Jansen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suryakumar_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suryakumar Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardik_Pandya", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hardik Pandya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piyush_Chawla", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Piyush Chawla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wankhede_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wankhede Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umran_Malik", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Umran Malik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanvir_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sanvir Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilak_Varma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tilak Varma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishan_Kishan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ishan Kishan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbhajan_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harbhajan Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Watson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shane Watson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_analysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bowling analysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket-keeper", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wicket-keeper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Not out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Duck (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corey_Anderson_(cricketer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corey Anderson (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayan_Doshi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nayan Doshi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Pooran", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nicholas Pooran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Capitals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delhi Capitals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "K.

MI have lost eight of the 11 matches they have played so far and are on the verge of being eliminated from the tournament. On the other hand, SRH have won six of their 10 matches and are well in contention for the playoffs.\n\nEarlier in the season, the two teams came face to face in Hyderabad and it was a batting feast for the fans. An aggregate of 523 runs were amassed, with SRH posting the then-highest-ever total in IPL history - 277. MI displayed a brilliant fightback (246/5) but it wasn't enough for them to get over the line.\n\nThis time, MI will be hosting the party at the iconic Wankhede Stadium and Hardik Pandya and Co. will be aiming to settle the scores. The venue is known for producing high-scoring thrillers and expect a cracking game when the two clash again. MI look a bit weak in both departments, can they stop the SRH batters from putting up a show on their home turf?\n\nRohit Sharma started off the IPL 2024 season on a strong note, often giving MI a strong start in the Powerplay. However, in the last four matches, the veteran opener has struggled to find runs. He was dismissed for cheap scores inside the first six overs. Looking at his current form, SRH will not worry too much about the former MI captain and they have Bhuvneshwar Kumar to tackle him in the initial overs.\n\nThe two senior Indian players clashed in 61 balls in the IPL and scored 81 runs with one dismissal. It will be interesting to see how Rohit fares against Bhuvi's swing, especially when the right-arm pacer is coming off the back of a match-winning performance against Rajasthan Royals.", "source": {"uri": "crictracker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricTracker"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardik_Pandya", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hardik Pandya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wankhede_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wankhede Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rajasthan Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhuvneshwar_Kumar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bhuvneshwar Kumar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swing bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.crictracker.com/media/attachments/1714911666614_MI-vs-SRH.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540533", "eventUri": "eng-9540533", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

The host successfully chased down 174 after suffering initial blows. Suryakumar Yadav anchored MI's chase after they were down to 31/3. Earlier, Hardik Pandya and Piyush Chawla starred with three-wicket hauls. Pat Cummins scored a pivotal 35*(17), lifting SRH up from 136/8. Here are the stats.\n\nSRH openers Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma added 56 runs after MI elected to field. Jasprit Bumrah dismissed Abhishek against the run of play. That dismissal brought four more as the Orange Army were down to 96/5. Notably, debutant Anshul Kamboj dismissed Mayank Agarwal. Middle-over spells from Hardik and Piyush reduced SRH to 136/8. SRH finally reached 173/8, with Cummins playing a captain's knock.\n\nMarco Jansen, Cummins, and Bhuvneshwar thwarted MI's top order with a thundering opening spell. Jansen dismissed Ishan Kishan in the second over before Cummins got rid of Rohit Sharma. Bhuvneshwar Kumar then dismissed Naman Dhir to reduce MI to 31/3. SKY and Tilak took over thereafter, having launched a counter-attack. The duo shared a century-plus stand in MI's seven-wicket win.\n\nWhile Abhishek and Mayank departed within two overs, Chawla dismissed Travis Head and Heinrich Klaasen in back-to-back overs. Skipper Hardik backed himself and removed Nitish Reddy, Jansen, and Shahbaz Ahmed. Chawla later dismissed Abdul Samad, reducing SRH to 136/8. Hardik took three wickets for 31 runs, while leg-spinner Piyush conceded 33 runs.Notably, middle overs (7-14) produced just 51 runs for four wickets.\n\nAs per Cricbuzz, this was the first instance of a Mumbai Indians spinner taking more than a wicket in an innings in IPL 2024. Notably, Piyush has just eight wickets in nine matches this season.\n\nCummins scored a crucial 35*(17), a cameo laced with 2 fours and 2 sixes.

The visitors were ousted by a brilliant century from Suryakumar Yadav, which led MI to their first win after four successive losses.\n\nSRH were high on confidence after defeating league leaders Rajasthan Royals (RR) in their previous encounter. After being asked to bat first by Hardik Pandya, their explosive batting unit crumbled to 96-5 from 56-0. SRH were struggling to reach the 150-run mark at one stage, but were bolstered by Pat Cummins' cameo towards the end to finish with 173-8.\n\nMI had a hard time against the moving new ball, with SRH claiming three wickets inside the powerplay. After being reduced for 31-3, it seemed like MI might falter in a home run chase like they recently did against the Kolkata Knight Riders.\n\nHowever, Tilak Varma and Suryakumar Yadav ensured that the chase progressed without any more hiccups and guided MI to victory with 16 balls to spare.\n\nFans highlighted how MI's win benefits a lot of other teams, and keeps them alive in the race for the playoffs. Here are some of the reactions:\n\n\"This srh loss was much needed to keep the competition alive,\" one fan remarked.\n\nSRH play their last three league matches at home\n\nSRH have a tricky fixture list, with the trio of Lucknow Super Giants, Gujarat Titans and the Punjab Kings lined up. Their loss to MI at the Wankhede marked their final away clash of the season, as they will play their last three league stage matches at their home venue - Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium.\n\n\"Probably a couple short, at the Wankhede you want as many as you can get. You always feel like you're in, the wicket had a little bit in it so we were definitely in the game. I think Sanvir helped us get to that 170 instead of 150, ideally we'd have a bowler. It's T20 cricket, and it doesn't always work out. SKY played really well. We like playing at home, we'll wait and see what's ahead of us,\" Cummins said after the defeat.\n\nSRH's upcoming clash against LSG on Wednesday, May 8, could be crucial in deciding who qualifies for the playoffs.

PTI\n\nMumbai Indians (MI) host Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) at the Wankhede Stadium on Monday in a match that could have a big impact on the IPL 2024 playoffs race.\n\nJust three weeks are all that are left in the 17th season of the Indian Premier League (IPL), and the race to the playoffs certainly is getting more intense with each passing day. The tournament's still wide open at the moment, and Monday's showdown between MI and SRH is one that will be keenly followed by a lot of teams, and not just the fans of the two franchises.\n\nKolkata Knight Riders (KKR) and Rajasthan Royals (RR) currently occupy the top two spots on the IPL 2024 points table with both teams on 16 points, with KKR having played a game more than RR. However, neither team has officially qualified for the playoffs yet, with Rajasthan needing to win one more match to get the 'Q' against their name.\n\nBy the same token, none of teams sitting in the bottom half of the table is officially knocked out of the playoffs race. Even the ninth-placed Gujarat Titans, whose fortunes have taken a massive hit this season after back-to-back appearances in the final since their debut in 2022, can still make it if they win their next three matches and other results go their way.\n\nSRH start the solid favourites against MI ahead of Monday's showdown at the Wankhede, given the manner in which they had demolished their attack at Hyderabad's Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium earlier this season.\n\nThe 'Orange Army' posted 277/3 after they were invited to bat by MI skipper Hardik Pandya, breaking the record for the highest team total in IPL history in the process, a record that had belonged to Royal Challengers Bengaluru for more than a decade.\n\nMI dished out a solid batting performance of their own in response, but fell well short of the 278-run target, finishing at 246/5 to suffer a 31-run defeat -- their second on the trot at the start of the season.\n\nAhead of return fixture between the two sides in Mumbai on Monday, we take a look at their IPL 2024 playoff scenarios:\n\nMatches remaining: vs MI in Mumbai on 6 May; vs LSG in Hyderabad on 8 May; vs GT in Hyderabad on 16 May; vs PBKS in Hyderabad on 19 May\n\nSRH had been pushed down to the fifth spot following Chennai Super Kings' (CSK) 28-run victory over Punjab Kings (PBKS) in Dharamsala on Sunday, which helped the defending champions jump to the third spot on the points table, resulting in Lucknow Super Giants dropping to fourth.\n\nHyderabad, who have had quite the revival under Pat Cummins' leadership this season after finishing at the very bottom last year, will have enough opportunities for a top-four finish given they have four matches in hand, including the return fixture against Mumbai. Adding to their advantage is the fact that their last three matches will take place in the familiar confines of the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, their home ground.\n\nSRH should have one foot in the playoffs if they're able to beat MI at the Wankhede, given 14 points has been the average cut-off for teams finishing in the top four at the end of the league stage in a 14-match-per-side season. So going by that logic, Hyderabad should remain in the hunt even if they end up losing three of their last four matches.\n\nTwo wins should virtually guarantee them a third-fourth place finish at the end of the league stage while three or more wins in their remaining fixtures should make them favourites for a top-two finish, which will then give them two attempts at making the final.\n\nMatches remaining: vs SRH in Mumbai on 6 May; vs KKR in Kolkata on 11 May; vs Lucknow Super Giants in Mumbai on 17 May\n\nFive-time champions Mumbai Indians have had a forgettable run in all-rounder Pandya's maiden season in charge, losing eight out of 11 matches this season and currently sitting at the bottom of the 10-team table.\n\nThough their chances of making the playoffs for a second season running appear practically impossible, Mumbai Indians remain mathematically alive in the tournament. And that's because teams have qualified for the top four with just 12 points on the board in the past, case in point being SRH in 2019. That, however, was an eight-time affair and this season could tell a different story altogether.\n\nFor MI, the equation to a top-four finish is simple -- win each of their remaining matches by handsome margins to ensure they finish with a NRR that should be competitive enough for them to sneak into the playoffs while finishing on 12 points.\n\nMumbai will also be hoping that the team finishing at the fourth spot at the end of the league stage doesn't go past the 12-point mark. KKR and RR are the only two teams past the 12-point mark so far this season and one of CSK, LSG and SRH is expected to join them in that club sooner rather than later.\n\nFor MI to have a shot at the playoffs, at least two teams from the trio of Chennai, Lucknow and Hyderabad need to lose all of their remaining games. And that sides such as DC (10), RCB (8), PBKS (8) and GT (8) don't go past the 12-point mark either, after which NRR will come into play.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news",

Mumbai Indians got their 4th win of the tournament on the night\n\nMatch 55 of the Indian Premier League (IPL 2024) witnessed Mumbai Indians put up a show in front of their home fans as the hosts registered their 4th victory of the campaign. MI beat the SunRisers Hyderabad by 7 wickets at the Wankhede on May 6.\n\nOpening the innings, SRH batsmen Abhishek Sharma and Travis Head provided a solid start for their team during the powerplay. While Abhishek initially played a supporting role, his partner Travis Head showcased some aggressive strokeplay, scoring 48 runs off 30 balls.\n\nHowever, the momentum shifted as MI bowlers, led by spinner Piyush Chawla, consistently took wickets, causing SRH's score to plummet to 96/5 by the 12.1 overs mark.\n\nMI captain Hardik Pandya delivered a standout performance, claiming 3 wickets for 31 runs in his allotted 4 overs against the SunRisers. His bowling display was particularly crucial, given recent scrutiny over his bowling abilities.\n\nTravis Head emerged as the highest run-scorer for SRH, but their innings concluded with a total of 173/8 in 20 overs.\n\nWith Mumbai Indians playing at home and aiming to salvage pride, they will seek to put up an impressive performance for their supporters against a formidable SRH side.\n\nIn reply, Mumbai openers knew they didn't have to have an explosive start to their innings to stay at the required run rate. Rohit Sharma and Ishan Kishan failed to get into double digits after what was a good opening over for them.\n\nWhile Ishan went for just 9 runs, former MI skipper Rohit Sharma only managed to score 4 runs on the night which extended his poor run for the hosts to 6 games in this tournament now.\n\nIt was the duo of Suryakumar Yadav and Tilak Varma who started building the momentum for Mumbai Indians. Their unbeaten 143-run partnership brought MI relief in the middle and gave the fans a lot of relief in the chase.\n\nIt was the swashbuckling knocks of the duo that inspired their side to a 7-wicket win on the night as Suryakumar Yadav's fiery 102* was supported by Tilak's gritty 37* to give Mumbai Indians their 4th victory of the season.", "source": {"uri": "news24online.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News24"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shashwat_nishant@news24online.com", "name": "Shashwat Nishant", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardik_Pandya", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hardik Pandya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piyush_Chawla", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Piyush Chawla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilak_Varma", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tilak Varma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suryakumar_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suryakumar Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishan_Kishan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ishan Kishan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Not out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://news24online.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/MI-vs-SRH-3.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540533", "eventUri": "eng-9540533", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 418, "textEnd": 423}], "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

On Monday, May 6th, 2024, Match 55 will see the Mumbai Indians (MI) take on the Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) at the Wankhede Stadium. MI is struggling, having lost four games in a row and sitting at the bottom of the table. They're desperate for a win to boost their morale and keep their playoff dreams alive.\n\nIn contrast, the Sunrisers Hyderabad are riding high after a close one-run win against the Rajasthan Royals. They're aiming for a playoff spot and want to continue their winning streak against MI. This match is going to be intense, with both teams giving it their all to secure a crucial victory.\n\nWhen it comes to head-to-head encounters between MI and SRH, the rivalry has been closely contested over the years. Out of the 23 matches played between the two teams, MI has emerged victorious on 12 occasions, while SRH has won 10 matches. With one match ending in a no result, both teams have demonstrated their competitive spirit on numerous occasions. As they prepare to add another chapter to their storied rivalry, cricket fans can expect a captivating contest between MI and SRH at the Wankhede Stadium.\n\nTravis Head has been a standout performer for SRH in the IPL 2024 season, showcasing his batting prowess with consistent performances at the top of the order. With 396 runs under his belt in nine innings, including a crucial half-century, Head has been instrumental in providing solid starts for his team. MI will need to devise a strategic plan to contain Head's aggressive stroke play and disrupt SRH's batting momentum early in the innings.\n\nProbable Best Bowler: Jasprit Bumrah\n\nJasprit Bumrah, often hailed as one of the best fast bowlers in world cricket, has been MI's go-to bowler throughout the IPL 2024 season. Despite MI's struggles, Bumrah has consistently delivered exceptional performances, claiming 17 wickets in 11 matches so far. With his ability to bowl yorkers and deceive batsmen with his variations, Bumrah poses a significant threat to SRH's batting lineup. As the holder of the Purple Cap, Bumrah will be eager to add to his tally of wickets and lead MI to a much-needed victory.\n\nScenario 1: Sunrisers Hyderabad win the toss and opt to bowl\n\nIn this scenario, SRH's decision to bowl first could be influenced by the favourable conditions at the Wankhede Stadium, where the pitch tends to assist pacers early on. With the dew factor likely to come into play later in the evening, SRH will aim to restrict MI to a manageable total during the first innings. A powerplay score of 60-70 runs would set the tone for a competitive match, with MI looking to capitalize on the batting-friendly conditions.\n\nHowever, SRH's bowling attack, led by the likes of Pat Cummins and Bhuvneshwar Kumar, will pose a stern challenge to MI's batsmen. If SRH can execute their bowling plans effectively and capitalize on key moments, they stand a good chance of clinching victory in this scenario.\n\nScenario 2: Sunrisers Hyderabad win the toss and opt to bat\n\nAlternatively, if SRH wins the toss and elects to bat first, they will look to capitalize on the batting-friendly conditions at the Wankhede Stadium. A powerplay score of 75-85 runs would provide SRH with a solid platform to build a formidable total in the first innings. With Travis Head leading the charge alongside Abhishek Sharma, SRH's top order has the firepower to put MI's bowlers under pressure from the outset.\n\nMI's bowlers, including the likes of Jasprit Bumrah and Piyush Chawla, will need to strike early and stem the flow of runs to prevent SRH from posting a daunting total. However, if SRH's batsmen can maintain their momentum and capitalize on scoring opportunities, they are well-placed to emerge victorious in this scenario.\n\nCatch all the action live on the Star Sports Network.

But just when it appeared that the Mumbai Indians innings would go the way it had in the previous match when they lost to Kolkata Knight Riders chasing a small target.\n\nSuryakumar had struck a half-century in that match but could not guide his team to victory. On Monday, SKY did not leave things undone as he played a brilliant innings, hitting shots all over the ground, and completing his century with a six as Mumbai reached 174/3 in 17.2 overs.\n\nSuryakumar scored 102 not out off 51 balls, hitting 12 boundaries and six maximums, operating at a strike rate of 200.00 that left the Sunrisers players shell-shocked and the capacity crowd mesmerised.\n\nOn Monday, Suryakumar also became the second MI batter after Rohit Sharma to record 25 scores of 50-plus for Mumbai Indians in the IPL.\n\nWith this victory, Mumbai Indians moved to eight points from 12 matches and picked them up from the bottom to ninth position. SRH remained fourth with 12 points from 11 matches, the same as Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.\n\nMumbai Indians got off to a poor start as they lost Ishan Kishan (9), Rohit Sharma (4) and Haman Dhir (0) in quick succession as the hosts slumped to 31/3 in the fifth over.\n\nKishan started with a boundary off the first ball of the innings, clipping in through square leg as Bhuvneshwar Kumar drifted onto the pads. When he carved a widish delivery by Marco Jansen to the boundary despite slight movement, it looked like Kishan would trouble SRH a lot on Monday, But Jansen had his revenge when he made one move a bit to induce a leading edge from Kishan for Mayank Agarwal to pouch a simple catch.\n\nPat Cummins brought himself into attack inside the Power-play and the SRH skipper was rewarded Rohit Sharma skied a leading edge for Klaasen to run behind to take a difficult catch. Naman Dhir tried to hit his way out of trouble off Bhuvneshwar but perished for a zero.\n\nHowever, Suryakumar Yadav came to Mumbai Indians' rescue hitting a timely half-century. But unlike in the previous match, when he struck a fifty but could not guide his team to victory, on Monday, the Mumbai batter stayed put at the wicket, unleashed some brilliant shots, playing his usual 360-degree cricket to help his team to a memorable victory.\n\nThough he appeared to be facing a bit of physical discomfort, Suryakumar Yadav, the best T20 batter in the World as per the ICC rankings, played some unbelievable shots and raised a century partnership for the fourth wicket partnership with Tilak Varma that pulled Mumbai Indians to safety.\n\nAfter playing the first couple of overs cautiously, SKY drove Bhuvi through mid-off for his first boundary and a few deliveries later stayed deep in the crease and clipped Cummins for a six over deep third.\n\nHe waded into Marco Jansen in the seventh over, hitting him for two fours and two sixes, whipping, thumping and ramping him to the boundary with relish.\n\nHe completed his half-century off 30 balls, hitting five boundaries and three maximums in the process. Suya kept up the scoring rate with back-to-back boundaries off Jansen in the 13th over and with a six off Bhuvi and successive fours off Shahbaz Ahmed in the 15th over and a four off Natarajan took him into the 90s.\n\nTilak Varma proved an ideal partner to Suryakumar as he kept the other end intact, giving him company, encouraging his partner and hitting a few good shots as he remained unbeaten on 37 off 32 balls, studded with six boundaries.\n\nWith 24 needed from 24 balls, Pat Cummins brought himself, hoping for a wicket and hamper Mumbai's progress but SKY launched into him, hitting the Australia captain for two boundaries and a six, three pulled boundaries that left the capacity crowd mesmerised. Suryakumar Yadav moved into the 90s and then completed his century with a six, sealing Mumbai Indians' fourth victory in IPL 2024.\n\nBrief scores:\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad 173/8 in 20 overs (Travis Head 48, Pat Cummins 35 not out; Hardik Pandya 3-31, Piyush Chawla 3-33) lost to Mumbai Indians 174/3 in 17.2 overs (Suryakumar Yadav 102 not out, Tilak Varma 37 not out; Bhuvneshwar Kumar 1-22)",

But just when it appeared that the Mumbai Indians innings would go the way it had in the previous match when they lost to Kolkata Knight Riders chasing a small target.\n\nSuryakumar had struck a half-century in that match but could not guide his team to victory. On Monday, SKY did not leave things undone as he played a brilliant innings, hitting shots all over the ground, and completing his century with a six as Mumbai reached 174/3 in 17.2 overs.\n\nSuryakumar scored 102 not out off 51 balls, hitting 12 boundaries and six maximums, operating at a strike rate of 200.00 that left the Sunrisers players shell-shocked and the capacity crowd mesmerised.\n\nOn Monday, Suryakumar also became the second MI batter after Rohit Sharma to record 25 scores of 50-plus for Mumbai Indians in the IPL.\n\nWith this victory, Mumbai Indians moved to eight points from 12 matches and picked them up from the bottom to ninth position. SRH remained fourth with 12 points from 11 matches, the same as Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.\n\nMumbai Indians got off to a poor start as they lost Ishan Kishan (9), Rohit Sharma (4) and Haman Dhir (0) in quick succession as the hosts slumped to 31/3 in the fifth over.\n\nKishan started with a boundary off the first ball of the innings, clipping in through square leg as Bhuvneshwar Kumar drifted onto the pads. When he carved a widish delivery by Marco Jansen to the boundary despite slight movement, it looked like Kishan would trouble SRH a lot on Monday, But Jansen had his revenge when he made one move a bit to induce a leading edge from Kishan for Mayank Agarwal to pouch a simple catch.\n\nPat Cummins brought himself into attack inside the Power-play and the SRH skipper was rewarded Rohit Sharma skied a leading edge for Klaasen to run behind to take a difficult catch.

SRH had recovered to post 173 for eight. The win lifted Mumbai Indians from the bottom of the points table to the ninth spot while SRH, despite the loss, remained fourth with 12 points in 11 games.\n\nJoining forces inside the powerplay with MI left reeling at 31 for three, the pair of Suryakumar and Tilak Varma (37 not out off 32) did a superb recovery job with 143-run unbeaten stand to script a comprehensive victory. Suryakumar's sensational knock included 12 fours and half a dozen sixes.\n\nFor that matter, MI could have been reduced to 31/4 had a Bhuvneshwar Kumar delivery in the fifth over not pitched outside the leg stump with the veteran seamer pinning Varma in front of the wickets.\n\nIshan Kishan (9) perished early once again while Naman Dhir (0) endured a nine-ball duck.\n\nWith their backs against the wall, Suryakumar picked Marco Jansen to attack as he collected 22 runs off the seventh over with two sixes and two fours to begin his job.\n\nBut shortly after he completed his fifty off 30 balls, Suryakumar was seen stretching and wincing in pain while looking to manage a strain, presumably to his groin -- one of the reasons why he missed cricket for nearly four months from late last year.\n\nHowever, to his credit, the world No 1 T20 batter hung around till the end to take MI over the line as he finished the game with a flurry of boundaries -- two sixes and as many fours off his last four balls.\n\nApart from Suryakumar's struggles while batting, the decline in Rohit Sharma's form also came to the fore with the India captain mistiming one to be dismissed for a mere four -- his fourth score in single digits this IPL in last five outings.\n\nEarlier in the first half, Pandya struck form before the T20 World Cup while veteran Chawla also bagged three wickets as Mumbai Indians restricted Sunrisers Hyderabad for a below-par total.\n\nPandya found rhythm and momentum to return 4-0-31-3 while Chawla (4-0-33-3) produced an impactful performance to trouble the SRH batters.\n\nHowever, to his credit, SRH skipper Pat Cummins chipped in with a 17-ball 35 (2x4s, 2x6s) late in the innings to take them past the 150-run mark.\n\nIn complete contrast to last time these teams met earlier in this IPL when SRH hammered 277/3, their usually free-flowing batters struggled for momentum and lack of initiative meant they could never really trouble the Mumbai bowlers.\n\nTravis Head top scored with 48 while skipper Pat Cummins made a quick 17-ball 35 not out.", "source": {"uri": "republicworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Republic World"},

SRH had recovered to post 173 for eight.\n\nAlso Read | ICC T20 World Cup 2024 Jerseys: See Pics of Kits To Be Worn by All Teams During Men's Twenty20 WC.\n\nThe win lifted Mumbai Indians from the bottom of the points table to the ninth spot while SRH, despite the loss, remained fourth with 12 points in 11 games.\n\nJoining forces inside the powerplay with MI left reeling at 31 for three, the pair of Suryakumar and Tilak Varma (37 not out off 32) did a superb recovery job with 143-run unbeaten stand to script a comprehensive victory. Suryakumar's sensational knock included 12 fours and half a dozen sixes.\n\nAlso Read | Will India Travel to Pakistan for ICC Champions Trophy 2025? Here's What BCCI Vice-President Rajeev Shukla Had to Say (Watch Video).\n\nFor that matter, MI could have been reduced to 31/4 had a Bhuvneshwar Kumar delivery in the fifth over not pitched outside the leg stump with the veteran seamer pinning Varma in front of the wickets.\n\nIshan Kishan (9) perished early once again while Naman Dhir (0) endured a nine-ball duck.\n\nWith their backs against the wall, Suryakumar picked Marco Jansen to attack as he collected 22 runs off the seventh over with two sixes and two fours to begin his job.\n\nBut shortly after he completed his fifty off 30 balls, Suryakumar was seen stretching and wincing in pain while looking to manage a strain, presumably to his groin -- one of the reasons why he missed cricket for nearly four months from late last year.\n\nHowever, to his credit, the world No 1 T20 batter hung around till the end to take MI over the line as he finished the game with a flurry of boundaries -- two sixes and as many fours off his last four balls.\n\nApart from Suryakumar's struggles while batting, the decline in Rohit Sharma's form also came to the fore with the India captain mistiming one to be dismissed for a mere four -- his fourth score in single digits this IPL in last five outings.\n\nEarlier in the first half, Pandya struck form before the T20 World Cup while veteran Chawla also bagged three wickets as Mumbai Indians restricted Sunrisers Hyderabad for a below-par total.\n\nPandya found rhythm and momentum to return 4-0-31-3 while Chawla (4-0-33-3) produced an impactful performance to trouble the SRH batters.\n\nHowever, to his credit, SRH skipper Pat Cummins chipped in with a 17-ball 35 (2x4s, 2x6s) late in the innings to take them past the 150-run mark.\n\nIn complete contrast to last time these teams met earlier in this IPL when SRH hammered 277/3, their usually free-flowing batters struggled for momentum and lack of initiative meant they could never really trouble the Mumbai bowlers.\n\nTravis Head top scored with 48 while skipper Pat Cummins made a quick 17-ball 35 not out.", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [],

MI", "body": "The Pat Cummins-led side is in the midst of an intense battle between multiple teams who are bidding for spots in the final four, with Rajasthan Royals (16 points), Kolkata Knight Riders (14 points) and Lucknow Super Giants (12 points) placed above SRH.\n\nChennai Super Kings (5th with 10 points) and a resurgent Delhi Capitals (6th with 10 points) are breathing down SRH's neck, a scenario that would force the 2016 winners to shrug off any rust and get ready for an intense mid-table battle.\n\nIf a two-paced pitch at the Wankhede Stadium for the previous clash against KKR was an aberration, the free-flowing SRH batters would look to make merry and pile up a huge score as they have done several times this year.\n\nThe pitches here generally are batting-friendly and short boundary lengths at this venue make scores in excess of 200 a norm, but the MI-KKR contest played out on a sluggish surface last Friday challenged the batters to dig deep.\n\nSRH would be high on confidence having pipped the table-toppers RR by just one run in their previous outing, a game in which their bowlers pulled off a thrilling win.\n\nTravis Head (396 runs), Abhishek Sharma (315) and Heinrich Klaasen (337) remain the enforcers in SRH's batting but South African Aiden Markram would be keen to make a big score of his own, having had a mixed run so far.\n\nNitish Kumar Reddy (219 runs) has emerged as one of the most promising players for SRH in last few games which takes a significant amount of pressure off the key batters.\n\nT Natarajan's (15 wickets) accuracy would be handy for SRH as the left-arm pacer is chasing Mumbai Indians' Jasprit Bumrah (17) for the purple cap.\n\nFive-time winners Mumbai slipped to the bottom of the pool again when Royal Challengers Bengaluru trumped Gujarat Titans on Saturday night.\n\nWith only three wins in 11 matches, MI's challenge is all but over and there is only \"pride and name\" left to play for by their own admission.\n\nHowever, all is not lost as MI's key India players for the upcoming T20 World Cup, Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav and Hardik Pandya would remain in focus for their individual form.\n\nRohit's all-out aggressive approach has not yielded many big scores whereas the world number 1 T20 batter Suryakumar would be eyeing consistency after a fine half-century against KKR a few nights ago.\n\nIndia vice-captain Pandya has being consistently on the receiving end due to his ordinary form with both bat and ball and also his on-field decisions as MI skipper.\n\nThe all-rounder, however, would be keen to make amends and put an end to the criticism that he has been facing ever since this IPL edition got underway.\n\nTeams (from): Mumbai Indians: Hardik Pandya (c), Rohit

Together with Tilak Verma (37 not out off 32), he put on an unbeaten 143-run partnership that snuffed out all hopes of SRH, as Mumbai reached their target in 17.2 overs.\n\nIt was Yadav's second century in IPL and sixth in T20s and one that would be rated very highly in the years to come.\n\nMumbai's fourth win in 12 matches took them to eight points and helped them jump a spot to ninth while it was SRH's fifth loss in 11 games as they stayed on 12 points.\n\nEarlier, Mumbai skipper Hardik Pandya (3/31) and veteran leg spinner Piyush Chawla's probing bowling (3/33) helped the home team restrict Hyderabad to 173/8 at the Wankhede.\n\nMumbai won the toss and opted tow bowl but found Travis Head (48 of 30 balls) and Abhishek Sharma (11 off 16) in a punitive mood as they raced to 56 within sixes overs.\n\nJasprit Bumrah (1/23) Sharma removed at the end of the sixth over. Mayank Agarwal (5) also departed soon to give debutant Ansul Khamboj (1/42) his maiden IPL wicket after as Mumbai clawed back into the contest.\n\nHead continued to wield his bat until though he struggles to time his shots and was lucky to have got bowled out on a no-ball from Kamboj. The Aussie opener also got another life when Nuwan Thushara spilled an easy chance at deep third man when he was on 44 in the eighth over.\n\nBut by then, SRH were struggling to score freely with Pandya and Chawla bowling tight lengths. Leggie Chawla made inroads with the crucial wickets of Head and Heinrich Klaasen (2) to put Mumbai on top.\n\nPandya's bounder accounted for Nitish Kumar Reddy (20), who also claimed the wicket of Shahbaz Ahmed (10) later on after which SRH skipper Pat Cummins' 17-ball 35 (2x4s, 2x6s) towards the end to take them past the 150-run mark.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news",

I fielded for 20 overs and batted for 18 overs, only tired (nothing else to worry about.) I feel it was the need of the hour for me.\n\n\"I went out to bat, needed someone to bat till the end. I just enjoyed my time. It's from the Mumbai school of arts, have played a lot of cricket at Wankhede. When the ball stopped seaming, I played all my shots that I practice in the nets. I feel the intent would have been the same, I would have definitely played in the same pattern.\"\n\nHardik Pandya: \"We want to focus on playing good cricket, still think we gave 10-15 runs extra. The way the batters batter, that was excellent. My bowling, I like to bowl in the right areas, I bowl according to the situation.\n\n\"Bowled in the right areas today and it worked. I was like Chawla had to bowl from the shorter side. You got to be accurate, the margin of errors have become smaller these days for the bowlers.\n\n\"It's unbelievable, the best past of SKY is that he puts the bowlers under pressure. It's sheer confidence, his game has changed, is one of the best batters. He can change a game in a different way, lucky to have him (SKY) in our side.\"\n\nTilak Verma: \"Initially it was really tough. Both of us were struggling. Wanted to bat with a straight bat. Our plan was to take off the seam. After that we know the 360 degree batter is there. We didn't decide anything.\n\n\"It's a long season. We'll be having such wickets like slow wickets, seaming wickets. I wanted to just play on the situation but it was seaming. But I kept my intent. Was just looking for runs. Wanted to keep my scoring options with the straight bat.\n\n\"Think I batted well. At that moment, he was batting really well so I thought he should be scoring a hundred. So I wanted to take single and not hit big shots.\"\n\nPat Cummins | SRH Captain: \"Probably a couple short, at the Wankhede you want as many as you can get.

It is sheer confidence, his game has changed, is one of the best batters. He can change a game in a different way, lucky to have him (SKY) in our side.\"\n\n\"We want to focus on playing good cricket, still think we gave 10-15 runs extra. The way our batters batted, that was excellent. My bowling, I like to bowl in the right areas, I bowl according to the situation. Bowled in the right areas today and it worked.\"\n\nOn Piyush Chawla's three-fer, Pandya said, \"I was like Piyush Chawla had to bowl from the shorter side. He (Chawla) had to be accurate, the margin of errors have become smaller these days for the bowlers.\"\n\nComing to the match, MI won the toss and elected to field first. SRH lost wickets at regular intervals from the beginning and it was knocks from Travis Head (48 in 30 balls, with seven fours and a six) and skipper Pat Cummins (35* in 17 balls, with two fours and two sixes) that took SRH to 173/8 in their 20 overs.\n\nIn the run chase, MI lost their top order early and was reeling at 31/3. It was then that Suryakumar (102* in 51 balls with 12 fours and six sixes) and Tilak Varma (37* in 32 balls, with six fours) launched a counter attack which guided MI to a win with 16 balls left.\n\nSuryakumar took home the 'Player of the Match' honour.\n\nMI is at the ninth spot with four wins and eight losses, giving them eight points. SRH is at fourth with six wins, five losses and 12 points.

The average first innings score is 186. While the swing is observed in the initial overs, the pitch has shown slower-than-usual characteristics in the last game, assisting spinners despite some dew. Kolkata Knight Riders successfully defended a target of 170 in the previous match, although Mumbai's batters, including Suryakumar Yadav, struggled to adapt.

It turned out to be a nail-biting affair at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium.\n\nBatting first, the hosts posted 201 runs in 20 overs.\n\nBhuvneshwar Kumar gave SRH an excellent start by dismissing Jos Buttler and Sanju Samson in the very first over. RR were brought back to the contest by Yashasvi Jaiswal and Riyan Parag, who stitched a 133-run partnership. Shimron Hetmyer and Rovman Powell chipped in with quickfire cameos late in the innings.

However, Mumbai Indians pulled them back a bit, claiming five wickets within the next fifty runs as SRH slumped to 96/5.\n\nOn a wicket that was providing even bounce despite the presence of some grass on the surface, the experienced Jasprit Bumrah, as has he done earlier too, provided the breakthrough, coming into the attack as the first-change bowler.\n\nHe struck in the last over of the Power-play when his length delivery held its line and took the outside edge as Abhishek played at it with little footwork, Ishan Kishan made a superb diving attempt to take a nice catch. Abhishek made 11 off 16 balls, a six off Anshul Kamboj being the lone boundary he hit on Monday.\n\nMayank Agarwal, brought in to bolster the batting, lasted just six balls. Debutant medium pacer Anshul Kamboj, who opened the bowling with Nuwan Thushara but was taken to 13 runs in his first over and 19 in his second, took Agarwal as his first wicket in IPL when he cleaned him up with a delivery that moved in a bit to beat the leg-side heave that the batter attempted.\n\nTravis Head, who was going strong at the other end, was dropped by Nuwan Thushara at deep third-man off Kamboj when he was on 45. The Australian opener had earlier struck three fours off the 23-year-old Kamboj from Haryana, the first off a free hit, which was also a no-ball. He had started with a four off Thushara in the first over. Piyush Chawla had his measure in the 11th over when Head attempted a slog-sweep off a fullish one and hit it straight to Tilak Varma at backward square leg.\n\nThe Sunrisers Hyderabad innings came apart after that as Nitish Kumar /reddy (20), Heinrich Klaasen (2), Shahbaz Ahmed (10), Marco Jansen (17) and Abdul Samad (3) fell in quick succession as they slipped to 136/8 from 90/3 at one juncture.\n\nPandya opened his account for the day y sending back the dangerous Nitish Reddy after the batter from Andhra Pradesh had hammered two fours off his bowling in the ninth over. Pandya had his man in his next over when Reddy played a pull off a short one outside off but was beaten by extra pace and skied it to Kamboj grabbed it between point and cover.\n\nhe claimed two wickets off the 16th over, sending back Shahbaz Ahmed and Jansen to further hamper SRH's progress.\n\nChawla got the crucial wickets of Travis Head and Henriech Klassen, cleaning him up with a fastish one that the wicketkeeper batter played onto his stumps. He also trapped Samad lbw to complete a three-fer.\n\nPat Cummins and Impact Player Sanvir Singh helped them negotiate the last couple of overs, taking them past the 150-run mark, Cummins struck two fours and as many sixes as he remained unbeaten on 35 to give SRH a below-par score.\n\nBrief scores:\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad 173/8 in 20 overs (Travis Head 48, Pat Cummins 35 not out; Hardik Pandya

Watch - Piyush Chawla abuses Heinrich Klaasen after rattling his stumps", "body": "The veteran Mumbai Indians (MI) leg-spinner Piyush Chawla looked at his very best in the 55th match of the Indian Premier League 2024 (IPL 2024) against Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai on Monday, May 6.\n\nPiyush Chawla picked up three biggest wickets in the innings as he dismissed Travis Head, Heinrich Klaasen and Abdul Samad - all three batters who have been winning matches for Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in the ongoing edition of the Indian Premier (IPL).\n\nThe best of the three wickets picked by Piyush Chawla was of Heinrich Klaasen as he rattled the stumps of the South African batsman. Notably, Piyush Chawla enjoys great success against Heinrich Klaasen in IPL as in 4 innings, he has dismissed the batter twice while giving away just 29 runs.\n\nOn the first ball of the 13th over, Piyush Chawla bowled a 91.9kph delivery on the stumps and Klaasen went for a big slog. The batter only managed to get an inside edge and saw his stumps getting rattled. After dismissing the batsman, Piyush Chawla looked quite pumped and he was seen saying an abusive word - Behe****d.\n\nSpeaking during the mid-innings break, Piyush Chawla said that a lot of dew had come in the first innings itself. Chawla added that he got the idea of which length to bowl after playing a few matches. Piyush Chawl elaborated:\n\n\"It's not gripping that much because a lot of dew has already come in. For seamers, there's quite a bit of help. This season, batters go for it if they see the ball a little pitched up even if they are new to the crease - I didn't realise that in the first few matches, but got the idea later about what length to bowl. 173 isn't going to be that easy, we'll still have to bat well. No, there's hardly anything for spinners in this wicket.\"\n\nIn the end, Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) finished their innings with a score of 173/8. The two performers in the batting department for SRH were Travis Head (48) and Pat Cummins (35).\n\nNotably, this is the second time these two teams were going head-to-head with each other in the ongoing edition of the competition. The first clash between the teams was an absolute high-scoring match where SRH emerged victorious by 31 runs on March 27.\n\nSince that game, Sunrisers Hyderabad have gone on to deliver great performances but Mumbai Indians have gone from bad to worse and are on the verge of getting eliminated from the playoffs race.\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad (Playing XI): Abhishek Sharma, Travis Head, Mayank Agarwal, Nitish Reddy, Heinrich Klaasen(w), Abdul Samad, Shahbaz Ahmed, Marco Jansen, Pat Cummins(c), Bhuvneshwar Kumar, T Natarajan\n\nMumbai Indians (Playing XI): Ishan Kishan(w), Rohit Sharma, Naman Dhir, Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya(c), Tim David, Anshul Kamboj, Piyush Chawla, Jasprit Bumrah, Nuwan Thushara", "source": {"uri": "cricketaddictor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketAddictor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piyush_Chawla", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Piyush Chawla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stump_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stump (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Klaasen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heinrich Klaasen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Samad_(Indian_cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abdul Samad (Indian cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wankhede_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wankhede Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg_spin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leg spin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Africa national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

The hosts, having lost all four of their previous games and virtually out of the tournament, will be giving it one last shot. They would want to seek revenge from SRH, who beat them in the reverse fixture in a high-scoring encounter which saw SRH bashing MI's bowlers all around.\n\nAs for SRH, they have everything to play for, with a spot in the Playoffs definitely up for grabs. Coming on the back of a one-run victory against the Rajasthan Royals in their last game, they would be looking to continue the same by carrying forward the momentum.\n\nThe surface at Wankhede Stadium has been among the most balanced surfaces in the Indian Premier League. The red soil deck, sourced from Matheran, is known to assist pacers in the first half and spinners as the game progresses. The humid conditions owing to sea-facing location also allows for dew to become a factor in night games. Thus, the captain winning the toss might fancy bowling first, to have a double advantage of the conditions in Mumbai.\n\nMumbai Indians\n\nIshan Kishan (wk), Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma, Nehal Wadhera, Hardik Pandya (c), Tim David, Mohammad Nabi, Gerald Coetzee, Piyush Chawla, Jasprit Bumrah\n\nAbhishek Sharma, Travis Head, Aiden Markram, Heinrich Klaasen (wk), Nitish Kumar Reddy, Abdul Samad, Shahbaz Ahmed, Pat Cummins (c), Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mayank Markande, Jaydev Unadkat\n\nCurrently, SRH's highest run-getter in the ongoing edition, Travis Head would enter the field to extend his flair, coming on the back of a half-century. The Australian all-rounder has scored 396 runs in the nine innings so far, and has given countless nightmares to bowlers alongside his opening partner Abhishek Sharma. MI will prepare differently to stem the runs from southpaw's blade.\n\nHaving already claimed 17 wickets in 11 matches this season, Jasprit Bumrah has been a class apart, despite his comrades getting torn apart in most of MI's games this season. The Purple Cap holder has a commendable record against the Sunrisers with 16 wickets to his name, and would look to add some more to the list.", "source": {"uri": "crictracker.com", "dataType":

There are calls for them to infuse some fresh faces into the 11 while resting India's 2024 T20 World Cup aces, Jasprit Bumrah and Rohit Sharma.\n\nIt seems unlikely but couldn't get harder for Hardik Pandya. The loss against a weakened Kolkata Knight Riders at home, despite winning the toss, was a killer blow after which, even such decisions would feel merely PR to appease the fans.\n\nAfter the game begins, SRH are almost certain to snatch all the attention back. They are one of the most exciting teams in IPL 2024. Lucknow Super Giants (LSG)'s loss on Sunday has given them an opening and Pat Cummins would know that if they have to make it to the top-four, they can't lose against the 10th-placed side.\n\nThe last time the two teams met in IPL 2024 was in Hyderabad in the first half of the season where the hosts smashed 277 to perhaps change the league forever. This match is likely to be tighter because both bowling attacks have improved, while the Wankhede seemed to have mellowed down for bowlers too.\n\nWhether it's pride or points, below, we have predicted three bowlers who can pick up the most wickets to help their teams achieve their respective goals:\n\n#3 Jasprit Bumrah\n\nAlthough MI's bowling attack has looked more balanced in recent games and they put up their best performance against KKR, Mumbai are still heavily revolved around Jasprit Bumrah. Hardik might not leave him out just yet because there's a mathematical chance for them to qualify and he could have a big impact again.\n\nBumrah is the highest-ever T20 wicket-taker at the Wankhede and has an excellent overall record against SRH, picking 16 wickets in 14 matches at an average of 24.50.\n\nGenerally, teams have tried to play his overs out in IPL 2024 but SRH's Heinrich Klaasen and Travis Head wouldn't do that, which will open the game up for Bumrah.\n\n#2 T Natarajan\n\nSRH are blessed with one of the best fast-bowling attacks in IPL 2024 and they strengthened it further by bringing in Marco Jansen for Aiden Markram in the last game. Given that there's always a bit of help available for pacers at Wankhede, any two (or even all four) could be successful today.\n\nT Natarajan has been the most consistent so far. He has 15 wickets in IPL 2024 and is yet to go wicketless in eight matches. He hasn't had a lot of success against MI in the past but this match, against one of the most fidgety batting lineups that has struggled against left-arm pace all season, could change that.\n\n#1 Bhuvneshwar Kumar\n\nAfter the form he showed in the last game against Rajasthan Royals (RR) in Hyderabad, it's hard to keep Bhuvneshwar Kumar away from the top of this list. His profound swing took out two of RR's best - Jos Buttler and Sanju Samson - while some vintage, smart death bowling helped SRH sneak out a one-run win.\n\nWankhede is likely to support both skills even more. He has 10 wickets at a decent average of 27.70 here. With both Rohit Sharma and Ishan Kishan struggling against swing early on and MI's lower order unable to put up match-winning performances so far, Kumar could have one of his best hunting days in IPL 2024.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rudransh_khurana@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Rudransh Khurana", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasprit_Bumrah", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jasprit Bumrah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardik_Pandya", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hardik Pandya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toss_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toss (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T.

One of those three games is on Monday against the Sunrisers Hyderabad side who are flying high.\n\nIt has been yet another dismal season for the five-time IPL winners as they sit at the bottom of the IPL points table. Hardik Pandya will want his side to win the rest of the matches in order to avoid the wooden spoon. One of the main weapons for Mumbai Indians will be pace bowler Jasprit Bumrah. The 30-year-old is one of the leading bowlers across the IPL this season and has been terrific. Jasprit Bumrah has already picked up a fifer this season and has been one of the few bright spots for MI.\n\nThe best bowling figures for Jasprit Bumrah against SRH came during the IPL 2017 season away from home. His figures of 3/24 came from four overs. His wickets that day included Ben Cutting followed by Naman Ojha and Rashid Khan.\n\nTravis Head - The Australian batter has been in devastating form with the bat for his SRH side. Jasprit Bumrah will want to get rid of Travis Head early in order to give Mumbai Indians the much needed breakthrough with the ball early in the game.\n\nAlso Read: Mumbai Indians' strongest predicted playing XI against Sunrisers Hyderabad, Match 55\n\nHeinrich Klassen - If Travis Head is dangerous at the top, the middle order is manned by South African star Heinrich Klaasen. The 31-year-old has already destroyed Mumbai Indians once this season and Jasprit Bumrah will want to deny a sequel.\n\nMumbai Indians' seamer Jasprit Bumrah is the 4 best bowler against SRH in IPL history. His 16 wickets and just one wicket behind Kagiso Rabada who has 17 wickets. Former Chennai Super Kings legend Dwayne Bravo is 2 with 22 wickets.\n\nFor the record Yuzvendra Chahal is the most successful bowler versus SRH with 28 wickets.

He also hit a century in the IPL after 12 long years this season. However, his performances have dipped drastically since, with his scores in the last five games reading - 4(5), 11(12), 4(5), 8(8), and 6(5).\n\nWith the 2024 T20 World Cup coming up in the next month, Indian fans have been hoping for Rohit Sharma to get out of the rut and regain his mojo. However, he could not do that during Monday's IPL 2024 match, as Pat Cummins dismissed him cheaply in the fourth over.\n\nA couple of fans shared a clip and pictures on X to give a glimpse of a dejected Rohit Sharma in the dressing room after he got out against SRH in the chase.

SRH bowlers put their side in the driver's seat with a brilliant performance with the new ball. However, SRH's joy was short-lived as Suryakumar Yadav single-handedly took MI over the line with a scintillating 51-ball century, reiterating his credentials as one of the premiere T20 batters in the world.\n\nMI captain Hardik Pandya hailed Suryakumar Yadav at the post-match presentation, saying:\n\n\"The best part about Suryakumar is that he puts the bowler under so much pressure, the other batters can take advantage of that. It breaks you, the places he hits them, you don't see the ball going there.

would surely end their already slim chances of advancement.\n\nThey approach this match on the back of four successive defeats and their new captain Hardik Pandya, who was brought in from Gujarat Titans with much fanfare before the tournament, would be desperate to regain some sort of form.\n\nThey would need a much improved all-round display to beat SRH as they failed to chase down a 170-run target at their home of the Wankhede Stadium.\n\nNeither Ishan Kishan, Rohit Sharma nor Tilak Varma, Naman Dhir, and Nehal Wadhera could get going as Suryakumar Yadav waged a lone battle.\n\nHyderabad have had an up and down season so far with six wins in 10 games keeping them at the fifth spot, a spot below Lucknow Super Giants on net run rate.\n\nThey beat table-topper Rajasthan Royals in their last match, which would give them confidence after two successive defeats against Chennai Super Kings and Royal Challengers Bengaluru earlier.\n\nUnder skipper Pat Cummins, SRH have been bombastic while batting first, scoring over 350 thee times with openers Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Heinrich Klaasen and Aiden Markram all going great guns.\n\nBut while chasing they have faltered, unable to reach targets of 200 runs or above even once and would be looking to make amends if given a chance.\n\nMumbai Indians: Ishan Kishan(w), Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak

Photograph: BCCI\n\nHardik Pandya regained his form with the ball, while veteran spinner Piyush Chawla bagged three wickets as Mumbai Indians restricted Sunrisers Hyderabad for a below-par 173/8 in their IPL 2024 match in Mumbai on Monday.\n\nPandya found rhythm and momentum to return 3/31 in four overs, while Chawla claimed 3/33 as the duo produced an impactful performance to dismantle the SRH batting line-up in the middle overs.\n\nSRH skipper Pat Cummins staged a late rescue act as he slammed a quickfire 17-ball 35, hitting two sixes and as many fours to take SRH past the 150-run mark.\n\nIMAGE: Mumbai Indians' players celebrates after Piyush Chawla dismissed Travis Head. Photograph: BCCI\n\nIn complete contrast to last time these teams met earlier in this IPL when SRH hammered 277/3, their usually free-flowing batters struggled for momentum and lack of initiative meant they could never really trouble the Mumbai bowlers.\n\nThe Powerplay had yielded 56 runs for the visitors without any damage but lack of initiative and regular fall of wickets stemmed the flow of runs.\n\nLeg-spinner Chawla made the biggest impact with key wickets of Travis Head (48) and Heinrich Klaasen (2) to put Mumbai Indians in complete control.\n\nIMAGE: Jasprit Bumrah celebrates with team-mates after taking the wicket of Abhishek Sharma. Photograph: BCCI\n\nHead, who rode his luck throughout his stay in the middle, could not make the most of it. With two inside edges for boundaries at the start, SRH's premier batter appeared to be struggling for timing and rhythm.\n\nIn the fourth over, Head (24) made room to smack MI debutant Ankush Kamboj and lost his off-stump in the process but that was when he got his first lifeline as the bowler was found to have overstepped. Head got another life when Nuwan Thushara spilled a regulation chance at thirdman when the opener was on 44 in the eighth over, but by then, SRH's decline had already begun.\n\nIMAGE: Pat Cummins bats. Photograph: BCCI\n\nBumrah had got Abhishek Sharma (11 off 16 balls) caught behind and Mayank Agarwal (5) had become the Kamboj's first victim.\n\nNitish Kumar Reddy (20) was bounced out by Pandya, who also snaffled the wicket of Shahbaz Ahmed (10) later on to mark a complete flop show with the bat for SRH.\n\nIMAGE: Anshul Kamboj celebrates the wicket of Mayank Agarwal.

The five-time champions are virtually out of the playoffs race but they can certainly spoil the party for the Pat Cummins-led SRH side. Meanwhile, MI's former captain Rohit Sharma played the previous game against Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) as an impact player due to back spasms.\n\nWill he be part of the playing XI for the clash against SRH? Well, the latest update coming from the MI camp is that Rohit is 'fit and fine' but it remains to be seen if the management takes precautionary measure keeping in mind the upcoming T20 World Cup.\n\nIn the pre-match press confernce on Sunday (May 5), Naman Dhir confirmed that the opening batter is fit. Moreover, Rohit Sharma also batted in the nets on Saturday and Sunday and didn't seem to be in any visible discomfort. If he is fully fit, then the 37-year-old should make it back to the playing XI.\n\nHaving said that, it also remains to be seen if Jasprit Bumrah, the purple cap holder of IPL 2024, is rested keeping his workload in mind given that MI are only mathematically in race to make it to top four. Interestingly, Hardik Pandya and his men fielded only three overseas players against KKR and even then, they couldn't make full use of Mohammad Nabi.\n\nMumbai Indians Squad: Ishan Kishan(w), Rohit

Despite facing challenges, SRH capitalized on a promising start and a spirited cameo from Pat Cummins to set a competitive target.\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) showcased a commendable recovery to set a total of 173, marking a notable turnaround despite initial challenges. While the score might not reach the soaring heights commonly witnessed in IPL matches, the pitch conditions were far from favourable for easy scoring. Opting to bat first, SRH made a promising start during the powerplay phase, with the opening partnership contributing a solid 56 runs. Although Abhishek Sharma faced difficulties, Travis Head's aggressive batting propelled the innings forward, benefiting from a couple of fortunate escapes - surviving being bowled off a no-ball and a dropped catch.\n\nHowever, the middle overs proved to be a struggle for SRH as Mumbai Indians (MI) tightened their grip with disciplined bowling. Hardik Pandya and Piyush Chawla emerged as pivotal figures, each claiming three wickets and consistently disrupting SRH's momentum. By the 16th over, SRH found themselves at 125/7, facing the risk of a modest total. Nonetheless, a spirited cameo from Pat Cummins, scoring an unbeaten 35 off just 17 deliveries, ensured SRH finished on a competitive note.\n\nLooking ahead, SRH's bowling performance holds the key to their chances, especially considering the slightly two-paced nature of the pitch.

They have lost each of their last four games.\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad, on the other hand, are at fourth with six wins in 10 matches. They defeated Rajasthan Royals (RR) by one run in their last match.\n\nThe teams clashed against each other on March 27 as SRH emerged victorious by 31 runs. Batting first, SRH scored 277/3 in the match.\n\nWankhede Stadium, Mumbai Pitch Report\n\n\"Let's reflect on the boundary sizes first - to my right it's 60m and to my left, it's 65m, down the ground it's 74m. I think you got two different games from two different ends, if you look at this end it is quite dry than what we have come to expect, still there is plenty of runs to be had, I think captains will utilise spin bowling down into this because it's quite dry and it might grip,\" Michael Clarke and Daren Ganga said ahead of MI vs KKR match - the last match at the venue which was played at a fresh strip.\n\n\"But, if we continue to walk up this pitch, we can see that the grass covering is a lot more even so the fast bowlers might get more pace and bite bowling from this end up here. So, from a batting perspective, you have to see which overs you are going to capitalize on, whom you are going to attack.\n\n\"I spoke to the groundsmen and they are expecting some dew tonight so the toss is important. The average first innings score here in the four matches this season is 190. It's not humid, there is no breeze around so I still think these are good batting conditions and I feel 190 is going to be below-par on this pitch,\" they added.\n\nIn the match, KKR scored 169 in 19.5 overs after being asked to bat first. Pacers picked eight wickets, while one wicket was taken by spinner Piyush Chawla. Andre Russell got run out. In reply, Mumbai were bundled out for 145 in 18.5 overs. Pacers picked six wickets, while spinners four.\n\nDue to the dew factor, team winning the toss will certainly look to bowl first. The average score in the last five T20s at the venue is 186. Team winning the toss has opted to bowl first 78 percent of the time in last five years.\n\nNo chances of rain in Mumbai on Monday, May 6. The humidity level will be close to 74 percent, and the temperature will hover around 30 degree celsius. The wind speed will be 11 km/h at the Wankhede Stadium.\n\nHow to watch MI vs SRH IPL 2024 Match 54?\n\nMI vs SRH live streaming will be available for free via the JioCinema app and website, while Star Sports network will show the matches live on TV from 7:30 PM IST with coverage starting at 6:30 PM IST.\n\nWhich TV channel will show IPL 2024 matches?\n\nTV viewers can catch MI vs SRH IPL 2024 action on the Star Sports network channels - Star Sports 1, Star Sports 1 Hindi, Star Sports 1 Kannada, Star Sports 1 Tamil, Star Sports 1 Telugu and Star Suvarna Plus.", "source": {"uri": "mykhel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "myKhel.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "utkarsh_singh@mykhel.com", "name": "Utkarsh Singh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wankhede_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wankhede Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajasthan Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Run rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daren_Ganga", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daren Ganga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Clarke_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Clarke (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toss_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toss (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JioCinema", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "JioCinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Suvarna", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Star Suvarna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Sports_(Indian_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Star Sports (Indian TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piyush_Chawla", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Piyush Chawla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Russell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andre Russell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Collecting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Collecting", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.mykhel.com/img/2024/05/pat-cummins-srh-vs-mi-1200-1714964244.jpg?06052024131517", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540533", "eventUri": "eng-9540533", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 167, "textEnd": 172, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-27", "textStart": 512, "textEnd": 520}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

Having opted to bowl, he hoped Mumbai Indians would play for pride, the badge, and the fans. Despite his calm demeanour though the weight on his shoulders was undeniable. His side was up against Sunrisers Hyderabad, who had slammed a colossal 277/3 against them earlier in the season. More importantly, another defeat would make them the first team to get knocked-out of the playoffs race in Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024.\n\nBut riding on a sparkling century by Suryakumar Yadav, MI earned a seven-wicket win at the Wankhede Stadium on Monday and lived to fight another day. They restricted SRH to a below-par 173/8 before Surya hit an unbeaten 102 off 51 balls in a match-winning 143-run partnership with Tilak Varma (37 off 32). Their campaign is still hanging by a thread, but the five-time champions will believe they can finish away from the bottom of the table.\n\nHaving begun the chase with a string of boundaries, MI found themselves in a hole after losing three wickets for five runs. While Ishan Kishan and Naman Dhir were caught in the slips, it was Rohit Sharma's dismissal that was the most disappointing. The India captain, who had scored 29 runs across the previous four games, got a top edge playing a half-hearted pull off Pat Cummins and walked back with four runs off five balls.\n\nFrom there, however, it was the Surya show all the way. The right-hander got his second IPL century on the back of some typically breathtaking stroke play. He did well to ride the storm initially along with Varma as Cummins and Bhuvneshwar Kumar bowled testing deliveries before cutting loose, hitting 12 fours and six sixes. Cummins used just one over of spin and the strategy didn't work as Surya kept finding the fence at will. The 33-year-old brought up his century with a six, closing out the game in the process with 16 balls to spare.\n\nEarlier, all eyes were on Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma in anticipation of another rollicking start. Although the two left-handers weren't at their fluent best, they managed a 56-run opening stand. It was Jasprit Bumrah, unsurprisingly, who provided the breakthrough for MI by getting Abhishek to edge to the 'keeper.\n\nAnshul Kamboj, making his IPL debut, was denied Head's wicket as Nuwan Thushara dropped a sitter in the deep. But the right-arm pacer from Haryana struck soon after by rattling Mayank Agarwal's stumps. At 90/2 in the 11th over, the visitors would have been hopeful of getting a formidable total. But they ended up losing six wickets for 46 runs from there on as Pandya (3/31) and Piyush Chawla (3/33) delivered standout spells.\n\nChawla showed his experience by bowling at a flatter trajectory, not allowing the batters to free their arms. The leg-spinner got the key wickets of Head and Heinrich Klaasen to leave SRH tottering at 96/5, before returning later to trap Abdul Samad leg before.\n\nPandya, meanwhile, got a much-needed confidence boost as he returned his best bowling figures of the season. The 30-year-old conceded 11 runs in his first over but bounced back strongly to get the wickets of Nitish Reddy, Marco Jansen and Shahbaz Ahmed. It took an unbeaten 35 off 17 balls by Cummins to take SRH to a fighting total, but it wasn't enough in the end.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan

He bagged 17 wickets at an average of 16.12 after appearing in 11 matches.\n\nWhile speaking at the pre-match press conference, Franklin said it will be an exciting match against MI if they can see Bumrah's showdown.\n\n\"He has generally a pretty big impact on games. But if we see that showdown, I am sure it will be pretty exciting to watch,\" Franklin said.\n\nThe SRH bowling coach added they are waiting to see how the Mumbai-based franchise uses Bumrah in the game on Monday.\n\n\"Let's see what sort of tactics Mumbai go with. How they use Bumrah. I know there has been a little bit of debate around about how he gets used, but again, it doesn't really matter where he gets used,\" he added.\n\nThe Sunrisers are holding fourth place on the IPL 2024 standings with 12 points after winning 6 of 10 matches in the tournament. They are coming into this match after beating Rajasthan Royal (RR) by just one run.\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad Squad: Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma, Anmolpreet Singh, Nitish Reddy, Heinrich Klaasen (Wk), Abdul Samad, Shahbaz Ahmed, Marco Jansen, Pat Cummins (C), Bhuvneshwar Kumar, T Natarajan, Jaydev Unadkat, Umran Malik, Mayank Markande, Aiden Markram, Sanvir Singh, Washington Sundar, Glenn Phillips, Rahul Tripathi, Mayank Agarwal, Upendra Yadav, Jhatavedh Subramanyan, Vijayakanth Viyaskanth, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Akash Maharaj Singh.

Here's What BCCI Vice-President Rajeev Shukla Had to Say (Watch Video).\n\nHowever, to his credit, SRH skipper Pat Cummins chipped in with a 17-ball 35 (2x4s, 2x6s) late in the innings to take them past the 150-run mark.\n\nIn complete contrast to last time these teams met earlier in this IPL when SRH hammered 277/3, their usually free-flowing batters struggled for momentum and lack of initiative meant they could never really trouble the Mumbai bowlers.\n\nAlso Read | Crystal Palace vs Manchester United Premier League 2023-24 Free Live Streaming Online: How To Watch EPL Match Live Telecast on TV & Football Score Updates in IST?.\n\nThe batters struggled on a two-paced surface and and MI were quick enough to capitalise.\n\nThe powerplay had yielded 56 runs for the visitors without any damage but lack of initiative and regular fall of wickets stemmed the flow of runs.\n\nComing on to bowl only in the second half of the innings, Chawla made the biggest impact with key wickets of Travis Head (48) and Heinrich Klaasen (2) to put Mumbai Indians in complete control.\n\nHead, who rode his luck throughout his stay in the middle, could not make the most of it.\n\nWith two inside edges for boundaries at the start, SRH's premier batter appeared to be struggling for timing and rhythm.\n\nIn the fourth over, on 24, Head made room to smack MI debutant Ankush Kamboj and lost his off-stump in the process but that was when he got his first lifeline as the bowler was found to have overstepped.\n\nHead got another life when Nuwan Thushara spilled a regulation chance at deep third man when the opener was on 44 in the eighth over, but by then, SRH's decline had already begun.\n\nBumrah had got Abhishek Sharma (11 off 16 balls) caught behind and Mayank Agarwal (5) had become the Kamboj's first victim.\n\nNitish Kumar Reddy (20) was bounced out by Pandya, who also snaffled the wicket of Shahbaz Ahmed (10) later on to mark a complete flop show with the bat for SRH.",

However, to his credit, SRH skipper Pat Cummins chipped in with a 17-ball 35 (2x4s, 2x6s) late in the innings to take them past the 150-run mark. In complete contrast to last time these teams met earlier in this IPL when SRH hammered 277/3, their usually free-flowing batters struggled for momentum and lack of initiative meant they could never really trouble the Mumbai bowlers. The powerplay had yielded 56 runs for the visitors without any damage but lack of initiative and regular fall of wickets stemmed the flow of runs. Coming on to bowl only in the second half of the innings, Chawla made the biggest impact with key wickets of Travis Head (48) and Heinrich Klaasen (2) to put Mumbai Indians in complete control. Head, who rode his luck throughout his stay in the middle, could not make the most of it. With two inside edges for boundaries at the start, SRH's premier batter appeared to be struggling for timing and rhythm.\n\nIn the fourth over, on 24, Head made room to smack MI debutant Ankush Kamboj and lost his off-stump in the process but that was when he got his first lifeline as the bowler was found to have overstepped.\n\nHead got another life when Nuwan Thushara spilled a regulation chance at deep third man when the opener was on 44 in the eighth over, but by then, SRH's decline had already begun.\n\nBumrah had got Abhishek Sharma (11 off 16 balls) caught behind and Mayank Agarwal (5) had become the Kamboj's first victim.\n\nNitish Kumar Reddy (20) was bounced out by Pandya, who also snaffled the wicket of Shahbaz Ahmed (10) later on to mark a complete flop show with the bat for SRH.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piyush_Chawla", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Piyush Chawla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardik_Pandya", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hardik Pandya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Klaasen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heinrich Klaasen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitish_Kumar_Reddy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nitish Kumar Reddy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuwan_Thushara", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuwan Thushara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahbaz_Ahmed_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shahbaz Ahmed (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayank_Agarwal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayank Agarwal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caught", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caught"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/16_01_2019_13_01_16_4088895.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540533", "eventUri": "eng-9540533", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

In current form, the 2016 winners score heavy over the five time winners as most of their batters and bowlers are in prime form.\n\nAlso Check: IPL 2024: Playoffs qualification scenarios for each team - CricTracker\n\nMayank Agarwal's poor form with the bat gave young Abhishek Sharma a chance to open the innings. Taking full advantage of the chance, the young left-handed batter has done his best and been in tremendous form with the bat.\n\nTravis Head has changed the way batting has been approached during this season of the IPL. The Australian star has been one of the most dangerous batters and time and again given SRH a great start. His first game of IPL 2024 came against MI where he scored a half-century in real quick time.\n\nThe onus of scoring runs in the middle-order falls on the South African duo of Aiden Markram and Heinrich Klaasen. The two batters have been in tremendous form, with Klaasen in particular being devastating against the spin bowlers.\n\nAbdul Samad began the season well with the bat, where he scored a few crucial knocks as a finisher. In the last few games, however, the young batter has seen runs dry up as the form has deserted him. With the Mumbai Indians bowlers struggling, Samad will want to use this as a chance to come back to form.\n\nYoung all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy played a pivotal knock in the last match against Rajasthan Royals. The cricketer has been gaining a lot of attention for his amazing batting and handy medium pace bowling.\n\nShahbaz Ahmed has been having somewhat of a break-out season. The 29-year-old has been in good nick with the bat and also been economical with the ball in hand. The southpaw will want to continue this form and help his side get into the Playoffs.\n\nOut of favour Indian pacer, Bhuvneshwar Kumar came back into roaring form during the game against the Royals. His wicket of Sanju Samson reminded fans of his vintage bowling skills, and his wicket to dismiss Rovman Powell showed nerve that the experienced pacer can hold at crucial junctures of the game.\n\nCaptain Cummins too will want to contribute more with the ball as he continues to grow leaps and bounds as a captain. Jaydev Unadkat who spent a season in Mumbai will want to come back and prove a point against his former side.

Mumbai Indians find themselves at the bottom of the IPL 2024 standings with only three wins out of 11 matches, with six points to their name. On the other hand, SunRisers Hyderabad are currently hovering in fourth place, having garnered 12 points with six wins out of 10 matches. Let's delve into the predicted XI lineups of both teams as we approach what promises to be an enticing matchup.\n\nDespite early fireworks in the season, Ishan Kishan has looked stuttering with the bat. With 257 runs in 11 matches, the wicketkeeper batter will be eager to score big against SRH.\n\nIndia skipper Rohit Sharma has struggled to score runs in the recent matches for MI. However, with 326 runs in 11 matches and a century to his name, Rohit will likely display his batting prowess sooner rather than later.\n\nIn the last match against KKR, Naman Dhir couldn't leave a mark. Despite getting few chances to bat in IPL 2024, Dhir has only managed 61 runs in four matches with an impressive strike rate of 169.44. Additionally, he is still awaiting his maiden IPL wicket and aims to make a significant contribution at home on Monday.\n\nSuryakumar Yadav has enjoyed his scintillating form in IPL 2024. Having already notched up three fifty-plus scores, SKY has accumulated 232 runs in eight matches backed by a stunning strike rate of over 168. The right-hander could likely add another big score to his tally come Monday.\n\nIndian batter Tilak Varma has been one of the shining lights for MI in their dismal IPL 2024 campaign. The explosive southpaw has piled up 347 runs in 11 matches while maintaining a strike rate of 151.52. Varma's sublime form could prove lethal against SRH.\n\nNehal Wadhera is yet to leave a mark with the bat in IPL 2024. With 105 runs in four matches, Wadhera will be raring to score crucial runs in the upcoming match against Hyderabad. The left-hander boasts a strike rate of 134.62 and is a vital cog in the MI camp.\n\nHardik Pandya (captain)\n\nMI's new skipper Hardik Pandya has probably failed to crack the winning algorithm in the IPL 2024. Additionally, the Indian all-rounder has struggled to convert his cameos into big scores. However, Pandya can also prove effective with the ball considering he has scalped eight wickets for MI.\n\nTim David\n\nAustralian hard-hitting batter Tim David couldn't replicate his IPL 2023 success this year. So far, David has accumulated 241 runs in 11 matches, showcasing a commendable strike rate of 161.74. Meanwhile, his clean-hitting prowess at the Wankhede Stadium makes him a regular starter at home.\n\nGerald Coetzee\n\nGerald Coetzee, the Protea pacer, will lead MI's pace bowling assault against SRH on Monday. Coetzee's capacity to dismantle batters with his sheer pace has propelled him to claim 13 wickets in 10 matches at an economy rate of 10.18.\n\nPiyush Chawla\n\nVeteran legspinner Piyush Chawla will be key in executing Mumbai Indians' spin attack. Chawla's array of spin variations have guided him to five wickets in eight matches. Piyush has also maintained an economy rate of 9.25, making him handy in restricting the opposition batters to a lesser score.\n\nJasprit Bumrah\n\nStar Indian bowler Jasprit Bumrah has been in sensational form this season. With 17 wickets in eleven matches, Bumrah is one of the highest wicket-takers in IPL 2024. His ability to bowl accurate yorkers could see him outmuscle SRH's explosive batting lineup come Monday.\n\nSunRisers Hyderabad's highest run-scorer this season, Travis Head is likely to open the innings against MI. While boasting a strike rate of 194.12, Head has amassed 396 runs in just nine matches. The southpaw has also recorded three fifty-plus scores and a century in the ongoing IPL edition. His form will be crucial in guiding SRH home.\n\nAbhishek Sharma\n\nAbhishek Sharma is enjoying his explosive form with the bat in IPL 2024. The swashbuckling southpaw has notched up 315 runs in 10 matches while boasting a humongous strike rate of 208.60. He will aim to play a big knock and lead SRH to a brisk start against MI.\n\nAiden Markram\n\nAiden Markram will aim to take the pressure off SRH's opening batters. With 199 runs in nine matches, Markram has had a decent run with the bat in IPL 2024. He also has a half-ton to his name and will be eager to take his runs tally up by a notch soon.\n\nNitish Kumar Reddy\n\nNitish Kumar Reddy's inclusion in the playing XI has added stability to SRH's starting XI. The all-rounder's aggressive batting style has guided him to 219 runs with the bat and three wickets with the ball in just seven matches. Reddy will enter this contest on the back of a 76-run knock in the last match and will aim to continue his form against MI.\n\nHeinrich Klaasen (wicketkeeper)\n\nThe fiery Protea batter Heinrich Klassen is one of the shining lights for the SunRisers in IPL 2024. The wicketkeeper batter has accumulated 337 runs in 10 matches at a strike rate of 189.33. He will play an X-factor role against MI.\n\nAbdul Samad\n\nAbdul Samad is enjoying his rhythm with the bat in the ongoing season. With a strike rate of 187.34, Samad has notched up 148 runs in 10 matches this season. His ability to score hefty runs in the middle makes him an important player in SRH's batting lineup.\n\nShahbaz Ahmad\n\nShahbaz Ahmad's inclusion in the playing XI will add depth and stability to SRH's batting and bowling units.

Sitting patiently on his mother's lap, it was Jasprit Bumrah's son Angad who watched his father bowling the most-economic spell for the hosts.\n\nMI vs SRH IPL 2024 Live\n\nBumrah returned 1 for 23 in four overs. The right-arm quick provided MI with an opening breakthrough after the hosts decided to bowl first. Bumrah struck in the final over of the Powerplay to break the half-century stand between Abhishek Sharma and Travis Head for the opening wicket. The pacer bowled a length ball from around the wicket, Abhishek poked at it without moving his feet and edged it straight to the keeper.\n\nMeanwhile, the camera panned towards the stands where Bumrah's wife, Sanjana Ganesan was seated with little Angad in her lap.

The MI skipper found form to return 31/3 in 4 overs while Chawla (4-0-33-3) produced an impactful performance to trouble the SRH batters.\n\nHowever, SRH skipper Pat Cummins chipped in with a 17-ball 35 (2x4s, 2x6s) late in the innings to take them past the 150-run mark. In complete contrast to the last time these teams met earlier in this IPL when SRH hammered 277/3, their usually free-flowing batters struggled for momentum and lack of initiative meant they could never really trouble the Mumbai bowlers.\n\nThe powerplay had yielded 56 runs for the visitors without any damage but lack of initiative and regular fall of wickets stemmed the flow of runs.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasprit_Bumrah", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jasprit Bumrah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wankhede_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wankhede Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piyush_Chawla", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Piyush Chawla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardik_Pandya", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hardik Pandya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/05/jasprit-bumrahs-wife-sanjana-ganesan-with-son-angad-2024-05-8f5f7478beba1e9dd06f829ef21c0ecc-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540533", "eventUri": "eng-9540533", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

It's interesting to see if the trend continues in the upcoming MI vs SRH clash, between the Mumbai Indians and Sunrisers Hyderabad on May 06, 2024.\n\nThe visitors have been going through a horrible time in the death overs, with the ball in hand, at an economy of 12.25, the second most in this tournament. On the other hand, Mumbai have an economy is 11.16 in the last five overs, which sits right in the middle of the ten teams.\n\nBoth teams haven't conceded many sixes before the MI vs SRH clash, as Hyderabad bowlers have gone for 31 sixes, while Mumbai have been smashed for 32 over boundaries. However, the five-time champions have grabbed 25 wickets in this period, which is the second most, but seven less than the top position in this IPL 2024.

If they want to end this 17th season of the tournament on a high, then they need to find some firepower at the back end of the 20 overs.\n\nThe AccuWeather confirms that the evening temperature in Wankhede during the MI vs SRH affair will be around 29\u00b0C. The humidity level will be 76%, which indicates a good amount of dew during the game. However, if the pitch falls on the slower side, the team winning the toss may look to bat first.\n\nAlso Read: IPL 2024: RCB To Win The Tournament?

The flamboyant batter struggled with his injury but kept pushing hard till the end and got the job done for Mumbai Indians. Against a team, that was dominating everyone with the ball, Suryakumar maintained his composure and played to his merit to help Mumbai win the match by seven wickets.\n\nBatting first, Surnisers Hyderabad struggled a bit. Travis Head survived on two different occasions. First, debutant Anshul Kombaj rattled the stumps but it was a no-ball and latter, a sitter was dropped. Meanwhile, Abhishek Sharma couldn't do any damage. Head, however, kept going as he made 48 runs off 30 deliveries but barely got any support from the others. Towards the fag end, skipper Pat Cummins smashed 35* runs off 17 deliveries which helped them post 173 runs on the board in the first innings.\n\nAlso Read - Who is Anshul Kamboj?\n\nWhen it came to the chase, Mumbai got off to a flying start but most of their runs came through extras. Sooner than later, they lost three wickets and were on the back foot. Just when it was felt that Mumbai are slowly inching towards another defeat, Suryakumar stepped up and smashed a brilliant century. Tilak Varma supported him well in the middle, which made the chase easier for Mumbai.\n\n1. Mumbai ka Raja - Suryakumar Yadav\n\nSuryakumar actually played like a king against Hyderabad. He smashed the bowlers all over the park and made 102* runs off 51 balls as Mumbai won the match with 16 balls remaining. Him returning back to runs is a massive plus point for not just Mumbai but also for the national team. He suffered an injury during the chase but he didn't stop attacking and eventually won it for Mumbai.\n\n2. Chawla still got it\n\nWhenever people talk about Mumbai's bowling attack, they talk about Jasprit Bumrah and rightly so, but Piyush Chawla was sensational against Hyderabad which deserves a lot of recognition. The veteran spinner picked up three crucial wickets of Travis Head, Heinrich Klaasen and Abdul Samad, which broke SRH's backbone. He was critical in MI's massive victory over SRH.\n\n3. What went wrong for SRH?\n\nUnless their openers manage to give them a good start, SRH have struggled with the bat. That is one area that the management needs to address immediately. Klaasen not being in form in not helping them and they also should look forward to bringing in Glenn Phillips in place of Marco Jansen. They can play Umran Malik with the ball and Phillips can too provide a couple of overs.\n\nProbably a couple short, at the Wankhede you want as many as you can get. You always feel like you're in, the wicket had a little bit in it so we were definitely in the game. I think Sanvir helped us get to that 170 instead of 150, ideally we'd have a bowler. It's T20 cricket, and it doesn't always work out. SKY played really well. We like playing at home, we'll wait and see what's ahead of us. Hopefully a few more fireworks.\n\nWe want to focus on playing good cricket, still think we gave 10-15 runs extra. The way the batters batter, that was excellent. My bowling, I like to bowl in the right areas, I bowl according to the situation. Bowled in the right areas today and it worked. I was like Chawla had to bowl from the shorter side. You got to be accurate, the margin of errors have become smaller these days for the bowlers. It's unbelievable, the best past of SKY is that he puts the bowlers under pressure. It's sheer confidence, his game has changed, is one of the best batters. He can change a game in a different way, lucky to have him (SKY) in our side.", "source": {"uri": "crictracker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricTracker"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suryakumar_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Suryakumar Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "No-ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piyush_Chawla", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Piyush Chawla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wankhede_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wankhede Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stump_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stump (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasprit_Bumrah", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jasprit Bumrah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umran_Malik", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Umran Malik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Jansen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marco Jansen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowled", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowled"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Phillips_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glenn Phillips (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Klaasen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heinrich Klaasen"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.crictracker.com/media/attachments/1715017933015_mi-mp-2.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540533", "eventUri": "eng-9540533", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

Although both Hardik and Piyush conceded over 30 runs each, their middle-over spells were effective. Here are the key stats.\n\nSRH openers Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma added 56 runs after MI elected to field. However, the Orange Army were down to 96/5. While Abhishek and Mayank Agarwal departed within two overs, Chawla dismissed Head and Klaasen in back-to-back overs. Skipper Hardik backed himself and removed Nitish Reddy, Marco Jansen, and Shahbaz Ahmed. Chawla later dismissed Abdul Samad, reducing SRH to 136/8.\n\nHardik took three wickets for 31 runs, while leg-spinner Piyush conceded 33 runs. It is worth noting that the middle overs (7-14) produced just 51 runs for four wickets. The scoring rate in this phase was 6.37.

There's only one possibility and they need CSK's help", "body": "Mumbai Indians have endured a catastrophic campaign under new captain Hardik Pandya. Having won three games out of their first 11, MI are sitting at the bottom of the points table with just six points and only three games left to play.\n\nHence their chances for IPL playoffs are practically impossible and close to zero. But mathematically there is still one possibility for Mumbai Indians to miraculously seal an IPL Playoffs spot and that requires a massive help from Chennai Super Kings.\n\nThe Mumbai Indians are all set to take on Sunrisers Hyderabad at home in match 55 of IPL 2024 today. Skipper Hardik Pandya and his troops enter the contest knowing full well that it is a do or die match for them. A loss today would mean that Mumbai Indians will be officially eliminated from the IPL 2024 Playoffs race. A win can keep Mumbai Indians playoffs hopes alive. So how can MI still qualify for IPL 2024 playoffs and where does CSK come into the picture?\n\nAlso Read | West Indies on High Alert as Trinidad PM confirms T20 WC terror threat\n\nHow can Mumbai Indians still qualify for IPL Playoffs 2024?\n\nThe equation for MI players, coaching staff and Hardik Pandya is simple, win all your three remaining games, get to 12 points, improve net run rate and hope other teams falter.\n\nIf Mumbai Indians win all their remaining games, their points tally will go to 12 points. Then they would require that none of the teams from the 4th spot to 9th spot reach 14 points otherwise they will be eliminated from the playoffs race.\n\nMI need CSK's help to qualify\n\nMI cannot qualify in the top 3 places as Lucknow Super Giants and Sunrisers Hyderabad, both teams that are on 12 points will face each other. Hence one of these two teams is bound to reach 14 points. So Mumbai Indians can only qualify to the playoffs through the fourth spot.\n\nFor that miracle to happen, MI will be hoping that CSK go on to lose all of their remaining three games against Rajasthan Royals, Gujarat Titans and Royal Challengers Bengaluru. If CSK fail to win all their three games then MI will be in the equation if none of DC, PBKS, RCB and GT reach 14 points.\n\nAlso Read | Irfan Pathan BLASTS MS Dhoni, argues he fails to fulfil his role\n\nThe probability of Mumbai Indians qualifying is close to zero and if they manage to do so then it will be nothing short of a miracle.

While the opening duo of Nuwan Thushara and debutant Anshul Kamboj got some tap, the ever-reliable Jasprit Bumrah returned with economical figures yet again, proving to be the most miserly of the lot. Skipper Hardik Pandya and Piyush Chawla returned three wickets apiece.\n\nOnto the chase, SRH had the Mumbai Indians in a tight spot after picking up their first three with only 31 on the board. However, it was Suryakumar Yadav's heroics which got MI over the line, with his adroit and ferocious 102* (51) taking his side to a seven-wicket victory, with Tilak Varma playing the perfect partner by scoring 37 off 32.\n\nAlso Check: IPL 2024 Points Table\n\nHardik and Cummins, the captains of the Mumbai Indians and the Sunrisers Hyderabad, respectively, gave it their all for their sides. Both of them shone in the first innings, with Hardik coming back strongly after being hit for 22 off his first two, picking the crucial wicket of Nitish Kumar Reddy off the first delivery of his third over. In his final one, he scalped two to put SRH on the backfoot. Meanwhile, Cummins came in in the 16th over, with his side destabilised at 124/7. His late blitz with the bat propelled SRH to a somewhat decent total of 173/8, while at one point, they weren't even looking like reaching 150.\n\nThe IPL veteran came back superbly after conceding nine in the first over of the match. His next one was a magnificently orchestrated maiden over to Naman Dhir, with him equalling Praveen Kumar's tally of bowling 14 maidens in the history of the IPL. His third over produced the wicket of Dhir, whose harrowing stay at the crease was put to an end after a nine-ball duck, Bhuvneshwar's penultimate delivery of his spell getting mowed over long-on for a maximum, which disrupted his figures. Nonetheless, it was an amazing exhibition of seam-bowling by the master for the umpteenth time.\n\nWith his side in a spot of bother at 31/3 in 4.1 overs, it was all to do for the batters to come to save Mumbai from yet another loss this IPL campaign. Local boy Suryakumar Yadav stepped up to the task and how! He quickly got going, taking charge to the bowlers, particularly taking a liking to Marco Jansen, dispatching him for a whopping 32 runs in the nine deliveries he faced from the towering lanky South African. His 51-ball 102-run knock proved to be the difference between both sides, notching up his second IPL ton and sixth century in T20 cricket to hand his side a rare win in the ongoing IPL.", "source": {"uri": "crictracker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricTracker"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuwan_Thushara", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuwan Thushara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardik_Pandya", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hardik Pandya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasprit_Bumrah", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jasprit Bumrah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piyush_Chawla", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Piyush Chawla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wankhede_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wankhede Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitish_Kumar_Reddy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nitish Kumar Reddy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilak_Varma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tilak Varma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suryakumar_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suryakumar Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Jansen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marco Jansen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crease_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crease (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Duck (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.crictracker.com/media/attachments/1715017933030_MI-mp-1.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540533", "eventUri": "eng-9540533", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

Pandya found rhythm and momentum to return 4-0-31-3 while Chawla (4-0-33-3) produced an impactful performance to trouble the SRH batters. This was Pandya's fourth best bowling figures in the IPL. Indian cricket team captain Rohit Sharma was a happy man seeing the progress of his NO. 1 all rounder.\n\nHowever, to his credit, SRH skipper Pat Cummins chipped in with a 17-ball 35 (2x4s, 2x6s) late in the innings to take them past the 150-run mark.\n\nIn complete contrast to last time these teams met earlier in this IPL when SRH hammered 277/3, their usually free-flowing batters struggled for momentum and lack of initiative meant they could never really trouble the Mumbai bowlers.\n\nThe batters struggled on a two-paced surface and and MI were quick enough to capitalise.\n\nThe powerplay had yielded 56 runs for the visitors without any damage but lack of initiative and regular fall of wickets stemmed the flow of runs.\n\nHead, who rode his luck throughout his stay in the middle, could not make the most of it.\n\nWith two inside edges for boundaries at the start, SRH's premier batter appeared to be struggling for timing and rhythm.\n\nIn the fourth over, on 24, Head made room to smack MI debutant Ankush Kamboj and lost his off-stump in the process but that was when he got his first lifeline as the bowler was found to have overstepped.\n\nHead got another life when Nuwan Thushara spilled a regulation chance at deep third man when the opener was on 44 in the eighth over, but by then, SRH's decline had already begun.\n\nNitish Kumar Reddy (20) was bounced out by Pandya,

That victory not only marked SRH's first win of the season but also set the stage for a campaign where they've been nothing short of explosive.\n\nCurrently fourth in the points table with six wins from ten games, a victory on Monday would inch them closer to securing a playoff berth.\n\nOn the other hand, MI has struggled to find their footing since their first loss of the season to SRH. They are languishing at the bottom of the IPL 2024 points table with just three wins in eleven matches.\n\nThe Hardik Pandya-led side's hopes for a playoff spot have all but evaporated, and they'll be playing for pride in the upcoming clash. Here's a look at SRH's Probable XI vs MI.\n\nSRH's opening pair, Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma, have been in blistering form, consistently tearing apart opposition bowling attacks. They'll be keen to unleash their fury once more on the batter-friendly pitch at the Wankhede.\n\nThe previous match saw Aiden Markram benched, with Anmolpreet Singh stepping into the No. 3 spot. However, Singh's failure to score is likely to pave the way for Markram's return.\n\nThe middle-order trio of Nitish Reddy, Heinrich Klaasen, and Abdul Samad have been in stellar form and are expected to retain their spots.\n\nShahbaz Ahmed will continue to bring his versatility to the No. 7 position, while Marco Jansen, who had a forgettable last outing conceding 44 runs without claiming a wicket, might find himself on the sidelines as Markram will take the fourth overseas player's spot in SRH's playing XI.\n\nLeading the charge with the ball will be the formidable quartet of captain Pat Cummins, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, T Natarajan, and Jaydev Unadkat, forming a fast-bowling lineup that MI will find challenging to counter.\n\nAs the clock ticks down to the MI vs SRH clash, the Men in Orange will be looking to repeat their early-season heroics and edge closer to the playoffs, while the home side will aim to salvage pride and perhaps play the role of spoilers in what has been a challenging season for them.\n\nSRH's Probable Playing XI Vs Mumbai Indians", "source": {"uri": "cricket.one", "dataType": "news", "title": "OneCricket"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Jansen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marco Jansen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wankhede_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wankhede Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

He hammered 12 fours and 6 sixes. His stupendous knock helped MI clinch a seven-wicket win over the Hyderbad-based franchise at the Wankhede Stadium.\n\nWhile speaking after the match, Suryakumar pointed out that he has fielded for 20 overs and batted for 18 overs so there's no need to worry about his injury.\n\n\"I have done this after a long time. I fielded for 20 overs and batted for 18 overs, only tired (nothing else to worry about.) I feel it was the need of the hour for me. I went out to bat, needed someone to bat till the end. When the ball stopped seaming, I played all my shots that I practice in the nets. I feel the intent would have been the same, I would have definitely played in the same pattern,\" Suryakumar said.\n\nRecapping the match, MI won the toss and elected to field first. SRH lost wickets at regular intervals from the beginning and it was knocks from Travis Head (48 in 30 balls, with seven fours and a six) and skipper Pat Cummins (35* in 17 balls, with two fours and two sixes) that took SRH to 173/8 in their 20 overs.\n\nIn the run chase, MI lost their top order early and was reeling at 31/3. It was then that Suryakumar (102* in 51 balls with 12 fours and six sixes) and Tilak Varma (37* in 32 balls, with six fours) launched a counter attack which guided MI to a win with 16 balls left.\n\nSuryakumar took home the 'Player of the Match' honour.\n\nMI is at the ninth spot with four wins and eight losses, giving them eight points.

The 5-time champions, who are no longer in the race for the playoffs, played the party popper's role to perfection. Suryakumar Yadav battled discomfort in his legs to hit a match-winning 102 not out in 51 balls after captain Hardik Pandya and Piyush Chawla shone with the ball to help MI get off the bottom spot in the points table.\n\nChasing 174 on a pitch that was the bowlers' friend for most of the game, MI were reduced to 31 for 3 after their top-order batters, including Rohit Sharma and Ishan Kishan, were dismissed for single-digit scores. However, Suryakumar Yadav and Ishan Kishan stiched 143 runs for the 4th wicket in just 69 deliveries as they helped Mumbai complete the chase in just 17.2 overs.\n\nMI vs SRH, IPL 2024 Highlights | Scorecard\n\nSuryakumar Yadav was struggling to run between the wickets, but he did not give up and only relied on big-hitting in the latter half of MI's chase. Suryakumar hit a six to get to his second IPL hundred and take MI past the finish line.\n\nSuryakumar hit 6 sixes and 12 boundaries in one of his finest IPL knocks as the World No.1 T20I batter used all his experience to rescue MI and help them clinch 2 rare points in the ongoing season. Tilak Varma played a crucial hand as the young left-hander was solid at the other end. Tilak finished with 37 from 32 balls, but his knock was worth its weight in gold.\n\nIt was Suryakumar Yadav's second IPL hundred and his sixth three-figure score in T20 cricket. The India star became only the second batter after Rohit Sharm to hit more than one hundred for MI in the history of the tournament.\n\nWith the win, MI took their tally to 8 points in 12 matches and pushed Gujarat to the bottom of the points table. On the other hand, SunRisers lost an opportunity to move to the 3rd spot and they are holding on to the 4th spot in the 10-team table with 12 points from 11 games.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suryakumar_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Suryakumar Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardik_Pandya", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hardik Pandya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishan_Kishan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ishan Kishan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piyush_Chawla", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Piyush Chawla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wankhede_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wankhede Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilak_Varma", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tilak Varma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20 International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gujarat"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gujarat"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202405/suryakumar-yadav-065537195-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=y_..eLmZKU_O9FgoibWC4sv4bUNyII8y", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540533", "eventUri": "eng-9540533", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 255, "textEnd": 260}], "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

AP\n\nSuryakumar Yadav scored a fine century on Monday as Mumbai Indians (MI) kept themselves alive in the 2024 Indian Premier League (IPL) with a seven-wicket win over Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) at the Wankhede Stadium.\n\nMI were set a target of 174 by SRH after the five-time champions opted to bowl first. Despite getting off to a brisk start, MI lost Ishan Kishan (9) in the second over. Former captain Rohit Sharma could only collect a solitary boundary before being caught by Heinrich Klaasen off Pat Cummins\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ball in the fourth over.\n\nMI were eventually restricted to 31/3 in the fifth over, following the dismissal of Naman Dhir, who was caught by Marco Jansen at first slip off Bhuvneshwar Kumar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bowling.\n\nSuryakumar Yadav had come in at number four, following Rohit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wicket, and the 33 year-old would go onto forge an unbeaten 143-run stand with Tilak Varma, who played a supporting role with a 32-ball 37.\n\nSKY got to his fifty off 30 deliveries, and took only 21 more balls to convert that into a century.

He helped MI to secure a dominating seven-wicket victory at Wankhede Stadium on Monday, May 6.\n\nWith this impressive knock, 'SKY' slammed his second century and also crossed the 3,500-run mark in the cash-rich league. He smoked 12 fours and six fours on his way to a breathtaking century. The 33-year-old arrived at the crease when MI were struggling at 31/3, but resurrected the team's innings along with Tilak Varma.\n\nSKY went on to unleash his trademark shots towards the backward square leg region to get things going. He then toiled the SRH bowlers all around the park. Meanwhile, Tilak Varma provided strong support to remain unbeaten on 37 off 32 to seal the chase with 16 balls to spare.\n\nWith this victory, MI climbed to the ninth position with four wins in 12 IPL 2024 matches.\n\nHere's how the fans reacted to SKY's match-winning knock:\n\nA large section of the crowd expressed their admiration for Surya's form ahead of T20 World Cup 2024, where he will likely play at No.4 for India.\n\n\"Much needed century by Suryakumar Yadav before the World Cup,\" one fan tweeted.\n\n\"The role of Suryakumar Yadav will be the most important for India to win the T20 World Cup 2024,\" another noted.\n\n\"One of the best innings from #SuryakumarYadav \ud83d\udd25 Need this form in T-20 Worldcup too..!\" one fan commented.\n\nSuryakumar Yadav's MI puts SRH plans in jeopardy\n\nThe SunRisers Hyderabad batted first and were off to a decent start with Travis Head (48). However, the middle-order failed to perform. Pat Cummins then provided a valuable contribution of 35* to help the visitors post a par total of 174.\n\nThe score proved to be far less demanding, as MI inflicted a significant loss to SRH, which impacted their net run rate as well. With six wins in 11 league matches, the Hyderabad-based franchise are fourth in the points table with -0.065 NRR.\n\nThey now need to win at least two of their remaining three matches to cement their place in the top two positions to gain an advantage in the playoffs.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tejas_rathi@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Tejas Rathi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suryakumar_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Suryakumar Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilak_Varma", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tilak Varma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wankhede_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wankhede Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crease_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crease (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Not out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_run_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Net run rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting order (cricket)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/3942c-17150196754494-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540533", "eventUri": "eng-9540533", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 239, "textEnd": 244}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

Mumbai played the last game with only three overseas players and might consider a change or two to that combination against a Hyderabad outfit that demolished their bowling in the reverse fixture.\n\nMI's squad for IPL 2024: Rohit Sharma, Hardik Pandya (c), Dewald Brevis, Suryakumar Yadav, Ishan Kishan, Tilak Varma, Tim David, Harvik Desai, Arjun Tendulkar, Shams Mulani, Nehal Wadhera, Jasprit Bumrah, Kumar Kartikeya, Piyush Chawla, Akash Madhwal, Luke Wood, Romario Shepherd, Nuwan Thushara, Anshul Kamboj, Naman Dhir, Shreyas Gopal, Kwena Maphaka, Gerald Coetzee, Mohammad Nabi, Shivalik Sharma\n\nOn that note, here is MI's predicted playing XII (including one impact sub) for Match 55 of IPL 2024 against SRH.\n\nOpeners: Rohit Sharma and Ishan Kishan (wk)\n\nRohit Sharma and Ishan Kishan started the season well, but the duo's form has cooled off of late. While the former has barely been able to enter double digits, the latter hasn't looked too fluent at the crease. They are usually dangerous at the Wankhede Stadium and will have to deliver if MI are to get back to winning ways.\n\nMiddle Order: Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma, Nehal Wadhera, Hardik Pandya (c), Tim David, and Mohammad Nabi\n\nNaman Dhir batted at No. 3 in the last game, but he has looked out of place in the MI side throughout IPL 2024. While he is a player of high potential, Mumbai simply don't have the room to fit him in their XII without compromising the ideal positions of their other batters.\n\nSo MI could opt to bring back Mohammad Nabi at Dhir's expense to have a better-quality off-spinner who can bowl in the powerplay. Nabi could prove effective against the likes of Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma.\n\nSuryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma, Nehal Wadhera and Hardik Pandya form the backbone of the middle order, with Tim David's big-hitting being one of their weapons at the death.\n\nLower Order: Gerald Coetzee, Jasprit Bumrah, Piyush Chawla, Nuwan Thushara\n\nNuwan Thushara broke the back of the opposition's top order with a three-wicket burst in the last game, and he is likely to continue partnering with Jasprit Bumrah in the pace attack.\n\nGerald Coetzee wasn't used much in the previous outing, but MI can be expected to retain him ahead of the likes of Romario Shepherd and Luke Wood. Coetzee's high pace and hit-the-deck skills could ask questions of the SRH middle order.\n\nPiyush Chawla, who bowled an economical spell recently, will be the lead spinner.\n\nMI's predicted playing XII (inc impact sub): Rohit Sharma, Ishan Kishan (wk), Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma, Nehal Wadhera, Hardik Pandya (c), Tim David, Mohammad Nabi, Piyush Chawla, Jasprit Bumrah, Gerald Coetzee, Nuwan

While MI are out of the playoffs race, Hardik's bowling form was in focus as India picked him as the specialist fast-bowling all-rounder in their T20 World Cup squad. Much to the delight of Rohit, Hardik shone with the ball, picking 3 wickets as MI restricted SRH to 173 after opting to bowl in the big-ticket contest on Monday, May 6. MI vs SRH, IPL 2024 Updates | Scorecard\n\nRohit Sharma and the selectors backed Hardik Pandya and picked him as vice-captain for the World Cup despite his ordinary form in the first half of IPL 2024. Hardik, however, has shown signs of returning to good form with the ball. In his last three games for MI, the captain has picked 7 wickets -- 2 for 26 against LSG, 2 for 44 against KKR, and 3 for 31 against SRH.\n\nRohit Sharma looked impressed by Hardik Pandya's spell against SRH as he was seen patting the all-rounder on his back after the crucial wickets in the middle overs of the contest.\n\nHardik Pandya brought himself into the attack only after the powerplay, showcasing more sense in his decision-making as he allowed the likes of Nuwan Tushara, Jasprit Bumrah and debutant Anshul Kamboj to operate in the first 6 overs. Hardik got his first wicket in the 12th over with a well-directed bouncer that caught in-form Nitish Kumar Reddy by surprise because of the extra pace.\n\nHe then got the big wickets of all-rounders Shahbaz Ahmed and Marco Jansen to dent SunRisers' progress with the bat on Monday.

It's fair to suggest that Mumbai Indians, \"still mathematically alive\", are virtually out of IPL 2024 playoffs race.\n\nCan Mumbai Indians (MI) still qualify for Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024 Playoffs?\n\nMumbai Indians are on the brink of being officially eliminated from IPL 2024 playoffs race. They have three more matches to play in the league stage of IPL 2024. MI, in their upcoming matches, are scheduled to face Sunrisers Hyderabad on May 6, Kolkata Knight Riders on May 11, and Lucknow Super Giants on May 17. Losing even one of these three matches would offically knock MI out of IPL 2024 Playoffs race.\n\nIf Mumbai Indians manage to win all their remaining three matches, they can reach a maximum of 12 points. However, typically for a team to enter top 4, seal a playoff berth, requires at least 16 points.\n\nFor MI to stay alive in IPL 2024 Playoffs race with 12 points, no other team in IPL 2024 standings should surpass the 12-point mark.\n\nCurrently, Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH), Lucknow Super Giants (LSG), and Chennai Super Kings (CSK) have already reached 12 points. Hence, for MI to have a chance, at least two of these franchises would need to lose their remaining matches.\n\nAssuming the above scenarios unfold favorably for MI, the next crucial aspect would be improving their Net Run Rate (NRR).\n\nMI's current NRR stands at a disappointing -0.356, which is very low. The five-time IPL winners won't be able to secure a playoff berth if the NRR of other 12-point teams surpasses MI's.\n\nMI would need to focus not only on winning their remaining three matches but also on improving their NRR significantly to enhance their IPL 2024 playoff chances.", "source": {"uri": "news.abplive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "english"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shivam_sharma@news.abplive.com", "name": "Shivam Sharma", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shreyas_Iyer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shreyas Iyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Trust_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Press Trust of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chennai Super Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_run_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Net run rate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Table_Tennis/Leagues", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Table Tennis/Leagues", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Modified_Pitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Modified Pitch", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2024/05/06/ce14071bd9670eaeb03e7196f9b7ac7d171497855381524_original.jpg?impolicy=abp_cdn&imwidth=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540533", "eventUri": "eng-9540533", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-03", "textStart": 550, "textEnd": 555}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 1555, "textEnd": 1560}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-11", "textStart": 1587, "textEnd": 1593}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-17", "textStart": 1623, "textEnd": 1629}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

They are virtually knocked out of the tournament, and only a miracle can help them qualify for the playoffs.\n\nIn a video shared on his YouTube channel, Chopra chose Rohit as the first Mumbai Indians player in focus in Monday's game.\n\n\"I am first focusing on Rohit Sharma because in the last four games - Rajasthan, Delhi, Lucknow and the last game here vs KKR - I think his highest score is probably 11. This does not go well. He had a good start to the tournament, 300-325 runs were scored, struck a century as well at this ground but after that, he has just fallen off the radar. You don't want that,\" he reasoned (6:50).\n\n\"He has got out many times against left-arm seamers and here also you will get one in T Natarajan and possibly Jaydev Unadkat as well. So I am a little worried from an Indian point of view, not the Mumbai Indians' point of view as much. I want the Indian team's T20 captain to score runs,\" the former India opener added.\n\nRohit has aggregated only 29 runs in his last four innings in IPL 2024.

He keeps pushing himself down the order and that does not go well. I don't like it personally. These battles need to be won from the front. You will have to come to bat slightly up the order and show your batting ability,\" he said (7:40).\n\nThe cricketer-turned-commentator chose Jasprit Bumrah as the crucial bowler for the Mumbai Indians against the SunRisers Hyderabad.\n\n\"I am going with Jasprit Bumrah for a very simple reason. The last time these two teams met, 277 were scored, and he probably gave only 25-30 in his four overs.

Sunrisers Hyderabad's explosive openers Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma got off to a decent start reaching 51/0 in the initial five overs. However, Mumbai's dependable asset Jasprit Bumrah broke through in the sixth over, dismissing Sharma. The pressure continued to mount on the visitors as Mumbai's debutant, Anshul Kamboj scalped the wicket of Mayank Agarwal in the eighth over. Despite this, Head and Nitish Kumar Reddy stabilized Hyderabad's innings taking the score to 88/2 after ten overs. Just as the Australian opener seemed set for another half-century, Mumbai's Piyush Chawla struck in the 11th over, removing Head for a brisk 48 off 30 balls, providing Mumbai with a crucial breakthrough. Unfortunately, setbacks continued for SRH when Reddy departed in the 12th over, followed by Heinrich Klaasen's dismissal in the 13th over, leaving them at 101/5. Thereafter, Marco Jansen and Shahbaz Ahmed took charge of the Hyderabad batting pushing the score to 120/5 by the 15th over. However, Mumbai Indians skipper Hardik Pandya showcased his bowling skills, delivering his best performance of the season (3/31) by removing Shahbaz and Jansen in the crucial 16th over. Despite the setback, Pat Cummins' late onslaught scoring 35 runs off just 17 deliveries bolstered the Sunrisers' total to a respectable 173/8 at the end of their innings.\n\nMumbai Indians were off to a shaky start as opener Ishan Kishan departed scoring just nine runs in the second over. The home team's matter worsened when Rohit Sharma and Naman Dhir departed within the powerplay with the scorecard at 36/3 in five overs. However, Suryakumar Yadav and Tilak Varma steadied the Mumbai batting with a 48-run stand taking the scorecard to 79/3 in eight overs with Surya scoring a brisk 32 off just 15 deliveries. The duo looked splendid with the bat as they slowly paved the way for Mumbai towards a clinical win with the scorecard at 93/3 in 11 overs. Additionally, the Indian batter went on to make a 30-ball fifty with Tilak contributing with a strike rate of 117. Meanwhile, Suryakumar looked great as he quickly scored 81 off 46 with the scorecard at 149/3 in 16 overs. With just 25 runs needed off the last four overs, the game was almost sealed for the home side. Additionally, Suryakumar Yadav made a splendid century off 51 deliveries and ultimately sealed the game for Mumbai Indians as they beat Sunrisers by seven wickets.", "source": {"uri": "sportscafe.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "SportsCafe.in"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayank_Agarwal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayank Agarwal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasprit_Bumrah", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jasprit Bumrah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wankhede_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wankhede Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahbaz_Ahmed_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shahbaz Ahmed (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Jansen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marco Jansen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardik_Pandya", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hardik Pandya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piyush_Chawla", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Piyush Chawla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Klaasen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heinrich Klaasen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilak_Varma", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tilak Varma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suryakumar_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suryakumar Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishan_Kishan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ishan Kishan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://sportscafe.in/img/es3-cfill-w800-h418/articles/cricket-2023/suryaa-1000x1000.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540533", "eventUri": "eng-9540533", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

In their previous face-off, Hyderabad emerged victorious in a thrilling encounter at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium. Hyderabad showcased their batting prowess by posting a massive score of 277 runs, setting a challenging target for Mumbai to chase down. With memories of their last encounter fresh in mind, Mumbai will be eager to turn the tables and secure a win on their home turf.\n\nMumbai, once formidable champions in the IPL, have experienced a noticeable decline in their performance. While they have seen commendable performances from other batters, their key assets, Rohit Sharma and Hardik Pandya, have struggled to make a significant impact with the bat. This dip in form from two of their most prominent players has undoubtedly affected the team's overall performance. On the bowling front, Mumbai heavily relies on the brilliance of Jasprit Bumrah to turn the tide in their favor. Bumrah's exceptional skills and ability to deliver under pressure have often been instrumental in Mumbai's success in the past. However, the over-reliance on Bumrah underscores the team's struggles in finding consistent contributors across all departments\n\nSRH experienced a rollercoaster of performances in the recent matches of the IPL 2024. After securing victories in three consecutive games, the team faced setbacks in their last two encounters against the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) and Chennai Super Kings (CSK). Interestingly, both defeats came in matches where Hyderabad was tasked with chasing a target, highlighting a potential vulnerability in their batting lineup.\n\nNevertheless, in their subsequent match, SRH had the opportunity to play to their strengths by batting first. In a thrilling contest against the Rajasthan Royals (RR), Hyderabad emerged victorious by the narrowest of margins, clinching a nail-biting win by just 1 run\n\nHead brings experience and stability to the batting lineup, while Abhishek adds versatility with both bat and ball. Markram provides solidity at the top of the order, alongside Klaasen, known for his consistent performances. Nitish Kumar and Samad offer firepower in the middle order, capable of accelerating the run rate when needed. Shahbaz adds depth to the batting lineup, contributing with both bat and ball. In the bowling department, Cummins and Bhuvneshwar lead the pace attack with their skill and experience.

MI are scheduled to take on the mighty Sunrisers Hyderabad next, with matches against Kolkata Knight Rider and Lucknow Super Giants to follow.\n\nCondition 2: Hope that no other team crosses the 12-point mark in IPL 2024 standings. At present, SRH, LSG and CSK already have 12 points to their name. Hence, at least two of these franchises would need to lose their remaining matches in the league campaign. With KKR and RR already sitting at the No. 1 and No. 2 spots with 16 points each, it is impossible for Mumbai to topple them. In fact, big wins against other teams for KKR and RR would only benefit MI.\n\nCondition 3: Mumbai Indians have a Net Run Rate of -0.356 at present. Even if MI win all of their remaining matches, they would need to do that by big margins in order to get into a positive NRR. But, that might not be enough if the NRR of other teams at 12 points is better than MI.\n\nThough you never say never in a sport like cricket, it's fair to assert that Mumbai Indians' chances of IPL 2024 playoffs qualification don't instill much hope in the hearts of their fans.", "source": {"uri": "sports.ndtv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NDTVSports.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kolkata"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chennai Super Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_run_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Net run rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor League", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-05/epmo1k58_hardik-pandya-bcci_625x300_06_May_24.jpg?im=FitAndFill,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540533", "eventUri": "eng-9540533", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

While the match served as another spectacle of IPL cricket, it also provided some heartening indicators for the Indian cricket team, especially with the T20 World Cup 2024 looming on the horizon.\n\nMI's revengeful victory over SRH brought about a lot of positive signs for Team India fans. Here are the 3 most promising signs from the MI vs SRH match for Team India.\n\nThe resurgence of Suryakumar Yadav couldn't have been more timely for Team India. After being sidelined due to injuries and subsequent recovery phases, Yadav returned to the pitch for Mumbai Indians. Despite not being at his peak fitness, Yadav showcased his mettle in a sensational manner during this match. Coming in at a precarious 31-3, Yadav steadied the ship and single-handedly carried Mumbai Indians to victory with a scintillating century, culminating it with a six on the last ball.\n\nThis innings was not just about the runs; it was about taking charge when the team needed it the most. For a player often criticised for not performing under pressure, Yadav's innings speaks volumes about his readiness to take on challenges. His performance suggests that he could be a crucial asset for India, especially in tense situations during the T20 World Cup. It has also created a headache regarding his batting position for Team India as he has been impressing at No. 3 for MI, a position that Virat Kohli bats at for the national team.\n\nAlso Check: MI vs SRH Match 55 - Stats Review\n\nHardik Pandya's journey has been fraught with injuries and scrutiny over form. Despite facing criticism and pressure from fans, Pandya has shown remarkable resilience with a smile on his face. As the captain of Mumbai Indians and the vice-captain of Team India, Pandya's return to form and fitness was of utmost importance as Team India launches another expedition to the World Cup come June.\n\nIn the MI vs SRH match, Pandya exhibited signs of his former self, bowling his full quota of overs and scalping three crucial wickets. His all-round performance is a promising sign for India, especially considering his role as a finisher with the bat and a key contributor with the ball. With the T20 World Cup approaching, Pandya's resurgence bodes well for India's chances in the USA and West Indies.\n\nAlso Check: India squad for T20 World Cup 2024 - Complete Player's list\n\nJasprit Bumrah's name is synonymous with excellence in bowling. His precision, line, and length have made him a nightmare for batters across the globe. In the IPL 2024, Bumrah has been at the top of his game, boasting the best economy rate and leading the IPL Purple Cap chart.\n\nAlso Check: IPL 2024 Purple Cap - Most Wickets\n\nIn the match against Sunrisers Hyderabad, he once again showcased his brilliance, maintaining a miserly economy rate of 5.80 while taking a crucial wicket of Abhishek Sharma. His consistency and ability to deliver under pressure are invaluable assets for Team India, especially in the fast-paced T20 format. As the leader of India's bowling attack in the T20 World Cup, Bumrah's stellar form provides a significant boost to India's prospects in the tournament, something that all Team India fans would be happy about.", "source": {"uri": "crictracker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricTracker"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suryakumar_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Suryakumar Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economy rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasprit_Bumrah", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jasprit Bumrah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Indies cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.crictracker.com/media/attachments/1715017933015_mi-mp-2.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540533", "eventUri": "eng-9540533", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

Surya Saves Mumbai Indians From Another Embarrassment; Watch Here", "body": "IPL 2024 MI Vs SRH: It is scary for every team when Surya Kumar Yadav comes into his groove. He plays on an entirely different spectrum as compared to everyone when he is in good touch. Whenever he is in good touch, it looks like he is playing a different match.\n\nHe showed that class once again against Hyderabad on Monday. While everyone was even struggling to score a single, Surya came and scored at a free flow rate to get Mumbai out of another tough situation.\n\nMumbai Indians started on a good note as they scored 26 runs in two overs. But a weird collapse happened and MI was only able to add 4 more runs in the next two overs and lost 3 wickets. That is when Surya Kumar and Tilak Verms started rebuilding the innings in style.\n\nIPL 2024 MI Vs SRH: The SKY Show!\n\nIt was rebuilding time, but Surya made sure to keep the required run rate in mind as well. He scored at a rapid rate and completed his century in just 51 deliveries.

The impending clash offers several intriguing player battles. Here are a few of them.\n\nRohit Sharma and Pat Cummins, the two captains of the 2023 ICC Cricket World Cup finalists, will lock horns in the upcoming clash. The Aussie seamer has dismissed Rohit thrice in T20 cricket, while the latter owns 57 runs off 39 balls in this rivalry. The previous SRH-MI encounter, which recorded over 520 runs, saw Cummins dismiss the former MI skipper.\n\nIn the past, Rohit has been outfoxed by left-arm pacers across formats. Bowlers like Trent Boult and Shaheen Afridi, among others, have troubled him with in-swinging deliveries. Notably, Rohit has fallen to left-arm seamers five times in IPL 2024. The MI batter will face Marco Jansen, T Natarajan, and Jaydev Unadkat in the impending clash.\n\nTime and time again, South African batter Heinrich Klaasen has shown why he is dangerous against spin. He smacked 3 fours and as many sixes for SRH against Rajasthan Royals, going after Yuzvendra Chahal. Klaasen strikes at 159.44 against spinners in T20s, which improves to 188.64 in the IPL.

Suryakumar was limping between the wickets during a sensational knock of 102 not out in 51 balls in MI's 7-wicket hammering of the SunRisers. However, the World No. 1 T20I batter said it was nothing but a bit of fatigue and rust due to the high-octane contests in the ongoing season.\n\nMI vs SRH, IPL 2024 Highlights | Scorecard\n\nSuryakumar Yadav did not let the niggle in the middle hinder his run-scoring form as he hit 6 sixes and 12 boundaries in a knock that left his batting partner 14Tilak Varma and the rest of the world in awe. MI were reeling at 31 for 3 in the powerplay after losing Rohit Sharma and Ishan Kishan for single-digit scores. However, Suryakumar and Tilak fearlessly counterattacked SRH pacers and put the pressure right back on the visiting team.\n\nWhile Suryakumar got his second IPL hundred to equal a Rohit Sharma record, the India star and Tilak Varma stitched 143 runs in just 69 balls -- the highest-ever partnership for MI for the 4th wicket or lower. Suryakumar hit the winning runs in style as he smashed one into the stands, also bringing up his 6th T20 century.\n\n\"I've been doing this after very long time. After 14th December this is the first time I fielded for 20 overs and batted for 18. But I'm alright. Only tiredness,\" Suryakumar Yadav said after winning the Player of the Match award.\n\nSuryakumar had missed the first couple of matches for MI in IPL 2024 as he needed more time to recover from a long injury layoff. Suryakumar underwent sports hernia surgery earlier in the year and missed the home series against Afghanistan. He last played for India in December when leading India in a T20I series in South Africa.\n\nIPL 2024: Points Table\n\nThe World No. 1 T20I batter, who has been picked in India's T20I squad, said the hundred on Monday was an important knock for him in the lead-up to the showpiece event.\n\nSuryakumar has 334 runs in 9 matches with four 50-plus scores, but he had not been able to stitch a string of consistent scores before the first week of May -- 56 against KKR and 102 not out against SRH.\n\n\"I feel it was the need of the hour for me to win. Three wickets were down and I needed to play till the end. Knew that dew was heavy and I had to bat till the seam came off. Traditional shots came from the Mumbai school of arts. I knew what to do when the ball was seaming and then brought out all the shots which I practice. I feel the intent would've been the same,\" Suryakumar said, explaining the method behind the madness.\n\nSuryakumar's wide array of shots was on display as he hit the SunRisers pacers with his unconventional style. His takedown of Marco Jansen in the 7th over changed the momentum in favour of MI on Monday. There was no looking back for Suryakumar and MI from there on as they chased down the target in just 17.2 overs.\n\nMI, who got off the bottom of the table, will next face KKR at Eden Gardens in Kolkata on May 11.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suryakumar_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Suryakumar Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20 International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilak_Varma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tilak Varma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_of_the_match", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Player of the match"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishan_Kishan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ishan Kishan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerplay_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Powerplay (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_cricket_team_against_Afghanistan_in_India_in_2018\u201319", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Irish cricket team against Afghanistan in India in 2018\u201319"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Jansen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marco Jansen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eden_Gardens", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eden Gardens"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seam_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seam bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kolkata"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202405/suryakumar-yadav-063702819-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=IjFKrRoxTAGvPR2B5fKYYUHKqSBQS_8e", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540533", "eventUri": "eng-9540533", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-12-14", "textStart": 1449, "textEnd": 1462}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-11", "textStart": 3198, "textEnd": 3204}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

However, despite Head's valiant efforts, SRH struggled to build a substantial total, managing to reach only 173/8 in their allotted 20 overs.\n\nThe inability to capitalise on Head's contribution was attributed to the relentless pressure exerted by Mumbai Indians' fielding unit. Mumbai's fielders executed their plans meticulously, thwarting SRH's attempts to accelerate the scoring rate.\n\nThe innings began with SRH openers, Abhishek Sharma and Head, displaying a strong intent to lay a solid foundation. While Sharma provided stability in the early overs, Head impressed with a brisk 48 off just 30 balls, including a flurry of boundaries.\n\nHowever, Mumbai Indians' bowlers quickly turned the tide in their favor, led by the experienced wrist-spinner Piyush Chawla who picked up three wickets. The wickets fell at regular intervals, and SRH found themselves struggling at 96/5 by the 12th over, courtesy of Mumbai's disciplined bowling performance.\n\nIn a pivotal moment, Mumbai Indians' skipper, Hardik Pandya, showcased his bowling prowess, claiming three crucial wickets for a mere 31 runs in his four-over spell. Pandya's exceptional display further bolstered Mumbai's dominance on the field, silencing any doubts surrounding his abilities.\n\nDespite their best efforts, SunRisers Hyderabad fell short in posting a competitive total against Mumbai Indians, highlighting the latter's formidable bowling attack and fielding prowess.\n\nAs the IPL 2024 season progresses, both teams will aim to build on their performances, with Mumbai Indians looking to maintain their winning momentum and SRH striving for a comeback in the tournament.

Hyderabad have been a dominant side in the first half of the season.\n\nBack-to-back losses to CSK and RCB took some sting out of the side but a close win against RR have brought back the side as a whole. The last win will give them huge confidence heading into this game.\n\nPat Cummins as the SRH skipper has made some bold moves throughout the season and some of them paid off. While they have been very dominant batting first, chasing has been their Achilles Heel this season. They lost their last two games chasing.\n\nAlso Read: PBKS vs CSK: Shikhar Dhawan ruled out of IPL 2024? Sunil Joshi provides a colossal update\n\nHowever, they scored 277 against MI, the last time they played the opposition. That huge win against MI will give them huge confidence as well. Speaking about the playing XI, it will be interesting to see if they can fit Glenn Phillips into the XI. Also, the lack of quality spinners has been a concern.\n\nHead will open the batting for SRH. He scored 58 off 44 balls against RR which was an unusual innings for him. It was his innings that helped SRH beach 200 in the end. He has scored 396 runs this season so far.\n\nThe southpaw will open the batting with Head. He has complemented the Australian opener very well this season. He has scored 315 runs this season so far.\n\nThe move to include Anmolpreet Singh has not paid off in the last two games for SRH. They can include either Sundar or Tripathi in the XI. The inclusion of Sundar gives them a quality spin option.\n\nKlaasesn should bat at four. So far, he has scored 337 runs this season in 10 games at a strike rate of 189.33. He scored 40 off 19 balls against RR.\n\nReddy should bat at five. He scored an unbeaten 76 off 42 balls and played his part in taking SRH to 201. He has scored 219 runs in just six innings at a strike rate of over 150.\n\nPhillips can replace Aiden Markram in the XI. SRH can think about giving him a few games and using him as a finisher in the lineup. He is also a brilliant fielder to boost. Phillips also gives them a spin option.\n\nSamad can slot in at seven. He has got his opportunities with the bat few and far between. However, he has been given a longer run by his franchise. So far, he has scored 148 runs this season at a strike rate of 187.34.\n\nSkipper Pat Cummins might bat at eight. He too has not got too many chances with the bat but has picked up 12 wickets this season so far and went past 50 IPL wickets this season.\n\nThe veteran Indian pacer can slot in at nine. He defended 13 off the final over to take SRh to victory. He has taken 8 wickets from seven games so far.\n\nNatarajan will slot in at 10. He is the second-highest wicket-taker this season so far with 15 wickets in 8 matches. The left-arm pacer took two for 35 in the last game.\n\nMarkande concludes the likely SRH XI for their match against MI. He is the specialist leg spinner in the side and did not play the last game. The leggie has picked up 8 wickets from seven games.\n\nUnadkat is expected to be the Impact sub for SRH. He was used in the same role in the last match as well where he bowled two overs for 23 runs. The Bengal all-rounder Shahbaz Ahmed can be looked at as the other option.", "source": {"uri": "cricketaddictor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketAddictor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chennai Super Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunil_Joshi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunil Joshi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikhar_Dhawan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shikhar Dhawan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting order (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anmolpreet_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anmolpreet Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Not out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Phillips_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glenn Phillips (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahbaz_Ahmed_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shahbaz Ahmed (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal_cricket_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bengal cricket team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aiden_Markram", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aiden Markram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowled", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowled"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg_spin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leg spin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-rounder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-rounder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static.cricketaddictor.com/images/2024/SunrisersHyderabad.webp?q=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540533", "eventUri": "eng-9540533", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

Mumbai Indians lost the previous game to Sunrisers Hyderabad in Hyderabad. This is the penultimate game in Mumbai this season.\n\nMI are heading into this game after losing their previous match to KKR. They were bowled out for 145 chasing 170 for victory. Mitchell Starc led KKR's revival with a four-wicket spell. However, the MI batters had to bear the criticism of their poor batting performance chasing this manageable total.\n\nMI are now almost out of the playoffs race with just three wins from 11 matches. Even if they win they win the next three games they will finish with 12 points which will not be enough to see them to the playoffs.\n\nSRH won a thriller against RR by just one run against Rajasthan Royals in Hyderabad in the last match. It was Bhuvneshwar Kumar who defended 13 off the final over to win the match. That win has brought back SRh into the reckoning. They won the match after two back-to-back losses. They will fancy their chances against MI who have really struggled this season.\n\nAlso Read: LSG vs KKR: Not Gautam Gambhir!! Venkatesh Iyer thanks this man for his career revival\n\nTeams below the top four have a lot to do from hereon to make the playoffs. The top four teams have maintained some distance from the bottom six throughout the tournament so far.\n\nThe temperatures in the daytime will be around 35 degrees on Monday. It will remain stable throughout the afternoon with hazy sunshine and hot and humid conditions. The temperature in the evening will be around 30 degrees with \"Clear to partly cloudy skies\" as per Accuweather. There is no chance of rain though.\n\nThe Wankheder pitch is normally a very good batting wicket. However, in the last match against KKR, the pitch was slow and the ball was gripping on the wicket. The slower deliveries by the seamers worked wonders for them. The wicket was slow and did not have the pace and bounce it normally has. It will be interesting to see what kind of wicket will be prepared for the MI vs SRH game.\n\nThe temperatures will be around 30 degrees in the evening with clear to partly cloudy skies. There is no chance of rain, however, the humidity levels will be high around 74 percent. Dew will play a major role as expected. However, no threat of rain means we can have a full game. How the match pans out will be down to the wicket that is prepared.\n\nMumbai Indians did not manage to chase down a manageable total in the end against KKR.

Even at 36, the West Indies legend continues to surprise fans with his fitness. During a recent training session of the MI ahead of the game against SRH, Pollard was spotted doing some catching. Pollard, during the session, took an incredible catch near the boundary. He first stretches his arms to catch the ball, then he realises he is going to overstep the ropes and hence he flicks the ball in the air - adjusts and then completes the catch.\n\nMeanwhile, plumbing the depths of the points table in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024, the only direction Mumbai Indians can now go is climb up the standings when they take on Sunrisers Hyderabad.\n\nConsidering the way their campaign has unfolded so far, getting things their way seems as good as impossible for Hardik Pandya's side as they have suffered defeats in eight of the 11 matches they have played so far this season. They have failed to stitch together a complete performance in most of their matches, losing games after excelling in one department of the match.\n\nLike in their clash with Kolkata Knight Riders at the Wankhede Stadium on Friday (May 3) when they bundled out the visitors for 169 as their bowlers used the double-paced wicket to their advantage to restrict them.

Meanwhile, Travis Head has jumped to fourth on the orange cap charts.\n\nThe Mumbai Indians managed to return to winning ways thanks to a scintillating century knock by Suryakumar Yadav to help beat the Sunrisers Hyderabad by seven wickets and 16 balls to spare at the Wankhede Stadium.\n\nMI were able to put up a fine performance with the ball to start things off with the skipper Hardik Pandya along with the veteran Piyush Chawla picking up three wickets each to restrict SRH to just 174.\n\nDespite the top-order collapse in the powerplay, Suryakumar Yadav steadied the ship along with Tilak Varma to steer the chase home in favour of the Mumbai-based franchise.\n\nVirat Kohli: The RCB icon continues to shine consistently. With the side now hitting their strides and hoping to secure a spot in the playoffs following a disastrous start to the IPL, the Bengaluru-based franchise will hope that Kohli can continue scoring the big runs for them in a bid for a spot in the playoffs.\n\nRuturaj Gaikwad: The burden of the captaincy has not weighed down the opening batter for the five-time champions CSK. Gaikwad seems to have hit his stride with the bat along with the responsibility of leading the side. Despite injuries hampering the bowling attack, the skipper continues to score runs consistently and will hope to do so to clinch a spot in the top-4.\n\nSunil Narine: Having found his form with the bat, he has been in immense form for the Kolkata Knight Riders and his batting contributions have served the side in good stead who are fighting for a spot at the top of the points table.\n\nTravis Head: The explosive batter might not have lit up the Wankhede like he would have wanted to but he scored a crucial 48 runs for the Sunrisers and helped them put up a par score. His contributions at the top are one of the primary reasons why the Hyderabad-based unit is still in contention for a spot in the playoffs.\n\nKL Rahul: The LSG skipper has been the shining light for the struggling LSG franchise. Despite being in contention for a spot in the top-four the lack of support with the batting unit has hampered KL's ability to score runs consistently. LSG hopes to see the skipper continue scoring runs and take them to their third consecutive playoff.\n\nJasprit Bumrah: The MI ace continues to impress with the ball. Against SRH he picked up a crucial wicket in the powerplay to get the ball rolling. The minimal runs conceded off his bowling were also able to build some pressure onto the opposition batters as well. Both MI and Indian cricket fans will hope to see him continue firing on all cylinders in the prelude to the T20 World Cup.\n\nHarshal Patel: The leading wicket-taker for the Punjab Kings has been crucial in their rise to form. In the most recent fixture against CSK, he was able to get the big wicket of MS Dhoni for a first-ball duck which shocked many. His ability with the slower deliveries makes him a crucial part of PBKS' death-bowling unit.\n\nVarun Chakravarthy: The return to form for the mystery spinner has propelled the KKR side to contention for a spot at the top of the table. With him firing, he allows the bowling unit to be arguably amongst the best in the league this season.\n\nT Natarajan: The left-arm pacer might not have had an ideal outing against MI but has had a fine season's performance so far. With SRH fighting for a spot in the top 4, they will hope that Natarjan can get back to taking wickets regularly in the upcoming games.\n\nArshdeep Singh: The left-arm pacer for PBKS, has been fairly decent for the side which has gotten them to turn the tides to their season after a fairly poor start. His return to form will be crucial ahead of the T20 World Cup along with the side still in contention for a spot in the playoffs.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suryakumar_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Suryakumar Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasprit_Bumrah", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jasprit Bumrah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilak_Varma", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tilak Varma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardik_Pandya", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hardik Pandya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piyush_Chawla", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Piyush Chawla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wankhede_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wankhede Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "K.

He is a very good guy,'' Dhir added.\n\nWith the Playoffs out of their reach now, the Mumbai Indians might rest a few key players and test their bench strength. However, Dhir is not very sure about that happening.\n\n\"Right now there is no such plan. It is upto the management what decision they take with regard to the playing XI. Even me playing tomorrow (Monday) remains to be seen, it will get confirmed tomorrow (Monday) only,'' he added.\n\nLooking back at their defeat against Kolkata Knight Riders, Dhir felt it was a match that they should have won and there were no demons in the pitch as such.\n\n\" It wasn't a surprise as such. The wicket was a bit damp when we were batting but overall it was a good batting wicket. I think we did not bat as well as we should have and we should have chased down the target. Wankhede everyone expects a good batting track.\n\nThe Sunrisers, who are currently fourth on the table, would be looking to put it across MI and strengthen their chances of reaching the Playoffs with four matches to go.\n\nAfter their thrilling one-run victory against Lucknow Super Giants, SRH would be in a great mindset to go out and execute their plans.\n\n\"It has surely given us a psychological boost. When the game went to the last couple of overs and to get over the line. For us, we were lucky that we were on the right side of it. It gives us a positive boost.

It came at the Wankhede Stadium on Monday, May 6.\n\nSuryakumar Yadav rescued MI from 31-3, with Tilak Varma playing the perfect second fiddle. The right-handed batter had to be patient initially as Pat Cummins and Bhuvneshwar Kumar were bowling a potent spell. However, in typical fashion, it didn't take too long for him to break the shackles and bat in his usual tempo.\n\nAfter five consecutive dot balls to open the innings, the No.1 T20 batter proceeded to hit six boundaries off his next nine deliveries to shift the momentum completely. As the partnership between Suryakumar Yadav and Tilak Varma blossomed, it became certain that MI would claim the win.\n\nAt one point, however, it seemed like the right-handed batter might just miss out on the ton. He made a final push with three consecutive boundaries off Cummins in the 17th over. He then hit a six against T Natarajan to reach the landmark three-figure and seal the points win.\n\nSuryakumar Yadav spoke about the importance of the knock after coming from a significant injury layoff after being adjudged as Player of the Match for his exploits.\n\nHe said:\n\n\"I've been doing this after a very long time. I think after 14th December, today is the day where I fielded for 20 overs and batted for almost 18 overs. So, it is a little bit tired, but hopefully tomorrow it will be better. I feel that it was the need of the hour today, three wickets down when I came in and someone had to be there till the end, and that is what I did.\"\n\nDecember 14 marked the date for the third T20I between India and South Africa, the contest where Suryakumar Yadav had suffered the fateful injury. Leading the side, he had scored his fourth T20I hundred, guiding India to 201-7. But he twisted his ankle while fielding as India skittled out the hosts for just 95 runs.\n\nThe ace batter largely played as an impact sub for the majority of the tournament after missing the first few matches for MI at the start. He hadn't received clearance from the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru following his recovery from an ankle injury and a hernia operation.\n\n\"I knew that the dew was heavy, and once the seam goes off, it will be easy for a batter to play\" - Suryakumar Yadav\n\nSuryakumar Yadav had an inconsistent 2024 campaign up until this point, which began with a duck against the Delhi Capitals (DC). He scored fifties against the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) and the Punjab Kings (PBKS) in winning causes. But there wasn't much noteworthy across the rest of his campaign.\n\n\"I knew that the dew was heavy, and once the seam goes off, it will be easy for a batter to play, so I just enjoyed my time.

The MI batter struggled to run between the wickets in the game against SRH at the Wankhede stadium in Mumbai. SKY made his return in IPL 2024 after being on the sidelines for a long time owing to an injury.\n\nSKY looked in solid form as he took it upon himself to guide MI to a successful run-chase. However, in the 11th and 12th over, SKY was seen feeling his groin area as he experienced discomfort while running in between the wickets. He was repeatedly seen going down on one knee when he reached the non-strikers end, looking in discomfort.\n\nSuryakumar Yadav missed the initial matches for Mumbai Indians (MI) in Indian Premier League (IPL 2024) due to injury.

Surya will be pivotal for India's chances at the 2024 T20 World Cup as they look to break an 11-year ICC title drought.\n\nThe versatile batter was also part of India's 2021 T20 World Cup and 2023 ODI World Cup campaigns.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "venkatesh_ravichandran@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Venkatesh Ravichandran", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewald_Brevis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dewald Brevis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suryakumar_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Suryakumar Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supla", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wankhede_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wankhede Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20 International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Cricket Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Indies"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/92e4c-17147281671959-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540533", "eventUri": "eng-9540533", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-03", "textStart": 263, "textEnd": 268}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 1592, "textEnd": 1598}], "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 65, "relevance": 1}

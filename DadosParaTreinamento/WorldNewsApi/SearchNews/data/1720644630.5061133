Both Ivanka, the 42-year-old daughter of former President Donald Trump, and Lauren, the 54-year-old fianc\u00e9e of billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, were among the first celebs seen arriving at the party thrown for Kim by her sister Khloe Kardashian at Funke in Beverly Hills. The beauties proved to be at the top of the TV star's inner circle during the soiree, as Ivanka sat on Kim's right while Lauren was two seats down. In addition, during a heartfelt speech to her pals, the SKIMS founder described everyone in attendance as her 'ride-or-dies', adding, 'I trust all of you.' Given their VIP placement on the seating chart and Kim's gushing description, it's clear that Ivanka and Lauren have quickly made their way to the top of her friendship group. This week's latest episode of the reality show The Kardashians contained footage of Kim's star-studded birthday party, which took place in October 2023. Both Ivanka and Lauren dressed to impress at the bash, with the 42-year-old ex-White House advisor donning a two-piece sequined set with a high slit, which put her toned and bronzed legs on full display. Meanwhile, the former journalist showed off her toned physique in a skin-tight black gown, which perfectly complimented her tresses. The birthday girl was certainly the center of attention during her celebration, as she sported a racy red dress that accentuated her ample assets. Kim posed up a storm alongside her close friends, which she praised for sticking with her through every step of her life. The other women in the reality icon's posse include Allison Statter and Zoe Winkler (daughter of Henry Winkler), plus Simone Harouche, Lindsay May, Sarah Meyer Michaelson and Ashley Kraines. As Ivanka and Lauren showcase their strong bond with Kim in her reality show, FEMAIL has broken down everything there is to know about the glamorous trio - from how their friendship formed to what they like to do together. Presidential pals! Kim and Ivanka's friendship began a decade ago, and strengthened after they began working on prison reforms together at the White House Kim and Ivanka's friendship traces back several years, and it only strengthened after the pair began working on prison reforms together. The duo first crossed paths in 2014 at the Meta Gala, where it was said that they bonded over motherhood. A source told Us Weekly in 2023, 'Kim and Ivanka have been friends for years and have hung out on a number of occasions. 'They initially bonded nearly a decade ago at the Met Gala over motherhood and being new moms. But they continued to connect numerous times over the years.' Since their initial meeting a decade ago, the women have been spotted together on numerous occasions. In 2018, the pair was seen posing side by side at the White House, where Kim was petitioning Ivanka's father, then-President Trump, to commute the life sentence of drug offender Alice Marie Johnson. The duo worked closely together to reduce and clear prison sentences - with Kim often confiding in Ivanka while attending dinner parties at her house. And by 2020, the reality star was gushing about Ivanka's dad online. 'President Trump commuted the sentences of three really deserving women. I didn't hear much about it in the news, so I wanted to share with you their stories. 'I have the pleasure of spending the day with these women today along with Alice Marie Johnson, who helped to pick these women,' she wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, at the time. In 2022, the women seemed to be closer than ever before as Ivanka enjoyed a three-hour dinner with the SKIMS founder at an upscale eatery. The meetup came two weeks after Kim's ex Kanye West, 46, came under fire for stating that he was going to go 'death con three on Jewish people,' seemingly referring to the US military's defense system known as DEFCON. Then, in October 2023, Ivanka - who converted to converted to Orthodox Judaism in 2009 before marrying Jared Kushner - joined Kim to celebrate her birthday party, which was aired on The Kardashians this week. Afterwards, Kim revealed that she had hit the 'jackpot' when it came to her friends, as she shared snaps from the star-studded birthday bash on Instagram. The two stars also attended the opening of Fontainebleau in Las Vegas together in December 2023. Fashion friends: Kim and Lauren grew close after they both bid on the same Balenciaga gown and the ladies often hype up each other's looks It's no surprise that two dark-haired beauties Kim and Lauren became best friends - as they both often boast stunning looks and seem to share the same love of chic clothing. Their friendship formed in a rather unconventional way, after they had a bidding war over a Balenciaga gown. Years ago, during New York Fashion Week, the two stunners realized they were both bidding on the same clothing article at the Kering Foundation's Caring for Women dinner. However, instead of continuing to desperately try to outbid each other, the pals decided they would share the gown. 'We'll share it!' Kim called out, according to Vogue. Luckily, however, the two didn't have to swap the dress back and forth as they were both offered a dress in the end. The duo jumped on the opportunity and forked over $200,000 each and then jetted off to France together to get fitted. It was there that their bond really kicked off. At the time, Kim gushed about the fianc\u00e9e of Amazon mogul Jeff - who she branded a 'girl's girl' while speaking to Vogue. She told the outlet: 'Lauren and I are always sending DMs building each other up. Every time there's a look that we like, she'll say, \"WOW,\" or, \"OMG you look amazing.\"' The next few months saw the duo forming an even stronger bond - with Lauren even becoming close pals with Kim's mom, Kris Jenner. Kim and Lauren let their hair down while at Beyonc\u00e9's Renaissance show in September. Kris also joined the duo as they partied the night away, and afterwards, the Kardashian momager gushed about Lauren and her soon-to-be spouse Jeff while speaking to Vogue. She told the outlet: 'We know they will be in our lives forever.' The pair have also stepped out multiple times to enjoy dinner together. And when Lauren rang in her birthday in December 2022, Kim was right there to celebrate. The former news anchor celebrated her 53 birthday at a Malibu beach house and Kim was sure to not miss it. The two posed for a selfie together as they showed off their stunning looks. And when it came time for Lauren's lover to celebrate his special day in January 2024, Kim once again showed her love and support. And it wasn't just Kim who showed her support, as Ivanka also celebrated the Amazon CEO by attending the bash. Ivanka and Lauren seem to have connected through Kim, who clearly keeps her friends close and loves to mix and mingle with various parties. After Kim's birthday party in October 2023, Lauren branded the event as 'an absolute blast' and raved about Kim. She wrote: 'Your kind heart shines equally as bright as your beauty, and it's a constant reminder of the incredible person you are, both inside and out. Wishing you endless happiness in the year ahead!

On the low-lying island of Bhashan Char, home to 36,000 Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, 57 cyclone centres were opened, deputy refugee commissioner Mohammad Rafiqul Haque told AFP. The country's three seaports and the airport in the second-largest city Chittagong were closed, officials said. India's Kolkata airport closed Sunday, while the Indian navy readied two ships with aid and medical supplies for \"immediate deployment\". While scientists say climate change is fuelling more storms, better forecasting and more effective evacuation planning have dramatically reduced the death toll. In the Great Bhola Cyclone in November 1970, an estimated half a million people died - mostly drowned by the storm surge. In May last year, Cyclone Mocha became the most powerful storm to hit Bangladesh since Cyclone Sidr in November 2007. Sidr killed more than 3,000 people and caused billions of dollars in damage. Last October, at least two people were killed and nearly 300,000 fled their homes for storm shelters when Cyclone Hamoon hit the country's southeastern coast.", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/cyclone-hits-bangladesh-nearly-million-flee-inland-shelter-4364576", "image": "https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--7hZ6IeIT--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2023-11:afp_watermark_14112023,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/v1/one-cms/core/2173613e3945963491ac71760b640b3fb5b22add.jpg?itok=", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 16:52:00", "author": "Cna", "authors": ["Cna"], "language": "en", "source_country": "sg", "sentiment": 0.145}

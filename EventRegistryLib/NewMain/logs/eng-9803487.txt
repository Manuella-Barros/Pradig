When he was carried on his fellow players' shoulders like a victorious warrior, the campaign attained its climax.\n\n\"One piece of advice that I got is from one of my coaches. He said, 'Sree, when you retire, people should not say, 'Why not?' They should ask you 'Why.' And I think I made some mistakes with that. Everyone is asking me, 'Why not?' And I think this is the right time to take that call,\" said Sreejesh.\n\nCaptain Harmanpreet Singh found it difficult to say goodbye to the legend. \"I would like to say a big thank you to him because he gave everything for the team. We love him so much. Lots of respect for him. He's staying with us only. Here (showing his heart) only.\"\n\nHailing from a non-hockey state Kerala, Sreejesh became a superstar because of his dedication to the sport. He has seen the lowest phase of Indian hockey, when the country could not qualify for the Olympics in 2008 for the only time, and has been witness to its gradual rise, from losing all its matches in 2012 to reaching the quarterfinals in 2016 and then to medalling in the 2020 Games.\n\nFrom being a youngster to being the senior most in the side, Sreejesh fondly remembered how he mellowed down over the years. \"I used to be an aggressive goalkeeper. I used a lot of abuse to activate my players. When I became a real super senior, the coaches said, 'Maybe the youngsters will listen to you, but when you say this, it can demoralize them.'\n\n\"Then I started talking to my goalposts. All of those abuses went to the goalposts. Before this, goalposts used to be my good friend, my emotional partner. I used to talk to my goalposts like, 'Buddy, what have you done?'\"\n\nBefore his last outing, Sreejesh was emotional while walking up to his post. \"It was my home for the last 24 years. I never lived life outside that ground. So, I didn't know what was going to happen to me next. I just wanted to recall all the memories. I just was revising myself. And it's a fun thing that Harman said to me, the dialogue from the movie, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag. 'If anybody asks, is it your last match? And I will say that I will play like that.' Then the team did it. And I had my time,\" signed off Sreejesh.\n\nLatest on SportstarParis Olympics: India 'Wins it for Sreejesh' as custodian par excellence bids emotional goodbye after 24 years Y.

The goalkeeper, however, was simple with his celebration. There were no fist bumps or shouts of joy. It was just a simple moment for the 36-year-old, who bowed down before the goalpost like it was a shrine where his god was living.\n\nThere was a sense of fulfilment for a man who got his first kit after his father decided to sell their cow. It felt like life had come full circle for a star, who had seen the highs and lows of Indian hockey, coming from Kerala, where the sport has never had a rich history. From the absolute rock-bottom the team hit in the 2012 London Olympics, Sreejesh remained a constant to see the revival of Indian hockey as it won 2 back-to-back Olympic medals for the first time since 1972.\n\nParis Olympics 2024: India Schedule | Full Coverage | Medal Tally\n\nHowever, as fans, you feel like Sreejesh was nowhere close to retirement. It seemed like the Indian star hadn't aged at all, especially during the Paris Olympics 2024 campaign. Nimble on his feet, with reactions showing no sign of any tardiness, Sreejesh lived up to his name of being the wall of Indian hockey. This was perfectly shown in the game against Australia, India's biggest bogey team.\n\nSreejesh was ever present to thwart any attack that was inside the Indian D. The last save he pulled off with just 7 seconds on the clock and close to 7 Australian players in the D, makes you just say he is Indian hockey's 'Thala for a reason.' And just when you thought, he couldn't top things off, in came the Great Britain quarterfinal.\n\nIn hockey, when you have a red card shown, it's almost like that team is bound to lose. No one is expected to hold on and not see the opponents score. When Amit Rohidas was given his marching orders, everyone felt India were going out of the competition. But the team scored and eventually the game was 1-1, when Sreejesh decided that it was time for him to be that extra defender for his side. A barrage of close to 11 penalty corners were stopped by Sreejesh and Co as he never stopped being telling his players what to do. He didn't have the captain's armband at that moment, but he was certainly 'Sreejesh bhai' for the entire team.\n\nThen came the penalty shootout, where there's almost a sense that when Sreejesh is on the line, the attacker is under pressure. And it was certainly there for everyone to see. Great Britain crumbled under pressure, as they missed two shots and India won 4-2.\n\nAnd in the bronze medal match, the pressure remained on India in the final quarter. Spain had 15 shots and 9 PCs but Sreejesh was up to the task, when it was needed. So then, Sreejesh why retire now?\n\n\"To retire at the top of the game, that's always been my aim.\"\n\nThese were the words of the legendary Joe Calzaghe as he decided to end his boxing career 46-0. While Sreejesh did have his fair share of losses and disappointments in hockey, he ended it at the top of his game.\n\nAnd Sreejesh wanted the same. In the run-up to the event, Sreejesh made it clear why he felt the Olympics was the best place to call it a day. He felt that everyone would remember him for his bold call.\n\n\"But this time I thought, gearing up for my fourth Olympics, I think this is the best platform for me to say goodbye because I believe that this is the best, the top place where you can say, 'ok, I'm done with this,'\" said Sreejesh.\n\nAnd that's what he ended up doing. Despite Hockey India president Dilip Tirkey admitting they wanted him to continue and fans asking him to go on, Sreejesh admitted that no U-turns will be happening this time around.\n\nHis reasoning was perfect as well, as he didn't want people to say yeah, this is the time to retire.\n\n\"I know that after today's match or after today's victory, nobody wanted me to retire. But as I mentioned earlier, my coach said, Sree, it's a question like when you retire, when you take that call, people should not ask. Why not? They should ask why. And I think this is the perfect way. But, I think my team gave the best send-off to me,\" said Sreejesh.\n\nWell, definitely not. By his own admission, the 36-year-old wants to be a coach and contribute back to the sport. So don't be surprised to see the man back in the technical area in the near future being vocal and cheering the team on and telling them what to do as a coach.\n\nTo end this ode, we bring another Sreejesh quote, which perfectly sums up what hockey means to him.\n\n\"My life is because of hockey, and my family is eating their bread and butter because of hockey.

Sreejesh perched himself on top of the goalpost after India broke a 41-year-old medal drought by securing a bronze. In Paris, he prostrated in front of the post, which he protected and abused with equal passion, before recreating the Tokyo moment after India won the bronze again to bring the curtain down on his unparalleled two-decade-old international career.\n\nOn Thursday (August 8, 2024), as the 36-year-old Sreejesh -- a veteran of 330 international caps -- paid obeisance to the sport he so dearly loves, it brought back memories of Sachin Tendulkar bowing to the pitch at the Wankhede Stadium 11 years ago.\n\n| Video Credit: Ritu Raj Konwar\n\nThe Indian team was successful in its 'win it for Sreejesh' campaign to make the stalwart's last dance a memorable one before carrying him on their shoulders like a victorious warrior.\n\n\"One piece of advice that I got is from one of my coaches. He said, 'Sree, when you retire, people should not say, 'Why not?' They should ask you 'Why.' And I think I made some mistakes with that. Everyone is asking me, 'Why not?' And I think this is the right time to take that call,\" said Sreejesh.\n\nCaptain Harmanpreet found it difficult to say goodbye to the legend. \"I would like to say a big thank you to him because he gave everything for the team. We love him so much. Lots of respect for him. He's staying with us only. Here (showing his heart) only.\"\n\nHailing from a non-hockey state Kerala, Sreejesh became a superstar because of his dedication to the sport. He has seen it all. From the lowest phase, when India failed to qualify for the Olympics in 2008 for the only time, to its gradual rise from losing all its matches in 2012 to reaching the quarterfinals in 2016 and then to medalling in 2020.\n\nFrom a youngster to being the senior most in the side, Sreejesh fondly remembered how he mellowed down over the years. \"I used to be an aggressive goalkeeper. I used a lot of abuse to activate my players. When I became a real super senior, the coaches said, 'Maybe the youngsters will listen to you, but when you say this, it can demoralise them.\n\n\"Then I started talking to my goalposts. All of those abuses went to the goalposts. Before this, goalposts used to be my good friend, my emotional partner. I used to talk to my goalposts like, 'Buddy, what have you done?\"\n\nBefore his last outing, Sreejesh was emotional while walking up to his post. \"It was my home for the last 24 years. I never lived life outside that ground. I just wanted to recall all the memories.\"\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goal (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wankhede_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wankhede Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sachin Tendulkar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmanpreet_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harmanpreet Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(armed_forces)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (armed forces)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kerala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kerala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://th-i.thgim.com/public/sport/olympics/54dxn6/article68502817.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/PTI08_08_2024_000477A.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803487", "eventUri": "eng-9803487", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

This achievement marks India's second consecutive bronze medal in the World Games, following a hard-fought battle that saw them oust Germany in the semifinals.\n\nThe match against Spain was particularly poignant as it marked the swan song of celebrated goalkeeper PR Sreejesh. Having announced his retirement prior to the Olympics, Sreejesh ended his illustrious 18-year career on a high note. His teammates honored him with a heartwarming farewell, giving him a standing ovation before hoisting him onto their shoulders and placing him against the goal post, with joyous celebrations echoing around them.\n\nSreejesh played a crucial role in India's journey, particularly in the quarterfinals against Great Britain, where he delivered a standout performance, denying the opposition any opportunity to score. Throughout his career, which began at the South Asian Games in 2006, Sreejesh has been instrumental in leading India to numerous victories, including two Asian Games gold medals, two Asia Cup titles, and four Asian Champions Trophy titles. He also captained the Indian team during the Rio Olympics and was a key player in India's bronze medal win at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.\n\nReflecting on his decision to retire, Sreejesh stated, \"There's no better time to end my game. We are going back with a medal. Some fans want me to continue, but my decision has not changed. Some decisions are tough and are best taken at the right time. All our team members played very well.\"\n\nAs the Indian hockey team celebrated their latest achievement in Paris, PR Sreejesh leaves behind a legacy of dedication, sportsmanship, and excellence that will inspire future generations of athletes.", "source": {"uri": "thehansindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hans India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pavan_bandari@thehansindia.com", "name": "Pavan Bandari", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_men's_national_field_hockey_team", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India men's national field hockey team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Asian_Champions_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's Asian Champions Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Hockey_Asia_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's Hockey Asia Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asian_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Asian Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asian Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2024/08/09/1469588-hockey.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803487", "eventUri": "eng-9803487", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5372549019607844, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Veteran goalkeeper PR Sreejesh added an emotional touch to the team's victory.\n\nThe Indian men's hockey team has achieved a significant milestone by winning the bronze medal at the Paris 2024 Olympics. Their 2-1 victory over Spain not only secured a podium finish but also marked the first time in over five decades that India has achieved back-to-back Olympic medals in hockey. This historic feat echoes the successes of the 1968 and 1972 Games, where India similarly won consecutive bronze medals.\n\nIndia's journey to the podium has been a long and challenging one. After winning gold in 1980, it took the team 41 years to return to medal contention. Their thrilling comeback in Tokyo 2021, where they overturned a 1-3 deficit to win 5-4 against Germany and claim bronze, was a turning point.\n\nNow, by replicating their success in Paris, India has solidified its place among the top hockey nations, achieving consecutive Olympic medals for the first time since 1972. While gold remains elusive, the bronze medal in Paris carries a deep sense of accomplishment and pride for the team and the nation.\n\nVeteran goalkeeper PR Sreejesh, a key figure in India's hockey resurgence, added an emotional touch to the team's victory. Having announced that the Paris Olympics would be his final international appearance, Sreejesh's farewell was marked by a heartfelt gesture.\n\nAs the final whistle blew, Sreejesh removed his gear and bowed deeply to his hockey equipment, a symbolic tribute to the sport that has defined his life and career.\n\nAfter Sreejesh's heartfelt gesture, his Indian teammates followed suit by bowing towards the legendary goalkeeper, paying their own tributes. Sreejesh took in the moment, deeply moved by the show of respect.\n\nIn a heartfelt interview with SheThePeople, PR Sreejesh spoke candidly about his wife, Dr. Aneeshya, an Ayurveda practitioner. He expressed gratitude for her unwavering support throughout his career, acknowledging the vital role she played in his journey. Sreejesh also expressed his desire for his wife to continue pursuing her career as an Ayurveda practitioner rather than staying at home. \"I want her to go out and work.

The IOA, alongside Chef-de-Mission Gagan Narang, echoed this sentiment, announcing Sreejesh's role as joint flag-bearer in recognition of his admirable service to Indian hockey and sport in general.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manu_Bhaker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manu Bhaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Olympic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian Olympic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard-bearer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Standard-bearer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neeraj_Chopra", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neeraj Chopra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._T._Usha", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "P.

Sreejesh is taking off his Indian jersey with the proud achievement of being the only Malayali to have won a medal in two Olympics. Sreejesh announced his retirement on social media soon after he arrived in Paris for the Olympics.\n\nSreejesh, who was selected for the Indian junior team in 2004, reached the senior team in 2006. He was named the best goalkeeper in the 2008 Junior Asia Cup. Sreejesh became the talk of the Indian hockey world with his unforgettable performance against Pakistan in that tournament. He then remained a steady wall in front of the Indian goal net for several years. Sreejesh has won several national and international best goalkeeper awards. He won gold in two Asian Games and four Asian Championships. He led the Indian side in many competitions, including the 2016 Rio Olympics. He was one of the main reasons why the Indian hockey team won an Olympic medal in Tokyo in 2021 after a gap of 41 years.\n\nIn Tokyo, it was Sreejesh's scintillating saves in the dying seconds of the bronze medal match against Germany that propelled India to victory. Despite losing in the semi-finals of the Paris Olympics against the same Germany, India went on to win another bronze medal by beating Spain in the Losers' final. Sreejesh, who kissed the ground after his last game, was given a guard of honour by his teammates. Sreejesh got the most beautiful send-off a player can ever get. Sreejesh displayed an excellent performance in his last tournament as well, especially in the quarter-final match against Great Britain.

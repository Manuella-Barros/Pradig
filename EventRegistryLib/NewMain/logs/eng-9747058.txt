The deal assures that the defendants in the lawsuit -- state education officials and several local school boards -- will not post the commandments in classrooms before Nov. 15, and won't make rules governing the law's implementation before then.\n\nLester Duhe, a spokesman for Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill, said the defendants \"agreed to not take public-facing compliance measures until November 15\" to provide time for briefs, arguments and a ruling.\n\nIn 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says Congress can \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\" The high court found that the law had no secular purpose but rather served a plainly religious purpose.\n\nIn 2005, the Supreme Court held that such displays in a pair of Kentucky courthouses violated the Constitution. At the same time, the court upheld a Ten Commandments marker on the grounds of the Texas state Capitol in Austin.\n\nLouisiana's new law does not require school systems to spend public money on Ten Commandments posters. It allows the systems to accept donated posters or money to pay for the displays.\n\nThe law also specifically authorizes but does not require other postings in public schools, including: The Mayflower Compact, which was signed by religious pilgrims aboard the Mayflower in 1620 and is often referred to as America's \"First Constitution\"; the Declaration of Independence; and the Northwest Ordinance, which established a government in the Northwest Territory -- in the present day Midwest -- and created a pathway for admitting new states to the Union.\n\nThe legal challenge to the law came soon after it was signed by Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, a Republican who succeeded two-term Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards in January. Landry's inauguration marked a full takeover of state government by the GOP in a Bible Belt state where the party already held other every statewide elected position and a supermajority in the Legislature.", "source": {"uri": "dailylocal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Local News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@dailylocal.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type":

Jeff Landry (R) has an absurd theory about how displaying the Ten Commandments in classrooms could have prevented last weekend's shooting of former President Donald Trump.\n\nDuring a Thursday interview with Nexstar Media at the Republican National Convention, Landry justified using taxpayer dollars to defend his state from lawsuits after it passed new legislation requiring copies of the biblical commandments to appear in every public classroom in Louisiana.\n\nLandry said that backing the mandate is an \"extremely easy\" decision, asking Nexstar: \"If the Supreme Court has something wrong, why would you not want that to be corrected?

Jeff Landry signed the law last month, making Louisiana the only state to require public schools to post the Ten Commandments, several parents and civil rights groups sued to stop it from taking effect. On Friday, the state agreed to hold off on enacting the law until the judge rules on the legal challenge.\n\n\"We are eager to ensure that our family's religious-freedom rights are protected from day one of the upcoming school year,\" said a statement earlier this month from the Rev. Darcy Roake, one of the parents suing the state. \"We believe that no child should feel excluded in public school because of their family's faith tradition.\"\n\nUnder the new law, known as Act 676, every public K-12 school and college classroom must display the Ten Commandments on posters measuring at least 11 by 14 inches and featuring \"large, easily readable font.\" Schools must also post a three-paragraph statement that explains how American textbooks used to include the Ten Commandments.\n\nThe law gives schools until Jan. 1 to put up the displays. Under the new court agreement, schools must wait until Nov. 15 to start posting them. Also, the state Board of Elementary and Secondary Education may not set any policies related to the law before that date.\n\nThe judge said in a court order that he will set a hearing in the case for Sept. 30, giving him time to issue a ruling by mid-November.\n\nNine Louisiana families with children in public schools filed a lawsuit last month challenging the new mandate. The families include parents who are Christian, Jewish and non-religious.\n\nThe lawsuit claims that requiring public schools to post the Ten Commandments violates the First Amendment, which forbids the government from \"establishing\" a state religion and protects citizens' right to freely practice their chosen religion. It also says the law goes against a 1980 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that struck down a Kentucky law requiring public schools to display the commandments.\n\nIf Louisiana's law takes effect, students \"will be unconstitutionally coerced into religious observance, veneration, and adoption of the state's favored religious scripture,\" the lawsuit says, \"and they will be pressured to suppress their personal religious beliefs and practices.\"\n\nProponents of the law say the Ten Commandments have educational value because they influenced Western legal traditions. They also say the text can provide students with moral guidance.\n\nLandry has staunchly supported the law, challenging its critics to sue him and saying he will happily spend taxpayer money to defend it in court.\n\n\"It's a price I'm glad to pay to hopefully keep kids out of crime, to reduce violence and to bring some civility back to the country and to the world,\" he said at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee this week.\n\nLandry then suggested that Thomas Matthew Crooks, the Pennsylvania man who tried to assassinate former President Donald Trump at a rally Saturday, would have benefitted from attending a school where the Ten Commandments were on display.\n\n\"Maybe he wouldn't have taken a shot at the President,\" Landry said.\n\nThe plaintiffs in the lawsuit are being represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Louisiana, Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the Freedom from Religion Foundation. The law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP is serving as pro bono counsel.\n\nThe complaint names as defendants state Superintendent of Education Cade Brumley, members of BESE and the school districts where the plaintiffs' children are enrolled.

The incident, which occurred last Saturday (7/13) in Pennsylvania, involved Thomas Matthew Crooks, whose motive remains unclear.\n\nGovernor Landry's controversial mandate to display the Ten Commandments in all public classrooms has received mixed reactions. Critics argue that it violates the separation of church and state and imposes religious views on children. Despite the backlash, including opposition from religious leaders and lawsuits from parents, Landry remains steadfast, even challenging groups like the ACLU to sue him if they disagree.\n\nIn the interview, Landry stated, \"I would submit that maybe if the Ten Commandments were hanging on [Crooks'] wall in the school that he was in, maybe he wouldn't have taken a shot at the [former] president.\" He also emphasized that the law aims to reduce crime and violence and bring civility back to society.\n\nLandry's push for this law has led to legal challenges. On July 17, U.S. Judge John W. deGravelles ordered all parties involved in the federal lawsuit to agree on an implementation date for the law, suggesting November 15. Parties have until noon today (7/19) to respond.\n\nDespite the controversy, Landry believes defending the law with taxpayer money is worthwhile.

Since Louisiana regularly places towards the bottom of state rankings in education, health, poverty, violent crimes, and overall quality of life, Louisiana must find it gratifying that it is finally number one in something.\n\nThe mandate in question, H.B. 71, was signed into law by Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry, a Republican, on June 19. Former President Donald Trump has enthusiastically endorsed the Louisiana law on his social media platform Truth Social.\n\nSimilar mandates have been proposed in Mississippi, South Carolina, West Virginia, Oklahoma, Utah, and Texas. Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick has expressed chagrin that his state was not the first to require display of the Ten Commandments in schools.\n\nThis latest eruption of Christian nationalism is problematic for several reasons. First, there is the question of which Ten Commandments are we talking about? There is no single, universally accepted text of the Ten Commandments; Jews, Catholics, and Protestants each have their own version. The Ten Commandments (known among Jews as aseret ha-dibrot, or the 10 utterances -- not Commandments) appear twice in the Old Testament with slight variations in Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5 and reappear in the Holiness Code of Leviticus 19. The aseret ha-dibrot disagree with the versions of the Ten Commandments as they appear in Catholic and Protestant Bibles, which also differ from each other.\n\nTo further complicate matters, the text mandated by the Oklahoma statute does not appear in any version of the Bible, whether Jewish, Protestant, or Catholic. Instead -- and I swear I am not making this up -- the wording in the Louisiana statute was first promulgated by the Fraternal Order of Eagles. In 1961, FOE gave the state of Texas a six-foot high monolith bearing its version of the Ten Commandments. The monolith stands at the State Capitol in Austin. FOE improved upon the work of the Almighty by mashing together different translations of the Commandments, snipping here and condensing there. If that's not ecumenism, I don't know what is.\n\nInterpretation is also a problem. Just what do the Commandments require of believers? Prohibitions against murder and theft may appear nonproblematic, but only until we try to decide what constitutes murder or theft.\n\nAnd then there are the Commandments' glaring omissions. Slavery is not prohibited. Nor is rape.[1] That's not surprising when you consider that the Ten Commandments treat women as men's property and place women on the same level as animals. The Tenth Commandment treats coveting thy neighbor's cattle or thy neighbor's wife as equally bad. (Coveting thy neighbor's husband is presumably OK).[2]\n\nIf a Biblical text has to be posted on classroom walls (I say if), why not the Beatitudes? The Beatitudes are far more uplifting than the stern Ten Commandments. In the Beatitudes, Jesus teaches, inter alia: \"Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth\"; \"Blessed are the merciful, for they shall be shown mercy\": and \"Blessed are the peacekeepers\" (Matthew 5: 3-10). But then, the Christo-fascists behind the Louisiana law aren't interested in being meek or merciful. Or peaceful.\n\n\"Public Schools Are Not Sunday Schools\"[3]\n\nEven before he signed H.B. 71, Governor Landry told the audience at a Republican fundraiser: \"I can't wait to be sued.\"\n\nGovernor, your wish is granted. On June 24, a federal lawsuit against the Louisiana law was filed in U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana. It will not be the last. Plaintiffs in Roake v. Brumley are Louisiana families representing a broad variety of religions: Jewish, Catholic, Protestant, and atheist. Their Complaint asserts that the Louisiana law is unconstitutional. The plaintiffs are correct, but that doesn't mean they won't lose.\n\nUp until recently, predicting the outcome of the suit would have been easy. Plaintiffs would have prevailed under Stone v. Graham (1980). In Stone, the US Supreme Court examined a Kentucky law which required posting the Ten Commandments in public-school classrooms. The Court struck down the Kentucky law as violative of the First Amendment Establishment Clause (\"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion\").\n\nThe Wall Comes Tumbling Down\n\nFor now, Stone v. Graham continues to stand, but for how much longer? The Supreme Court's six-Justice conservative supermajority is in the process of taking a jackhammer to what Thomas Jefferson called the \"wall of separation between the church and state.\" Conservatives deny this wall exists. They note that the words \"separation of church and state\" do not appear in the US Constitution. That is true, but proves nothing; the First Amendment free-exercise clause taken together with the establishment clause create separation of church and state without using the phrase. Far right Representative Lauren Boebert (R-CO) took time out from (allegedly) giving an over-the-pants handjob in a Denver theatre to declare: \"I'm tired of this separation of church and state junk that's not in the Constitution.\" Before this, Boebert said: \"The church is supposed to direct the government. The government is not supposed to direct the church.\" Those chilling words are Christo-fascism in a nutshell.\n\nIn Lemon v. Kurtzman (1971), the Supreme Court held that a statute which had a primarily secular purpose would be upheld. H.B. 71's proponents argue that H.B. 71 passes this test. They insist that the Ten Commandments are being posted not for religious reasons but because of their \"historical significance\" as the foundation of the US legal system. Governor Landry has said that in order to understand the rule of law, we need to start with the first lawgiver: Moses. Rubbish. US law is not founded on religion. The Constitutional Framers made sure of that.\n\nThe sponsor of H.B. 71, State Rep. Dodie Horton (R-District 9) gave the game away when she said: \"I'm concerned with our children looking and seeing what God's law is.\" This followed Horton's remark that the Ten Commandments were posted on the wall of the kindergarten in the private school she attended. She says she \"learned there was a God, and I knew to honor him and his laws.\"\n\nThe Lemon test has been crumbling since well before the current conservative Court and was not applied by the Court in a 2022 decision which allowed prayer in public school. It is unlikely that the conservative Court will require a secular basis for H.B. 71. Or the Court may unquestioningly accept the bogus claim that the Ten Commandments is an historical document and the source of US law. Expect the Court to uphold the Louisiana law.\n\nChristians Don't Hold a Monopoly on Virtue\n\nRajan Zed, who leads an organization called the Universal Society of Hinduism, has an intriguing idea. Zed is not against posting the Ten Commandments in classrooms, but wants selections from the Hindu scripture the Bhagavad-Gita to also be posted.\n\nWhy stop at the Hindu Bhagavad-Gita? Why not post the Buddhist Five Precepts, which include praiseworthy injunctions against killing, stealing, and lying. Looking beyond Buddhism, Confucianism teaches beneficence, responsibility, and the importance of virtue, justice, and community.\n\nConsider also the many uplifting Quranic ayats (verses) like: \"My [Allah's] mercy encompasses all things\" (Quran 7:156) and \"Allah does not burden a soul beyond that it can bear\" (Quran 2:286).\n\nA public school is not a public forum. You can't just walk in and start preaching your religion. Or your politics. Under First Amendment jurisprudence, a public school is not obligated to allow any religious or political messages. But once it does, it cannot discriminate among messages on the basis of content (viewpoint discrimination). If a school allows a Biden poster to go up, it must also allow a Trump poster. If the Ten Commandments are posted, then Hindus have the right to post the Bhagavad-Gita. Muslims have the right to post hadiths and Quranic verses, and so on. The Roake plaintiffs don't make this argument in their Complaint (plaintiffs want the displays of the Ten Commandments to come down), but other individuals and groups can.\n\nAttorney and Slate senior writer Mark Joseph Stern says backers of religious displays in schools\n\n\"think they'll win in the lower courts and they want to push this to SCOTUS and get a much broader right to proselytize in schools. Let's be clear, the Ten Commandments are the camel's nose under the tent in order to bring school prayer; in order to bring overtly Christian activities during school hours, and on school premises; in order to let educators turn themselves into proselytizers and religious leaders during the school day, and try to compel more children into Christianity. That is the goal here, and it is barely even concealed by its proponents.\"\n\nNotes.\n\n[1] Penalties for rape are imposed elsewhere in the Old Testament, in Deuteronomy and Leviticus.\n\n[2] George Carlin humorously suggested that the Ten Commandments could be reduced to just two: don't kill, and treat those around you with honesty and fidelity. Carlin is among countless observers who have noticed how flexible religion is when it comes to killing. You don't need to know much history to know that religion is responsible for more and bloodier conflicts than any other single cause. Christianity and Islam in particular are notable for conversions by the sword. Carlin suggests that the commandment not to kill could be more honestly expressed as \"Thou shall try real hard not to kill anyone, unless of course they pray to a different invisible man than the one you pray to.\"", "source": {"uri": "counterpunch.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Counter Punch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "charles_pierson@counterpunch.org", "name": "Charles Pierson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Landry", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Landry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatitudes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beatitudes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ten Commandments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bible"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Protestantism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Establishment_Clause", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Establishment Clause"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_v._Graham", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stone v.

A federal judge approved an agreement Friday that delays implementation until at least November, as a lawsuit filed by parents of various religious backgrounds makes its way through the courts.\n\nThe law, signed by Republican Governor Jeff Landry, would require poster-sized displays of the Ten Commandments in \"large, easily readable font\" in every K-12 classroom and state-funded university by January 1, 2025. Supporters argue that the commandments are historical documents foundational to U.S. law, while opponents claim the law violates First Amendment protections against government-established religion. Attorney General Liz Murrill has expressed eagerness to defend the law, stating, \"The 10 Commandments are pretty simple... but they also are important to our country's foundations.\"\n\nCivil liberties groups, including Americans United for Separation of Church and State, have vowed to challenge the law in court. Rachel Laser, the organization's president, warned, \"We're going to be seeing Gov. Landry in court.\" The controversy echoes similar debates across the nation, with states like Texas, Oklahoma, and Utah considering comparable legislation. Previous Supreme Court rulings have struck down similar laws in Kentucky but upheld a Ten Commandments monument on Texas Capitol grounds, highlighting the complexity of the issue.\n\nAs Louisiana grapples with this latest church-state conflict, the debate extends beyond legal concerns to questions of inclusivity and respect for diverse beliefs in public education. Chris Dier, Louisiana's 2020 teacher of the year, expressed reluctance to comply with the mandate, stating, \"I don't believe in doing something that is unconstitutional and harmful to students.\" The outcome of this legal battle could have far-reaching implications for religious expression in public institutions across the United States.", "source": {"uri": "tribune.net.ph", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ten Commandments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Landry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Landry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_judge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States federal judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Murrill", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William Murrill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans_United_for_Separation_of_Church_and_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Americans United for Separation of Church and State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_liberties", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil liberties"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Dier", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Dier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_State_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas State Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/tribune%2F2024-07%2F7ed79a85-3dc5-4259-9568-8d141257a74e%2FTen%20Commandments.png?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747058", "eventUri": "eng-9747058", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- Louisiana won't take official steps to implement a law requiring the Ten Commandments be placed in all of the state's public school classrooms until at least November as a lawsuit makes its way through the courts, according to an agreement approved by a federal judge Friday.\n\nThe suit was filed in June by parents of Louisiana public school children with various religious backgrounds, who said the law violates First Amendment language forbidding government establishment of religion and guaranteeing religious liberty. Backers of the law argue that the Ten Commandments belong in classrooms because the commandments are historical and are part of the foundation of U.S. law.\n\nThe law requires that the commandments be posted by no later than Jan. 1, a deadline unaffected by Friday's agreement. The agreement assures that the defendants in the lawsuit -- state education officials and several local school boards -- will not post the commandments in classrooms before Nov. 15.

Pharoah Doss: What good are the Ten Commandments to a child that can barely read?", "body": "Political scientists define the \"culture war\" as a conflict between social groups attempting to impose their values on society. Every rule, ordinance, regulation, ballot initiative, and court decision represent the imposition of a particular group's values, resulting in an ongoing \"culture war.\"\n\nPeople often characterize the political left as the initiators of culture war battles because they advocate for social change; yet, the reactionary right will start their own culture war battles as soon as opportunities present themselves.\n\nWhen the Christian right backed Donald Trump in 2016, the left accused them of compromising their own values; however, the Christian right made a \"culture war\" calculation. The Christian right agreed to back Trump if he pledged to appoint conservative Supreme Court judges.\n\nTrump won and delivered.\n\nThe Supreme Court now has a 6-3 conservative majority. The Supreme Court's new direction gave \"red states\" the chance to reignite \"culture war\" battles that the left thought they had already won.\n\nLast month, Louisiana's Republican governor, Jeff Landry, signed legislation requiring all public school classrooms, from kindergarten to state-funded institutions, to display a poster-size replica of the Ten Commandments.\n\nHasn't the Supreme Court ruled against Ten Commandments displays?\n\nIn 1980, a Kentucky law mandated the display of a copy of the Ten Commandments in every public school classroom. The Supreme Court ruled that Kentucky's motivation was religious and served no secular purpose. As a result, Kentucky's Ten Commandments displays were unconstitutional because they violated the \"establishment clause,\" which states that Congress cannot \"make any law respecting an establishment of religion.\"\n\nHowever, in 2005, the Supreme Court found that a six-foot-tall Ten Commandments monument on the grounds of the Texas state capitol was lawful because it was not only religious but also had historical and cultural significance.\n\nLouisiana's Republican governor and legislators insist on displaying the Ten Commandments in classrooms because it is a foundational document for America's legal system. In other words, their display serves a secular purpose because the Ten Commandments hold the same fundamental importance as the Bill of Rights.\n\nAccording to reports, Louisiana's Republican governor told a group of GOP donors only days before signing the Ten Commandments bill that he was looking forward to facing a lawsuit. Political commentators believe that Louisiana's Republican governor signed the Ten Commandments bill to initiate a \"culture war\" battle that the conservative Supreme Court will have to resolve. Apparently, Louisiana's GOP feels that if the Conservative Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, they might also reinterpret the \"separation of church and state\" in their favor.\n\nLouisiana's Republican Governor told the public that we must start with Moses' original law if we want the future generation to develop respect for the rule of law.\n\nHowever, in order for the students to develop respect for the rule of law, they would need to read the Ten Commandments. This is where the governor's faith leaps right over the illiteracy crisis in his state.\n\nLast year, the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), generally known as the nation's report card, indicated that only 43 percent of fourth-grade students in the United States scored at or above a proficient level in reading. Minorities experience a significant reduction in literacy rates, with only 17 percent of Black students and 21 percent of Latino students reading proficiently by the fourth grade.\n\nLast year, Jaclyn Tripp, an investigative reporter for KTAL NBC 6 News in Shreveport, La., noted that Louisiana's illiteracy rate is \"worse than the rest of the nation.\"\n\nAccording to Tripp, \"at least one-fourth of the population in five of every six parishes in Louisiana suffers from below-basic literacy. Twenty-one percent of adults in Louisiana do not have a high school degree. Fourth-grade testing in Louisiana shows White students are reading at a sixth-grade level, Black students are reading at a second-grade level, Latino students at a third-grade level, and Asian students at a fifth-grade reading level.\"\n\nTripp also reported that studies have shown that people with low literacy levels have limited problem-solving skills when compared to their literate counterparts, and crime rates in neighborhoods where many people are not functionally literate are significantly higher than in neighborhoods with high literacy levels. Two-thirds of fifth-grade students who cannot read proficiently end up on welfare or in jail, and 85 percent of juveniles in the court system are not functionally literate.\n\nEdwin Louis Cole, founder of the Christian Men's Network, once remarked, \"Building a godly life on the sand of scriptural illiteracy is impossible.\" It's also impossible for the Ten Commandments to help students gain respect for the law if they can barely read them.", "source": {"uri": "atlantadailyworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Atlanta Daily World"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

For its part, Louisiana schools, including Superintendent Cade Brumley, can take no steps toward requiring the postings, he said.\n\n\"No Defendant will post the Ten Commandments in any public-school classroom before November 15, 2024,\" the judge wrote Friday. \"Defendant Cade Brumley and defendant members of the Board of Education and Secondary Education will not, before November 15, 2024, promulgate advice, rules, or regulations regarding proper implementation of the challenged statute.\"", "source": {"uri": "wbrz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WBRZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ten Commandments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_church_and_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Separation of church and state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_judge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States federal judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baton_Rouge,_Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baton Rouge, Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baton Rouge, Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://dcer237tfveol.cloudfront.net/v2/ymTxvZDFRoPyoh-pFoHNOguFUmX9XMp6okYGlIeisyvd60to1Xhwj6XJYE32tOzdbib0s31rePLLIZTpmD5wvD-ybq1MGtcQhHOHWnYHXRGGVR_kiCeeK1XKZmc6yr0MY", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747058", "eventUri": "eng-9747058", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baton Rouge, Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-15", "textStart": 113, "textEnd": 120}, {"amb": false, "date": "-01-01", "textStart": 557, "textEnd": 563}, {"amb": false, "date": "2015-11-", "textStart": 935, "textEnd": 946, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

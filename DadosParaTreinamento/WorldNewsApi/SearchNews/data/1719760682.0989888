These rich guys never really learn do they? The Wall Street Journal spoke with members of the \u201cTriton Submarines\u201d team about their ambitions to show the world that submersibles are actually safe and not metal coffins. Right off the bat, I hate how close \u201cTriton\u201d is to \u201cTitan,\u201d but that\u2019s beside the point. One of the lead investors, the aforementioned real-estate investor, named Larry Connor has been all the way down to the Mariana Trench, and he plans to take the sub on a journey with company co-founder and CEO Patrick Lahey. Here\u2019s what he said to WSJ: \u201cI want to show people worldwide that while the ocean is extremely powerful, it can be wonderful and enjoyable and really kind of life-changing if you go about it the right way,\u201d Connor says by phone. He and Lahey plan to make the Titanic journey together in a two-person vessel. \u201cPatrick has been thinking about and designing this for over a decade. But we didn\u2019t have the materials and technology,\u201d Connor says. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have built this sub five years ago.\u201d Called the Triton 4000/2 Abyssal Explorer, it\u2019s listed on the company\u2019s website for $20 million. The \u201c4000\u201d represents the depth it can dive to in meters. Notably, Titanic rests at 3,800 meters. Connor says he isn\u2019t afraid of the deep. But he\u2019s not fearless. Just the night before our call, he says he had a fright while driving home to his farm: \u201cI almost hit a deer. I was going probably 60 miles per hour. That was scary.\u201d There\u2019s a big elephant in the room of the very small deep-water submersible community right now, and it\u2019s the implosion of Stockton Rush\u2019s Titan sub. A catastrophic event like that can leave a bad taste in a lot of folks\u2019 mouths, but not these two. They saw it as a bit of an opportunity. From the Wall Street Journal: \u201cHe called me up and said, \u2018You know, what we need to do is build a sub that can dive to [Titanic-level depths] repeatedly and safely and demonstrate to the world that you guys can do that, and that Titan was a contraption.\u2019\u201d [...] As Lahey and his peers see it, OceanGate\u2019s problems weren\u2019t broader submersible problems. They say classed subs are considered exceptionally safe modes of transportation thanks to rigorous testing of designs and materials. \u201cIn that sense, OceanGate didn\u2019t make the industry look bad,\u201d says McCallum. \u201cIt made us look good.\u201d After OceanGate officially announced it was suspending its operations in July of 2023, both Triton and its main competitor, Netherlands-based U-Boat Worx worked to differentiate their subs from the doomed OceanGate vessel. Here\u2019s what they did: The companies say they needed to drive home the key differences between \u201cclassed\u201d\u2014certified as safe and up to code\u2014and \u201cunclassed\u201d subs. Both Triton and U-Boat Worx use third-party maritime-classification societies to ensure that their machines are classed, and Eyos uses only classed subs for its chartered voyages. Titan, on the other hand, was unclassed and built using experimental designs and materials such as carbon fiber that were prone to cracking after repeat dives. Anyway, that\u2019s enough from me. You should really head over to the Wall Street Journal for more on what the Triton team is aiming for as well as what the high-end submersible industry as a whole looks like right now.

NeeAli Scott, a 17-year-old student at Savannah Arts Academy in Georgia, recently earned her college degree before she received her high school diploma, WJCL reported. Scott graduated from Savannah State University with an associate of science degree nearly a month before graduating from high school, the outlet said. She later graduated from Savannah Arts Academy on Monday, May 20.

Looking ahead, Scott told WJCL that she has not decided where she wants to next attend school, though she said that Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) are her top choice. She wants to study to become a cardiothoracic surgeon, according to the outlet. \"I would like to work in an inner-city hospital and give back to the youth here in Savannah or wherever I may end up,\" Scott said, per WJCL. Speaking about her decision to pursue a degree early, Scott told WJCL, \"I really just wanted to get as much education, a college education, as I can now for free.\" \"In the state of Georgia, you get 30 credits free,\" she continued. \"So that's already half of the associate's degree.\" \"Some classes gave me a little more of a challenge than others,\" Scott added of the college-level courses she took as a high school student. Scott's mother, Sabriya Scott, celebrated her daughter's academic achievements in a post shared on Instagram earlier this month. \"Today my baby did her BIG one!! She's OFFICIALLY a Savannah State University Graduate at 17 years old,\" the proud mom wrote. \"She just graduated from College before graduating from High School.\" \"I didn't let all the odds that was stacked against my 2lb micro-preemie affect how I knew my GOD would work in her life. GOD DID just that and today NeeAli graduated from SSU with her Associate Of Science Degree! ??,\" she added. \"Congratulations NeeAli Scott for being an amazing kid!! We \u2764\ufe0f you!\" \"Big thanks to my entire village and everyone that celebrated this milestone with her. \u2764\ufe0f,\" the real estate broker concluded.", "summary": "NeeAli Scott wants to study to become a cardiothoracic surgeon", "url": "https://people.com/student-17-earns-college-degree-before-graduating-from-high-school-8653628", "image": "https://people.com/thmb/-k5uFPhKcL_zD_HjmsM7c8lGfEA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(753x231:755x233)/NepAli-Scott-graduation-052424-tout-bc15e8afe93545b2bab46e928011ef62.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 13:00:00", "author": "Nicholas Rice", "authors": ["Nicholas Rice"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.369}

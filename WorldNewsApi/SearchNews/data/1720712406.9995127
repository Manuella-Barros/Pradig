{"id": 232015604, "title": "F1 Canadian Grand Prix: Can George Russell hold off Max Verstappen?", "text": "Last season only three drivers won a Formula 1 Grand Prix: Max Verstappen, Sergio P\u00e9rez, and Carlos Sainz Jr. Today\u2019s Canadian Grand Prix is the ninth Grand Prix of the season and four drivers \u2014 Verstappen, Sainz, Lando Norris, and Charles Leclerc \u2014 have reached the top step of the podium. That mere fact speaks to the compacted field this year, particularly at the pointy end of the grid, and the potential title fight that is emerging in F1. Can George Russell made it five? Russell\u2019s stunning performance in qualifying, where and Verstappen posted the exact same time in Q3 but the Mercedes driver secured pole position by putting in his lap first, gives him a chance at his first win of the 2024 campaign. But what will it take to hold off the three-time Drivers\u2019 Champion, who starts alongside him? A bit of strategy, and perhaps a bit of luck, according to the Mercedes driver. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a tough race for everybody, to be honest. Graining seems to be an issue. And this new track surface, nobody really knows how it\u2019s going to pan out. But we\u2019ve got to go for victory,\u201d said Russell following qualifying on Saturday. \u201cThe car is genuinely really, really fast at the moment. But it\u2019s going to be a long race, I think. As soon as you fall off that cliff of the [tires] tomorrow, it\u2019s going to be really difficult to recover,\u201d added Russell. \u201cSo, yeah, it could be a bit of a strategic game. Maybe not as extreme as we saw in Monaco last week, but maybe something similar.\u201d Here is the full starting grid, and some more questions that will be answered later today: Over the past few F1 seasons, one of the most uncomfortable positions in the sport has been P1 ... when you have nothing but Max Verstappen in your rear-view mirrors. That will be the scene for Russell heading into Turn 1 and then Turn 2, known as Virage Senna. Can Russell hold him off? And if he manages to keep the lead, how long can he keep it for? Looking at their fastest laps from yesterday \u2014 Verstappen\u2019s performance in Q3 and Russell\u2019s 1:11.742 in Q2, which was the fastest lap from anyone Saturday \u2014 you can see where Russell and the W15 had an advantage over Verstappen. On the straights: That is the telemetry data for those two laps, courtesy of F1-Tempo. Russell\u2019s strength on the straights, particularly the long Casino Straight heading into the final chicane by the Wall of Champions, could be huge on Sunday in this race. It is also a departure from recent years, when the pure power of the Red Bull challengers gave them the advantage on sections like the Casino Straight. For example, here is last year\u2019s telemetry data from the Canadian Grand Prix, which saw Verstappen win, and Fernando Alonso finish in P2: Times have changed. Verstappen may still win on Sunday, but it is not a given like it has been in year\u2019s past. This might be the biggest question heading into Sunday. What is the right strategy, given the newly resurfaced track in Montreal? According to Pirelli\u2019s Strategy Guide, the new surface in Montreal has made a two-stop strategy the likely solution for teams: But which two-stop? The medium-hard-hard shown first? Or the medium-hard-medium offered as option two? According to Mario Isola, Pirelli\u2019s Director of Motorsport, the graining and degradation issues they have seen on the medium tires this weekend makes Option 1 more likely. \u201cLuckily, we had that one dry session,\u201d said Isola. \u201cWe were expecting a mix between one- and two-stop strategies but the wear and degradation we measured on the medium compound is higher than expected. I believe this will push teams onto a two-stop.\u201d Will a team starting outside the points roll the dice on a one-stopper? This is the path Alexander Albon rode to a P7 in last year\u2019s race, as he stopped on Lap 12 and switched from the medium compound to a set of hards. He then delivered a stunning 58-lap performance on that set of hards, for a tremendous result. Could that be Sergio P\u00e9rez\u2019s path to points? Of course, all of this assumes a dry race ... This might be the biggest question of the day. What do the weather gods have in store for the field in Montreal? According to the Weather Channel, there is a 58% chance of rain right after lights go out for the Canadian Grand Prix. And moments ago in one of the support races \u2014 the Porsche Carrera Cup North America \u2014 wet conditions led to this: All week long drivers and teams have talked about the potential impact from the weather, and how the results on Sunday might come down to which team makes the right strategy calls ... and when they make them. That is looking very likely as the Canadian Grand Prix approaches. A team that has perhaps fallen down the pecking order and flown under the radar a bit this season? Aston Martin. They were the darlings of the early season a year ago, evidenced by Alonso\u2019s P2 in this race last season. But they arrived in Montreal sitting just fifth in the Constructors\u2019 Championship standings, 52 points behind fourth-place Mercedes. Can they have a bounceback performance today? Saturday was a strong result for the team, as Alonso will start up in P6, while Lance Stroll also starts in a points position, as he will roll off the line ninth. That gives Aston Martin a very good chance at accomplishing something they have done just twice this season: A double-points weekend. Team Principal Mike Krack outlined after qualifying how the circuit in Montreal might be a good fit for the AMR24. \u201cWe achieved our target of getting both cars through to Q3 this afternoon in Montr\u00e9al with the prospect of rain not amounting to much in the end. Our pace has been better at our \u2018home\u2019 race but we are not getting carried away. It was a close battle and encouraging to only be a few tenths away from pole position,\u201d said Krack. \u201cWe made good use of the used [tires] which got both Lance and Fernando through to Q3 ahead of the Ferraris,\u201d added the Aston Martin boss. \u201cThey both drove very well with an ever-changing track. The AMR24 is certainly more suited to this circuit and we will work overnight to optimise our prospects for tomorrow\u2019s race and give the local crowd something to cheer.\u201d", "url": "https://www.sbnation.com/formula-one/2024/6/9/24174726/f1-canadian-grand-prix-starting-grid", "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mr1ik9mb1EFwuqj7zPEN4kqNpIc=/0x0:3000x1571/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25483817/2156095190.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:27:06", "author": "Mark Schofield", "authors": ["Mark Schofield"], "language": "en", "catgory": "sports", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.054}

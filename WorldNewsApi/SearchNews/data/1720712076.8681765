In 2015, 76 million cubic meters of rock crashed from the rugged cliffs above a southeastern Alaska fjord and into the water below. The landslide sparked a nearly 200-meter-tall wave that roared down the narrow Taan Fiord and out into Icy Bay. No one witnessed the collapse, but a year later, the geologist Bretwood Higman was in the area taking detailed measurements of the tsunami\u2019s effects. Looking up from his work, Higman saw a massive cruise ship crossing the fjord\u2019s mouth. He was stunned. \u201cIt\u2019d never occurred to me that a cruise ship would go into Icy Bay,\u201d Higman says. An image of tsunami-tossed ships trapped in the rocky passage filled his mind. \u201cThere are many ways in which that could work out really badly.\u201d He couldn\u2019t get the picture out of his head. Landslide-generated tsunamis are low-probability, high-consequence events. But as rising temperatures cause glaciers to melt, the steep slopes of southeastern Alaska\u2019s numerous fjords are becoming unstable. Once buttressed by ice, many exposed cliffs now stand unsupported and at risk of collapse as the glaciers that once held them up rapidly retreat. Heavy rains and thawing permafrost are further increasing the hazards. And with tourists flocking to Alaska\u2019s rugged coast, \u201cthere are now these huge concentrations of people that are going right to the areas of highest risk,\u201d Higman says. We\u2019ve increased our vulnerability to disaster, and we\u2019ve increased the probability, he says. This risk is rising in coastal regions around the world that share Alaska\u2019s conditions, such as Greenland, Chile, Norway, and New Zealand. Unlike tsunamis triggered by earthquakes far offshore, which take time to strike coastal communities, tsunamis triggered by coastal landslides appear suddenly and can cause significantly higher waves, Higman says. That poses a greater threat to people in boats. The growing threat has been gnawing at Amanda Bauer, who\u2019s operated day cruises for 17 years, navigating the tight channels around Alaska\u2019s Prince William Sound, including in the Barry Arm fjord, where a 500-million-cubic-meter slab of unstable terrain is teetering above the retreating Barry Glacier. \u201cI think about it a lot when I\u2019m up there\u2014what would I do?\u201d Bauer says. \u201cSometimes I\u2019ll be sitting there, surrounded by ice; I couldn\u2019t go more than two knots if I wanted to. That\u2019s different than having open water where I can turn and burn if I see something happening.\u201d Concerned about how captains should respond to such an extreme threat, Higman dove into the existing scientific literature on how ships can ride out tsunami waves. Focusing only on research related to coastal landslide-triggered tsunamis, his search turned up little, save for some one-off case studies and eyewitness accounts of historical events, such as the time in 1958 when a wave nearly the height of Toronto\u2019s CN Tower capsized two boats in Lituya Bay, Alaska, and killed five people. Scientific efforts to model landslide-generated tsunamis and their effects on vessels are just beginning, which means there are scant data to inform guidelines. Higman found that the official guidance from the United States\u2019 National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program is similarly lacking. That advice, informed by the effects of offshore tsunamis, essentially boils down to three bullet points: For docked vessels, abandon ship and head for high ground on foot. For vessels in deep water, go out to even deeper water. And for vessels near shore, choose to either beach the boat and run, or flee to deeper water. This one-size-fits-all advice is meant to apply to everything from fishing boats to 150-passenger day cruisers. Landslide-generated tsunamis can strike before experts are able to detect them and issue warnings, and Higman says the captains he\u2019s spoken with would never choose to beach\u2014and potentially destroy\u2014their vessel and attempt to evacuate with passengers and crew up a rugged Alaska shoreline without even knowing when the wave will arrive or how far it will run up the coast. Although it\u2019s currently difficult to predict the arrival time or size of a landslide-generated tsunami in advance, Higman says current guidelines could better explain how tsunamis generally work. Tsunami waves differ fundamentally from the wind waves mariners are used to navigating, he says, which can throw off a captain\u2019s intuition. For one thing, tsunami waves pick up speed in deeper water and grow considerably taller in shallow water. The depths of Alaska\u2019s fjords can vary widely, so a captain could think they have plenty of time to outrun a tsunami, only to have the wave catch up and break right on top of them. Tsunamis confined to fjords also tend to slosh around like water in a bathtub, creating unpredictable currents in excess of 100 kilometers per hour. Those three bullet points of guidance don\u2019t get into these nuances of tsunamis\u2019 interactions with Alaska\u2019s complex shoreline, Higman says. The current guidelines may also underestimate the expertise of vessel operators, he says, who are used to making quick decisions in hazardous conditions. Elena Suleimani, a tsunami modeler for the Alaska Earthquake Center and co-author of the existing guidelines, admits that they\u2019re imperfect. Although she\u2019s created harbor-specific maps outlining where the water is deep enough for a ship to safely ride out a tsunami, Suleimani doesn\u2019t feel comfortable giving advice to vessel operators: \u201cI have no idea how to operate boats,\u201d she says. So, on a mission to give captains the best advice possible, Higman is running a workshop with the Prince William Sound Regional Citizens\u2019 Advisory Council (RCAC) in Valdez, Alaska, this month. The event will bring together tsunami scientists and vessel operators to compile their knowledge and, hopefully, work out some more practicable recommendations. At this point, Higman can\u2019t say exactly what the proper guidance should be. But although the workshop will focus on improving advice for the captains of small craft, Chad Hults, a geologist with the National Park Service, says operators of larger vessels, such as cruise ships, need to consider the threat of landslide-generated tsunamis as well. Hults says the NPS is keen to begin talks with the cruise lines that frequent Glacier Bay, where a dozen slabs of land seem ready to slide at any moment. During tourism season, Hults says, \u201cwe have 260 cruise ships\u2014two cruise ships a day\u2014going into Glacier Bay. There\u2019s no other place in the park system where we have 4,000 people on a boat and a pretty obvious hazard that could cause some harm.\u201d Similarly, says Alan Sorum, the maritime-operations project manager for the Prince William Sound RCAC, there are no official tsunami hazard guidelines for the oil tankers visiting Valdez, Alaska\u2014the endpoint of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. \u201cIf you capsize a big vessel like that,\u201d Sorum says, \u201cit would be a big problem cleaning that up.\u201d So far, Alaska\u2019s mariners have managed to avoid the worst. A tsunami hasn\u2019t caused an oil spill or killed anyone aboard a boat in Alaska in 60 years. \u201cWith all my effort on this, there\u2019s this voice in the back of my head that\u2019s like, \u2018Maybe it\u2019s not a big deal; maybe I\u2019m wasting my time,\u2019\u201d Higman says. But then he thinks about Barry Arm, Lituya Bay, and the cruise ship he saw sailing past the mouth of Taan Fiord. He tallies the dozens of unstable slopes known to be lurking across Alaska, all waiting to collapse into bays and fjords. \u201cAnd,\u201d he says, \u201cI do think that, at some point, [the situation] is going to explode.\u201d", "summary": "Landslides can cause sudden, powerful tsunamis\u2014and no one really knows how to navigate them.", "url": "https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2024/06/alaska-landslide-tsunamis-cruise-ships/678638/", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/H2BpI8MeRy9HkQ6s29UuEV3v-gc=/0x102:4792x2598/1200x625/media/img/mt/2024/06/HR_14761113/original.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 12:00:00", "author": "Christian Elliott", "authors": ["Christian Elliott"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.097}

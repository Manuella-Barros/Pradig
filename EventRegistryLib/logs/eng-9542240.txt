The new regulations, slated to take effect Aug. 1, also cover discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nFifteen Republican-controlled states sued the department last week in four federal lawsuits that argue the new regulations are \"plainly illegal\" and undermine protections meant for cisgender students. The regulations would also prevent states from enforcing laws that bar transgender student-athletes from competing on sports teams consistent with their gender identity, the suits argue, though the administration has yet to finalize a separate proposal governing athletics eligibility.\n\nTexas on Monday filed the first challenge to the new regulations, which Attorney General Ken Paxton wrote are built on a misinterpretation the Supreme Court's landmark ruling in Bostock v. Clayton County. It found that employees are protected from discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nLouisiana, Montana, Idaho and Mississippi followed, filing jointly in the Western District of Louisiana.\n\nOn Tuesday, West Virginia, Tennessee, Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio and Virginia filed a similar suit in the Eastern District of Kentucky. Alabama, Florida, Georgia and South Carolina sued Wednesday in the Northern District of Alabama.\n\n\"The timing and the sheer number of courts that have been invoked here sort of stack the odds against the Biden administration because there are just so many hoops to jump through,\" said Josh Blackman, a professor at South Texas College of Law Houston.\n\n\"You have to basically beat every single one of them to win,\" he said. \"And if any one of them vacates the rule, under the general understanding today, that vacates it nationwide.\"\n\nThe administration's Title IX revamp would also bolster nondiscrimination protections for pregnant students and change how schools handle claims of sexual harassment and assault.\n\nThe proposal -- first unveiled by the Education Department in June 2022 on the landmark law's 50th anniversary -- drew immediate criticism from conservatives, primarily for its intent to extend protections to transgender students. In July 2022, Florida's top education official brushed off the guidance as an attempt by the federal government \"to impose a sexual ideology\" on students and instructed schools not to follow it.\n\n\"I'm sure they were ready for it,\" Blackman said of the Biden administration's anticipation of legal action against the new regulations. \"They knew this was coming; it wasn't a surprise.\"\n\nA White House spokesperson referred The Hill to the Education Department when asked for comment on the lawsuits. An Education Department spokesperson declined, saying the department does not comment on pending litigation.\n\nThe spokesperson emphasized, however, that schools \"are obligated to comply with these final regulations\" by August as a condition of receiving federal funds.\n\nSince the cases challenging them were filed in largely conservative courts, it's possible that the administration's Title IX rules will be blocked before they can take effect, said Sarah Warbelow, the Human Rights Campaign's legal director.\n\n\"It's clear that the decision was made to file these lawsuits in more conservative jurisdictions,\" she said, \"not only with respect to the district courts, but also the circuit courts.\"\n\nShe pointed to Virginia, which joined Kentucky's lawsuit. Cases filed in Kentucky are appealed to the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, while Virginia cases are appealed to the 4th Circuit, which has already determined that Title IX prohibits discrimination against transgender students.\n\nMeanwhile, Texas's lawsuit, filed in the Amarillo Division of the Northern District of Texas, will almost certainly be heard by U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, who hears 95 percent of cases filed in Amarillo. Kacsmaryk, the division's only federal judge, has voiced opposition to the passage of LGBTQ nondiscrimination laws including the Equality Act, federal legislation that would make sexual orientation and gender identity protected classes.\n\nIn 2016, Kacsmaryk, then deputy counsel for the Christian conservative legal organization First Liberty Institute, wrote in a brief that \"the term 'sex' in Title IX must not be read to include gender identity.\"\n\nThree of the four lawsuits challenging the Biden administration's new regulations were filed in the 5th Circuit, the nation's most conservative federal appeals court.\n\n\"It's important to note that who is in the U.S. Department of Justice and in the White House and at the Department of Education will all also influence those decisions,\" Warbelow said. \"And so, elections have consequences for the long-term trajectory of any litigation on this matter.\"\n\nPreventing the new regulations from taking effect would deal a significant blow to LGBTQ students, especially in the South, where most of the lawsuits were filed, said Brian Dittmeier, director of public policy at GLSEN.\n\nIn a 2021 report from the group, which works to end anti-LGBTQ discrimination and bullying in schools, LGBTQ students in states like Alabama, Texas and Louisiana reported disproportionately high rates of victimization based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. Overall, more than 80 percent of LGBTQ students surveyed said they felt unsafe at school.\n\n\"That goes to show that there is a lot of room for state officials and school administrators to adopt policies and practices that actually ensure safer schools for their students,\" Dittmeier said.\n\n\"By bringing these lawsuits, what you see is the opposite. You see state officials who are actively working to avoid compliance with nondiscrimination law that would ensure a safer environment for their students.\"\n\nFor the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to The Hill.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gender identity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Transgender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_IX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Title IX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_orientation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sexual orientation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bostock_v._Clayton_County", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bostock v.

School boards may face federal investigations, litigation from parents, threats of a state takeover or lost funding.\n\nSign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times\n\n\"No matter which way a school district goes, they're going to possibly draw a lawsuit from someone in disagreement, whether that's a federal regulator or a private person who doesn't agree with how the district handled it,\" said Sonja Trainor, managing director for school law at the National School Boards Association. \"A lot of schools are going to be in no man's land.\"\n\nThe dispute centers on Title IX, the 1972 law prohibiting sex discrimination in educational programs that receive federal funding. The new regulations from the Biden administration interpret \"discrimination on the basis of sex\" to include discrimination on the basis of sex stereotypes and gender identity. The regulations did not address whether transgender students should be able to play on school sports teams corresponding to their gender identity. A second rule on that question is expected later.\n\n\"These regulations make it crystal clear that everyone can access schools that are safe, welcoming and that respect their rights,\" Education Secretary Miguel Cardona told reporters when the regulations were announced in April.\n\nBut in four separate lawsuits, filed in federal courts in Alabama, Louisiana, Texas and Kentucky, attorneys general in more than a dozen states are trying to block the regulations from going to effect in August as planned.\n\nAnd lawyers for the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian legal organization, have filed a challenge on behalf of the Rapides Parish School Board in Louisiana.\n\n\"We would not want to put ourselves in a position where the federal government would take funding away because we follow the original purpose of Title IX,\" Jeff Powell, the district superintendent, said in a statement. \"We want students in our district to have privacy and safety when they access sex-specific facilities.\"\n\nMost U.S. school districts receive federal funds for special education programs, and schools serving high concentrations of low-income families get federal support. But they get much more funding from state governments and, in some cases, local property taxes. Most school boards are directly answerable to their states.\n\n\"Schools are trying to ensure that kids are safe and that they have access to educational services,\" said Francisco Negron Jr., founder of K12 Counsel, a school law advocacy and policy firm. \"When there's inconsistency in the law, it's unsettling and it's distracting.\"\n\nSeveral Republican-led states have passed laws that forbid transgender students' use of school bathrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identity. Gov. Brad Little of Idaho signed a bill last month that bars teachers from referring to a student by a name or pronoun that does not align with the student's birth sex without parental consent.\n\nEducation officials in at least five states -- Oklahoma, Florida, Louisiana, Montana and South Carolina -- have urged school boards to maintain policies that \"recognize the distinction between sex and gender identity,\" as Elsie Arntzen, Montana's superintendent of public instruction, put it in her letter to school leaders in the state.\n\nFor now, the new federal regulations supersede any state law or directive from a state official on the issue. But one or more federal judges, legal experts said, could issue an order blocking the regulations from taking effect locally or nationally while the lawsuits make their way through the courts. And the issue may ultimately reach the Supreme Court, which has so far declined to weigh in on how Title IX should be interpreted with regard to gender identity.\n\nThe new regulations are premised in part on the Biden administration's interpretation of Bostock v. Clayton County, the landmark 2020 Supreme Court case in which the court ruled that discrimination based on transgender status necessarily entails treating individuals differently because of their sex.\n\nBut in the lawsuits, Republican-led states argue that the Department of Education exceeded its authority by issuing regulations that expand the definition of what constitutes sex discrimination. They point out that the Bostock decision was about workplace discrimination, and that Title IX includes specific exceptions for separating the sexes in certain educational situations, like sports teams. That shows, they argue, that Title IX was intended to recognize biological differences between males and females, not to address gender identity.\n\nAnd some Republican governors are not waiting for the courts to act.\n\n\"I am instructing the Texas Education Agency to ignore your illegal dictate,\" Gov. Greg Abbott wrote in a letter to President Joe Biden this past week.\n\nAnd Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders of Arkansas signed an executive order Thursday stating that schools in her state would continue to enforce restrictions on which bathrooms and pronouns transgender students are allowed to use.\n\n\"My message to Joe Biden and the federal government,\" Sanders said at a news conference, \"is we will not comply.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The new guidance, which takes effect in August, expands protections for LGBTQ+ students and adds new safeguards for victims of sexual assault.\n\nUnder the new rule, sex discrimination includes discrimination based on gender identity as well as sexual orientation. A school must not separate or treat people differently based on sex, except in limited circumstances. The updated guidance has infuriated conservative parent groups like Moms for Liberty, who claim Biden has gutted parents' rights and put children in harm's way.\n\n\"We're very concerned as parents about the fact that this new rule will supersede state law, all of the protections that we've worked to put into place in states around fundamental parental rights, stopping the teaching of gender ideology and sexual orientation instruction in schools,\" Moms for Liberty co-founder Tiffany Justice told Fox News Digital. \"We're really concerned we're going to see all of that just completely wiped away.\"\n\nSIX STATE SUE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION OVER NEW TITLE IX PROTECTIONS FOR TRANS ATHLETES IN GIRLS' SPORTS\n\nThe Biden administration has argued the final rule will better protect LGBTQ students from discrimination. Justice claimed it instead encourages schools to keep parents out of sensitive discussions with their children about sexuality and gender identity.\n\n\"Children should never have secret conversations with adults. But that's what we're seeing happen in some of these schools. We're seeing that social gender transition programs are being put into place for children without the knowledge and consent of parents and this new law will, in effect, give them a green light to go ahead and talk to our children about these types of private things without parents being involved. So, [it's] really a huge usurpation of parental rights,\" she argued.\n\nRepublican critics have also claimed the rule change will enable transgender athletes in schools to play on sports teams that do not match their biological sex.\n\nGOP SENATOR LEADS CHARGE TO RECOGNIZE 'AMERICAN GIRLS IN SPORTS DAY' AMID BIDEN'S TITLE IX OVERHAUL\n\nJustice's group, along with 52 other parent organizations, sent a letter to Education Secretary Miguel Cardona on May 1 calling the new guidance \"a grave threat\" to the safety of women and girls.\n\n\"The guidance poses a grave threat to the safety and opportunities of women and girls and thwarts students' First Amendment rights,\" the letter by Parents Defending Education reads.\n\nWhile the administration's new rules broadly protect against discrimination based on sex, they do not offer guidance around transgender athletes. But many Republican states argue that they could be interpreted as such.\n\nThe rule's implications would be in opposition to what the \"vast majority of Americans believe\" on transgender athletes, Justice continued.\n\nA Gallup poll from last July found that 69% of Americans believe transgender athletes should play in sports teams that align with their biological sex.\n\nRILEY GAINES SLAMS NEW TITLE IX PROTECTIONS AS THE 'MOST ANTI-WOMAN' PURSUIT OF THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION\n\nThe revised regulations also dismantle Trump-era actions that bolstered protections and prescribed a strict grievance process that ensures the accused are treated as innocent until proven guilty.\n\nJustice said parents should be alarmed by these rules changes that she believes leave both the accused and victims of assault vulnerable.\n\n\"A lot of parents who have kids in school right now need to understand that if a student is accused of something, no longer will there be due process on our college campuses. The aspect of criminality [regarding reporting assaults] has been removed as well,\" she said.\n\nMoms for Liberty is encouraging parents to become more educated about the final rule and to pressure their elected leaders to take action.\n\nThe parent group plans to release a free tool kit for parents on their website on Monday about the changes that will go into effect in August. The website will be updated with the latest news about lawsuits being filed and gives parents resources to take before their school boards and state and federal representatives to fight back against the Biden rule.\n\n\"A lot of times, Americans are a little wary of engaging if they don't know a lot about a subject,\" Justice said. \"And so once... we get up to speed on issues, we feel much more empowered to engage. So that's what we want to do with this new rule,\" she said.\n\n\"It's good to go on the record and to say this is a rule that we don't like, that the majority of Americans don't want and we certainly don't need across the United States of America going into effect,\" Justice continued.\n\nThe group also sent a letter to Republican governors and attorneys general across the United States on April 24 urging them to consider taking legal action and to defend schools that may be punished for not complying with the final rule.\n\nAt least six states and one school district have already filed lawsuits against the Biden administration over the rule change. Justice expects the rule will be tied up in court and eventually be paused nationwide while the courts figure out its constitutionality.\n\n\"I'm really happy to see people fighting back and taking a stand,\" Justice said.\n\nBIDEN'S TITLE IX RULES ARE A VICTORY FOR POWERFUL TEACHERS UNIONS FUELING DEM CAMPAIGNS\n\nThe Biden administration, however, has hailed the new rule change as advancing Title IX's legacy of protecting students from sex discrimination.\n\n\"For more than 50 years, Title IX has promised an equal opportunity to learn and thrive in our nation's schools free from sex discrimination,\" Cardona said in a press release. \"These final regulations build on the legacy of Title IX by clarifying that all our nation's students can access schools that are safe, welcoming, and respect their rights.\"\n\nThe Title IX change was also celebrated by American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten, who praised Biden for rolling back Trump-era regulations with the move. She said the changes would \"re-instill faith\" in Title IX and ensure education is \"free from discrimination.\"\n\nCLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"We look forward to additional final guidance that protects all students from politically motivated blanket bans -- banning books, banning history, banning certain students because of sexuality or gender identity -- which have no place in a country that believes in freedom and equality,\" she wrote in a release.\n\nFox News Digital reached out to the Department of Education for comment.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType":

Fortunately, religious colleges and universities can respond to this madness by restating church teaching in their demand to be exempt.\n\nSome background: Title IX is a federal civil rights law that bans sex discrimination against students, employees and others affiliated with schools or any other education program that receives federal funding. But it says nothing about sexual orientation or gender identity, so how can the administration justify this overreach?\n\nThe government points to a 2020 Supreme Court decision dealing with a different federal law. In Bostock v. Clayton County, a sharply divided Court interpreted discrimination \"because of sex\" under Title VII, the law prohibiting discrimination in the workplace, to encompass discrimination because of an individual's sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch, writing for the Court's majority, justified the sweeping expansion of the law by asserting that \"it is impossible to discriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex.\" Dismissing concerns that the Court's decision would \"sweep beyond Title VII to other federal or state laws that prohibit sex discrimination,\" Gorsuch wrote that \"none of these other laws are before us; we have not had the benefit of adversarial testing about the meaning of their terms, and we do not prejudge any such question today.\"\n\nIgnoring the expressed limits of the Bostock ruling, on his first day in office President Biden instructed all government agencies to consider Bostock's reasoning as applying to any law prohibiting sex discrimination. Title IX and its implementing regulations were specifically listed in the executive order.\n\nLawsuits have already been filed by several states and a school district contesting the new rule. Attorneys with Alliance Defending Freedom, counsel for the Rapides Parish School Board in Louisiana, assert that \"[t]he Department of Education's fundamental and radical rewriting of federal law forces schools across the country to embrace a controversial gender ideology that harms children -- including the very children it claims to help.\" The group adds that the lawsuit is \"the first of multiple lawsuits ADF plans to file challenging the rule.\"\n\nReligious colleges and universities that receive federal funding can also push back by insisting they are exempt. You see, Title IX does not apply to an educational institution that is controlled by a religious organization to the extent that its application would be inconsistent with the religious tenets of the organization. This objection offers an added benefit: the opportunity for these schools to offer religious instruction to their students.\n\nThere are two ways to go about doing this. One is for a school to inform the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) that it is claiming a religious exemption by submitting a written statement for assurance that OCR acknowledges the institution's exemption.\n\nLast year, for example, Baylor University, a private Baptist university in Waco, Texas, requested and was granted an exemption. It sought the exemption in response to civil rights complaints from an LGBTQ+ student accusing Baylor of not responding to sexual harassment claims. In its request for assurances, Baylor explained:\n\nThe University does not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity or expression per se, but it does regulate conduct that is inconsistent with the religious values and beliefs that are integral to its Christian faith and mission. Since Baylor 'affirms the biblical understanding of sexuality as a gift from God' and requires 'purity in singleness and fidelity in marriage between a man and a woman as the biblical norm,' any asserted Title IX requirement that Baylor must allow sexual behavior outside of marital union between a man and a woman, or that contradicts the Baptist doctrine of marriage and the created distinction between men and women, is inconsistent with Baylor's religious tenets, and the University is exempt from such requirement.\n\nAs exempt status under Title IX is not dependent on a school submitting a written statement to OCR, another approach is to defend exempt status. This is the route taken by Franciscan University of Steubenville.\n\nIn response to questions about the new Title IX regulations, President Father Dave Pivonka wrote a letter to students, faculty and staff. He said, \"As a passionately Catholic institution, we believe in and follow the teachings of the Catholic Church that consider 'sex' to refer to the objective reality of a human person as a man (male) or as a woman (female), grounded in and determined by a person's biology.\"\n\nHe added that, in light of the exemption available to religious institutions, \"whatever effect the new Title IX regulations might have on public institutions or secular institutions, the University will not apply the regulations in any way that is inconsistent with the Catholic Church's teaching on 'sex.'\"\n\nThe university has put together a compendium for the entire school community that makes good on its promise to provide \"much-needed resources as we seek to live the life-giving teaching of the Catholic Church on human sexuality in truth and love.\"\n\nThe Catholic University of America agrees with Franciscan.\n\n\"The Catholic University of America is closely monitoring changes to the Title IX regulations,\" a university spokesman told me. \"As a faith-based institution, we are exempted by law from having to comply with any element of Title IX that would violate our beliefs. We also anticipate that aspects of the regulation will be challenged in court and might be enjoined before it can ever take effect.\"\n\nBaylor, Franciscan and CUA are distinguishing themselves from secular institutions of higher learning by describing who they are, as they refuse the government's demand to transmit messages that distort their religious mission. As violent chaos disrupts many of our nation's campuses, Catholic and other religious colleges and universities shouldn't shy away from defending the truth about human nature and sexuality.", "source": {"uri": "ncregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "National Catholic Register"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gender identity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sexism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_orientation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sexual orientation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_IX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Title IX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-gender_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anti-gender movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Gorsuch", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Neil Gorsuch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baylor_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baylor University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bostock_v._Clayton_County", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bostock v.

They don't want to go to Title IX, but they don't want to see the person who had harmed them.\n\nYou know they're telling the truth. You want to ensure they can remain in the club. But if they don't want to go to Title IX -- or they do and their investigation drags on -- there's little you can do.\n\nMany student leaders at Harvard have faced this situation or something like it. Without a finding from an official investigation, universities cannot punish or sanction students under federal Title IX rules. This can limit the kinds of supportive measures available to students who have experienced harm -- restricting an accused student's engagement with a club, for example, could constitute a punishment.\n\nA similar dynamic plays out in Houses, another setting where students might have to share space with those who have caused them harm. Here, again, without a finding of fault, the supportive measures available are limited. If both parties live in a certain House, the survivor would generally have to transfer, or both would stay there.\n\nNo student should have to share space with their harasser or assaulter. But while the Title IX investigation process remains so broken, often, there are only two options for students: Stay and risk their well-being or leave.\n\n\"The health, safety, and wellbeing of our students remains a top priority and a core commitment of the Harvard College experience,\" wrote a Harvard spokesperson in response to a request for comment.\n\n\"We are guided by clear policies and students are strongly encouraged to access the wide array of services that support those policies,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nIs that true? To understand these dynamics, I spoke with students who have led student organizations through these situations -- as well as those who have faced them personally.\n\nWhen student organizations respond to cases of harassment or assault, they face a slew of restrictions.\n\nAccording to the Recognized Student Organization Resource Guide, in cases of sexual misconduct, student organizations are unable to exclude members without first consulting the College Title IX office. Additionally, federal regulations require that supportive measures granted before a Title IX investigation reaches a resolution are not punitive or disciplinary.\n\nBut Title IX investigations can take months or years, and most survivors never initiate them in the first place for a host of reasons. Without the clarity of an official finding, it falls to many student leaders to figure out how to provide members with support. In turn, many students are left to choose between ending their involvement with the organization or regularly engaging with the person who harmed them.\n\nIn short, student organization's hands are tied, and survivors pay for it.\n\n\"Student organizations are very limited in what we can do in response to allegations, even if we have clear and convincing evidence that misuse of power occurred,\" a student leader of a large organization wrote.\n\n\"I wish there was more codified support from the University,\" a former president of a Harvard undergraduate cultural group told me. \"A lot of this comes down to social leaders.\"\n\nOne former student organization president told me about a situation where she experienced these shortcomings firsthand. During her tenure, she was approached by an individual who said a board member had assaulted them but did not want to file a Title IX report. She was told by her adviser that she couldn't remove someone from the board without citing the club's constitution, but it contained no language regarding removal.\n\nAs a result, she was unable to take any action against the accused board member, though she later pushed to add language that would allow the club's leaders to address these problems in the future.\n\nThe limitations this president faced are not unique. Two of the organizations whose constitutions I reviewed lacked a misconduct policy in their constitution. Another organization, I learned, doesn't have a constitution at all.\n\nIn comparison, organizations with sufficient procedures for sexual harassment and assault in their bylaws give their leaders greater latitude to navigate these tricky situations and take action to support survivors.\n\nThe Institute of Politics, for example, has extensive policies about misconduct contained in a code of conduct that all members of its leadership board are required to sign. Violations of that code can result in suspension or even termination from leadership after an internal investigation, sometimes involving IOP staff.\n\nAs a result, explained Amen H. Gashaw '24, who served as president of the IOP last year, \"It's very rare that we ever have to go to Title IX.\" Gashaw called this fortunate, noting that Title IX \"isn't always the most proactive when it comes to working with students to make them feel comfortable.\"\n\nStill, in her experience working with Harvard's administration to address misconduct, she has found it to have \"a tendency toward being slower than faster, and being less decisive in action than more decisive.\"\n\nHarvard Model Congress, like the IOP, has a lengthy document laying out its sexual harassment policies. Because it defines membership in HMC as solely participation in the Boston conference and characterizes everything else as a privilege, HMC can remove students from leadership or bar them from travel and other activities if they are found in violation of the policy without having to consult Title IX.\n\nToo often, though, students face these situations in organizations without policies as strong as those of HMC or the IOP, denying students who have experienced sexual harm equal access to the extracurriculars that are such a meaningful part of the Harvard experience.\n\nSolving this doesn't mean compromising due process entirely. But while Title IX investigations remain so ineffective, policies -- or a lack thereof -- that prevent club leaders from doing their due diligence and taking action protect those who have committed harassment or assault rather than those who have experienced it.\n\nWill M. Sutton '23, a former activist with the feminist advocacy group Our Harvard Can Do Better (now known as Harvxrd Feminist Coalition, for which I'm an organizer), put it best: \"I want us to be able to keep each other safe.\"\n\nNo contact orders, which prohibit contact between parties, are intended to provide students a measure of relief without an official Title IX finding. In reality, they have a host of issues -- and, it turns out, can burden students who have experienced harm just as much as those who have perpetrated it.\n\nThese orders are relatively common. Maha Ibrahim, a Title IX attorney, told me that one of the first things most universities offer to survivors is a no contact order.\n\nAccording to the Office of Gender Equity's website, these documents are typically mutual, prohibiting either student from initiating direct or indirect communication with the other.\n\nHowever, in the context of student organization work, communication is in some cases still allowed.\n\nAn undergraduate who has a no contact order with someone in her same organization described the difficulties with enforcing her order. In theory, the rule is that contact within the context of a student organization must be limited only to what is necessary for their work for that organization.\n\nIn practice, those lines aren't so clean.\n\nShe felt the person she had a no contact order against was pushing the order's boundaries, speaking to her more often than necessary and coming too close to her physically. For those reasons, the undergraduate ultimately obtained a restraining order -- a stronger option than a no contact order, but often an inaccessible one, since many students don't have access to lawyers and court proceedings are public.\n\nUnlike many restraining orders, no contact orders can also lack clauses requiring the parties keep a certain distance apart, meaning both parties can remain in the same House or courses.\n\nAnother undergraduate I spoke with went to the Title IX office after an incident with a member of their House staff. In response, they obtained a no contact order, and the staff member was moved from their House temporarily but returned after a week.\n\n\"Lately, I've been seeing him around a lot more. And I recognize that I don't want to go to the dining hall for breakfast because I know that it'll just be him and myself there,\" they said.\n\nThey were offered swipe access to another dining hall, they said, but it was inconvenient to be isolated from their friends and the House community. They were told that he couldn't be moved out of their House because the university couldn't apply rules unevenly. And because their no contact order is mutual, they must avoid him within the House as much as he must avoid them.\n\n\"There are no rules that apply to him that don't apply to me. There's no extra protection for me or extra rules against him as the person who did this,\" they said.\n\nThis is how no contact orders fall short: Often, those who obtain them still have to navigate the spaces as the person who harmed them -- with added restrictions on their own conduct too.\n\nAnd even when perpetrators violate a no contact order, the University does not always take action. After Griffin Wong '24 obtained a no contact order following a bullying situation, the other student clearly violated it by calling him on the phone.\n\nBut when Wong, a former Crimson Sports Chair, reached out to his resident dean and a dean from the Office of Academic Integrity and Student Conduct, he told me he received no response.\n\n\"I think it's a bad precedent to set for survivors who do need the protection,\" he said. \"That's a very dangerous signal.\"\n\nAnd, although Wong was told that because of the no contact order both he and the other student would have to move out of Lowell House, where they were housed as freshmen during Covid, only he ended up having to move. The other student was allowed to stay.\n\n\"That felt like a betrayal on the part of the administration,\" he said.\n\nWhile the problems with the formal Title IX investigation process remain, students deserve support that allows them to remain in the Houses and clubs they enjoy.\n\nFortunately, under recent updates to Title IX guidelines by the Biden administration, universities are now explicitly able to offer one-way no contact orders, eliminating the burdens that two-way orders can put on survivors.\n\nStill, one-way or not, the University has a responsibility to more stringently enforce no contact orders and provide solutions for settings -- whether classes, student organizations, or Houses -- where total separation isn't provided.\n\nAbove all, supportive measures must be tailored to individual students. Advocates have long encouraged schools to get creative in the measures they offer. The new Biden regulations make room for schools to do exactly that.\n\nDue process matters. But the many issues with the formal Title IX process leave survivors to suffer without adequate support. Students shouldn't have to trade the clubs and Houses they love for safety and peace of mind.", "source": {"uri": "thecrimson.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Harvard Crimson"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harvard University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_IX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Title IX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_order", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Contact order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_College", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harvard College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quality of life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_harassment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual harassment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undergraduate_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Undergraduate education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_misconduct", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual misconduct"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Burden of proof (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codification_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Codification (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_conduct", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Code of conduct"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restraining_order", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Restraining order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bar association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_diligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Due diligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equity (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowell_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lowell House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocacy_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advocacy group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abraham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Due process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_(education)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dean (education)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Feminism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/thumbnails.thecrimson.com/photos/2024/05/05/162458_1371365.png.2000x1499_q95_crop-smart_upscale.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542240", "eventUri": "eng-9542240", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Sex and gender are not the same, and stripping out sex from Title IX upends all protections for women in education -- including the preservation of women's-only spaces, such as sports locker rooms.\n\nFortunately, states can and are taking action, and thank goodness in Alabama we know better. Governor Ivey issued a prompt statement standing up for women when she recently said, \"Alabama is NOT implementing President Biden's offensive, unlawful and dangerous rewrite of Title IX -- we're taking it to the courts! \"\n\nAttorney General Steve Marshall was among the first in the nation to stand up to this ill-conceived rule that would infringe on the constitutional rights of students, parents, faculty and the State of Alabama itself, and he fully expects the rule to be struck down swiftly.\n\nThis is just one of many battles we can count on to fight in the future as our way of life is challenged by a small but vocal segment of our society that seeks to change the fabric of our lives by redefining words, ignoring what we know to be truth and goodness.\n\nI introduced House Bill 111 to clearly define 'male' and 'female' terms to provide clarity for the courts and our state agencies. 'Woman,' for example, is used in 160 unique Alabama laws. Women and girls in Alabama deserve to live in a state that recognizes and protects their rights and unique differences from men.\n\nWords must have meaning, and my intent is to make sure we have uniform definitions that will stand up to judicial scrutiny and support our state's position on the meaning of 'male', 'female', 'man' and 'woman'.\n\nAnd even though Alabama already has a fairness in sports law, this bill is necessary because it will prevent men who say they identify as women from gaining an unfettered right to enter women's shelters, be housed in women's prisons, and join women's sororities.\n\nHB111, which is being carried in the Senate by Sen. April Weaver (R-Brierfield), will give meaning to common words so that Alabama courts have clarity when interpreting laws that already exist, something I wish that was not necessary but has proven to be crucial to ensuring women don't lose their sex-based rights.\n\nThis bill doesn't take away anyone's rights or create any special rights for women. It simply clarifies definitions of words that Alabama is already using in law, so that we are all speaking a common language. And it asserts the state's interest in maintaining single-sex spaces in order to protect privacy, fairness, safety, and equal opportunity.\n\nThe bill only needs a Senate floor vote to pass, and with three working days left, time is of the essence.\n\nLet's get HB 111 over the legislative finish line and send it to Gov.

Based on that interpretation, parents who are not proactive in affirming their children's gender identities could be viewed as contributing to that damage.\n\nAnd because educators are legally mandated to report any suspected abuse to Child Protective Services, they may have no choice but to report parents who refuse to help their children seek medical transition -- or even those who object to schools that socially transition their children.\n\nBiden's Title IX rewrite comes on the heels of news that the state of Illinois was already planning to revise the definition of abuse to include a refusal to accommodate gender identity -- a move that could empower the state, through Child Protective Services, to remove children from homes where parents did not affirm the new gender identity or help the children to obtain puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, or even surgeries.", "source": {"uri": "dailywire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Wire"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_IX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Title IX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gender identity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_protective_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Child protective services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender_health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transgender health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender_hormone_therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transgender hormone therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puberty_blocker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Puberty blocker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Disabilities", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Disabilities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice/Web_Columns", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice/Web Columns", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://dw-wp-production.imgix.net/2024/03/GettyImages-1258591064-scaled-e1711815352791.jpg?w=1200&h=800&ixlib=react-9.3.0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542240", "eventUri": "eng-9542240", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

Sarah Huckabee Sanders issued an executive order on Thursday directing state schools to defy the Biden administration's expansion of Title IX protections to include students identifying as transgender.\n\nThe Republican governor's order, signed on Thursday, asserts the state's commitment to preserving the traditional understanding of sex as an \"immutable characteristic of the human body\" firmly \"rooted in biology and the created order.\"\n\n\"The government should celebrate, not erase, sex differences by providing proper protections for them,\" the order reads. It also states that the Biden administration \"has rejected reality and chosen to appease their left-wing base over students' safety and best interests.\"\n\nUnlike certain other governors who veto bills protecting girls' sports and safety.\n\nYep.\n\nThere are, of course, the Lefties melting down over this:\n\nThere's a lot of support for the good Governor's defiance of the Title IX rules.\n\nThe IWF is the organization that filed the first lawsuit against the Title IX rewrite.\n\nWe have a dearth of those these days.\n\nIt should be all of the states, but we'll take what we can get.\n\nIt'll be interesting to watch the Biden administration's response to this, as they've turned a blind eye to the rampant Title VI violations happening on campus across the country.\n\nWe bet they'll issue statements and be mad about it, maybe even try to punish Arkansas.\n\nBut people need to stand up to this administration.", "source": {"uri": "twitchy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Twitchy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amy_curtis@twitchy.com", "name": "Amy Curtis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_IX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Title IX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Huckabee_Sanders", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sarah Huckabee Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_states_and_blue_states", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Red states and blue states"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

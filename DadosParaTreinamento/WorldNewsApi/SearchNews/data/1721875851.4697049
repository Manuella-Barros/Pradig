In 2022, she was shortlisted for the Library Association\u2019s \u2018author of the year\u2019 category at the An Post Irish Book Awards. The Kerry-born writer is currently working on her 22nd novel, Moving On, which is due for publication in February. Meaney lives in Co Clare. How did your upbringing influence your relationship with money? Mam was a miracle worker. Thanks to the marriage ban, she had to give up her teaching job when she became a wife. But she managed, with only her share of Dad\u2019s very modest salary as a school inspector, to feed and clothe seven of us \u2013 without us ever feeling hard done by. She definitely taught me how to look for the bargains and spend wisely. When were you most broke? After I qualified as a teacher, I was put on emergency tax for the first few months, which was par for the course at the time. I paid a huge percentage of tax, which was duly paid back in time, but those first months were lean ones. Pot noodle came into its own. What was your biggest ever extravagance? Without a doubt the Mini Cooper I splashed out on in 2022. It cost \u20ac30,000 and was easily the most expensive car I\u2019d ever bought \u2013 but I was in a post-pandemic shopping mood and said \u2018to hell with it\u2019. It\u2019s an automatic \u2013 not out of choice, but because it was the only one they had on the forecourt when I turned up at the garage. Patience wouldn\u2019t be my strongest suit, so I took it. It\u2019s like driving a pricey bumper car. I love it. What\u2019s the most expensive place you\u2019ve ever been to? That would probably be the Sheraton Grand Doha in Qatar. I spent Christmas there in 1983, at the home of the ex-pat parents of my then-boyfriend. Christmas in an Arab country was interesting \u2013 as in it didn\u2019t really happen \u2013 but we had a good time with his Scottish mum and Kiwi dad. On New Year\u2019s Eve, we went out to dinner at the Sheraton. Thankfully I wasn\u2019t paying the bill, but I\u2019d say the poor parents are still paying off the loan. Opulence doesn\u2019t even come into it. I can\u2019t say for sure, but I suspect our plates were real gold. Do you still carry cash? I do. I\u2019m an old fashioned girl. In my defence, I tried to install Revolut on my phone, and failing that, I tried Google Wallet, but I kept running into a dead end \u2013 a combination of my spectacular ignorance of all things technological and a not-so-smart smartphone. So now I do cash or debit card when I go shopping, and the credit card comes out for the bigger buys, and it\u2019s grand thanks. What was your biggest ever financial mistake? A singles holiday to Turkey. Seriously, I could write a book \u2013 but I don\u2019t do misery lit. What was your worst-ever job? Waitressing. I lasted a week. It was a disaster \u2013 I kept getting orders wrong. Are you a spender or a saver? I\u2019m an excellent saver and a canny spender. Not mean, just shrewd. \u200bDo you have a pension? No. Luckily the books keep me afloat. As long as I can keep thinking, I\u2019ll keep eating. What three things would you not be able to do without if you had to tighten your belt? The Mini Cooper, the internet, and Netflix.", "summary": "<p>Novelist Roisin Meaney qualified as a teacher and first worked in Dublin and in Zimbabwe.

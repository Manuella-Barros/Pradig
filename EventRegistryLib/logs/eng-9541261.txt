Able to reply any time the Oxford Products bike neared, Irwin pulled away on the penultimate lap.\n\nThere was a huge scare for the Northern Irish rider on the final lap - out of his seat at Druids.\n\nIrwin kept his composure to take his 20th British Superbike win.\n\nIddon gave chase but finished second, a final 1.069s behind.\n\nKyle Ryde earned pole in qualifying, the first track action of the day, the Yamaha man in total control of the Q2 session.\n\nThe OMG Grilla rider got a good start, but was still beaten to the lead on the final lap. From there it seemed wise to manage tyres, which saw the #77 drop back into the clutches of the riders behind.\n\nThe tyre decision allowed Ryde to get the better of his Yamaha teammate and collect the final podium spot, but it was too big a ask to reel in the Ducati duo ahead.\n\nChampionship leader after his stunning Navarra double, Ryan Vickers struggled with grip and slipped back after his electric start. That allowed Tommy Bridewell to continue his forward progress, with a clean move for fourth on lap 14 allowing the #1 to take the position on his Honda.\n\nVickers next had pressure from Danny Kent, but the former Moto3 champion was having similar grip issue son his McAMS sponsored Yamaha, allowing the #7 to hold on to fifth.\n\nJason O'Halloran had impressed, qualifying fourth on his Kawasaki for the Simply Motorbikes team, but quickly went the wrong way at lights out. The Australian's fight back took him to a lonely seventh.\n\nRory Skinner was next to see the chequered flag for the Cheshire Holdings BMW team, in turn clear of\n\n2023 race one winner Josh Brookes, who placed ninth for FHO Racing.\n\nLeon Haslam recovered enough from his issue filled qualifying to finish inside the top ten for his ROKiT BMW team.\n\nBrookes and Haslam were close on track, before a huge gap back to wait for eleventh paced finisher Charlie Nesbitt, the best of the MasterMac Honda duo in eleventh.\n\nFraser Rogers made up the most places in the race for TAG Honda to claim twelfth.\n\nThe remaining points went to Peter Hickman, a spirited push after his earlier big fall taking him to 13th for FHO Racing, ahead of Lee Jackson (MasterMac Honda), who had an early bike issue which saw him drop and recover for 14th and Dean Harrison in 15th for Honda Racing.\n\nAndrew Irwin just missed out in 16th for Honda, with Lewis Rollo the best of the Pathway entries in 17th.\n\nOfficial British Superbike Oulton Park Records:\n\nStorm Stacey was the first rider out of the race, his bike dramatically entering the air fence at Druids.\n\nHe was joined out of action by Billy McConnell, Max Cook, who was running eighth at the time of his fall and Franco Bourne, the last rider to exit.\n\nTom Neave is recovering from his crash filled appearance at Navarra, so has Eemel Lahti keeping his seat warm at Stauff Fluid Power Kawasaki.\n\nAlex Olsen's absence as also announced before the BSB round, he is not replaced as he recovers from a broken wrist.\n\nRyan Vickers still leads the way thanks to his two wins in Spain, but his lead is now down to just three points, with a total of 47.\n\nA perfect run of podiums so far sees Kyle Ryde apply the pressure in second, on 44, with Danny Kent not far behind on 40.\n\nGlenn Irwin's win sees him in fourth overall on 38 points, just nine off the title lead.\n\nDefending champion Tommy Bridewell sits eighth overall, with

Once past his fellow Yamaha rider, Vickers looked to have the pace to catch the Ducati duo, but not enough track left to do so.\n\nKent was safe in fourth, with a gap back to the chasing pack.\n\nLeon Haslam and Tommy Bridewell were at war for that place, with the #1 bike taking the lead of the next group on lap eight. The ROKiT Haslam racing rider never gave up and kept the Honda in his sights - and was able to claim fifth back on the penultimate lap.\n\nJason O'Halloran was all action in the same group at the beginning of the race and was briefly ahead of the duo on his way to seventh for Completely Motorbikes Kawasaki.\n\nThere was clear track before Josh Brookes took eighth for FHO Racing, Max Cook arrived at the chequered flag next for ninth on the second Completely Motorbikes entry.\n\nStorm Stacey (LKQ Euro Car Parts) lead the next group on track over the line to complete the top ten.\n\nLee Jackson looked more comfortable as he brought home his MasterMac Honda in a close eleventh, with attention right behind from Danny Buchan, who collected his best finish of the season so far in twelfth for DAO Racing.\n\nThe remaining points on offer went to Charlie Nesbitt in 13th for MasterMac Honda, Fraser Rogers in 14th for Tag Racing Honda and Andrew Irwin on the factory Honda in 15th.\n\nDean Harrison picked up the most places in the race, making up nine spots, to just miss out in 16th.\n\nLewis Rollo was once again the best placed Pathway rider finishing 18th on the Aprilia.\n\nOfficial British Superbike Oulton Park Records:\n\nOulton Park continued it's trend for spectacular crashes with Brayden Elliott clipped on the leg by his bike as he exited at the half way mark.\n\nPeter Hickman fell soon after, his crash left his FHO Racing bike upside down and Hickman in the middle of the track, with all the riders behind managing to miss him before he could move. Hickman, already carrying injury looked more disappointed than hurt, walking away shaking his head following his fast turn one exit.\n\nKyle Ryde had an issue with his Yamaha a lap later, which saw him pull in to the pits and call it a day on lap ten.\n\nSince the start of the Oulton Park meet Luke Hedger, Franco Bourne and Rory Skinner have withdrawn.\n\nAfter his warm-up crash, Rory Skinner has now been discharged from hospital - the fast spinning fall saw him lose his helmet but he was back in his team garage to see race three.\n\nAhead of the weekend both Alex Olsen and Tom Neave were withdrawn. Neave was replaced by Eemel Lahti(19th).\n\nA triple race win sees Glenn Irwin pull out an advantage, a maximum Haul at Oulton Park taking him to a leading total of 74.\n\nRyan Vickers fast finish lifts him to second, six points adrift.\n\nA consistent run from Christian Iddon, his first triple podium visit since 2021, saw a leap up to third overall, on 67 points, one behind Vickers.\n\nDanny Kent is fourth after five races with 64, with a DNF seeing Kyle Ryde slip back to fifth on 55.\n\nReigning champion Tommy Bridewell remains sixth now on 47 points.", "source": {"uri": "crash.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Crash"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lisa_lewis@crash.net", "name": "Lisa Lewis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Irwin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Glenn Irwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oulton_Park", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oulton Park"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Honda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Kent", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Danny Kent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ducati", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ducati"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Iddon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christian Iddon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Bird_Motorsport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Bird Motorsport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Haslam", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leon Haslam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superbike_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Superbike racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorcycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motorcycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Cook", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Max Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_O'Halloran_(motorcyclist)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jason O'Halloran (motorcyclist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Hickman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peter Hickman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Brookes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Brookes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Bridewell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Bridewell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawasaki_Heavy_Industries", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kawasaki Heavy Industries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_Motor_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yamaha Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kent"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kent"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_Skinner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rory Skinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Ryde", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Ryde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Superbike_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British Superbike Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aprilia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aprilia"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/ATV_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/ATV Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Dirt_Bikes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Dirt Bikes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://cdn.crash.net/styles/xl/s3/2024-05/closeee%20g%20irwin%20front%20action%20black%20bike%20IH_BSB_Oulton%20Park%20test_10524_168997_0.jpg?itok=kffAo3YC", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541261", "eventUri": "eng-9541261", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

Once through on Kent it didn't take long for Bridewell to size up the rider in second - Iddon.\n\nLap eight saw the defending champion make his move at Cascades, the Oxford Products rider fought back but the #1 bike shut the door and gave chase to his 2023 title rival, Irwin.\n\nThe Northern Irish rider had pulled out enough of a gap as Bridewell cut through to second, leading over the line by 0.352s.\n\nIddon remained third in his 250th race start, continuing his improving run at Oulton Park, with two podium finishes in two races.\n\nThe front rider had broken away, so Kent was safe as the top Yamaha rider in fourth on the McAMS sponsored bike.\n\nKyle Ryde was fastest in the morning warm-up, but that didn't translate to race pace for the sprint, his high hopes of a better performance over the shorter distance were soon dashed, but the OMG Grilla rider did make it to the front of the chasing group for fifth after a battle with Josh Brookes.\n\nJason O'Halloran also found a way past his fellow countryman to claim sixth for Completely Motorbikes, with the FHO Racing man not far behind in seventh.\n\nLeon Haslam was battling in the same group and just held off the second Yamaha, with a struggling Ryan Vickers on board, bringing home his ROKiT Haslam BMW Motorrad bike in eighth.\n\nMax Cook completed the top ten on the second Completely Motorbikes machine.\n\nMasterMac Honda's Lee Jackson was a distant eleventh, just ahead of Storm Stacey (LKQ Euro Car Parts Kawasaki) in the run to the chequered flag for twelfth.\n\nCharlie Nesbitt was a lonely 13th on the second MasterMac Honda bike, clear of Honda's Andrew Irwin in 14th, with an injury carrying Peter Hickman picking up the final point for FHO Racing.\n\nLewis Rollo was the best of the Pathway riders, in 17th aboard the Aprilia.\n\nFraser Rogers finished last, quick thinking seeing him avoiding the bike sin front, but sitting up and running onto the grass at Shell Oils ruined his chance of a second points finish at the Cheshire track.\n\nOfficial British Superbike Oulton Park Records:\n\nThere was only one faller in the race, with Luke Hedger crashing out of contention on lap seven.\n\nDean Harrison was out before a wheel had been turned in anger, pulling into the pits before the warm-up lap with an issue on his Honda.\n\nSeveral riders were absent before the start of the race.\n\nRory Skinner had a crash in morning warm-up, which red flagged the session. Originally unconscious he was transferred to the medical centre where his situation improved. The TAS Racing rider was then transferred to hospital for further checks and care. It was confirmed that his helmet had come off during the fall.\n\nThe Scottish rider was discharged from hospital during the sprint race.\n\nAlso out of action, Tom Neave continued his recovery after three heavy falls in Spain and was replaced by Eemel Lahti at Stauff Fluid Power Kawasaki.\n\nAlex Olsen is out with a fractured scaphoid, but is not replaced. Franco Bourne did not start the sprint.\n\nThe points distribution in BSB sees the overall standings incredibly close after four races.\n\nA win sees Glenn Irwin take over at the top, with 56 points, just one ahead of Kyle Ryde.\n\nRyde is, in turn, just one point ahead of Ryan Vickers, who lead the way before the sprint.\n\nDanny Kent is fourth on 52 points with Christian Iddon completing the top five on 51 points - just five points separate the top five.\n\nReigning champion Tommy Bridewell sits sixth on a total of 37.", "source": {"uri": "crash.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Crash"},

this year, and his bike probably wasn't as good as ours last year and it's maybe why it looked as though he didn't perform as well as the other Ducatis.\n\n\"It sets me up for tomorrow and it sets me up for a bit of road racing next week.\"\n\nIrwin is the sole rider in the PBM team this season, which is being run by Jordan and Frank Bird after their father Paul passed away last year.\n\nThe 34-year-old highlighted the importance of his first win of the campaign as the team makes a new start.\n\n\"It's very important,\" he said. \"It feels a little bit like your first win again in Superbike: One, because I'm the only rider in this team and the expectation is on you, and you have to get that monkey off your back and two because we are in a new season and things can change over the winter and we've very much done that.\"\n\nAndrew Irwin finished outside the points in 16th place on the Honda Racing UK Fireblade, 32 seconds behind his brother.\n\nToday, the Sprint race is

Then, with added fortune - he found himself right behind a fast moving Christian Iddon - the #77 got an early best of 1m 33.411s in - that allowed himto stay relaxed in the pit, confident after setting his personal best lap of Oulton Park.\n\nRyde only ventured back out to watch the rest of the session on the team's pit wall monitors on the way to his ninth British Superbike pole.\n\nGlenn Irwin topped the test at Oulton Park directly before the second round. That continued the trend of the Cheshire track being a success for the Ducati rider - last season he took wins at both visits to the track, with one at the same round last year and two on the return for the Showdown.\n\nOut on circuit, the PBM rider was unimpressed with slow riding conduct but was also able to find a good lap quickly, his best was 0.202s behind Ryde and saw him also back into the pits for the closing minutes.\n\nRyan Vickers arrived as the form man after just one round - snatching up both of the available race wins in Navarra to lead with maximum points.\n\nSuccess was less instant for the championship leader - his tyre strategy had to be changed on the fly after the red flag. The second OMG rider was able to chip away at his time to claim the final front row slot.\n\nVickers came under pressure for the place late on as Jason O'Halloran found his feet as he continued to get to grips with his new Kawasaki. His late improvements saw him to fourth for Completely Motorbikes.\n\nDanny Kent took pole last time out in Navarra, but is less of a fan of the Cheshire track. Despite that he was in contention for a top three place, close on times in fifth for McAMS racing, setting his best ever lap at the circuit.\n\nIddon was the first rider to take the chequered flag, but did not slip down as there were few riders improving, holding sixth for Oxford Products Ducati.\n\nSeventh went to Rory Skinner on the Cheshire Mouldings BMW entry, Just ahead of Tommy Bridewell.\n\nAfter a strong show at the test before the round, finishing second, the reigning champion had high hopes his bike issues from the first race were over, but another unsettled session saw him eighth for Honda.\n\nJosh Brookes was ninth after topping Q1 for FHO Racing BMW Motorrad, with Max Cook completing the top ten on the second Completely Motorbikes entry.\n\nLeon Haslam only just made it back to the pits for the restart after an issue on his ROKiT Haslam Racing BMW saw him limp slowly back in after the red flag. Frantic work in the garage got the #91 back on track, but circulating off the pace for 12th.\n\nLee Jackson had trouble leaving the pits on the restart, with a bike that wouldn't. When finally out on the Honda he placed 13th.\n\nQ2 was only a few minutes old when Peter Hickman experienced a strange slide off heading into Brittens, which saw his bike head forward at speed, destroying the foam corner barrier.\n\nAlready injured and icing his hand after a crash in the Oulton Park test when his handlebars broke, the damage to his bike was too big to repair in time, leaving Hickman with no time in the session.\n\nOfficial British Superbike Oulton Park Records:\n\nJosh Brookes lead the riders moving into Q2, along with the MasterMac Honda Duo of Charlie Nesbitt and Lee Jackson.\n\nTheir late improvements left Dean Harrison just out of luck, as Jackson's late effort bested his.\n\nHis Honda UK teammate Andrew Irwin was fancied to go through, but was coasting out of his final run, leaving him fifth in the session, for 17th on the grid.\n\nAnother previous podium contender, Danny Buchan, also found the session tough, in 19th for DAO Racing.\n\nThe best pathway rider in the session was Lewis Rollo - 20th aboard his Aprilia.\n\nThere were two absentees announced ahead of the track action at Oulton Park, Tom Neave is still recovering after three huge falls in Navarra. Following more swelling to his knee Neave underwent a CT scan, which revealed more damage. He is replaced at Stauff Fluid Power Kawasaki by Eemel Lahti (24th).\n\nAlex Olsen also misses the round but is not replaced, diagnosed with a fractured scaphoid after a fall in the recent test at the track.", "source": {"uri": "crash.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Crash"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lisa_lewis@crash.net", "name": "Lisa Lewis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oulton_Park", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oulton Park"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Superbike_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "British Superbike Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheshire", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cheshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cheshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Irwin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glenn Irwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Ryde", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Ryde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Iddon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christian Iddon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Hickman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peter Hickman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuito_de_Navarra", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Circuito de Navarra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_Motor_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yamaha Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_position", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pole position"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ducati", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ducati"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_Skinner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rory Skinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_O'Halloran_(motorcyclist)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jason O'Halloran (motorcyclist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Brookes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Brookes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Kent", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Danny Kent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Bird_Motorsport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul Bird Motorsport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Bridewell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Bridewell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Haslam", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leon Haslam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawasaki_Heavy_Industries", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kawasaki Heavy Industries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Honda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BMW"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorcycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motorcycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oxford"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oxford"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Cook", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Max Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aprilia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aprilia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_Motorrad", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BMW Motorrad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/BMX", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/BMX", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/ATV_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/ATV Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Dirt_Bikes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Dirt Bikes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://cdn.crash.net/styles/xl/s3/2024-05/Ryde%20angle%20IH_BSB_Oulton%20Park%20test_10524_168806.jpg?itok=fhDsqfVV", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541261", "eventUri": "eng-9541261", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

moment of concern came as his bike wobbled on the penultimate corner but he quickly regained control to complete a dominant victory.\n\nAfter Monday's two races at Oulton Park, Irwin will head straight to his native Northern Ireland for the coming week's North West 200 road racing meeting.\n\nKyle Ryde secured the final podium spot in Race One and is three points behind championship leader

back on the right track after the opening round at Navarra in Spain, when he finished eighth in the second race on the Hager PBM Ducati after a solid fourth in the opener.\n\nIrwin will also be eager to leave Oulton on a high as he heads straight to the North West 200, where he is bidding to extend his record of eight Superbike victories in a row.\n\nThe 35-year-old needs one more win to equal the record of nine Superbike victories held jointly by Michael Rutter and the late Joey Dunlop on the north coast, where practice gets under way on Wednesday around the 8.9-mile 'Triangle' course.\n\nFirst, though, Irwin is focused on maximising his potential at Oulton after he topped the times during a two-day test on Wednesday and Thursday ahead of the Bank Holiday weekend meeting at the PBM team's home venue.\n\nIrwin, who won three times in six races at Oulton in 2023, said: \"It's always great to go to Oulton Park which is the team's home round and I also have many sponsors based in the area.\n\n\"It's always a special time of year as we have a busy few weeks what with BSB and the North West 200.\n\n\"We lost our way a little in the second race at the opening round but I know we have a great setting for Oulton Park and can't wait to get to work at the test this week.\n\n\"This track holds special memories for me with all the success I had last year, never finishing off the podium and winning three races,\" added the 34-year-old, who was fastest in free practice on Saturday.\n\n\"I've been working really hard behind the scenes since Navarra so I'm sure we can take the fight to the opposition and hopefully come away with a repeat of last year's successes.\"\n\nIrwin is fifth in the standings after the first round, 16 points behind OMG Yamaha's Ryan Vickers.\n\nHe has finished as the title runner-up in the past two seasons, missing out on becoming Northern Ireland's first BSB champion last year by only half a point to his then team-mate Tommy Bridewell.\n\nIrwin's brother and Honda Racing UK rider Andrew will be keen to put a disappointing round at Navarra behind him this weekend after finishing outside the points in 16th in the first race before improving to 13th in the second encounter.\n\nBSB qualifying and the first 18-lap race take place on Sunday (16:30 BST).\n\nOn Monday, the BSB Sprint race is at 13:15 BST with Race 3 at 16:15

I got duffed up a little bit at the beginning and then picked my way through a little bit and then tried to settle in behind Glenn and - he set an incredible pace really - I tried to keep pushing, every time I sort of upped the pace he responded - every time.\n\n\"It was quite interesting where we make up time really, different parts of the track, so hopefully he won't find out my secrets and I can find out his and we can improve for tomorrow and see if we can take it to him!\"\n\nIddon has two chances to win on Bank Holiday Monday - the last time he did so was the first visit to Brands Hatch in 2021 - with the Sprint race first off before the riders return to track for the longer race three to close the meeting.", "source": {"uri": "crash.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Crash"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lisa_lewis@crash.net", "name": "Lisa Lewis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Iddon", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Christian Iddon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oulton_Park", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oulton Park"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ducati", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ducati"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Irwin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glenn Irwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuito_de_Navarra", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Circuito de Navarra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brands_Hatch", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brands Hatch"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/ATV_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/ATV Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Races", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Races", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://cdn.crash.net/styles/xl/s3/2024-05/iddon%20IH_BSB_Navarra_200424_158305.jpg?itok=ww0wFFDa", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541261", "eventUri": "eng-9541261", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

Oulton is definitely a circuit that I feel much more at home with compared to Navarra.\n\n\"I do think that there is more to come from both bikes really and after a quick run out on the Stock bike I'm excited to get back on the Superbike this weekend and have a real go.\n\n\"I think it's going to be a tight fight for points this weekend so I will get my head down in FP1 and just go from there.\n\n\"We've got a few things to try on Saturday and I'm looking forward to it.\"\n\nMcGuinness is embarking on his 34th year in motorcycle racing and will mark his 30th anniversary of competing at the North West 200 next week.\n\nThe 52-year-old used the test to continue development of the new model of the CBR1000RR-R Fireblade.\n\n\"It feels surreal to say that this will be my thirty-fourth season of racing,\" said the 23-time TT winner.\n\n\"It feels great to be back at a race track with the Honda team and heading into a race weekend once more after a good test.\n\n\"Our focus in the test was on learning as much as we could about the new bike before we really get going on the roads next week at the North West.\n\n\"Looking to this weekend first though, Oulton is such a unique circuit and a real test for the rider, so I'm looking forward to getting stuck in and having a go.\"\n\nManx prospect Harrison missed most of last season after breaking his collarbone and wrist in a crash at the North West and says his priority is to arrive at the TT in peak form.\n\n\"This test was all about getting some mileage under my belt and gaining bike time - I'm not going out chasing a lap time or risking anything, my focus is 100% on getting through the next few weeks fit, healthy and injury-free, and for that reason we've decided not to race this weekend,\" said the 25-year-old.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to going to the North West, I'm putting zero pressure on myself to go and get a result.\n\n\"I want to get five strong finishing positions under my belt and lay the foundations for a strong year of racing on the roads.\"\n\nBSB riders Tommy Bridewell and Andrew Irwin and Supersport contender Jack Kennedy also participated in the test.\n\nFree practice takes place on Saturday with qualifying and the first BSB race (16:30 BST) taking place on Sunday.\n\nOn Monday, the BSB Sprint race is at 13:15 BST with the second 18-lap encounter at 16:15 BST.",

main challengers after the fourth rotation, courtesy of fine parallel bars routines from Illia Kovtun and Oleg Verniaiev.\n\nZou had produced a huge score in qualifying on the parallel bars and the champion in Tokyo did not disappoint with 16.000 to push China over three points clear, ahead of the closing rotation.\n\nJapan were going to need a herculean effort from Hashimoto, the defending

2016.\n\nThis was the first of 14 artistic gymnastics titles on the line in Paris, with Simone Biles' United States team in the spotlight on Tuesday.\n\nnr/pst", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com",

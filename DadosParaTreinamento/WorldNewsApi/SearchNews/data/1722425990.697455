Erik ten Hag is going into another summer window in charge at Old Trafford, after months of speculation he would be moved on. An FA Cup final victory over City proved his saving grace, with a new contract also on the way from Sir Jim Ratcliffe. But he will need to hit the ground running to keep the wolves from the door. And although his influence over recruitment is expected to diminish, a number of his compatriots remain priority targets. Mirror Football understands Netherlands international Joshua Zirkzee is the club's top striker target, with INEOS believing his \u00a334million release clause would enable the signing of a player who will grow in value after his arrival. At the other end of the pitch, Matthijs de Ligt is under strong consideration to replace the departing Raphael Varane. But while they have some successes when dipping into the Dutch market, Ratcliffe will be all too aware of some very high-profile flops. Here are some memorable hits and infamous misses when it comes to players from Ten Hag's homeland. HITS Jaap Stam Sir Alex Ferguson admitted selling Treble-winning defensive giant Stam to Lazio in 2001 was one of the biggest regrets of his glittering United reign. Ruud van Nistelrooy Prolific scorer, regarded as the best finisher of his generation, he plundered 150 goals in five seasons at United before joining Real Madrid in 2006. He looks poised to be another of United's arrivals this summer, joining Ten Hag's backrrom staff. Edwin van der Sar His decisive penalty shoot-out save from Nicolas Anelka in the 2008 Champions League final against Chelsea saw United crowned European champions. Robin van Persie Effectively won the Premier League for United in 2013, playing all 38 games and scoring 26 league goals as Sir Alex Ferguson signed off with his 13th title triumph MISSES Memphis Depay Signed by Louis van Gaal, he arrived from PSV Eindhoven against a backdrop of huge expectation, but flopped at United, scoring just seven goals in 53 games. Donny van de Beek Another who arrived at United with a big reputation after his exploits at Ajax, but never got going at United. Just finished a loan spell at Eintracht Frankfurt. Alexander Buttner Signed by Sir Alex Ferguson in his final season, Buttner only made 28 appearances over two years at United, although he did win the Premier League. Wout Weghorst Signed on loan from Burnley in January 2023, Weghorst made 31 appearances for United, but managed to score just twice.

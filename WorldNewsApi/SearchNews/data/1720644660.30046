Charlotte, 32, announced she was pregnant back in April after suffering seven miscarriages and failed IVF attempts. At the time, she didn't reveal who the father was. A month later, the recruitment manager split from her wife Laura and claimed Conor is the father of her child. The singer, 31, has now been seen at his sister's birthday drinks, where he was caught sharing some stern words with his girlfriend. The pair attended the celebrations in Battersea Park but left three hours before the other guests.

When they left, Conor's girlfriend looked angry and was seen gesturing as they made their way back to Conor\u2019s nearby flat. The couple kept things casual for the outing, with Conor wearing a purple hoodie and oversized beige pants. His girlfriend wore a pair of baggy light blue jeans and an oversized white jumper. Conor is said to have been introduced to his baby mum thanks to Harry. They met at The Traitors wrap party and Charlotte recently took to Instagram to reveal the identity of her baby's father. She said: \"I've really toyed with whether this is the right thing to do or not. I've sort of hidden a lot of things in the protection of somebody else through this process. \"I decided that the best thing is to always be open and honest. Essentially I have not named the father in protection of him. I'm prepared to do this alone, but I'm not prepared to have my daughter have to grow up and not be able to say who her father is, or should I say, birth father, or hide it from her. \"She deserves to know where she comes from. I'm not a secret, she's not a dirty secret. I won't be silenced.\" Speaking of Conor, she said: \"I met him after The Traitors wrap party and we started seeing each other and Penelope arrived in my tummy!\" Charlotte also opened up about her pregnancy journey. Writing on social media, she said: \"After seven miscarriages over my 20s, failed Insemination, failed IVF I was told It probably won't happen for you. \"These words for a lot of women, are the words you never want to hear! Yet someone decided I deserved a wish answering and I am now going to have my own little miracle. It was a rough start (never knew sickness could be so bad) but I'm starting to feel normal again! ! I wanted to share this with all my family, friends and #thetraitors fan base! ! It's been a shock to say the least but the most welcomed surprise ever! ! !\" If you have been affected by this story, advice and support can be found at the Miscarriage Association.

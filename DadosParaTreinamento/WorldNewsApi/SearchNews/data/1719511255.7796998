Both Suzuki and Omura supported the maglev project and offered little difference in terms of policy.", "summary": "In a tightly fought race, Yasutomo Suzuki, the four-time mayor of the city of Hamamatsu, was chosen as the next governor of Shizuoka Prefecture on Sunday, beating the ruling Liberal Democratic Party-backed candidate, Shinichi Omura, by a 5.1% margin, or 77,487 votes.", "url": "https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2024/05/27/japan/politics/shizuoka-maglev-election-suzuki/", "image": "https://www.japantimes.co.jp/japantimes/uploads/images/2024/05/27/399279.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 16:23:39", "author": "Francis Tang,Web Master", "authors": ["Francis Tang", "Web Master"], "language": "en", "source_country": "jp", "sentiment": -0.442}

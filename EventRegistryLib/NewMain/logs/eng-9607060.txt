talks in Singapore", "body": "Singapore (AFP) - The US and Chinese defence chiefs are set to hold rare direct talks in Singapore this weekend, offering hopes of further military dialogue aimed at preventing flashpoint disputes from spinning out of control.\n\nThe expected meeting between the United States' Lloyd Austin and China's Dong Jun at the Shangri-La Dialogue will be the first substantive face-to-face talks between their countries' defence chiefs in 18 months.\n\nThe security forum is an annual gathering of defence chiefs from around the world that has in recent years become a barometer of US-China relations.\n\nThis year's edition, starting Friday, will come a week after China held military drills around Taiwan and warned of war over the island.\n\nThe dispute over democratic and US-backed Taiwan, which China has vowed to bring under its control, is the highest-profile of many rows between the global powers.\n\nBeijing is also furious over Washington's deepening defence ties in the Asia-Pacific, particularly with the Philippines.\n\nChina has in recent years grown increasingly assertive in staking its claims in the contested South China Sea, including by building artificial islands and militarising them.\n\nIt effectively suspended military talks with the United States in late 2022 in response to then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan.\n\nThe two sides agreed after a summit between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden in November last year to restart high-level military talks.\n\nAustin and Dong then talked over the phone in April.\n\nTheir meeting in Singapore -- announced by the Pentagon last week -- would be the most substantial encounter on defence since the presidential summit.\n\nHowever, the two sides have yet to resume much of the direct military dialogue that was scrapped after Pelosi's Taiwan visit.\n\n\"The hope here is for the (Dong-Austin) meeting to be the beginnings of cautious rapprochement to re-establish military-to-military open lines of communication,\" Mustafa Izzuddin, senior international affairs analyst with consultancy Solaris Strategies Singapore, told AFP.\n\nBiden and Xi agreed at their summit to set up a communications channel between the US Indo-Pacific Command chief and China's commanders responsible for military operations near Taiwan, Japan and in the South China Sea.\n\nA US official recently highlighted the importance of direct talks between those commanders.\n\nIzzuddin described such dialogue as \"essential\".\n\n\"It's exceptionally important because when we talk about what is happening in the South China Sea and Taiwan, it's essentially about defence and security,\" he said.\n\n- Threat of conflict -\n\nAustin and Dong will also give speeches this weekend at the Shangri-La Dialogue in which they are expected to touch on a range of their nations' pressure points.\n\nThe United States is increasingly worried about China's fast-developing military capabilities.\n\nChina already has the largest navy in the world and this month carried out a sea test of its third and biggest aircraft carrier.\n\nIn 2021, China reportedly stunned US defence officials with a globe-circling hypersonic test flight involving a high-speed missile launch over the South China Sea.\n\nIn Beijing, China's leaders are enraged by the United States routinely deploying warships and fighter jets in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea.\n\nChina views this as part of a decades-long US effort to contain it.\n\n\"If the United States does not hit the brakes but continues to speed down the wrong path, no amount of guardrails can prevent derailing, and there will surely be conflict and confrontation,\" China's then-foreign minister Qin Gang said last year.\n\nSong Zhongping, a Chinese military analyst and former People's Liberation Army officer, told AFP that Dong's Singapore speech would likely include a call for the United States to stop \"provoking\" China on Taiwan and the South China Sea.\n\n\"We especially want to warn certain countries from outside the region -- the US, Japan -- that interfering in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea will inevitably cause serious regional conflict,\" he said.\n\nSong also downplayed the prospects of deeper US-China military dialogue unless the United States cut its support for Taiwan.\n\n\"If the US cannot turn a new leaf on this issue, it cannot achieve results no matter who it speaks with.\"", "source": {"uri": "rfi.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "RFI"}, "authors": [],

defence chiefs to hold rare talks in Singapore", "body": "The US and Chinese defence chiefs are set to hold rare direct talks in Singapore this weekend, offering hopes of further military dialogue aimed at preventing flashpoint disputes from spinning out of control.\n\nThe expected meeting between the United States' Lloyd Austin and China's Dong Jun at the Shangri-La Dialogue will be the first substantive face-to-face talks between their countries' defence chiefs in 18 months.\n\nThe security forum is an annual gathering of defence chiefs from around the world that has in recent years become a barometer of US-China relations.\n\nThis year's edition, starting Friday, will come a week after China held military drills around Taiwan and warned of war over the island.\n\nThe dispute over democratic and US-backed Taiwan, which China has vowed to bring under its control, is the highest-profile of many rows between the global powers.\n\nBeijing is also furious over Washington's deepening defence ties in the Asia-Pacific, particularly with the Philippines.\n\nChina has in recent years grown increasingly assertive in staking its claims in the contested South China Sea, including by building artificial islands and militarising them.\n\nIt effectively suspended military talks with the United States in late 2022 in response to then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan.\n\nThe two sides agreed after a summit between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden in November last year to restart high-level military talks.\n\nAustin and Dong then talked over the phone in April.\n\nTheir meeting in Singapore -- announced by the Pentagon last week -- would be the most substantial encounter on defence since the presidential summit.\n\nHowever, the two sides have yet to resume much of the direct military dialogue that was scrapped after Pelosi's Taiwan visit.\n\n\"The hope here is for the (Dong-Austin) meeting to be the beginnings of cautious rapprochement to re-establish military-to-military open lines of communication,\" Mustafa Izzuddin, senior international affairs analyst with consultancy Solaris Strategies Singapore, told AFP.\n\nBiden and Xi agreed at their summit to set up a communications channel between the US Indo-Pacific Command chief and China's commanders responsible for military operations near Taiwan, Japan and in the South China Sea.\n\nA US official recently highlighted the importance of direct talks between those commanders.\n\nMore from this section Indian election: the use of deepfake causes concerns 'Poor weather conditions' cancels remainder of Bethpage Air Show at Jones Beach Oleksandr Usyk 'makes request to boxing chiefs' with potential blow on cards after Tyson Fury win\n\nIzzuddin described such dialogue as \"essential\".\n\n\"It's exceptionally important because when we talk about what is happening in the South China Sea and Taiwan, it's essentially about defence and security,\" he said.\n\n- Threat of conflict -\n\nAustin and Dong will also give speeches this weekend at the Shangri-La Dialogue in which they are expected to touch on a range of their nations' pressure points.\n\nThe United States is increasingly worried about China's fast-developing military capabilities.\n\nChina already has the largest navy in the world and this month carried out a sea test of its third and biggest aircraft carrier.\n\nIn 2021, China reportedly stunned US defence officials with a globe-circling hypersonic test flight involving a high-speed missile launch over the South China Sea.\n\nIn Beijing, China's leaders are enraged by the United States routinely deploying warships and fighter jets in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea.\n\nChina views this as part of a decades-long US effort to contain it.\n\n\"If the United States does not hit the brakes but continues to speed down the wrong path, no amount of guardrails can prevent derailing, and there will surely be conflict and confrontation,\" China's then-foreign minister Qin Gang said last year.\n\nSong Zhongping, a Chinese military analyst and former People's Liberation Army officer, told AFP that Dong's Singapore speech would likely include a call for the United States to stop \"provoking\" China on Taiwan and the South China Sea.\n\n\"We especially want to warn certain countries from outside the region -- the US, Japan -- that interfering in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea will inevitably cause serious regional conflict,\" he said.\n\nSong also downplayed the prospects of deeper US-China military dialogue unless the United States cut its support for Taiwan.\n\n\"If the US cannot turn a new leaf on this issue, it cannot achieve results no matter who it speaks with.\"\n\nburs-mba/amj/kma/pbt", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "martin_abbugao@reformer.com", "name": "Martin Abbugao",

China defence chiefs to hold rare talks in Singapore", "body": "The US and Chinese defence chiefs are set to hold rare direct talks in Singapore this weekend, offering hopes of further military dialogue aimed at preventing flashpoint disputes from spinning out of control.\n\nThe expected meeting between the United States' Lloyd Austin and China's Dong Jun at the Shangri-La Dialogue will be the first substantive face-to-face talks between their countries' defence chiefs in 18 months.\n\nThe security forum is an annual gathering of defence chiefs from around the world that has in recent years become a barometer of US-China relations.\n\nThis year's edition, starting Friday, will come a week after China held military drills around Taiwan and warned of war over the island.\n\nThe dispute over democratic and US-backed Taiwan, which China has vowed to bring under its control, is the highest-profile of many rows between the global powers.\n\nBeijing is also furious over Washington's deepening defence ties in the Asia-Pacific, particularly with the Philippines.\n\nChina has in recent years grown increasingly assertive in staking its claims in the contested South China Sea, including by building artificial islands and militarising them.\n\nIt effectively suspended military talks with the United States in late 2022 in response to then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan.\n\nThe two sides agreed after a summit between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden in November last year to restart high-level military talks.\n\nAustin and Dong then talked over the phone in April.\n\nTheir meeting in Singapore -- announced by the Pentagon last week -- would be the most substantial encounter on defence since the presidential summit.\n\nHowever, the two sides have yet to resume much of the direct military dialogue that was scrapped after Pelosi's Taiwan visit.\n\n\"The hope here is for the (Dong-Austin) meeting to be the beginnings of cautious rapprochement to re-establish military-to-military open lines of communication,\" Mustafa Izzuddin, senior international affairs analyst with consultancy Solaris Strategies Singapore, told AFP.\n\nBiden and Xi agreed at their summit to set up a communications channel between the US Indo-Pacific Command chief and China's commanders responsible for military operations near Taiwan, Japan and in the South China Sea.\n\nA US official recently highlighted the importance of direct talks between those commanders.\n\nIzzuddin described such dialogue as \"essential\".\n\n\"It's exceptionally important because when we talk about what is happening in the South China Sea and Taiwan, it's essentially about defence and security,\" he said.\n\n- Threat of conflict -\n\nAustin and Dong will also give speeches this weekend at the Shangri-La Dialogue in which they are expected to touch on a range of their nations' pressure points.\n\nThe United States is increasingly worried about China's fast-developing military capabilities.\n\nChina already has the largest navy in the world and this month carried out a sea test of its third and biggest aircraft carrier.\n\nIn 2021, China reportedly stunned US defence officials with a globe-circling hypersonic test flight involving a high-speed missile launch over the South China Sea.\n\nIn Beijing, China's leaders are enraged by the United States routinely deploying warships and fighter jets in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea.\n\nChina views this as part of a decades-long US effort to contain it.\n\n\"If the United States does not hit the brakes but continues to speed down the wrong path, no amount of guardrails can prevent derailing, and there will surely be conflict and confrontation,\" China's then-foreign minister Qin Gang said last year.\n\nSong Zhongping, a Chinese military analyst and former People's Liberation Army officer, told AFP that Dong's Singapore speech would likely include a call for the United States to stop \"provoking\" China on Taiwan and the South China Sea.\n\n\"We especially want to warn certain countries from outside the region -- the US, Japan -- that interfering in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea will inevitably cause serious regional conflict,\" he said.\n\nSong also downplayed the prospects of deeper US-China military dialogue unless the United States cut its support for Taiwan.\n\n\"If the US cannot turn a new leaf on this issue, it cannot achieve results no matter who it speaks with.\"\n\nburs-mba/amj/kma/pbt\n\nMore from this section\n\nAt least 22 dead in Memorial

talks in Singapore", "body": "SINGAPORE, Singapore -- The US and Chinese defense chiefs are set to hold rare direct talks in Singapore this weekend, offering hopes of further military dialogue aimed at preventing flashpoint disputes from spinning out of control.\n\nThe expected meeting between the United States' Lloyd Austin and China's Dong Jun at the Shangri-La Dialogue will be the first substantive face-to-face talks between their countries' defense chiefs in 18 months.\n\nThe security forum is an annual gathering of defense chiefs from around the world that has in recent years become a barometer of US-China relations.\n\nThis year's edition, starting Friday, will come a week after China held military drills around Taiwan and warned of war over the island.\n\nThe dispute over democratic and US-backed Taiwan, which China has vowed to bring under its control, is the highest-profile of many rows between the global powers.\n\nBeijing is also furious over Washington's deepening defense ties in the Asia-Pacific, particularly with the Philippines.\n\nChina has in recent years grown increasingly assertive in staking its claims in the contested South China Sea, including by building artificial islands and militarising them.\n\nIt effectively suspended military talks with the United States in late 2022 in response to then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan.\n\nThe two sides agreed after a summit between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden in November last year to restart high-level military talks.\n\nAustin and Dong then talked over the phone in April.\n\nTheir meeting in Singapore -- announced by the Pentagon last week -- would be the most substantial encounter on defense since the presidential summit.\n\nHowever, the two sides have yet to resume much of the direct military dialogue that was scrapped after Pelosi's Taiwan visit.\n\n\"The hope here is for the (Dong-Austin) meeting to be the beginnings of cautious rapprochement to re-establish military-to-military open lines of communication,\" Mustafa Izzuddin, senior international affairs analyst with consultancy Solaris Strategies Singapore, told AFP.\n\nBiden and Xi agreed at their summit to set up a communications channel between the US Indo-Pacific Command chief and China's commanders responsible for military operations near Taiwan, Japan and in the South China Sea.\n\nA US official recently highlighted the importance of direct talks between those commanders.\n\nIzzuddin described such dialogue as \"essential\".\n\n\"It's exceptionally important because when we talk about what is happening in the South China Sea and Taiwan, it's essentially about defense and security,\" he said.\n\nThreat of conflict\n\nAustin and Dong will also give speeches this weekend at the Shangri-La Dialogue in which they are expected to touch on a range of their nations' pressure points.\n\nThe United States is increasingly worried about China's fast-developing military capabilities.\n\nChina already has the largest navy in the world and this month carried out a sea test of its third and biggest aircraft carrier.\n\nIn 2021, China reportedly stunned US defense officials with a globe-circling hypersonic test flight involving a high-speed missile launch over the South China Sea.\n\nIn Beijing, China's leaders are enraged by the United States routinely deploying warships and fighter jets in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea.\n\nChina views this as part of a decades-long US effort to contain it.\n\n\"If the United States does not hit the brakes but continues to speed down the wrong path, no amount of guardrails can prevent derailing, and there will surely be conflict and confrontation,\" China's then-foreign minister Qin Gang said last year.\n\nSong Zhongping, a Chinese military analyst and former People's Liberation Army officer, told AFP that Dong's Singapore speech would likely include a call for the United States to stop \"provoking\" China on Taiwan and the South China Sea.\n\n\"We especially want to warn certain countries from outside the region -- the US, Japan -- that interfering in the Taiwan Strait and the

spinning out of control.\n\nThe meeting between the United States' Lloyd Austin and China's Dong Jun on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue is the first substantive face-to-face talks between the two countries' defence chiefs in 18 months.\n\nDong and Austin began the talks shortly before 1:00 pm (0500 GMT) at the luxury hotel hosting the security forum, a member of the US delegation told reporters.\n\nDefence chiefs and officials from around the world are attending the annual forum that has in recent years become a barometer of US-China relations.\n\nThis year's edition comes a week after China held military drills around Taiwan and warned of war over the US-backed island following the inauguration of President Lai Ching-te, who Beijing has described as a \"dangerous separatist\".\n\nThe dispute over democratic Taiwan, which Beijing considers part of its territory, tops the list of disputes between the rivals.\n\nBeijing is also furious over Washington's deepening defence ties in the Asia-Pacific, particularly with the Philippines, and its regular deployment of warships and fighter jets in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea.\n\nChina views this as part of a decades-long US effort to contain it.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's administration and China have been stepping up communication to ease friction between the nuclear-armed rivals, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken visiting Beijing and Shanghai last month.\n\nA key focus has been the resumption of military-to-military dialogue.\n\nChina scrapped military communications with the United States in 2022 in response to then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan.\n\nTensions between Washington and Beijing were stoked further during 2023 by issues including an alleged Chinese spy balloon that was shot down over US airspace, a meeting between Taiwan's then-president Tsai Ing-wen and Pelosi's successor Kevin McCarthy, and American military aid for Taipei.\n\nThe two sides agreed after a summit between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Biden in November last year to restart high-level military talks.\n\n- Pressure points -\n\nThat includes a communications channel between the US Indo-Pacific Command chief and Chinese commanders responsible for military operations near Taiwan, Japan and in the South China Sea.\n\nChinese and American forces have had a series of close encounters in the disputed waterway that China claims almost entirely.\n\nAustin warned prior to Biden and Xi agreeing to resume military-to-military dialogue that accidents have the potential to spiral out of control, especially in the absence of open lines of communication between American and Chinese forces.\n\nFriday's meeting between Austin and Dong follows a phone call between the pair in April, and offers hope of further military talks to cool tensions.\n\nAustin and Dong will give speeches this weekend at the Shangri-La Dialogue in which they are expected to touch on a range of their nations' pressure points.\n\nThe United States, increasingly worried about China's fast-developing military capabilities, has been strengthening its alliances and partnerships in the region to counter China's growing assertiveness over Taiwan and in the South China Sea.\n\nIn a post on X early Friday announcing his arrival in Singapore, Austin said he would meet with regional counterparts and continue his department's work with \"like-minded Indo-Pacific partners to promote our shared vision for a free and open region\".\n\nPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos, who has sought to deepen defence cooperation with the United States as he stands up to Chinese actions in waters off the Southeast Asia country, will deliver the Shangri-La Dialogue's keynote speech on Friday.\n\namj/cwl\n\nFOX28 Spokane\u00a9", "source": {"uri": "fox28spokane.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 28 Spokane"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

that has in recent years become a barometer of US-China relations.\n\nThis year's edition comes a week after China held military drills around Taiwan and warned of war over the US-backed island following the inauguration of President Lai Ching-te, who Beijing has described as a \"dangerous separatist\".\n\nThe dispute over democratic Taiwan, which Beijing considers part of its territory, tops the list of disputes between the rivals.\n\nBeijing is also furious over Washington's deepening defence ties in the Asia-Pacific, particularly with the Philippines, and its regular deployment of warships and fighter jets in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea.\n\nChina views this as part of a decades-long US effort to contain it.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's administration and China have been stepping up communication to ease friction between the nuclear-armed rivals, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken visiting Beijing and Shanghai last month.\n\nA key focus has been the resumption of military-to-military dialogue.\n\nChina scrapped military communications with the United States in 2022 in response to then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan.\n\nTensions between Washington and Beijing were stoked further during 2023 by issues including an alleged Chinese spy balloon that was shot down over US airspace, a meeting between Taiwan's then-president Tsai Ing-wen and Pelosi's successor Kevin McCarthy, and American military aid for Taipei.\n\nThe two sides agreed after a summit between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Biden in November last year to restart high-level military talks.\n\nPressure points\n\nThat includes a communications channel between the US Indo-Pacific Command chief and Chinese commanders responsible for military operations near Taiwan, Japan and in the South China Sea.\n\nChinese and American forces have had a series of close encounters in the disputed waterway that China claims almost entirely.\n\nAustin warned prior to Biden and Xi agreeing to resume military-to-military dialogue that accidents have the potential to spiral out of control, especially in the absence of open lines of communication between American and Chinese forces.\n\nFriday's meeting between Austin and Dong follows a phone call between the pair in April, and offers hope of further military talks to cool tensions.\n\nAustin and Dong will give speeches this weekend at the Shangri-La Dialogue in which they are expected to touch on a range of their nations' pressure points.\n\nThe United States, increasingly worried about China's fast-developing military capabilities, has been strengthening its alliances and partnerships in the region to counter China's growing assertiveness over Taiwan and in the South China Sea.\n\nIn a post on X early Friday announcing his arrival in Singapore, Austin said he would meet with regional counterparts and continue his department's work with \"like-minded Indo-Pacific partners to promote our shared vision for a free and open region\".\n\nPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos, who has sought to deepen defence cooperation with the United States as he stands up to Chinese actions in waters off the Southeast Asia country, will deliver the Shangri-La Dialogue's keynote speech on Friday.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"},

Beijing is also furious over Washington's deepening defence ties in the Asia-Pacific, particularly with the Philippines.\n\nChina has in recent years grown increasingly assertive in staking its claims in the contested South China Sea, including by building artificial islands and militarising them.\n\nIt effectively suspended military talks with the United States in late 2022 in response to then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan.\n\nThe two sides agreed after a summit between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden in November last year to restart high-level military talks.\n\nAustin and Dong then talked over the phone in April.\n\nTheir meeting in Singapore -- announced by the Pentagon last week -- would be the most substantial encounter on defence since the presidential summit.\n\nHowever, the two sides have yet to resume much of the direct military dialogue that was scrapped after Pelosi's Taiwan visit.\n\n\"The hope here is for the (Dong-Austin) meeting to be the beginnings of cautious rapprochement to re-establish military-to-military open lines of communication,\" Mustafa Izzuddin, senior international affairs analyst with consultancy Solaris Strategies Singapore, told AFP.\n\nBiden and Xi agreed at their summit to set up a communications channel between the US Indo-Pacific Command chief and China's commanders responsible for military operations near Taiwan, Japan and in the South China Sea.\n\nA US official recently highlighted the importance of direct talks between those commanders. Izzuddin described such dialogue as \"essential\".\n\n\"It's exceptionally important because when we talk about what is happening in the South China Sea and Taiwan, it's essentially about defence and

Singapore", "body": "SINGAPORE, May 31 -- The US and Chinese defence chiefs will hold rare direct talks in Singapore today, offering hopes for more military dialogue that could help prevent disputes over Taiwan and other flashpoint issues from spinning out of control.\n\nThe meeting between the United States' Lloyd Austin and China's Dong Jun on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue will be the first substantive face-to-face talks between the two countries' defence chiefs in 18 months.\n\nDong and Austin are scheduled to meet at 1pm at the luxury hotel hosting the security forum, members of the US delegation told AFP on the condition of anonymity.\n\nDefence chiefs and officials from around the world are attending the annual forum that has in recent years become a barometer of US-China relations.\n\nThis year's edition comes a week after China held military drills around Taiwan and warned of war over the US-backed island following the inauguration of President Lai Ching-te, who Beijing has described as a \"dangerous separatist\".\n\nThe dispute over democratic Taiwan, which Beijing considers part of its territory, tops the list of disputes between the rivals.\n\nBeijing is also furious over Washington's deepening defence ties in the Asia-Pacific, particularly with the Philippines, and its regular deployment of warships and fighter jets in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea.\n\nChina views this as part of a decades-long US effort to contain it.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's administration and China have been stepping up communication to ease friction between the nuclear-armed rivals, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken visiting Beijing and Shanghai last month.\n\nA key focus has been the resumption of military-to-military dialogue.\n\nChina scrapped military communications with the United States in 2022 in response to then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan.\n\nTensions between Washington and Beijing were stoked further during 2023 by issues including an alleged Chinese spy balloon that was shot down over US airspace, a meeting between Taiwan's then-president Tsai Ing-wen and Pelosi's successor Kevin McCarthy, and American military aid for Taipei.\n\nThe two sides agreed after a summit between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Biden in November last year to restart high-level military talks.\n\nPressure points\n\nThat includes a communications channel between the US Indo-Pacific Command chief and Chinese commanders responsible for military operations near Taiwan, Japan and in the South China Sea.\n\nChinese and American forces have had a series of close encounters in the disputed waterway that China claims almost entirely.\n\nAustin warned prior to Biden and Xi agreeing to resume military-to-military dialogue that accidents have the potential to spiral out of control, especially in the absence of open lines of communication between American and Chinese forces.\n\nThe highly anticipated meeting between Austin and Dong follows a phone call between the pair in April, and offers hope of further military talks to cool tensions.\n\nAustin and Dong will give speeches this weekend at the Shangri-La Dialogue in which they are expected to touch on a range of their nations' pressure points.\n\nThe United States, increasingly worried about China's fast-developing military capabilities, has been strengthening its alliances and partnerships in the region to counter China's growing assertiveness over Taiwan and in the South China Sea.\n\nIn a post on X early Friday announcing his arrival in Singapore, Austin said he would meet with regional counterparts and continue his department's work with \"like-minded Indo-Pacific partners to promote our shared vision for a free and open region\".\n\nPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos, who has sought to deepen defence cooperation with the United States as he stands up to Chinese actions in waters off the South-east Asia country, will deliver the Shangri-La Dialogue's keynote speech on Friday. -- AFP", "source": {"uri": "malaymail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Malay Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

UrduPoint", "body": "Singapore, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 29th May, 2024) The US and Chinese defence chiefs are set to hold rare direct talks in Singapore this weekend, offering hopes of further military dialogue aimed at preventing flashpoint disputes from spinning out of control.\n\nThis year's edition, starting Friday, will come a week after China held military drills around Taiwan and warned of war over the island.\n\nThe dispute over democratic and US-backed Taiwan, which China has vowed to bring under its control, is the highest-profile of many rows between the global powers.\n\nBeijing is also furious over Washington's deepening defence ties in the Asia-Pacific, particularly with the Philippines.\n\nChina has in recent years grown increasingly assertive in staking its claims in the contested South China Sea, including by building artificial islands and militarising them.\n\nHowever, the two sides have yet to resume much of the direct military dialogue that was scrapped after Pelosi's Taiwan visit.\n\n\"The hope here is for the (Dong-Austin) meeting to be the beginnings of cautious rapprochement to re-establish military-to-military open lines of communication,\" Mustafa Izzuddin, senior international affairs analyst with consultancy Solaris Strategies Singapore, told AFP.\n\nA US official recently highlighted the importance of direct talks between those commanders.\n\nIzzuddin described such dialogue as \"essential\".\n\n\"It's exceptionally important because when we talk about what is happening in the South China Sea and Taiwan, it's essentially about defence and security,\" he said.\n\nAustin and Dong will also give speeches this weekend at the Shangri-La Dialogue in which they are expected to touch on a range of their nations' pressure points.\n\n\"If the United States does not hit the brakes but continues to speed down the wrong path, no amount of guardrails can prevent derailing, and there will surely be conflict and confrontation,\" China's then-foreign minister Qin Gang said last year.\n\nSong also downplayed the prospects of deeper US-China military dialogue unless the United States cut its support for Taiwan.", "source": {"uri": "urdupoint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UrduPoint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label":

Lloyd Austin and China's Dong Jun on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue is the first substantive face-to-face talks between the two countries' defence chiefs in 18 months.\n\nDong and Austin began the talks shortly before 1:00 pm (0500 GMT) at the luxury hotel hosting the security forum, a member of the US delegation told reporters.\n\nDefence chiefs and officials from around the world are attending the annual forum that has in recent years become a barometer of US-China relations.\n\nThis year's edition comes a week after China held military drills around Taiwan and warned of war over the US-backed island following the inauguration of President Lai Ching-te, who Beijing has described as a \"dangerous separatist\".\n\nThe dispute over democratic Taiwan, which Beijing considers part of its territory, tops the list of disputes between the rivals.\n\nBeijing is also furious over Washington's deepening defence ties in the Asia-Pacific, particularly with the Philippines, and its regular deployment of warships and fighter jets in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea.\n\nChina views this as part of a decades-long US effort to contain it.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's administration and China have been stepping up communication to ease friction between the nuclear-armed rivals, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken visiting Beijing and Shanghai last month.\n\nA key focus has been the resumption of military-to-military dialogue.\n\nChina scrapped military communications with the United States in 2022 in response to then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan.\n\nTensions between Washington and Beijing were stoked further during 2023 by issues including an alleged Chinese spy balloon that was shot down over US airspace, a meeting between Taiwan's then-president Tsai Ing-wen and Pelosi's successor Kevin McCarthy, and American military aid for Taipei.\n\nThe two sides agreed after a summit between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Biden in November last year to restart high-level military talks.\n\nThat includes a communications channel between the US Indo-Pacific Command chief and Chinese commanders responsible for military operations near Taiwan, Japan and in the South China Sea.\n\nChinese and American forces have had a series of close encounters in the disputed waterway that China claims almost entirely.\n\nAustin warned prior to Biden and Xi agreeing to resume military-to-military dialogue that accidents have the potential to spiral out of control, especially in the absence of open lines of communication between American and Chinese forces.\n\nFriday's meeting between Austin and Dong follows a phone call between the pair in April, and offers hope of further military talks to cool tensions.\n\nAustin and Dong will give speeches this weekend at the Shangri-La Dialogue in which they are expected to touch on a range of their nations' pressure points.\n\nThe United States, increasingly worried about China's fast-developing military capabilities, has been strengthening its alliances and partnerships in the region to counter China's growing assertiveness over Taiwan and in the South China Sea.\n\nIn a post on X early Friday announcing his arrival in Singapore, Austin said he would meet with regional counterparts and continue his department's work with \"like-minded Indo-Pacific partners to promote our shared vision for a free and open region\".\n\nPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos, who has sought to deepen defence cooperation with the United States as he stands up to Chinese actions in waters off the Southeast Asia country, will deliver the Shangri-La Dialogue's keynote speech on Friday.", "source": {"uri": "spacewar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SpaceWar"}, "authors": [],

military-to-military dialogue in 'coming months'  --  US defense chief", "body": "SINGAPORE, Singapore -- The United States and China will resume military-to-military communications \"in the coming months\", US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Friday, as Beijing hailed the \"stabilizing\" security relations between the countries.\n\nAustin met with his Chinese counterpart Dong Jun on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore in the first substantive face-to-face talks between the two defence chiefs in 18 months.\n\nDong and Austin met for over an hour at the luxury hotel hosting the security forum that is attended by defence officials from around the world and in recent years has become a barometer of US-China relations.\n\nAustin said telephone conversations between US and Chinese military commanders would resume \"in the coming months\", according to a readout released by the Pentagon.\n\nHe also welcomed plans for a \"crisis-communications working group\" with China by the end of the year, the statement said.\n\nDescribing the talks as \"positive\", Chinese defence spokesman Wu Qian told reporters that military-to-military relations were \"currently stopping their decline and stabilising\".\n\nBut Wu cautioned that it was not possible for Beijing and Washington to solve all bilateral problems in one meeting, highlighting their thorniest dispute over Taiwan, which China considers part of its territory.\n\nThis year's Shangri-La Dialogue comes a week after China held military drills around self-ruled Taiwan and warned of war over the US-backed island following the inauguration of President Lai Ching-te, who Beijing has described as a \"dangerous separatist\".\n\n\"The Taiwan issue is purely China's internal affairs, external forces have no right to interfere, and the United States' actions seriously violate the one China principle,\" Wu said, referring to Washington's decision to congratulate Lai and send a delegation to the ceremony.\n\nAustin said China's military exercises were \"provocative\" and insisted it should not use Taipei's \"political transition... as a pretext for coercive measures.\"\n\nResuming dialogue\n\nUS President Joe Biden's administration and China have been stepping up communication to ease friction between the nuclear-armed rivals, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken visiting Beijing and Shanghai last month.\n\nA key focus has been the resumption of military-to-military dialogue, which is seen as critical to preventing flashpoint disputes from spinning out of control.\n\nChina scrapped military communications with the United States in 2022 in response to then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan.\n\nTensions between Washington and Beijing were further stoked by issues including an alleged Chinese spy balloon that was shot down over US airspace, a meeting between Taiwan's then-president Tsai Ing-wen and Pelosi's successor Kevin McCarthy and American military aid for Taipei.\n\nChina is also furious over the United States' deepening defence ties in the Asia-Pacific, particularly with the Philippines, and its regular deployment of warships and fighter jets in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea.\n\nBeijing views this as part of a decades-long US effort to contain it.\n\nThe two sides agreed after a summit between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Biden last November to restart high-level military talks, including over military operations near Taiwan, Japan and in the South China Sea.\n\nPressure points\n\nChinese and American forces have had a series of close encounters in the disputed waterway that China claims almost entirely.\n\nWhile meeting Dong, Austin underscored the importance of \"high seas freedom of navigation\", especially in the South China Sea, and insisted that the United States would continue to \"fly, sail and operate\" wherever international law allowed, the Pentagon readout said.\n\nPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos, who has sought to deepen defence cooperation with the United States as he stands up to Chinese actions in waters off the Southeast Asia country, will deliver the Shangri-La Dialogue's keynote speech on Friday.\n\nAustin and Dong will also give speeches in Singapore this weekend in which they are expected to touch on a range of their nations' pressure points.\n\nTheir meeting on Friday follows a phone call between them in April, and offers hope of further military talks to cool tensions.\n\nAustin's last significant interaction with a Chinese counterpart was in November 2022 when he met with Wei Fenghe in Cambodia.\n\nWei was subsequently replaced by Li Shangfu, who shook hands and spoke briefly with Austin at the Shangri-La Dialogue in 2023, but they did not hold a formal meeting.", "source": {"uri": "philstar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Philstar.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

'Coming Months': Austin", "body": "The United States and China will resume military-to-military communications \"in the coming months\", U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Friday, as Beijing hailed the \"stabilizing\" security relations between the countries.\n\nAustin met with his Chinese counterpart Dong Jun on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore in the first substantive face-to-face talks between the two defense chiefs in 18 months.\n\nDong and Austin met for over an hour at the luxury hotel hosting the security forum that is attended by defence officials from around the world and in recent years has become a barometer of US-China relations.\n\nAustin said telephone conversations between US and Chinese military commanders would resume \"in the coming months\", according to a readout released by the Pentagon.\n\nHe also welcomed plans for a \"crisis-communications working group\" with China by the end of the year, the statement said.\n\nDescribing the talks as \"positive\", Chinese defence spokesman Wu Qian told reporters that military-to-military relations were \"currently stopping their decline and stabilising\".\n\nBut Wu cautioned that it was not possible for Beijing and Washington to solve all bilateral problems in one meeting, highlighting their thorniest dispute over Taiwan, which China considers part of its territory.\n\nThis year's Shangri-La Dialogue comes a week after China held military drills around self-ruled Taiwan and warned of war over the US-backed island following the inauguration of President Lai Ching-te, who Beijing has described as a \"dangerous separatist\".\n\n\"The Taiwan issue is purely China's internal affairs, external forces have no right to interfere, and the United States' actions seriously violate the one China principle,\" Wu said, referring to Washington's decision to congratulate Lai and send a delegation to the ceremony.\n\nAustin said China's military exercises were \"provocative\" and insisted it should not use Taipei's \"political transition... as a pretext for coercive measures.\"\n\nUS President Joe Biden's administration and China have been stepping up communication to ease friction between the nuclear-armed rivals, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken visiting Beijing and Shanghai last month.\n\nA key focus has been the resumption of military-to-military dialogue, which is seen as critical to preventing flashpoint disputes from spinning out of control.\n\nChina scrapped military communications with the United States in 2022 in response to then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan.\n\nTensions between Washington and Beijing were further stoked by issues including an alleged Chinese spy balloon that was shot down over US airspace, a meeting between Taiwan's then-president Tsai Ing-wen and Pelosi's successor Kevin McCarthy and American military aid for Taipei.\n\nChina is also furious over the United States' deepening defence ties in the Asia-Pacific, particularly with the Philippines, and its regular deployment of warships and fighter jets in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea.\n\nBeijing views this as part of a decades-long US effort to contain it.\n\nThe two sides agreed after a summit between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Biden last November to restart high-level military talks, including over military operations near Taiwan, Japan and in the South China Sea.\n\nChinese and American forces have had a series of close encounters in the disputed waterway that China claims almost entirely.\n\nWhile meeting Dong, Austin underscored the importance of \"high seas freedom of navigation\", especially in the South China Sea, and insisted that the United States would continue to \"fly, sail and operate\" wherever international law allowed, the Pentagon readout said.\n\nPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos, who has sought to deepen defence cooperation with the United States as he stands up to Chinese actions in waters off the Southeast Asia country, will deliver the Shangri-La Dialogue's keynote speech on Friday.\n\nAustin and Dong will also give speeches in Singapore this weekend in which they are expected to touch on a range of their nations' pressure points.\n\nTheir meeting on Friday follows a phone call between them in April, and offers hope of further military talks to cool tensions.\n\nAustin's last significant interaction with a Chinese counterpart was in November 2022 when he met with Wei Fenghe in Cambodia.\n\nWei was subsequently replaced by Li Shangfu, who shook hands and spoke briefly with Austin at the Shangri-La Dialogue in 2023, but they did not hold a formal meeting.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business

disputes between the rivals.\n\nBeijing is also furious over Washington's deepening defence ties in the Asia-Pacific, particularly with the Philippines, and its regular deployment of warships and fighter jets in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea.\n\nChina views this as part of a decades-long US effort to contain it.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's administration and China have been stepping up communication to ease friction between the nuclear-armed rivals, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken visiting Beijing and Shanghai last month.\n\nA key focus has been the resumption of military-to-military dialogue.\n\nChina scrapped military communications with the United States in 2022 in response to then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan.\n\nTensions between Washington and Beijing were stoked further during 2023 by issues including an alleged Chinese spy balloon that was shot down over US airspace, a meeting between Taiwan's then-president Tsai Ing-wen and Pelosi's successor Kevin McCarthy, and American military aid for Taipei.\n\nMore from this section Opossum brought to safety after being trapped in traffic Robert De Niro speaks at Biden campaign

Dialogue In 'Coming Months': Austin", "body": "The United States and China will resume military-to-military communications \"in the coming months\", US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Friday, as Beijing hailed the \"stabilising\" security relations between the countries.\n\nAustin met with his Chinese counterpart Dong Jun on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore in the first substantive face-to-face talks between the two defence chiefs in 18 months.\n\nDong and Austin met for over an hour at the luxury hotel hosting the security forum that is attended by defence officials from around the world and in recent years has become a barometer of US-China relations.\n\nAustin said telephone conversations between US and Chinese military commanders would resume \"in the coming months\", according to a readout released by the Pentagon.\n\nHe also welcomed plans for a \"crisis-communications working group\" with China by the end of the year, the statement said.\n\nDescribing the talks as \"positive\", Chinese defence spokesman Wu Qian told reporters that military-to-military relations were \"currently stopping their decline and stabilising\".\n\nWu cautioned that it was not possible for Beijing and Washington to solve all bilateral problems in one meeting, but said \"talking is better than not talking\".\n\nThis year's Shangri-La Dialogue comes a week after China held military drills around Taiwan and warned of war over the US-backed island following the inauguration of President Lai Ching-te, who Beijing has described as a \"dangerous separatist\".\n\nSelf-ruled Taiwan, which Beijing considers part of its territory, tops the list of disputes between the rivals.\n\nChina is also furious over the United States' deepening defence ties in the Asia-Pacific, particularly with the Philippines, and its regular deployment of warships and fighter jets in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea.\n\nBeijing views this as part of a decades-long US effort to contain it.\n\nUS President Joe Biden's administration and China have been stepping up communication to ease friction between the nuclear-armed rivals, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken visiting Beijing and Shanghai last month.\n\nA key focus has been the resumption of military-to-military dialogue, which is seen as critical to preventing flashpoint disputes from spinning out of control.\n\nChina scrapped military communications with the United States in 2022 in response to then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan.\n\nTensions between Washington and Beijing were stoked further during 2023 by issues including an alleged Chinese spy balloon that was shot down over US airspace, a meeting between Taiwan's then-president Tsai Ing-wen and Pelosi's successor Kevin McCarthy, and American military aid for Taipei.\n\nThe two sides agreed after a summit between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Biden last November to restart high-level military talks.\n\nThat includes a communications channel between the US Indo-Pacific Command chief and Chinese commanders responsible for military operations near Taiwan, Japan and in the South China Sea.\n\nChinese and American forces have had a series of close encounters in the disputed waterway that China claims almost entirely.\n\nAustin warned prior to Biden and Xi agreeing to resume military-to-military dialogue that accidents have the potential to spiral out of control, especially in the absence of open lines of communication between American and Chinese forces.\n\nFriday's meeting between Austin and Dong follows a phone call between the pair in April, and offers hope of further military talks to cool tensions.\n\nAustin's last significant interaction with a Chinese counterpart was in November 2022 when he met with Wei Fenghe in Cambodia.\n\nWei was subsequently replaced by Li Shangfu, who shook hands and spoke briefly with Austin at the Shangri-La Dialogue in 2023 but did not hold a formal meeting with him.\n\nAustin and Dong will give speeches this weekend at the Shangri-La Dialogue in which they are expected to touch on a range of their nations' pressure points.\n\nThe United States, increasingly worried about China's fast-developing military capabilities, has been strengthening its alliances and partnerships in the region to counter China's growing assertiveness over Taiwan and in the South China Sea.\n\nIn the meeting, Austin underscored the United States' commitment to the one China policy, but insisted that it would continue to \"fly, sail and operate\" wherever international law allowed, the Pentagon readout said.\n\nPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos, who has sought to deepen defence cooperation with the United States as he stands up to Chinese actions in waters off the Southeast Asia country, will deliver the Shangri-La Dialogue's keynote speech on Friday.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title":

with his Chinese counterpart Dong Jun on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore in the first substantive face-to-face talks between the two defence chiefs in 18 months.\n\nDong and Austin met for over an hour at the luxury hotel hosting the security forum that is attended by defence officials from around the world and in recent years has become a barometer of US-China relations.\n\nAustin said telephone conversations between US and Chinese military commanders would resume \"in the coming months\", according to a readout released by the Pentagon.\n\nHe also welcomed plans for a \"crisis-communications working group\" with China by the end of the year, the statement said.\n\nDescribing the talks as \"positive\", Chinese defence spokesman Wu Qian told reporters that military-to-military relations were \"currently stopping their decline and stabilising\".\n\nBut Wu cautioned that it was not possible for Beijing and Washington to solve all bilateral problems in one meeting, highlighting their thorniest dispute over Taiwan, which China considers part of its territory.\n\nThis year's Shangri-La Dialogue comes a week after China held military drills around self-ruled Taiwan and warned of war over the US-backed island following the inauguration of President Lai Ching-te, who Beijing has described as a \"dangerous separatist\".\n\n\"The Taiwan issue is purely China's internal affairs, external forces have no right to interfere, and the United States' actions seriously violate the one China principle,\" Wu said, referring to Washington's decision to congratulate Lai and send a delegation to the ceremony.\n\nAustin said China's military exercises were \"provocative\" and insisted it should not use Taipei's \"political transition... as a pretext for coercive measures.\"\n\nUS President Joe Biden's administration and China have been stepping up communication to ease friction between the nuclear-armed rivals, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken visiting Beijing and Shanghai last month.\n\nA key focus has been the resumption of military-to-military dialogue, which is seen as critical to preventing flashpoint disputes from spinning out of control.\n\nChina scrapped military communications with the United States in 2022 in response to then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan.\n\nTensions between Washington and Beijing were further stoked by issues including an alleged Chinese spy balloon that was shot down over US airspace, a meeting between Taiwan's then-president Tsai Ing-wen and Pelosi's successor Kevin McCarthy and American military aid for Taipei.\n\nChina is also furious over the United States' deepening defence ties in the Asia-Pacific, particularly with the Philippines, and its regular deployment of warships and fighter jets in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea.\n\nBeijing views this as part of a decades-long US effort to contain it.\n\nThe two sides agreed after a summit between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Biden last November to restart high-level military talks, including over military operations near Taiwan, Japan and in the South China Sea.\n\nChinese and American forces have had a series of close encounters in the disputed waterway that China claims almost entirely.\n\nWhile meeting Dong, Austin underscored the importance of \"high seas freedom of navigation\", especially in the South China Sea, and insisted that the United States would continue to \"fly, sail and operate\" wherever international law allowed, the Pentagon readout said.\n\nPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos, who has sought to deepen defence cooperation with the United States as he stands up to Chinese actions in waters off the Southeast Asia country, will deliver the Shangri-La Dialogue's keynote speech on Friday.\n\nAustin and Dong will also give speeches in Singapore this weekend in which they are expected to touch on a range of their nations' pressure points.\n\nTheir meeting on Friday follows a phone call between them in April, and offers hope of further military talks to cool tensions.\n\nAustin's last significant interaction with a Chinese counterpart was in November 2022 when he met with Wei Fenghe in Cambodia.\n\nWei was subsequently replaced by Li Shangfu, who shook hands and spoke briefly with Austin at the Shangri-La Dialogue in 2023, but they did not hold a formal meeting.", "source": {"uri": "spacewar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SpaceWar"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5,

with his Chinese counterpart Dong Jun on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore in the first substantive face-to-face talks between the two defence chiefs in 18 months.\n\nDong and Austin met for over an hour at the luxury hotel hosting the security forum that is attended by defence officials from around the world and in recent years has become a barometer of US-China relations.\n\nAustin said telephone conversations between US and Chinese military commanders would resume \"in the coming months\", according to a readout released by the Pentagon.\n\nHe also welcomed plans for a \"crisis-communications working group\" with China by the end of the year, the statement said.\n\nDescribing the talks as \"positive\", Chinese defence spokesman Wu Qian told reporters that military-to-military relations were \"currently stopping their decline and stabilising\".\n\nWu cautioned that it was not possible for Beijing and Washington to solve all bilateral problems in one meeting, but said \"talking is better than not talking\".\n\nThis year's Shangri-La Dialogue comes a week after China held military drills around Taiwan and warned of war over the US-backed island following the inauguration of President Lai Ching-te, who Beijing has described as a \"dangerous separatist\".\n\nSelf-ruled Taiwan, which Beijing considers part of its territory, tops the list of disputes between the rivals.\n\nChina is also furious over the United States' deepening defence ties in the Asia-Pacific, particularly with the Philippines, and its regular deployment of warships and fighter jets in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea.\n\nBeijing views this as part of a decades-long US effort to contain it.\n\nUS President Joe Biden's administration and China have been stepping up communication to ease friction between the nuclear-armed rivals, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken visiting Beijing and Shanghai last month.\n\nA key focus has been the resumption of military-to-military dialogue, which is seen as critical to preventing flashpoint disputes from spinning out of control.\n\nChina scrapped military communications with the United States in 2022 in response to then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan.\n\nTensions between Washington and Beijing were stoked further during 2023 by issues including an alleged Chinese spy balloon that was shot down over US airspace, a meeting between Taiwan's then-president Tsai Ing-wen and Pelosi's successor Kevin McCarthy, and American military aid for Taipei.\n\nThe two sides agreed after a summit between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Biden last November to restart high-level military talks.\n\nThat includes a communications channel between the US Indo-Pacific Command chief and Chinese commanders responsible for military operations near Taiwan, Japan and in the South China Sea.\n\nChinese and American forces have had a series of close encounters in the disputed waterway that China claims almost entirely.\n\nAustin warned prior to Biden and Xi agreeing to resume military-to-military dialogue that accidents have the potential to spiral out of control, especially in the absence of open lines of communication between American and Chinese forces.\n\nFriday's meeting between Austin and Dong follows a phone call between the pair in April, and offers hope of further military talks to cool tensions.\n\nAustin's last significant interaction with a Chinese counterpart was in November 2022 when he met with Wei Fenghe in Cambodia.\n\nWei was subsequently replaced by Li Shangfu, who shook hands and spoke briefly with Austin at the Shangri-La Dialogue in 2023 but did not hold a formal meeting with him.\n\nAustin and Dong will give speeches this weekend at the Shangri-La Dialogue in which they are expected to touch on a range of their nations' pressure points.\n\nThe United States, increasingly worried about China's fast-developing military capabilities, has been strengthening its alliances and partnerships in the region to counter China's growing assertiveness over Taiwan and in the South China Sea.\n\nIn the meeting, Austin underscored the United States' commitment to the one China policy, but insisted that it would continue to \"fly, sail and operate\" wherever international law allowed, the Pentagon readout said.\n\nPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos, who has sought to deepen defence cooperation with the United States as he stands up to Chinese actions in waters off the Southeast Asia country, will deliver the Shangri-La Dialogue's keynote speech on Friday.", "source": {"uri": "spacewar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SpaceWar"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5,

Singapore\n\nThe United States and China will resume military-to-military communications \"in the coming months\", US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Friday, as Beijing hailed the \"stabilising\" security relations between the countries.\n\nAustin met with his Chinese counterpart Dong Jun on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore in the first substantive face-to-face talks between the two defence chiefs in 18 months.\n\nDong and Austin met for over an hour at the luxury hotel hosting the security forum that is attended by defence officials from around the world and in recent years has become a barometer of US-China relations.\n\nAustin said telephone conversations between US and Chinese military commanders would resume \"in the coming months\", according to a readout released by the Pentagon.\n\nHe also welcomed plans for a \"crisis-communications working group\" with China by the end of the year, the statement said.\n\nDescribing the talks as \"positive\", Chinese defence spokesman Wu Qian told reporters that military-to-military relations were \"currently stopping their decline and stabilising\".\n\nWu cautioned that it was not possible for Beijing and Washington to solve all bilateral problems in one meeting, but said \"talking is better than not talking\".\n\nThis year's Shangri-La Dialogue comes a week after China held military drills around Taiwan and warned of war over the US-backed island following the inauguration of President Lai Ching-te, who Beijing has described as a \"dangerous separatist\".\n\nSelf-ruled Taiwan, which Beijing considers part of its territory, tops the list of disputes between the rivals.\n\nChina is also furious over the United States' deepening defence ties in the Asia-Pacific, particularly with the Philippines, and its regular deployment of warships and fighter jets in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea.\n\nBeijing views this as part of a decades-long US effort to contain it.\n\nUS President Joe Biden's administration and China have been stepping up communication to ease friction between the nuclear-armed rivals, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken visiting Beijing and Shanghai last month.\n\nA key focus has been the resumption of military-to-military dialogue, which is seen as critical to preventing flashpoint disputes from spinning out of control.\n\nChina scrapped military communications with the United States in 2022 in response to then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan.\n\nMore from this section Fed Reserve President Kashkari Wants 'Many More Months' of Inflation Progress Before Cutting Rates Putin Declares Zelensky's Rule Illegitimate, Asserts Ukrainian Parliament Sole Authority Menendez bribery trial: Jurors see texts sent between senator and wife regarding Egyptian military aid\n\nTensions between Washington and Beijing were stoked further during 2023 by issues including an alleged Chinese spy balloon that was shot down over US airspace, a meeting between Taiwan's then-president Tsai Ing-wen and Pelosi's successor Kevin McCarthy, and American military aid for Taipei.\n\nThe two sides agreed after a summit between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Biden last November to restart high-level military talks.\n\nThat includes a communications channel between the US Indo-Pacific Command chief and Chinese commanders responsible for military operations near Taiwan, Japan and in the South China Sea.\n\n- Pressure points -\n\nChinese and American forces have had a series of close encounters in the disputed waterway that China claims almost entirely.\n\nAustin warned prior to Biden and Xi agreeing to resume military-to-military dialogue that accidents have the potential to spiral out of control, especially in the absence of open lines of communication between American and Chinese forces.\n\nFriday's meeting between Austin and Dong follows a phone call between the pair in April, and offers hope of further military talks to cool tensions.\n\nAustin's last significant interaction with a Chinese counterpart was in November 2022 when he met with Wei Fenghe in Cambodia.\n\nWei was subsequently replaced by Li Shangfu, who shook hands and spoke briefly with Austin at the Shangri-La Dialogue in 2023 but did not hold a formal meeting with him.\n\nAustin and Dong will give speeches this weekend at the Shangri-La Dialogue in which they are expected to touch on a range of their nations' pressure points.\n\nThe United States, increasingly worried about China's fast-developing military capabilities, has been strengthening its alliances and partnerships in the region to counter China's growing assertiveness over Taiwan and in the South China Sea.\n\nIn the meeting, Austin underscored the United States' commitment to the one China policy, but insisted that it would continue to \"fly, sail and operate\" wherever international law allowed, the Pentagon readout said.\n\nPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos, who has sought to deepen defence cooperation with the United States as he stands up to Chinese actions in waters off the Southeast Asia country, will deliver the Shangri-La Dialogue's keynote speech on Friday.\n\nbur-amj/dhw", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Beijing calls Lai a \"separatist\".\n\nBoth sides, however, emphasised the importance of keeping military-to-military ties open, and a senior US defence official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the meeting marked an \"important step\" in opening lines of communication.\n\nThe official said Austin was \"firm but professional\" and also brought up China's nuclear, space and cyber developments.\n\nThe two sides also discussed the South China Sea and the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza.\n\nLater on Friday the spotlight shifts to Philippine President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr, who is expected to discuss the legal and geopolitical position of the Philippines on the South China Sea and note the importance of the waterway to global trade.\n\nChina claims sovereignty over almost all of the South China Sea, including parts claimed by the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam, despite a 2016 ruling by the Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration that found Beijing's sweeping claims have no legal basis.\n\nTaiwan's Defence Minister Wellington Koo told reporters in Taipei on Friday that increased tensions around the democratically governed island claimed by China as its own territory would diminish if Beijing's military drills ceased.\n\n\"If China stops its provocation and intimidation then peace and stability can be maintained,\" he said.\n\nThe region has seen a sharp uptick in such exercises in recent years, according to a report by the London-based International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS) released on Friday.\n\nAlthough both the United States and China have significantly increased the volume of military exercises across Asia, Beijing's drills still lag in scale and complexity, the study found.\n\nThe Shangri-La Dialogue, in its 21st iteration, is held every year in Singapore by IISS, gathering military and political leaders to discuss security issues.

"SINGAPORE, May 31, 2024 (BSS/AFP) - The United States and China will resume military-to-military communications \"in the coming months\", US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Friday, as Beijing hailed the \"stabilising\" security relations between the countries.\n\nAustin met with his Chinese counterpart Dong Jun on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore in the first substantive face-to-face talks between the two defence chiefs in 18 months.\n\nDong and Austin met for over an hour at the luxury hotel hosting the security forum that is attended by defence officials from around the world and in recent years has become a barometer of US-China relations.\n\nAustin said telephone conversations between US and Chinese military commanders would resume \"in the coming months\", according to a readout released by the Pentagon.\n\nHe also welcomed plans for a \"crisis-communications working group\" with China by the end of the year, the statement said.\n\nDescribing the talks as \"positive\", Chinese defence spokesman Wu Qian told reporters that military-to-military relations were \"currently stopping their decline and stabilising\".\n\nWu cautioned that it was not possible for Beijing and Washington to solve all bilateral problems in one meeting, but said \"talking is better than not talking\".\n\nUS President Joe Biden's administration and China have been stepping up communication to ease friction between the nuclear-armed rivals, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken visiting Beijing and Shanghai last month.\n\nA key focus has been the resumption of military-to-military dialogue, which is seen as critical to preventing flashpoint disputes from spinning out of control.\n\nChina scrapped military communications with the United States in 2022 in response to then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan.\n\nTensions between Washington and Beijing were stoked further during 2023 by issues including an alleged Chinese spy balloon that was shot down over US airspace, a meeting between Taiwan's then-president Tsai Ing-wen and Pelosi's successor Kevin McCarthy, and American military aid for Taipei.\n\nThe two sides agreed after a summit between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Biden last November to restart high-level military talks.\n\nThat includes a communications channel between the US Indo-Pacific Command chief and Chinese commanders responsible for military operations near Taiwan, Japan and in the South China Sea.\n\n- Pressure points -\n\nChinese and American forces have had a series of close encounters in the disputed waterway that China claims almost entirely.\n\nAustin warned prior to Biden and Xi agreeing to resume military-to-military dialogue that accidents have the potential to spiral out of control, especially in the absence of open lines of communication between American and Chinese forces.\n\nFriday's meeting between Austin and Dong follows a phone call between the pair in April, and offers hope of further military talks to cool tensions.\n\nAustin's last significant interaction with a Chinese counterpart was in November 2022 when he met with Wei Fenghe in Cambodia.\n\nWei was subsequently replaced by Li Shangfu, who shook hands and spoke briefly with Austin at the Shangri-La Dialogue in 2023 but did not hold a formal meeting with him.\n\nAustin and Dong will give speeches this weekend at the Shangri-La Dialogue in which they are expected to touch on a range of their nations' pressure points.\n\nThe United States, increasingly worried about China's fast-developing military capabilities, has been strengthening its alliances and partnerships in the region to counter China's growing assertiveness over Taiwan and in the South China Sea.\n\nIn the meeting, Austin underscored the United States' commitment to the one China policy, but insisted that it would continue to \"fly, sail and operate\" wherever international law allowed, the Pentagon readout said.\n\nPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos, who has sought to deepen defence cooperation with the United States as he stands up to Chinese actions in waters off the Southeast Asia country, will deliver the Shangri-La Dialogue's keynote speech on Friday.", "source": {"uri": "bssnews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS)"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Is that a red line? Almost certainly.\"\n\n\"And we will respond accordingly,\" he added.\n\nChina and the Philippines both claims parts of the South China Sea, along with Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan.\n\nThe Philippines is a treaty ally of the United States.\n\nMarcos said that the US military presence in Southeast Asia was \"crucial to regional peace\" amid growing pressure from China.\n\nThe US has repeatedly said that it will defend the Philippines in the disputed maritime region. Just in April, the two countries conducted a joint military drill called the \"Balikatan exercise.\" The 2024 drills were the first to take place outside of Philippine territorial waters.\n\nEarlier on Friday, US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin met with China's Defense Minister Dong Jun on the sidelines of the summit, which has become a barometer for US-China relations in recent years.\n\nThe two nations will resume military-to-military communications \"in the coming months,\" Austin said.\n\nHe also welcomed plans for a \"crisis-communications working group\" with China by the end of the year, a statement released by the Pentagon said.\n\nAustin expressed concern about Chinese military activity near Taiwan, adding that China should not use Taiwan's political transition, \"part of a normal, routine democratic process,\" as a pretext for \"coercive measures,\" a Pentagon spokesperson said after the meeting.\n\nHe also underscored the importance of respect for freedom of navigation in the South China Sea.\n\nA Chinese defense spokesperson meanwhile called the talks \"positive, practical and constructive.\"\n\nHowever, in the meeting, China's Dong Jun told Austin that Washington's actions on Taiwan had seriously violated the One-China principle.\n\nDong further said that China was committed to resolving disagreements with the Philippines on the South China Sea but tolerance for provocations has a limit.\n\nTouching on the conflict in Ukraine, Dong told Austin that China held an \"impartial position.\"\n\n\"We have honored our commitment not to provide weapons to either side of the conflict. In accordance with laws and regulations, we have implemented strict controls on exports of military items,\" the spokesman said.\n\nDong also called on his US counterpart to help establish peace in the Middle East.\n\nAll eyes were on the ministers and their first substantive in-person interaction since 2022. The meeting offers hopes for more military dialogues between the superpowers on contentious issues like Taiwan and the South China Sea.\n\nJust a week ago, China held military drills around Taiwan and warned of war over the US-backed territory after President Lai Ching-te began his term in office. China has described him as a \"dangerous separatist.\"\n\nAustin is scheduled to deliver a speech at the forum on Saturday while Dong will speak on Sunday.\n\n\"China believes that high-level China-US strategic military communications help stabilize military-to-military relations; China maintains an open attitude towards this,\" Chinese Defense Ministry spokesperson Wu Qian said on Thursday.\n\nThe US and China have been making efforts to step up and keep communication lines open over the last several months, after relations between the two countries hit rock bottom in the last couple of years due to an alleged Chinese spy balloon, tensions over Taiwan and the Philippines, and China's support for Russia in its war in Ukraine. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Beijing and Shanghai last month.\n\nChina scrapped military communications with the United States in 2022 in response to then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan. The two sides finally agreed to a summit between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Biden in November of 2023.", "source": {"uri": "dw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deutsche Welle"}, "authors":

CHIEF Minister Datuk Seri Panglima Hajiji Noor's 2021 Hala Tuju Sabah Maju Jaya Plan and the Sabah Economic Development and Investment Authority (SEDIA) have laid out a road map to an exciting future for all Sabahans, with a target of increasing Sabah's income levels and GDP per capita from about RM 23,000 to about RM 40,000 by 2030.

Is that a red line? Almost certainly.\"\n\n\"And we will respond accordingly,\" he added.\n\nChina and the Philippines both claims parts of the South China Sea, along with Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan.\n\nThe Philippines is a treaty ally of the United States.\n\nMarcos said that the US military presence in Southeast Asia was \"crucial to regional peace\" amid growing pressure from China.\n\nThe US has repeatedly said that it will defend the Philippines in the disputed maritime region. Just in April, the two countries conducted a joint military drill called the \"Balikatan exercise.\" The 2024 drills were the first to take place outside of Philippine territorial waters.\n\nEarlier on Friday, US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin met with China's Defense Minister Dong Jun on the sidelines of the summit, which has become a barometer for US-China relations in recent years.\n\nThe two nations will resume military-to-military communications \"in the coming months,\" Austin said.\n\nHe also welcomed plans for a \"crisis-communications working group\" with China by the end of the year, a statement released by the Pentagon said.\n\nAustin expressed concern about Chinese military activity near Taiwan, adding that China should not use Taiwan's political transition, \"part of a normal, routine democratic process,\" as a pretext for \"coercive measures,\" a Pentagon spokesperson said after the meeting.\n\nHe also underscored the importance of respect for freedom of navigation in the South China Sea.\n\nA Chinese defense spokesperson meanwhile called the talks \"positive, practical and constructive.\"\n\nHowever, in the meeting, China's Dong Jun told Austin that Washington's actions on Taiwan had seriously violated the One-China principle.\n\nDong further said that China was committed to resolving disagreements with the Philippines on the South China Sea but tolerance for provocations has a limit.\n\nTouching on the conflict in Ukraine, Dong told Austin that China held an \"impartial position.\"\n\n\"We have honored our commitment not to provide weapons to either side of the conflict. In accordance with laws and regulations, we have implemented strict controls on exports of military items,\" the spokesman said.\n\nDong also called on his US counterpart to help establish peace in the Middle East.\n\nAll eyes were on the ministers and their first substantive in-person interaction since 2022. The meeting offers hopes for more military dialogues between the superpowers on contentious issues like Taiwan and the South China Sea.\n\nJust a week ago, China held military drills around Taiwan and warned of war over the US-backed territory after President Lai Ching-te began his term in office. China has described him as a \"dangerous separatist.\"\n\nAustin is scheduled to deliver a speech at the forum on Saturday while Dong will speak on Sunday.\n\n\"China believes that high-level China-US strategic military communications help stabilize military-to-military relations; China maintains an open attitude towards this,\" Chinese Defense Ministry spokesperson Wu Qian said on Thursday.\n\nThe US and China have been making efforts to step up and keep communication lines open over the last several months, after relations between the two countries hit rock bottom in the last couple of years due to an alleged Chinese spy balloon, tensions over Taiwan and the Philippines, and China's support for Russia in its war in Ukraine. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Beijing and Shanghai last month.\n\nChina scrapped military communications with the United States in 2022 in response to then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan. The two sides finally agreed to a summit between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Biden in November of 2023.", "source": {"uri": "dw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deutsche Welle"}, "authors":

It ends on June 2.", "source": {"uri": "staradvertiser.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Honolulu Star Advertiser"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@staradvertiser.com", "name": "Reuters", "type":

Defense chiefs from around the world are in attendance.\n\nAll eyes are on the ministers and their first substantive in-person interaction since 2022. The meeting offers hopes for more military dialogues between the superpowers on contentious issues like Taiwan and the South China Sea.\n\nJust a week ago, China held military drills around Taiwan and warned of war over the US-backed territory after President Lai Ching-te became President.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Beijing and Shanghai last month.\n\nChina scrapped military communications with the United States in 2022 in response to then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan. The two sides finally agreed to a summit between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Biden in November of 2023.\n\nThe event's spotlight is on Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr, who is likely to discuss the Philippines' legal and geopolitical claim on the South China Sea while speaking on the importance of the maritime region for global trade.\n\nChina has claimed sovereignty over the shoals and most of the South China Sea, including parts claimed by the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam.\n\nMeanwhile, the US has repeatedly said that it will defend the Philippines in the disputed maritime region. Just in April, the two countries conducted a joint military drill called the \"Balikatan exercise.\" The 2024 drills were the first to take place outside of Philippine territorial waters.", "source":

defence chiefs set to meet in Singapore", "body": "The US and Chinese defence chiefs were in Singapore on Friday for a major security forum where they are set to hold rare direct talks, with Taiwan and other flashpoint disputes expected to dominate the three-day event.\n\nThe meeting between the United States' Lloyd Austin and China's Dong Jun on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue will be the first substantive face-to-face talks between their countries' defence chiefs in 18 months.\n\nDefence chiefs and officials from around the world are attending the annual forum that has in recent years become a barometer of US-China relations.\n\nThis year's edition comes a week after China held military drills around Taiwan and warned of war over the US-backed island following the inauguration of President Lai Ching-te, who Beijing has described as a \"dangerous separatist\".\n\nThe dispute over democratic Taiwan, which Beijing considers part of its territory, tops the list of disputes between the rivals.\n\nBeijing is also furious over Washington's deepening defence ties in the Asia-Pacific, particularly with the Philippines, and its regular deployment of warships and fighter jets in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea.\n\nChina views this as part of a decades-long US effort to contain it.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's administration and China have been stepping up communication to ease friction between the nuclear-armed rivals, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken visiting Beijing and Shanghai last month.\n\nA key focus has been the resumption of military-to-military dialogue.\n\nMore from this section Sunak debates with Starmer, not Farage are the important ones, says Minister Cricket in uncharted territory as T20 World Cup starts in Texas Dick Schoof: Ex-security boss tapped for Dutch PM\n\nChina scrapped military communications with the United States in 2022 in response to then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan.\n\nTensions between Washington and Beijing were stoked further during 2023 by issues including an alleged Chinese spy balloon that was shot down over US airspace, a meeting between Taiwan's then president Tsai Ing-wen and Pelosi's successor Kevin McCarthy, and American military aid for Taipei.\n\nThe two sides agreed after a summit between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Biden in November last year to restart high-level military talks.\n\nThat includes a communications channel between the US Indo-Pacific Command chief and China's commanders responsible for military operations near Taiwan, Japan and in the South China Sea.\n\nChinese and American forces have had a series of close encounters in the disputed waterway that China claims almost entirely.\n\nAustin warned prior to Biden and Xi agreeing to resume military-to-military dialogue that accidents have the potential to spiral out of control, especially in the absence of open lines of communication between American and Chinese forces.\n\nThe meeting between Austin and Dong followed a phone call between the pair in April, and offered hopes of further military talks.\n\namj/cwl", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com",

meet in Singapore", "body": "SINGAPORE: The US and Chinese defence chiefs were in Singapore on Friday for a major security forum where they are set to hold rare direct talks, with Taiwan and other flashpoint disputes expected to dominate the three-day event.\n\nThe meeting between the United States' Lloyd Austin and China's Dong Jun on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue will be the first substantive face-to-face talks between their countries' defence chiefs in 18 months.\n\nDefence chiefs and officials from around the world are attending the annual forum that has in recent years become a barometer of US-China relations.\n\nThis year's edition comes a week after China held military drills around Taiwan and warned of war over the US-backed island following the inauguration of President Lai Ching-te, who Beijing has described as a \"dangerous separatist\".\n\nThe dispute over democratic Taiwan, which Beijing considers part of its territory, tops the list of disputes between the rivals.\n\nGet the latest news\n\ndelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\nBeijing is also furious over Washington's deepening defence ties in the Asia-Pacific, particularly with the Philippines, and its regular deployment of warships and fighter jets in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea.\n\nChina views this as part of a decades-long US effort to contain it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPresident Joe Biden's administration and China have been stepping up communication to ease friction between the nuclear-armed rivals, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken visiting Beijing and Shanghai last month.\n\nA key focus has been the resumption of military-to-military dialogue.\n\nChina scrapped military communications with the United States in 2022 in response to then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan.\n\nTensions between Washington and Beijing were stoked further during 2023 by issues including an alleged Chinese spy balloon that was shot down over US airspace, a meeting between Taiwan's then president Tsai Ing-wen and Pelosi's successor Kevin McCarthy, and American military aid for Taipei.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe two sides agreed after a summit between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Biden in November last year to restart high-level military talks.\n\nThat includes a communications channel between the US Indo-Pacific Command chief and China's commanders responsible for military operations near Taiwan, Japan and in the South China Sea.\n\nChinese and American forces have had a series of close encounters in the disputed waterway that China claims almost entirely.\n\nAustin warned prior to Biden and Xi agreeing to resume military-to-military dialogue that accidents have the potential to spiral out of control, especially in the absence of open lines of communication between American and Chinese forces.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe meeting between Austin and Dong followed a phone call between the pair in April, and offered hopes of further military talks.", "source": {"uri":

Since then, however, such unsafe manoeuvres involving the two countries have drastically decreased.\n\nAustin last had an in-person meeting with his Chinese counterpart in 2022, when he met China's defence minister at the time, Wei Fenghe. He spoke with Dong this year by phone.\n\nThe official said Austin would also bring up \"regional and global security issues\".\n\nThat includes rising maritime tensions in the South China Sea between Manila and Beijing, as the Philippines has accused China of using water cannons and blocking manoeuvres through disputed shoals and reefs.\n\nPhilippine President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr will deliver a keynote address on Friday night at the security summit in Singapore where he is expected to address those issues.\n\nChina claims sovereignty over the shoals and almost all the South China Sea, including parts claimed by the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam, despite a 2016 ruling by The Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration that found Beijing's sweeping claims have no legal basis.\n\nThe two defence leaders are also likely to discuss Taiwan. Austin will reiterate the United States' longstanding \"One China\" policy but also bring up China's military activities near Taiwan.\n\nLast week China ended two days of war games around Taiwan in which it simulated attacks with bombers and practiced boarding ships, exercises that Taiwan condemned as \"blatant provocation,\" detailing a surge of Chinese warplanes and warships.\n\nBeijing said the exercises were \"punishment\" for Taiwan President Lai Ching-te's inauguration speech, in which he said the two sides of the Taiwan Strait were \"not subordinate to each other\".\n\nThe United States is also increasingly concerned about China's support for Russia's war effort in Ukraine and have been closely watching for movement of weapons from Beijing to Moscow.\n\nExperts say that engagement between U.S. and Chinese military leaders is important to protect against miscommunication, but that a single meeting is unlikely to make major progress.\n\n\"I don't think that they're going to have much time to have any kind of substantive dialogue,\" said Derek Grossman, a Rand Corporation defence analyst. \"Those types of discussions usually happen when they are not sideline events to the main event.\"", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden",

Beijing calls Lai a \"separatist\".\n\nBoth sides, however, emphasised the importance of keeping military-to-military ties open, and a senior US defence official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the meeting marked an \"important step\" in opening lines of communication.\n\nThe official said Austin was \"firm but professional\" and also brought up China's nuclear, space and cyber developments.\n\nThe two sides also discussed the South China Sea and the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza.\n\nLater on Friday the spotlight shifts to Philippine President Ferdinand R Marcos Jr, who is expected to discuss the legal and geopolitical position of the Philippines on the South China Sea and note the importance of the waterway to global trade.\n\nChina claims sovereignty over almost all of the South China Sea, including parts claimed by the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam, despite a 2016 ruling by the Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration that found Beijing's sweeping claims have no legal basis.\n\nTaiwan's Defence Minister Wellington Koo told reporters in Taipei on Friday that increased tensions around the democratically governed island claimed by China as its own territory would diminish if Beijing's military drills ceased.\n\n\"If China stops its provocation and intimidation then peace and stability can be maintained,\" he said.\n\nThe region has seen a sharp uptick in such exercises in recent years, according to a report by the London-based International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS) released on Friday.\n\nAlthough both the United States and China have significantly increased the volume of military exercises across Asia, Beijing's drills still lag in scale and complexity, the study found.\n\nThe Shangri-La Dialogue, in its 21st iteration, is held every year in Singapore by IISS, gathering military and political leaders to discuss security issues. It ends on June 2.

The two discussed tensions in the Indo-Pacific region at the Shangri-La defence forum. The US emphasised freedom of navigation in the South China Sea. China accused the US of inflaming regional security. Both countries are restoring defence contacts and plan to resume military-to-military communications.US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met with his Chinese counterpart for more than an hour Friday, as the two countries seek to repair lines of communications between their militaries that could be critical as tensions continue to rise between the two in the Indo-Pacific region. The meeting behind closed doors with Chinese Defense Minister Dong Jun was the first in person for the top defense officials since contacts between the American and Chinese militaries broke down in 2022 after then-U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, infuriating Beijing.\n\nIt took place on the sidelines of the Shangri-La defense forum, Asia's premier security conference, which features defense officials, government leaders and diplomats from around the world.\n\nThe weekend talks are being held as wars rage in Gaza and Ukraine, and at a time of increasing tensions and competition for influence between the United States and China in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nBeijing in recent years has been rapidly expanding its navy and is becoming growingly assertive in pressing its claim to virtually the entire South China Sea, which has led to an increasing number of direct conflicts with other countries in the region, most notably the Philippines and Vietnam.\n\nThe US, meanwhile, has been ramping up military exercises in the region with its allies to underscore its \"free and open Indo-Pacific\" concept, meant to emphasize freedom of navigation through the contested waters, including the Taiwan Strait. China also claims the democratic self-governing island of Taiwan and has said it will not rule out using force to take it.\n\nAustin, who is due to address the conference on Saturday, reiterated the American position to Dong during their talks, according to Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder.\n\n\"The secretary made clear that the United States will continue to fly, sail, and operate - safely and responsibly - wherever international law allows,\" Ryder said. \"He underscored the importance of respect for high seas freedom of navigation guaranteed under international law, especially in the South China Sea.\"\n\nSince territorial hostilities with China surged last year in the South China Sea, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s administration has taken steps to forge new security alliances with a number of Asian and Western countries and allowed a US military presence in more Philippine bases under a 2014 defense pact.\n\nIn his talks with Austin, Dong accused the US of inflaming regional security by deploying medium-range missiles in the Philippines for the first time recently, and said the Philippines was being provocative toward China by pressing its own South China Sea claims, Chinese Defense Ministry spokesperson Wu Qian told reporters after the meeting.\n\nMarcos opens this year's conference, hosted by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, with a keynote address Friday.\n\nThis week, Marcos already expressed concerns over a new law issued by China giving its coast guard license to seize foreign ships \"that illegally enter China's territorial waters\" and to detain foreign crews for up to 60 days. The same law also made new reference to 2021 legislation that says China's coast guard can fire upon foreign ships if necessary.\n\nWith Philippines ships now regularly confronted by the Chinese, there are concerns that a low-level confrontation could lead to an escalation, said Eugene Tan, a professor of international law at the Singapore Management University.\n\n\"I don't think these countries are really looking to go to war with each other, but the concern with these skirmishes is that sometimes when you have a miscalculation, then things could rapidly deteriorate into the use of force,\" he said.\n\n\"And I think the last thing that countries in the region would want, particularly as they focus on the post-pandemic recovery, would be to have a regional conflict at the doorstep.\"\n\nThis year's conference comes just a week after China held massive military drills around Taiwan, staging a simulated blockade of the island after it inaugurated a new government that refuses to accept Beijing's insistence that the island is part of China.\n\nChina regards Taiwan as a renegade province that must come under its control, by force if necessary.\n\nThe US, like most countries, does not have formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan but is bound by its own laws to provide the island with the means to defend itself. Washington is Taiwan's biggest provider of military hardware and maintains a de facto embassy on the island to underscore their strong ties.\n\nIn his talks with Dong, Austin reiterated that the United States remains committed to the one-China policy, but \"expressed concern\" about the recent Chinese exercises, Ryder said.\n\nAustin told Dong that China \"should not use Taiwan's political transition - part of a normal, routine democratic process - as a pretext for coercive measures,\" Ryder said.\n\nChina has denounced American and British support for Taiwan's newly elected government, as well as the visit of a US congressional visit to meet with Taiwan's new leader, Lai Ching-te.\n\nDong brought up those concerns with Austin, telling him that he urged \"the US side to correct mistakes and abide by the one-China principle and to not, in any way, assist Taiwan independence by force,\" Wu Qian said.\n\nChina and the US have been gradually restoring defense contacts since they broke down over Pelosi's visit to Taiwan, and Austin and Dong already talked with each other by video conference in April.\n\nIn their meeting Friday, Austin emphasized the importance of keeping open lines of military-to-military communication and said \"both sides will resume telephone conversations between theater commanders in the coming months,\" Ryder said.\n\nWu Qian said this was an important step.\n\n\"The communications between the two militaries aims to enhance understanding, eliminate misunderstanding, accumulate mutual trust and achieve stability in relations,\" he said.\n\nMeia Nouwens, a Chinese security and defense expert with the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said that while the resumption of direct communications is important, talking is the minimum that should be expected of two great powers.\n\nDirect military communications are meant to allow commanders to defuse a situation before it escalates, but Nouwens cautioned it will only be effective if Chinese leaders give their commanders the \"political leeway to respond in the moment.\"\n\n\"We have to remember that there is a different political system in each of these two countries and therefore the commanders do not necessarily operate in the same way, or have the same level of political ability to make decisions in the moment or respond,\" she said.\n\nAustin is due to address the forum Saturday morning, while Dong will speak on Sunday, the final day.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors":

The fraught U.S.-China relationship is expected to loom over Asia's top security meeting, as are the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, and the South China Sea tensions.\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin arrived in Singapore early on Friday. He went into a meeting with China's defence minister, Dong Jun, in the afternoon that was to discuss contentious issues such as Taiwan and the South China Sea, but also the importance of keeping communications open, Pentagon officials said. Austin is scheduled to deliver a speech at the forum on Saturday; Dong will speak on Sunday.\n\n\"China believes that high level China-U.S. strategic military communications helps stabilise military to military relations; China maintains an open attitude towards this,\" Chinese defence ministry spokesperson Wu Qian said on Thursday. Friday night, however, the spotlight will be on Philippine President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr, who is expected to discuss the legal and geopolitical position of the Philippines on the South China Sea and note the importance of the waterway to global trade.\n\nChina claims sovereignty over the shoals and almost all of the South China Sea, including parts claimed by the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam, despite a 2016 ruling by the Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration that found Beijing's sweeping claims have no legal basis. Dong and Austin are likely to discuss those issues, as well as Taiwan. Austin will reiterate the United States' longstanding \"One China\" policy but also bring up China's military activities near Taiwan, which recently inaugurated its new president, Lai Ching-te, the Pentagon officials said.\n\nTaiwan's Defence Minister Wellington Koo told reporters in Taipei on Friday that increased tensions around the democratically governed island claimed by China as its own territory would diminish if Beijing's military drills ceased. \"If China stops its provocation and intimidation then peace and stability can be maintained,\" he said.\n\nThe region has seen a sharp uptick in such exercises in recent years, according to a report by the London-based International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS) released on Friday. Although both the United States and China have significantly increased the volume of military exercises across Asia, Beijing's drills still lag in scale and complexity, the study found.\n\nThe security forum, in its 21st iteration, is held every year in Singapore by IISS, gathering military and political leaders to discuss security issues. It ends on June 2.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd_Austin", "type":

The U.S. criticized Chinese military activities near Taiwan, while China warned against U.S. interference. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. condemned China's actions in the South China Sea. The conference also discussed Ukraine and Gaza conflicts.\n\nThe U.S. and Chinese defence chiefs locked horns on Taiwan in their first face-to-face meeting in two years on Friday, while Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr slammed \"illegal, coercive actions\" in the South China Sea, a clear censure of Beijing.\n\nThe exchanges at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, Asia's biggest defence forum, came amid reports that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy would fly in to attend the meeting\n\non Saturday. He is expected to try to drum up support for a Ukraine peace conference to be hosted by Switzerland in mid-June. Russia has not been invited and China has confirmed it will\n\nnot attend .\n\nZelenskiy has urged U.S. President Joe Biden to attend, but Washington has not confirmed who it will send. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and China's defence minister, Dong Jun, met on the sidelines of the Singapore conference earlier in the day, reiterating their differences on Taiwan and other issues but emphasising the need to keep military-to-military communications open.\n\nAustin expressed concern about Chinese military activity near Taiwan, including after the island's presidential election and the inauguration of President Lai Ching-te this month, U.S. Air Force Major General Patrick Ryder said in a statement. \"The secretary expressed concern about recent provocative PLA activity around the Taiwan Strait, and he reiterated that the PRC should not use Taiwan's political transition - part of a normal, routine democratic process - as a pretext for coercive measures,\" Ryder said after the 75-minute meeting.\n\nHe was referring to the People's Liberation Army and the People's Republic of China. Dong warned Austin that the U.S. should not interfere in China's affairs with Taiwan, defence ministry spokesperson Wu Qian told reporters. China claims the democratically governed island as its own territory.\n\nThe U.S. approach to Taiwan violates commitments made by the United States and sends the wrong signal to \"separatist forces\" in Taiwan, the spokesperson quoted Dong as saying. Beijing calls the new president, Lai, a \"separatist\". A senior U.S. defence official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the meeting marked an \"important step\" in opening lines of communication.\n\nThe official said Austin was \"firm but professional\" and also brought up China's nuclear, space and cyber developments. The two sides also discussed the South China Sea and the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza.\n\nSOUTH CHINA SEA DISPUTE Marcos, making a keynote address at the meeting, said that the Philippines and other Southeast Asian countries had a vision for \"peace, stability, and prosperity\" in the disputed South China Sea, but that this was being undermined by other actors, although he did not name China.\n\n\"Illegal, coercive, aggressive, and deceptive actions continue to violate our sovereignty, sovereign rights, and jurisdiction,\" Marcos said. Encounters between the Philippines and China in Asia's most contested waters have grown more tense and frequent over the past year as Beijing presses its claims on shoals sitting in waters that Manila says are well within its territory.\n\nChina's coast guard has stepped up so-called \"grey-zone\" activities such as use of water cannons, collisions and ramming tactics to try to stop the Philippines patrolling and resupplying its troops. The Philippines' dispute with China coincides with an increase in its security engagements with the United States under Marcos, including expansion of U.S. access to Philippine bases. The U.S. and the Philippines are treaty allies.\n\nMarcos, however, underlined that both Beijing and Washington had a major role in keeping peace in the region. \"The continued stability of this region requires China and the United States to manage their rivalry in a responsible manner,\" he said. \"Their contest is exacerbating flashpoints\n\nand has created new security dilemmas.\" China claims sovereignty over almost all of the South China Sea, including parts claimed by the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam.\n\nTaiwan Defence Minister Wellington Koo told reporters in Taipei on Friday that increased tensions around the island would diminish if Beijing's military drills there ceased. \"If China stops its provocation and intimidation then peace and stability can be maintained,\" he said.\n\nThe region has seen a sharp uptick in such exercises in recent years, according to a report by the London-based International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS) released on Friday. Although both the United States and China have significantly increased the volume of military exercises across Asia, Beijing's drills still lag in scale and complexity, the study found.\n\nThe Shangri-La Dialogue, in its 21st iteration, is held every year in Singapore by IISS, gathering military and political leaders to discuss security issues. Austin addresses the meeting on Saturday and Dong on Sunday. Indonesia's President-elect Prabowo Subianto is scheduled to speak to delegates on Saturday.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

Their talks, held at the Shangri-La defense forum, addressed recent confrontations, naval expansions, and the delicate situation surrounding Taiwan.\n\nUS Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met with his Chinese counterpart for more than an hour Friday, as the two countries seek to repair lines of communications between their militaries that could be critical as tensions continue to rise between the two in the Indo-Pacific region. The meeting behind closed doors with Chinese Defense Minister Dong Jun was the first in person for the top defense officials since contacts between the American and Chinese militaries broke down in 2022 after then-U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, infuriating Beijing.\n\nIt took place on the sidelines of the Shangri-La defense forum, Asia's premier security conference, which features defense officials, government leaders and diplomats from around the world.\n\nThe weekend talks are being held as wars rage in Gaza and Ukraine, and at a time of increasing tensions and competition for influence between the United States and China in the Indo-Pacific region. Beijing in recent years has been rapidly expanding its navy and is becoming growingly assertive in pressing its claim to virtually the entire South China Sea, which has led to an increasing number of direct conflicts with other countries in the region, most notably the Philippines and Vietnam. The US, meanwhile, has been ramping up military exercises in the region with its allies to underscore its \"free and open Indo-Pacific\" concept, meant to emphasize freedom of navigation through the contested waters, including the Taiwan Strait. China also claims the democratic self-governing island of Taiwan and has said it will not rule out using force to take it. Austin, who is due to address the conference on Saturday, reiterated the American position to Dong during their talks, according to Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder. \"The secretary made clear that the United States will continue to fly, sail, and operate -- safely and responsibly -- wherever international law allows,\" Ryder said. \"He underscored the importance of respect for high seas freedom of navigation guaranteed under international law, especially in the South China Sea.\" Since territorial hostilities with China surged last year in the South China Sea, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s administration has taken steps to forge new security alliances with a number of Asian and Western countries and allowed a US military presence in more Philippine bases under a 2014 defense pact. In his talks with Austin, Dong accused the US of inflaming regional security by deploying medium-range missiles in the Philippines for the first time recently, and said the Philippines was being provocative toward China by pressing its own South China Sea claims, Chinese Defense Ministry spokesperson Wu Qian told reporters after the meeting.\n\nMarcos opens this year's conference, hosted by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, with a keynote address Friday. This week, Marcos already expressed concerns over a new law issued by China giving its coast guard license to seize foreign ships \"that illegally enter China's territorial waters\" and to detain foreign crews for up to 60 days. The same law also made new reference to 2021 legislation that says China's coast guard can fire upon foreign ships if necessary.\n\nWith Philippines ships now regularly confronted by the Chinese, there are concerns that a low-level confrontation could lead to an escalation, said Eugene Tan, a professor of international law at the Singapore Management University.\n\n\"I don't think these countries are really looking to go to war with each other, but the concern with these skirmishes is that sometimes when you have a miscalculation, then things could rapidly deteriorate into the use of force,\" he said. \"And I think the last thing that countries in the region would want, particularly as they focus on the post-pandemic recovery, would be to have a regional conflict at the doorstep.\" This year's conference comes just a week after China held massive military drills around Taiwan, staging a simulated blockade of the island after it inaugurated a new government that refuses to accept Beijing's insistence that the island is part of China. China regards Taiwan as a renegade province that must come under its control, by force if necessary. The US, like most countries, does not have formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan but is bound by its own laws to provide the island with the means to defend itself. Washington is Taiwan's biggest provider of military hardware and maintains a de facto embassy on the island to underscore their strong ties. In his talks with Dong, Austin reiterated that the United States remains committed to the one-China policy, but \"expressed concern\" about the recent Chinese exercises, Ryder said. Austin told Dong that China \"should not use Taiwan's political transition -- part of a normal, routine democratic process -- as a pretext for coercive measures,\" Ryder said.\n\nChina has denounced American and British support for Taiwan's newly elected government, as well as the visit of a US congressional visit to meet with Taiwan's new leader, Lai Ching-te.\n\nDong brought up those concerns with Austin, telling him that he urged \"the US side to correct mistakes and abide by the one-China principle and to not, in any way, assist Taiwan independence by force,\" Wu Qian said. China and the US have been gradually restoring defense contacts since they broke down over Pelosi's visit to Taiwan, and Austin and Dong already talked with each other by video conference in April. In their meeting Friday, Austin emphasized the importance of keeping open lines of military-to-military communication and said \"both sides will resume telephone conversations between theater commanders in the coming months,\" Ryder said.\n\nWu Qian said this was an important step. \"The communications between the two militaries aims to enhance understanding, eliminate misunderstanding, accumulate mutual trust and achieve stability in relations,\" he said. Meia Nouwens, a Chinese security and defense expert with the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said that while the resumption of direct communications is important, talking is the minimum that should be expected of two great powers. Direct military communications are meant to allow commanders to defuse a situation before it escalates, but Nouwens cautioned it will only be effective if Chinese leaders give their commanders the \"political leeway to respond in the moment.\" \"We have to remember that there is a different political system in each of these two countries and therefore the commanders do not necessarily operate in the same way, or have the same level of political ability to make decisions in the moment or respond,\" she said.\n\nAustin is due to address the forum Saturday morning, while Dong will speak on Sunday, the final day.(AP) RUP RUP\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news",

Gen. Patrick Ryder, said in a statement, referring to the People's Republic of China.\n\nA senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters that the meeting marked an \"important step\" in opening lines of communication.\n\nThe official said Austin also brought up China's nuclear, space and cyber developments.\n\nDong is the third Chinese defense minister - after Li Shangfu and Wei Fenghe - that Austin has seen in three consecutive years at the Shangri-La Dialogue as secretary of defense, but the second minister that he's held talks with as Li declined the offer of a meeting in 2023.\n\nThe two defense chiefs had a conversation via video last month to discuss bilateral relations, as well as regional and global security issues.\n\nMilitary ties between China and the U.S. have been fraught with problems that show no sign of abating as Beijing ramps up aggression against the democratic island of Taiwan and the Philippines in the South China Sea.\n\nThe U.S., at the same time, has also been holding military exercises with allies in the region to emphasize its \"free and open Indo-Pacific\" doctrine.\n\nAnalysts said that the Dong-Austin meeting, the first in-person talks between defense chiefs since 2022, indicates an attempt to restore communication and mend ties by both sides, but they had very low expectations for much more.\n\nLyle Goldstein, director of Asia Engagement at Defense Priorities, a U.S. think tank, told RFA that he had long advocated for \"more sustained, widespread, longer and deeper engagement between the U.S. and Chinese military establishments.\"\n\n\"But what we have now is very narrow, only at the very top level, and extremely brief,\" he said. \"It's better than a handshake, but not by much.\"\n\n\"Such 'in the spotlight' engagements also tend to push the already truncated meetings into 'gotcha' moments where leaders aim for soundbites to impress the audience at home,\" said Golstein, a China expert who spent 20 years at the U.S. Naval War College.\n\nFriction points\n\nBoth Austin and Dong plan to speak at the Shangri-La Dialogue to outline their countries' approaches to global and regional security.\n\nAustin is due to speak on Saturday and Dong on Sunday.\n\nThe Chinese admiral, who took office in December after a major shake-up at China's ministry of national defense, is expected to take a tougher stance against \"trouble-stirring by countries from outside the region,\" according to Chinese media.\n\nOnn Thursday, a ministry spokesperson condemned the U.S. deployment of an intermediate range missile system during recent Balikatan military drills in the Philippines, saying it brought risk of war in the region.\n\n\"There are a host of friction points between the U.S. and China on the security front, the most prominent of which include Taiwan, the South China Sea, and Ukraine,\" said Alexander Vuving, professor at the Daniel K. Inouye Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies in Hawaii.\n\nIn Vuving's opinion, both China and the U.S. would seek to use the Shangri-La Dialogue to \"strike the weak points of the other.\"\n\n\"China will likely portray the U.S. as an interventionist that stirs up tensions everywhere it gets involved, from Taiwan to the South China Sea to Ukraine to Gaza,\" the political scientist said.\n\n\"The U.S. will heavily criticize China's coercive actions, especially over Taiwan and in the South China Sea. It may also criticize China's non-transparent practice regarding Ukraine and bases in Cambodia,\" he added.\n\nDuring the teleconference in April, the Pentagon chief \"underscored the importance of respect for high seas freedom of navigation guaranteed under international law, especially in the South China Sea\" to his Chinese counterpart.\n\nThe Shangri-La Dialogue, held by the International Institute for Strategic Studies since 2002, has become a major platform for government officials and security experts to discuss regional security.\n\nChinese experts, however, take a dim view of the forum. China's state-run tabloid Global Times quoted unidentified analysts as saying that while the conference presented opportunities for Beijing to set the record straight, \"it could also be a stage where Western countries use to launch malicious accusations against China.\"\n\nPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. is expected to deliver a keynote speech on Friday evening, in which he will talk about the South China Sea and other challenges that his country faces.", "source": {"uri": "rfa.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Radio Free Asia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

China also claims the democratic self-governing island of Taiwan and has said it will not rule out using force to take it.\n\nAustin, who is due to address the conference on Saturday, reiterated the American position to Dong during their talks, according to Pentagon spokesperson Major General Pat Ryder.\n\n\"The secretary made clear that the United States will continue to fly, sail, and operate -- safely and responsibly -- wherever international law allows,\" Ryder said. \"He underscored the importance of respect for high seas freedom of navigation guaranteed under international law, especially in the South China Sea.\"\n\nSince territorial hostilities with China surged last year in the South China Sea, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s administration has taken steps to forge new security alliances with a number of Asian and Western countries and allowed a U.S. military presence in more Philippine bases under a 2014 defense pact.\n\nIn his talks with Austin, Dong accused the U.S. of inflaming regional security by deploying medium-range missiles in the Philippines for the first time recently, and said the Philippines was being provocative toward China by pressing its own South China Sea claims, Chinese Defense Ministry spokesperson Wu Qian told reporters after the meeting.\n\nThe Philippine president opened this year's conference, hosted by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, with a keynote address Friday.\n\nThis week, Marcos already expressed concerns over a new law issued by China giving its coast guard license to seize foreign ships \"that illegally enter China's territorial waters\" and to detain foreign crews for up to 60 days. The same law also made new reference to 2021 legislation that says China's coast guard can fire upon foreign ships if necessary.\n\nWith Philippines ships now regularly confronted by the Chinese, there are concerns that a low-level confrontation could lead to an escalation, said Eugene Tan, a professor of international law at the Singapore Management University.\n\n\"I don't think these countries are really looking to go to war with each other, but the concern with these skirmishes is that sometimes when you have a miscalculation, then things could rapidly deteriorate into the use of force,\" he said.\n\n\"And I think the last thing that countries in the region would want, particularly as they focus on the post-pandemic recovery, would be to have a regional conflict at the doorstep.\"\n\nThis year's conference comes just a week after China held massive military drills around Taiwan, staging a simulated blockade of the island after it inaugurated a new government that refuses to accept Beijing's insistence that the island is part of China.\n\nChina regards Taiwan as a renegade province that must come under its control, by force if necessary.\n\nThe United States, like most countries, does not have formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan but is bound by its own laws to provide the island with the means to defend itself. Washington is Taiwan's biggest provider of military hardware and maintains a de facto embassy on the island to underscore their strong ties.\n\nIn his talks with Dong, Austin reiterated that the United States remains committed to the one-China policy, but \"expressed concern\" about the recent Chinese exercises, Ryder said.\n\nAustin told Dong that China \"should not use Taiwan's political transition -- part of a normal, routine democratic process -- as a pretext for coercive measures,\" Ryder said.\n\nChina has denounced American and British support for Taiwan's newly elected government, as well as the visit of a U.S. congressional delegation to meet with Taiwan's new president, Lai Ching-te.\n\nDong brought up those concerns with Austin, telling him that he urged \"the U.S. side to correct mistakes and abide by the one-China principle and to not, in any way, assist Taiwan independence by force,\" Wu Qian said.\n\nChina and the U.S. have been gradually restoring defense contacts since they broke down over Pelosi's visit to Taiwan, and Austin and Dong already talked with each other by video conference in April.\n\nIn their meeting Friday, Austin emphasized the importance of keeping open lines of military-to-military communication and said \"both sides will resume telephone conversations between theater commanders in the coming months,\" Ryder said.\n\nWu said this was an important step.\n\n\"The communications between the two militaries aims to enhance understanding, eliminate misunderstanding, accumulate mutual trust and achieve stability in relations,\" he said.\n\nMeia Nouwens, a Chinese security and defense expert with the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said that while the resumption of direct communications is important, talking is the minimum that should be expected of two great powers.\n\nDirect military communications are meant to allow commanders to defuse a situation before it escalates, but Nouwens cautioned it will only be effective if Chinese leaders give their commanders the \"political leeway to respond in the moment.\"\n\n\"We have to remember that there is a different political system in each of these two countries and therefore the commanders do not necessarily operate in the same way, or have the same level of political ability to make decisions in the moment or respond,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "thediplomat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Diplomat Magazine"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pacific", "type": "wiki",

Since then, however, such unsafe manoeuvres involving the two countries have drastically decreased.\n\nAustin last had an in-person meeting with his Chinese counterpart in 2022, when he met China's defence minister at the time, Wei Fenghe. He spoke with Dong this year by phone.\n\nThe official said Austin would also bring up \"regional and global security issues\".\n\nThat includes rising maritime tensions in the South China Sea between Manila and Beijing, as the Philippines has accused China of using water cannons and blocking manoeuvres through disputed shoals and reefs.\n\nPhilippine President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr will deliver a keynote address on Friday night at the security summit in Singapore where he is expected to address those issues.\n\nChina claims sovereignty over the shoals and almost all the South China Sea, including parts claimed by the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam, despite a 2016 ruling by The Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration that found Beijing's sweeping claims have no legal basis.\n\nThe two defence leaders are also likely to discuss Taiwan. Austin will reiterate the United States' longstanding \"One China\" policy but also bring up China's military activities near Taiwan.\n\nLast week China ended two days of war games around Taiwan in which it simulated attacks with bombers and practiced boarding ships, exercises that Taiwan condemned as \"blatant provocation,\" detailing a surge of Chinese warplanes and warships.\n\nBeijing said the exercises were \"punishment\" for Taiwan President Lai Ching-te's inauguration speech, in which he said the two sides of the Taiwan Strait were \"not subordinate to each other\".\n\nThe United States is also increasingly concerned about China's support for Russia's war effort in Ukraine and have been closely watching for movement of weapons from Beijing to Moscow.\n\nExperts say that engagement between U.S. and Chinese military leaders is important to protect against miscommunication, but that a single meeting is unlikely to make major progress.\n\n\"I don't think that they're going to have much time to have any kind of substantive dialogue,\" said Derek Grossman, a Rand Corporation defence analyst. \"Those types of discussions usually happen when they are not sideline events to the main event.\"\n\n(Reporting by Idrees Ali.

The Philippines' president was to give a speech at the meeting later in the day that was expected to touch on sensitive South China Sea claims.\n\nThe U.S.-China relationship is expected to loom over the dialogue, as are the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, and the South China Sea tensions.\n\nDuring the meeting with Dong, Austin expressed concern about Chinese military activity near Taiwan, including after the island's presidential election and the inauguration of President Lai Ching-te this month, U.S. Air Force Major General Patrick Ryder said in a statement.\n\n\"The secretary expressed concern about recent provocative PLA activity around the Taiwan Strait, and he reiterated that the PRC should not use Taiwan's political transition - part of a normal, routine democratic process - as a pretext for coercive measures,\" Ryder said after the 75-minute meeting.\n\nHe was referring to the People's Liberation Army and the People's Republic of China.\n\nDong warned Austin that the U.S. should not interfere in China's affairs with Taiwan, defence ministry spokesperson Wu Qian told reporters.\n\nThe U.S. approach to Taiwan violates commitments made by the United States and sends the wrong signal to \"separatist forces\" in Taiwan, the spokesperson quoted Dong as saying. Beijing calls Lai a \"separatist\".\n\nBoth sides, however, emphasised the importance of keeping military-to-military ties open, and a senior U.S. defence official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the meeting marked an \"important step\" in opening lines of communication.\n\nThe official said Austin was \"firm but professional\" and also brought up China's nuclear, space and cyber developments.\n\nThe two sides also discussed the South China Sea and the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza.\n\nLater on Friday the spotlight shifts to Philippine President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr, who is expected to discuss the legal and geopolitical position of the Philippines on the South China Sea and note the importance of the waterway to global trade.\n\nChina claims sovereignty over almost all of the South China Sea, including parts claimed by the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam, despite a 2016 ruling by the Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration that found Beijing's sweeping claims have no legal basis.\n\nTaiwan's Defence Minister Wellington Koo told reporters in Taipei on Friday that increased tensions around the democratically governed island claimed by China as its own territory would diminish if Beijing's military drills ceased.\n\n\"If China stops its provocation and intimidation then peace and stability can be maintained,\" he said.\n\nThe region has seen a sharp uptick in such exercises in recent years, according to a report by the London-based International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS) released on Friday.\n\nAlthough both the United States and China have significantly increased the volume of military exercises across Asia, Beijing's drills still lag in scale and complexity, the study found.\n\nThe Shangri-La Dialogue, in its 21st iteration, is held every year in Singapore by IISS, gathering military and political leaders to discuss security issues. It ends on June 2.\n\n(Reporting by Idrees Ali and Xinghui Kok in Singapore and Ben Blanchard in Taipei; Writing by Gerry Doyle; Editing by Jamie Freed and Raju Gopalakrishnan)", "source": {"uri":

China also claims the democratic self-governing island of Taiwan and has said it would not rule out using force to take it.\n\nAustin, who is due to address the conference on Saturday, reiterated the American position to Dong during their talks, according to Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder.\n\n\"The secretary made clear that the United States will continue to fly, sail, and operate -- safely and responsibly -- wherever international law allows,\" Ryder said. \"He underscored the importance of respect for high seas freedom of navigation guaranteed under international law, especially in the South China Sea.\"\n\nSince territorial hostilities with China surged last year in the South China Sea, Marcos Jr.'s administration has taken steps to forge new security alliances with a number of Asian and Western countries and allowed a U.S. military presence in more Philippine bases under a 2014 defense pact.\n\nMarcos opened this year's conference, hosted by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, with his keynote address. He restated concerns over a new law issued by China giving its coast guard license to seize foreign ships \"that illegally enter China's territorial waters\" and to detain foreign crews for up to 60 days. The same law also made new reference to 2021 legislation that says China's coast guard can fire upon foreign ships if necessary.\n\n\"Attempts to apply domestic laws and regulation beyond one's territory and jurisdiction violate international law, exacerbate tensions and undermine regional peace and security,\" Marcos said, without naming China.\n\nWith Philippines ships now regularly confronted by the Chinese, there are concerns that a low-level confrontation could lead to an escalation, said Eugene Tan, a professor of international law at the Singapore Management University.\n\n\"I don't think these countries are really looking to go to war with each other, but the concern with these skirmishes is that sometimes when you have a miscalculation, then things could rapidly deteriorate into the use of force,\" he said.\n\n\"And I think the last thing that countries in the region would want, particularly as they focus on the post-pandemic recovery, would be to have a regional conflict at the doorstep.\"\n\nThis year's conference comes just a week after China held massive military drills around Taiwan, staging a simulated blockade of the island after it inaugurated a new government that refuses to accept Beijing's insistence that the island is part of China.\n\nChina regards Taiwan as a renegade province that must come under its control, by force if necessary.\n\nThe U.S., like most countries, does not have formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan but is bound by its own laws to provide the island with the means to defend itself.\n\nIn his talks with Dong, Austin reiterated that the United States remains committed to the one-China policy, but \"expressed concern\" about the recent Chinese exercises, Ryder said.\n\nAustin told Dong that China \"should not use Taiwan's political transition -- part of a normal, routine democratic process -- as a pretext for coercive measures,\" Ryder said.\n\nChina and the U.S. have been gradually restoring defense contacts since they broke down over Pelosi's visit to Taiwan, and Austin and Dong already talked with each other by video conference in April.\n\nIn their meeting Friday, Austin emphasized the importance of keeping open lines of military-to-military communication between American and Chinese commanders, and said \"both sides will resume telephone conversations between theater commanders in the coming months,\" Ryder said.\n\nChinese Defense Ministry spokesperson Wu Qian told reporters after the meeting that it showed the decline in military relations had now stabilized and that the resumption of direct communications was an important step.\n\n\"The communications between the two militaries aims to enhance understanding, eliminate misunderstanding, accumulate mutual trust and achieve stability in relations,\" he said.\n\nMeia Nouwens, a Chinese security and defense expert with the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said that while the resumption of direct communications is important, talking is the minimum that should be expected of two great powers.\n\nDirect military communications will only be effective if Chinese leaders give their commanders the \"political leeway to respond in the moment,\" Nouwens cautioned.\n\n\"We have to remember that there is a different political system in each of these two countries and therefore the commanders do not necessarily operate in the same way, or have the same level of political ability to make decisions in the moment or respond,\" she said.\n\nAustin is due to address the forum Saturday morning, while Dong will speak on Sunday, the final day.\n\n___\n\nAP journalists Syawalludin Zain in Singapore, Jim Gomez in Manila, Philippines and Tara Copp in Washington contributed to this story.", "source":

The dialogue is crucial as tensions rise in the Indo-Pacific, aiming to prevent miscalculations that could escalate conflicts.\n\nUS Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met with his Chinese counterpart for more than an hour Friday, as the two countries seek to repair lines of communications between their militaries that could be critical as tensions continue to rise between the two in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nThe meeting behind closed doors between Austin and Chinese Defense Minister Dong Jun was the first in person between the top defense officials since contacts between the American and Chinese militaries broke down in 2022 after then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, infuriating Beijing.\n\nIt came on the sidelines of the Shangri-La defense forum, Asia's premier security conference, which features defense officials, government leaders and diplomats from around the world.\n\nThe weekend talks are being held as wars rage in Gaza and Ukraine, and at a time of increasing tensions and competition for influence between the United States and China in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nBeijing in recent years has been rapidly expanding its navy and is becoming growingly assertive in pressing its claim to virtually the entire South China Sea, which has led to an increasing number of direct conflicts with other countries in the region, most notably the Philippines and Vietnam.\n\nThe US, meantime, has been ramping up military exercises in the region with its allies to underscore its \"free and open Indo-Pacific\" concept, meant to emphasize freedom of navigation through the contested waters, including the Taiwan Strait. China also claims the democratic self-governing island of Taiwan and has said it would not rule out using force to take it.\n\nAustin, who is due to address the conference on Saturday, reiterated the American position to Dong during their talks, according to Pentagon spokesperson Maj Gen Pat Ryder.\n\n\"The secretary made clear that the United States will continue to fly, sail, and operate -- safely and responsibly -- wherever international law allows,\" Ryder said. \"He underscored the importance of respect for high seas freedom of navigation guaranteed under international law, especially in the South China Sea.\" Since territorial hostilities with China surged last year in the South China Sea, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr's administration has taken steps to forge new security alliances with a number of Asian and Western countries and allowed a US military presence in more Philippine bases under a 2014 defense pact.\n\nMarcos opens this year's conference, hosted by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, with a keynote address Friday.\n\nThis week, Marcos already expressed concerns over a new law issued by China giving its coast guard license to seize foreign ships \"that illegally enter China's territorial waters\" and to detain foreign crews for up to 60 days. The same law also made new reference to 2021 legislation that says China's coast guard can fire upon foreign ships if necessary.\n\nWith Philippines ships now regularly confronted by the Chinese, there are concerns that a low-level confrontation could lead to an escalation, said Eugene Tan, a professor of international law at the Singapore Management University.\n\n\"I don't think these countries are really looking to go to war with each other, but the concern with these skirmishes is that sometimes when you have a miscalculation, then things could rapidly deteriorate into the use of force,\" he said.\n\n\"And I think the last thing that countries in the region would want, particularly as they focus on the post-pandemic recovery, would be to have a regional conflict at the doorstep.\" This year's conference comes just a week after China held massive military drills around Taiwan, staging a simulated blockade of the island after it inaugurated a new government that refuses to accept Beijing's insistence that the island is part of China.\n\nChina regards Taiwan as a renegade province that must come under its control, by force if necessary.\n\nThe US, like most countries, does not have formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan but is bound by its own laws to provide the island with the means to defend itself.\n\nIn his talks with Dong, Austin reiterated that the United States remains committed to the one-China policy, but \"expressed concern\" about the recent Chinese exercises, Ryder said.\n\nAustin told Dong that China \"should not use Taiwan's political transition -- part of a normal, routine democratic process -- as a pretext for coercive measures,\" Ryder said.\n\nChina and the US have been gradually restoring defense contacts since they broke down over Pelosi's visit to Taiwan, and Austin and Dong already talked with each other by video conference in April.\n\nIn their meeting Friday, Austin emphasized the importance of keeping open lines of military-to-military communication between American and Chinese commanders, and said \"both sides will resume telephone conversations between theater commanders in the coming months,\" Ryder said.\n\nChinese Defense Ministry spokesperson Wu Qian told reporters after the meeting that it showed the decline in military relations had now stabilized and that the resumption of direct communications was an important step.\n\n\"The communications between the two militaries aims to enhance understanding, eliminate misunderstanding, accumulate mutual trust and achieve stability in relations,\" he said.\n\nMeia Nouwens, a Chinese security and defense expert with the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said that while the resumption of direct communications is important, talking is the minimum that should be expected of two great powers.\n\nDirect military communications are meant to allow commanders to defuse a situation before it escalates, but Nouwens cautioned it will only be effective if Chinese leaders give their commanders the \"political leeway to respond in the moment.\" \"We have to remember that there is a different political system in each of these two countries and therefore the commanders do not necessarily operate in the same way, or have the same level of political ability to make decisions in the moment or respond,\" she said.\n\nAustin is due to address the forum Saturday morning, while Dong will speak on Sunday, the final day.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a

The meeting will occur during the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore and aims to emphasize the importance of military communications.\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin will meet with his Chinese counterpart on Friday for the first time since 2022 to discuss contentious issues such as Taiwan and the South China Sea, but also the importance of communicating, Pentagon officials said.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping have sought to manage tensions, and in November the two leaders agreed to resume direct military talks. Since then the two sides' militaries have held discussions, but Austin's meeting with Minister Dong Jun on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore will be the most senior in-person engagement on military matters since Biden and Xi met.\n\n\"The secretary is going to again emphasise the importance of continuing military to military communications, talking to each other not just when things are relatively calm, but it's especially important to talk when we have differences on important issues,\" said a senior U.S. defence official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. The Shangri-La Dialogue security summit in Singapore runs from Friday to Sunday, and both Austin and Dong will deliver remarks.\n\nIn October, the U.S. military said Chinese military aircraft had carried out risky or reckless manoeuvres close to U.S. aircraft nearly 200 times since 2021. Since then, however, such unsafe manoeuvres involving the two countries have drastically decreased. Austin last had an in-person meeting with his Chinese counterpart in 2022, when he met China's defence minister at the time, Wei Fenghe. He spoke with Dong this year by phone.\n\nThe official said Austin would also bring up \"regional and global security issues\". That includes rising maritime tensions in the South China Sea between Manila and Beijing, as the Philippines has accused China of using water cannons and blocking manoeuvres through disputed shoals and reefs.\n\nPhilippine President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr will deliver a keynote address on Friday night at the security summit in Singapore where he is expected to address those issues. China claims sovereignty over the shoals and almost all the South China Sea, including parts claimed by the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam, despite a 2016 ruling by The Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration that found Beijing's sweeping claims have no legal basis.\n\nThe two defence leaders are also likely to discuss Taiwan. Austin will reiterate the United States' longstanding \"One China\" policy but also bring up China's military activities near Taiwan. Last week China ended two days of war games around Taiwan in which it simulated attacks with bombers and practiced boarding ships, exercises that Taiwan condemned as \"blatant provocation,\" detailing a surge of Chinese warplanes and warships.\n\nBeijing said the exercises were \"punishment\" for Taiwan President Lai Ching-te's inauguration speech, in which he said the two sides of the Taiwan Strait were \"not subordinate to each other\". The United States is also increasingly concerned about China's support for Russia's war effort in Ukraine and have been closely watching for movement of weapons from Beijing to Moscow.\n\nExperts say that engagement between U.S. and Chinese military leaders is important to protect against miscommunication, but that a single meeting is unlikely to make major progress. \"I don't think that they're going to have much time to have any kind of substantive dialogue,\" said Derek Grossman, a Rand Corporation defence analyst. \"Those types of discussions usually happen when they are not sideline events to the main event.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Key discussions include the South China Sea dispute, Taiwan, and military communications. Philippine President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. will highlight the South China Sea's significance to global trade and regional stability.\n\nThe Shangri-La Dialogue summit began on Friday as U.S. and China defence chiefs prepared for their first face-to-face meeting in two years and the Philippines' president was set to give a speech expected to touch on sensitive South China Sea claims.\n\nThe fraught U.S.-China relationship is expected to loom over Asia's top security meeting, as are the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, and the South China Sea tensions. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin arrived in Singapore early on Friday. He is expected to meet with China's defence minister, Dong Jun, in the afternoon to discuss contentious issues such as Taiwan and the South China Sea, but also the importance of keeping communications open, Pentagon officials said.\n\nAustin is scheduled to deliver a speech at the forum on Saturday; Dong will speak on Sunday. \"China believes that high level China-U.S. strategic military communications helps stabilise military to military relations; China maintains an open attitude towards this,\" Chinese defence ministry spokesperson Wu Qian said on Thursday.\n\nFriday night, however, the spotlight will be on Philippine President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr, who is expected to discuss the legal and geopolitical position of the Philippines on the South China Sea and note the importance of the waterway to global trade. China claims sovereignty over the shoals and almost all of the South China Sea, including parts claimed by the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam, despite a 2016 ruling by the Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration that found Beijing's sweeping claims have no legal basis.\n\nDong and Austin are likely to discuss those issues, as well as Taiwan. Austin will reiterate the United States' longstanding \"One China\" policy but also bring up China's military activities near Taiwan, which recently inaugurated its new president, Lai Ching-te, the Pentagon officials said. Taiwan's Defence Minister Wellington Koo told reporters in Taipei on Friday that increased tensions around the democratically governed island claimed by China as its own territory would diminish if Beijing's military drills ceased.\n\n\"If China stops its provocation and intimidation then peace and stability can be maintained,\" he said. The region has seen a sharp uptick in such exercises in recent years, according to a report by the London-based International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS) released on Friday.\n\nAlthough both the United States and China have significantly increased the volume of military exercises across Asia, Beijing's drills still lag in scale and complexity, the study found. The security forum, in its 21st iteration, is held every year in Singapore by IISS, gathering military and political leaders to discuss security issues. It ends on June 2.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

China also claims the democratic self-governing island of Taiwan and has said it will not rule out using force to take it.\n\nAustin, who is due to address the conference on Saturday, reiterated the American position to Dong during their talks, according to Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder.\n\n\"The secretary made clear that the United States will continue to fly, sail, and operate -- safely and responsibly -- wherever international law allows,\" Ryder said. \"He underscored the importance of respect for high seas freedom of navigation guaranteed under international law, especially in the South China Sea.\"\n\nSince territorial hostilities with China surged last year in the South China Sea, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s administration has taken steps to forge new security alliances with a number of Asian and Western countries and allowed a U.S. military presence in more Philippine bases under a 2014 defense pact.\n\nIn his talks with Austin, Dong accused the U.S. of inflaming regional security by deploying medium-range missiles in the Philippines for the first time recently, and said the Philippines was being provocative toward China by pressing its own South China Sea claims, Chinese Defense Ministry spokesperson Wu Qian told reporters after the meeting.\n\nMarcos opens this year's conference, hosted by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, with a keynote address Friday.\n\nThis week, Marcos already expressed concerns over a new law issued by China giving its coast guard license to seize foreign ships \"that illegally enter China's territorial waters\" and to detain foreign crews for up to 60 days. The same law also made new reference to 2021 legislation that says China's coast guard can fire upon foreign ships if necessary.\n\nWith Philippines ships now regularly confronted by the Chinese, there are concerns that a low-level confrontation could lead to an escalation, said Eugene Tan, a professor of international law at the Singapore Management University.\n\n\"I don't think these countries are really looking to go to war with each other, but the concern with these skirmishes is that sometimes when you have a miscalculation, then things could rapidly deteriorate into the use of force,\" he said.\n\n\"And I think the last thing that countries in the region would want, particularly as they focus on the post-pandemic recovery, would be to have a regional conflict at the doorstep.\"\n\nThis year's conference comes just a week after China held massive military drills around Taiwan, staging a simulated blockade of the island after it inaugurated a new government that refuses to accept Beijing's insistence that the island is part of China.\n\nChina regards Taiwan as a renegade province that must come under its control, by force if necessary.\n\nThe U.S., like most countries, does not have formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan but is bound by its own laws to provide the island with the means to defend itself. Washington is Taiwan's biggest provider of military hardware and maintains a de facto embassy on the island to underscore their strong ties.\n\nIn his talks with Dong, Austin reiterated that the United States remains committed to the one-China policy, but \"expressed concern\" about the recent Chinese exercises, Ryder said.\n\nAustin told Dong that China \"should not use Taiwan's political transition -- part of a normal, routine democratic process -- as a pretext for coercive measures,\" Ryder said.\n\nChina has denounced American and British support for Taiwan's newly elected government, as well as the visit of a U.S. congressional visit to meet with Taiwan's new leader, Lai Ching-te.\n\nDong brought up those concerns with Austin, telling him that he urged \"the U.S. side to correct mistakes and abide by the one-China principle and to not, in any way, assist Taiwan independence by force,\" Wu Qian said.\n\nChina and the U.S. have been gradually restoring defense contacts since they broke down over Pelosi's visit to Taiwan, and Austin and Dong already talked with each other by video conference in April.\n\nIn their meeting Friday, Austin emphasized the importance of keeping open lines of military-to-military communication and said \"both sides will resume telephone conversations between theater commanders in the coming months,\" Ryder said.\n\nWu Qian said this was an important step.\n\n\"The communications between the two militaries aims to enhance understanding, eliminate misunderstanding, accumulate mutual trust and achieve stability in relations,\" he said.\n\nMeia Nouwens, a Chinese security and defense expert with the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said that while the resumption of direct communications is important, talking is the minimum that should be expected of two great powers.\n\nDirect military communications are meant to allow commanders to defuse a situation before it escalates, but Nouwens cautioned it will only be effective if Chinese leaders give their commanders the \"political leeway to respond in the moment.\"\n\n\"We have to remember that there is a different political system in each of these two countries and therefore the commanders do not necessarily operate in the same way, or have the same level of political ability to make decisions in the moment or respond,\" she said.\n\nAustin is due to address the forum Saturday morning, while Dong will speak on Sunday, the final day.\n\n___\n\nAP journalists Syawalludin Zain in Singapore and Tara Copp in Washington

Photo: AFP>\n\nEach side brought 10 officials to the talks, officials said.\n\nIt marks the first in-person summit between the pair and comes after a phone call between them in April.\n\nDuring that call they discussed various issues regarding the increasing military tensions between the two countries over major flashpoints, such as the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait.\n\nRelations have remained bitter since Beijing severed the military communication channel with Washington after Nancy Pelosi, who was US House speaker at the time, visited Taiwan in August 2022.\n\nThe bilateral meeting on Friday follows Beijing and Washington's attempt to restore military communication channels after Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden met in San Francisco in November.\n\nIt marks the first time in two years the two countries' defence ministers have met in person after Austin met then Chinese defence minister Wei Fenghe in November 2022 in Cambodia.\n\nNo China-US bilateral meeting took place at last year's Shangri-La Dialogue after Beijing refused because the US had imposed sanctions on Li Shangfu, who became defence minister in March last year and was ousted a few months later.\n\nHe was replaced by Dong in December.\n\nThe rare meeting between the two sides comes amid rising military tensions in the Taiwan Strait.\n\nLast week, the People's Liberation Army conducted a two-day joint military drill focusing on blockading the main island of Taiwan in response to the inauguration of the new Taiwanese leader William Lai Ching-te.\n\nBeijing sees Taiwan as part of China, to be reunited by force if necessary. Most countries, including the US, do not recognise Taiwan as an independent state, but Washington is opposed to any attempt to take the island by force, and is committed to arming it.\n\nOn Thursday, Beijing announced export controls on various military-related materials to take effect from July 1, which the Chinese commerce ministry said was to \"safeguard national security and interests.\"\n\nA review by the South China Morning Post of customs data shows the US is among the largest importers of those products.\n\nMore to follow ...\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

Reuters\n\nWith every passing edition, Shangri-La Dialogue has increasingly become China-centric reflecting the country's growing influence and the global concern over its strategic actions. While the dialogue addresses a broad range of security issues in the Asia-Pacific region, discussions often focus heavily on China's military expansion, territorial disputes and geopolitical strategies. This prominence is driven by China's assertive actions in the South China Sea, its Belt and Road Initiative and its evolving military capabilities significantly influencing regional and global security.\n\nChina and Shangri-La Dialogue 2024\n\nAdmiral Dong Jun, China's first naval officer to be appointed as defence minister, will make his debut appearance before an international audience. He assumed the position in December last year, following the brief tenure of his predecessor, Li Shangfu. According to the South China Morning Post, Admiral Dong brings extensive military experience. From 2017 to 2021, he held the position of deputy commander of the Southern Theatre Command, responsible for overseeing operations in the South China Sea. In 2013 and 2014, he was part of the East Sea Fleet, operating in the Taiwan Strait. Both regions are significant flashpoints for China. Additionally, Dong has served in the North Sea Fleet.\n\nAdmiral Dong is expected to meet US Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin on the sidelines of the upcoming meeting. This potential encounter in Singapore would be their first in-person dialogue following a video call in April. While the Pentagon has announced Austin's plans to meet his Chinese counterpart, neither the Pentagon nor Chinese officials have provided further details about the meeting. Beijing will be closely observing Admiral Dong's performance as he needs to project strength and establish his credentials.\n\nCurrently, Admiral Dong is not a member of the Communist Party's Central Military Commission, the decision-making body under President Xi Jinping. His role primarily involves military diplomacy with limited influence over actual military operations.\n\nChina's participation in the dialogue comes just days after conducting a large-scale, two-day military drill encircling Taiwan. This exercise was a response to Taiwanese President William Lai Ching-te's inauguration speech on 20 May, which China perceived as provocative. The drills drew criticism from several countries including the US, Japan, Australia and the European Union.\n\nPutting the ball on US court\n\nAhead of the highly anticipated Austin-Dong meeting, Chinese media has been emphasising that the responsibility for mending Washington's ties with Beijing lies with the US.\n\nEffective communication on defence matters is essential for managing mutual differences, yet China seeks greater sincerity from the US concerning its core interests and security concerns. The Global Times, citing experts, expressed that China hopes for meaningful dialogue rather than engagements merely for political show.\n\nDespite this, the Chinese state media acknowledged Defence Secretary Austin's commitment to meeting Admiral Dong in person at the Shangri-La Dialogue, especially considering his recent medical procedure. They noted that diplomatic relations have gradually improved since the summit between the Chinese and US heads of state in San Francisco in November 2023. This thaw follows the freezing of formal military-to-military meetings in August 2022 after then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan.\n\nChina expects the discussions to address Taiwan and South China Sea issues reflecting their importance in the bilateral relationship.\n\nPast concerns and criticisms\n\nIn May 2023, US-China interactions were strained as Defence Secretary Austin did not meet with his Chinese counterpart, Li Shangfu, following the fallout from then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan. Tensions escalated further in February with the discovery of a Chinese surveillance balloon over US territory. This incident compounded existing issues including close encounters between US and Chinese fighter jets over the South China Sea and naval vessels in the Taiwan Strait.\n\nThe 2022 Shangri-La Dialogue was similarly challenging for China. Countries such as Australia and Canada openly criticised Beijing for violating international laws citing dangerous maneuvers by Chinese jets that jeopardised the safety of military personnel. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced that Japan had no choice but to increase its defence budget and acquire advanced weaponry to protect itself. The South China Sea remains a hotbed of maritime security tensions with China having militarised various artificial islands within the 1.3 million square mile waterway.\n\nWhy is the Shangri-La Dialogue significant this year?\n\nThis year's Shangri-La Dialogue holds particular significance due to the multitude of complex global issues currently at play including US-China relations, China-Taiwan tensions, the Russia-Ukraine war, unrest in Myanmar, the US role in the Indo-Pacific, maritime security in the Indian and Pacific oceans and escalating tensions in the Middle East.\n\nThis year's edition will feature Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr delivering the keynote speech to open the 21st IISS Shangri-La Dialogue. He is expected to reaffirm his country's stance on the contested South China Sea where tensions with China have been rising.\n\nThe three-day summit traditionally begins on a Friday and concludes on a Sunday. The event kicks off with a keynote address typically delivered by a head of state. For instance, in his keynote address on 31 May, 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi described India-China relations as multifaceted and emphasised that both Asia and the world would benefit from India and China working together with mutual trust and confidence considering each other's interests. Prime Minister Modi was the first Indian premier to speak at the Shangri-La Dialogue.\n\nBirth of the Shangri-La Dialogue\n\nThe origins of the Shangri-La Dialogue, officially known as the IISS Asia Security Summit, date back to 2001 when Sir John Chipman, then Director-General and Chief Executive of The International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), identified a crucial need for a forum that would enable defence ministers and military chiefs from 28 Asia-Pacific countries to discuss regional security. This platform was designed to promote open communication, build trust and foster practical security cooperation.\n\nInspired by the Munich Conference on Security Policy, Chipman envisioned creating a Track One organisation dedicated to regional security dynamics. Initial outreach efforts targeted ASEAN members and invitations were extended to establish a regional security framework. Singapore, led by then president SR Nathan, embraced the concept enthusiastically. In February 2001, Chipman presented the idea to president Nathan, who pledged unwavering support until IISS could independently manage the conference. Consequently, Singapore became the host country, with the iconic Shangri-La Hotel serving as the venue since 2002. The dialogue takes its name from this location.\n\nThe inaugural dialogue saw participation from 14 defence ministers and 160 delegates with the United States represented by its deputy defence secretary, according to Channel News Asia. Over the years, the summit has expanded its invitation list and sessions. By the fifth year, high-level officials from China began participating, and by 2018, nearly 50 countries were represented.\n\nThe Shangri-La Dialogue now attracts legislators, academic experts, journalists and business delegates from around the world making it a premier platform for public policy development and discussions on defence and security in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nThis year's event will be held in Singapore from 31 May to 2 June.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Since then, however, such unsafe maneuvers involving the two countries have drastically decreased.\n\nAustin last had an in-person meeting with his Chinese counterpart in 2022, when he met China's defense minister at the time, Wei Fenghe. He spoke with Dong this year by phone.\n\nThe official said Austin would also bring up \"regional and global security issues.\"\n\nThat includes rising maritime tensions in the South China Sea between Manila and Beijing, as the Philippines has accused China of using water cannons and blocking maneuvers through disputed shoals and reefs.\n\nPhilippine President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr will deliver a keynote address on Friday night at the security summit in Singapore where he is expected to address those issues.\n\nChina claims sovereignty over the shoals and almost all the South China Sea, including parts claimed by the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam, despite a 2016 ruling by The Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration that found Beijing's sweeping claims have no legal basis.\n\nThe two defense leaders are also likely to discuss Taiwan. Austin will reiterate the United States' longstanding \"One China\" policy but also bring up China's military activities near Taiwan.\n\nLast week China ended two days of war games around Taiwan in which it simulated attacks with bombers and practiced boarding ships, exercises that Taiwan condemned as \"blatant provocation,\" detailing a surge of Chinese warplanes and warships.\n\nBeijing said the exercises were \"punishment\" for Taiwan President Lai Ching-te's inauguration speech, in which he said the two sides of the Taiwan Strait were \"not subordinate to each other.\"\n\nThe United States is also increasingly concerned about China's support for Russia's war effort in Ukraine and have been closely watching for movement of weapons from Beijing to Moscow.\n\nExperts say that engagement between U.S. and Chinese military leaders is important to protect against miscommunication, but that a single meeting is unlikely to make major progress.\n\n\"I don't think that they're going to have much time to have any kind of substantive dialog,\" said Derek Grossman, a Rand Corporation defense analyst. \"Those types of discussions usually happen when they are not sideline events to the main event.\" (Reporting by Idrees Ali.

The Philippines' president was to give a speech at the meeting later in the day that was expected to touch on sensitive South China Sea claims.\n\nThe U.S.-China relationship is expected to loom over the dialog, as are the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, and the South China Sea tensions.\n\nDuring the meeting with Dong, Austin expressed concern about Chinese military activity near Taiwan, including after the island's presidential election and the inauguration of President Lai Ching-te this month, U.S. Air Force Major General Patrick Ryder said in a statement.\n\n\"The secretary expressed concern about recent provocative PLA activity around the Taiwan Strait, and he reiterated that the PRC should not use Taiwan's political transition - part of a normal, routine democratic process - as a pretext for coercive measures,\" Ryder said after the 75-minute meeting.\n\nHe was referring to the People's Liberation Army and the People's Republic of China.\n\nDong warned Austin that the U.S. should not interfere in China's affairs with Taiwan, defense ministry spokesperson Wu Qian told reporters.\n\nThe U.S. approach to Taiwan violates commitments made by the United States and sends the wrong signal to \"separatist forces\" in Taiwan, the spokesperson quoted Dong as saying. Beijing calls Lai a \"separatist.\"\n\nBoth sides, however, emphasized the importance of keeping military-to-military ties open, and a senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the meeting marked an \"important step\" in opening lines of communication.\n\nThe official said Austin was \"firm but professional\" and also brought up China's nuclear, space and cyber developments.\n\nThe two sides also discussed the South China Sea and the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza.\n\nLater on Friday the spotlight shifts to Philippine President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr, who is expected to discuss the legal and geopolitical position of the Philippines on the South China Sea and note the importance of the waterway to global trade.\n\nChina claims sovereignty over almost all of the South China Sea, including parts claimed by the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam, despite a 2016 ruling by the Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration that found Beijing's sweeping claims have no legal basis.\n\nTaiwan's Defence Minister Wellington Koo told reporters in Taipei on Friday that increased tensions around the democratically governed island claimed by China as its own territory would diminish if Beijing's military drills ceased.\n\n\"If China stops its provocation and intimidation then peace and stability can be maintained,\" he said.\n\nThe region has seen a sharp uptick in such exercises in recent years, according to a report by the London-based International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS) released on Friday.\n\nAlthough both the United States and China have significantly increased the volume of military exercises across Asia, Beijing's drills still lag in scale and complexity, the study found.\n\nThe Shangri-La Dialogue, in its 21st iteration, is held every year in Singapore by IISS, gathering military and political leaders to discuss security issues. It ends on June 2.\n\n(Reporting by Idrees Ali and Xinghui Kok in Singapore and Ben Blanchard in Taipei; Writing by Gerry Doyle; Editing by Jamie Freed and Raju Gopalakrishnan)", "source": {"uri":

The Philippines' president was to give a speech at the meeting later in the day that was expected to touch on sensitive South China Sea claims.\n\nThe U.S.-China relationship is expected to loom over the dialogue, as are the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, and the South China Sea tensions.\n\nDuring the meeting with Dong, Austin expressed concern about Chinese military activity near Taiwan, including after the island's presidential election and the inauguration of President Lai Ching-te this month, U.S. Air Force Major General Patrick Ryder said in a statement.\n\n\"The secretary expressed concern about recent provocative PLA activity around the Taiwan Strait, and he reiterated that the PRC should not use Taiwan's political transition - part of a normal, routine democratic process - as a pretext for coercive measures,\" Ryder said after the 75-minute meeting.\n\nHe was referring to the People's Liberation Army and the People's Republic of China.\n\nDong warned Austin that the U.S. should not interfere in China's affairs with Taiwan, defence ministry spokesperson Wu Qian told reporters.\n\nThe U.S. approach to Taiwan violates commitments made by the United States and sends the wrong signal to \"separatist forces\" in Taiwan, the spokesperson quoted Dong as saying. Beijing calls Lai a \"separatist\".\n\nBoth sides, however, emphasised the importance of keeping military-to-military ties open, and a senior U.S. defence official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the meeting marked an \"important step\" in opening lines of communication.\n\nThe official said Austin was \"firm but professional\" and also brought up China's nuclear, space and cyber developments.\n\nThe two sides also discussed the South China Sea and the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza.\n\nLater on Friday the spotlight shifts to Philippine President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr, who is expected to discuss the legal and geopolitical position of the Philippines on the South China Sea and note the importance of the waterway to global trade.\n\nChina claims sovereignty over almost all of the South China Sea, including parts claimed by the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam, despite a 2016 ruling by the Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration that found Beijing's sweeping claims have no legal basis.\n\nTaiwan's Defence Minister Wellington Koo told reporters in Taipei on Friday that increased tensions around the democratically governed island claimed by China as its own territory would diminish if Beijing's military drills ceased.\n\n\"If China stops its provocation and intimidation then peace and stability can be maintained,\" he said.\n\nThe region has seen a sharp uptick in such exercises in recent years, according to a report by the London-based International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS) released on Friday.\n\nAlthough both the United States and China have significantly increased the volume of military exercises across Asia, Beijing's drills still lag in scale and complexity, the study found.\n\nThe Shangri-La Dialogue, in its 21st iteration, is held every year in Singapore by IISS, gathering military and political leaders to discuss security issues. It ends on June 2.\n\nReporting by Idrees Ali and Xinghui Kok in Singapore and Ben Blanchard in Taipei; Writing by Gerry Doyle; Editing by Jamie Freed and Raju Gopalakrishnan\n\nIdrees Ali\n\nThomson Reuters\n\nNational security correspondent focusing on the Pentagon in Washington D.C.

Austin will reiterate the United States' longstanding \"One China\" policy but also bring up China's military activities near Taiwan, which recently inaugurated its new president, Lai Ching-te, the Pentagon officials said.\n\nTaiwan's Defense Minister Wellington Koo told reporters in Taipei on Friday that increased tensions around the democratically governed island claimed by China as its own territory would diminish if Beijing's military drills ceased.\n\n\"If China stops its provocation and intimidation then peace and stability can be maintained,\" he said.\n\nThe region has seen a sharp uptick in such exercises in recent years, according to a report by the London-based International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS) released on Friday.\n\nAlthough both the United States and China have significantly increased the volume of military exercises across Asia, Beijing's drills still lag in scale and complexity, the study found.\n\nThe security forum, in its 21st iteration, is held every year in Singapore by IISS, gathering military and political leaders to discuss security issues. It ends on June 2.\n\n-- Reporting by Idrees Ali and Xinghui Kok in Singapore and Ben Blanchard in Taipei; Writing by Gerry Doyle; Editing by Jamie Freed and Raju Gopalakrishnan", "source": {"uri":

The two-day drill was also denouncing Washington's efforts to strengthen security ties with important allies like Japan, South Korea and the Philippines.\n\nThe telephone conversations between theatre commanders will be resumed in the coming months, affirms Austin. The announcement was made by US President Joe Biden and his Chinese Counterpart Xi Jinping in November 2023.\n\nAs Taiwan held presidential election and the inauguration of President Lai Ching-te this month, Austin also expressed concern about the recent proactive Chinese military activity around the Taiwan Strait. He reiterated that China should not use Taiwan's political transition part of a normal, routine democratic process.\n\nWhile affirming the importance of peace and stability across Taiwan Strait, the US Defence official also underscored that the United States remains committed to its longstanding one China policy, which is guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the Three US-China Joint Communiques, and the Six Assurances.\n\nAustin also made clear that under the guidelines of the International Law, US will continue to fly, sail and operate; safely and responsibly. He said he understands and respects the freedom of navigation under International Law, especially in South China Sea.\n\nThe US Defence Department will welcome a crisis-communications working group by the end of the year, said the US Department of Defence.\n\nRussia's unprovoked war against Ukraine and China's role in supporting Russia's defence industrial base was also discussed by the top defence officials in the Dialogue. The statement released by the Pentagon read; \"The Secretary also expressed concerns about recent provocations from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), including its direct contributions to Russia's ongoing assault on Ukraine.\"\n\nFollowing the meeting Pentagon said the US officials will continue active discussions with their Chinese counterparts about future engagements between defence and military officials at multiple levels. Today's meeting follows Austin's April 16 video teleconference call with his Chinese counterpart.\n\nDefence chiefs and officials from around the world are attending the Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual forum that began today and will culminate on Sunday.\n\nThe Shangri-La Dialogue's today's keynote speech will be delivered by Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in 2018, had delivered the key note speech at the forum. Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Fumio and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese were some of the earlier keynote speakers.", "source": {"uri":

Dong Jun, is the first face-to-face talks between the two defense chiefs and Austin's first such discussions with a Chinese counterpart since late 2022.\n\nThe meeting, on the sidelines of an annual defense conference in Singapore, takes place against a fraught regional backdrop. Beijing - which wields the world's largest navy - continues to aggressively assert disputed territorial claims in the East and South China Seas, while decrying Washington's efforts to strengthen security ties with key allies like Japan, South Korea and the Philippines.\n\nAt the core of those contentions is that China does not want to see America exercise its military power in Asia - a region where the US it has deep, historic security ties and seeks to maintain open waterways and deter North Korean aggression, but where China is widely viewed as wanting to establish its dominance.\n\nA deterioration of US-China military dialogue in recent years raised international concerns about those tensions leading to miscommunications that could veer toward conflict.\n\nIn their roughly 75 minute meeting, both Austin and Dong nodded to their interests in maintaining dialogue, while also pressing each other on key issues, according to statements from each sides.\n\nAustin raised concerns about \"recent provocative\" Chinese military activity around the Taiwan Strait and China's \"role in supporting Russia's defense industrial base,\" according to a readout from Pentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder.\n\nThe US defense chief also \"made clear\" that the US would continue its operations \"safely and responsibly\" wherever international law allows - in an apparent pushback on China's aggressive patrolling of international waters and airspace in the region.\n\nAustin's counterpart said the \"stabilization\" of the military-to-military relations \"does not come by easily and shall be cherished dearly,\" Chinese Defense Ministry spokesperson Wu Qian, told reporters after the meeting, adding that Dong stressed that neither side should \"contain or smear\" the other side, but build mutual trust.\n\nDong also said that when it comes to areas surrounding China, especially the South China Sea, commercial ships and aircraft \"can always operate safely,\" but that \"there is a huge difference between freedom and willfulness, between navigation and trespassing.\"\n\n\"It is important to respect others' security concerns, and security should be mutually respected. No one can pursue one's security at the expense of another country's security,\" Dong said, according to the ministry spokesperson.\n\nRegional tensions\n\nThe two leaders spoke following a period of weeks where regional tensions have been on show.\n\nChina earlier this month staged major war games around Taiwan following the inauguration of the island's new democratically elected president Lai Ching-te. China's ruling Communist Party claims the self-governing democracy as its own, despite never having controlled it.\n\nIts Coast Guard in recent weeks has also fired water cannons and sought to counter Philippine vessels operating in disputed areas of the South China Sea, stoking already heightened tensions with a US treaty ally in the region.\n\nBeijing has also lashed out at what it sees as provocative moves between the US and its allies, as it conducts joint military exercises in the region.\n\nAustin in his talks with Dong reiterated the US call for China not to \"use Taiwan's political transition -- part of a normal, routine democratic process -- as a pretext for coercive measures,\" the Pentagon statement said. Dong, meanwhile, slammed the US for offering a congratulatory message for Lai, calling on it to take \"concrete actions to correct its mistakes,\" according to China's account.\n\nDong also condemned the deployment of an American missile system during military drills in the Philippines last month as a \"threat to regional security,\" and accused Manila of being \"emboldened by outside powers,\" according to Wu. \"Our tolerance for continued and intensified provocations will have a limit,\" the spokesperson quoted Dong as saying in reference to the Philippines.\n\nChina claims historic rights to the bulk of the South China Sea, despite a 2016 ruling at an international tribunal in The Hague ruled in favor of the Philippines against that claim.\n\nThe two sides also discussed Russia's war in Ukraine, with Austin indicating to China that there would be consequences if Beijing continues to support Russia militarily, a senior US defense official said after the meeting.\n\nThe US defense chief \"said quite clearly that if China's support for Russia's defense sector continues than the United States, with our allies, will have to take further measures,\" the official said, while declining to detail what those measures would be.\n\nWashington in recent weeks has said dual-use exports from China are bolstering Russia's defense industrial base as it wages war in Ukraine and have warned Chinese counterparts against providing lethal aid. Dong said China, which claims neutrality in the conflict, had \"honored our promise not to provide weapons to either side of the conflict\" and has strict controls on dual-use exports, according to China's spokesperson.\n\nAustin also discussed US concerns about China's nuclear buildup and cyber attacks on US critical infrastructure, a second US defense official said.\n\nSevered ties\n\nThe sit-down in Singapore follows a call last month between Austin and Dong, who was appointed to his post in late December. The call marked Austin's first at-length conversation with a Chinese counterpart since November 2022.\n\nBeijing had largely suspended high-level military communications following a visit in August of that year from then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan, which sparked Beijing's ire.\n\nThe silence coincided with a period of significant tensions between the two powers, which included high-profile incidents such as a Chinese spy balloon traversing across the continental US and what the US described as an increase in \"coercive and risky\" behavior by Chinese pilots against US aircraft over the East and South China Seas.\n\nUS efforts to re-engage appeared further complicated by the appointment in early 2023 of China's previous Defense Minister Li Shangfu, who had been sanctioned by the US in 2018 over China's purchase of Russian weapons.\n\nAustin and Li had a brief exchange during last year's Shangri-La Dialogue, but no formal talks, with Beijing repeatedly suggesting that the US defense secretary won't get a meeting with Li unless the sanctions were revoked.\n\nEfforts to stabilize that communication hit another complication after Li abruptly vanished from the public eye last August amid a personnel shake-up in Chinese leader Xi Jinping's military ranks.\n\nLi was formally removed from his post without explanation in October and replaced by Dong, a former naval commander, some two months later.\n\nIn China, the defense minister is a largely ceremonial role, serving as the public face of military diplomacy with other countries, while command power resides within the Chinese Communist Party's powerful Central Military Commission led by Xi.\n\nXi and US President Joe Biden had vowed to restore high-level military talks during a summit outside San Francisco in November, seen by both sides as a key step in stabilizing fractious relations.\n\nSeveral weeks later, US and Chinese top generals spoke in a video call, paving the way for this week's in-person meeting between the defense chiefs.\n\nFollowing Friday's meeting, a US defense official said the US side had pressed for calls between China's five theater commanders in the region and US Indo-Pacific Command Commander Adm. Samuel Paparo, adding that those calls could happen soon but had not been scheduled.\n\nAustin also referenced plans to convene a crisis-communications working group by the end of the year, the Pentagon readout said.\n\nCNN's Alex Stambaugh and Brad Lendon contributed to this report.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType":

China also claims the democratic self-governing island of Taiwan and has said it would not rule out using force to take it.\n\nSince territorial hostilities with China surged last year in the South China Sea, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s administration has taken steps to forge new security alliances with a number of Asian and Western countries and allowed a US military presence in more Philippine bases under a 2014 defense pact.\n\nMarcos opens this year's Shangri-La Dialogue, hosted by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, with a keynote address Friday.\n\nThis week, Marcos already expressed concerns over a new law issued by China giving its coast guard license to seize foreign ships \"that illegally enter China's territorial waters\" and to detain foreign crews for up to 60 days. The same law also made new reference to 2021 legislation that says China's coast guard can fire upon foreign ships if necessary.\n\nWith Philippines ships now regularly confronted by the Chinese, there are concerns that a low-level confrontation could lead to an escalation, said Eugene Tan, a professor of international law at the Singapore Management University.\n\n\"I don't think these countries are really looking to go to war with each other, but the concern with these skirmishes is that sometimes when you have a miscalculation, then things could rapidly deteriorate into the use of force,\" he said.\n\n\"And I think the last thing that countries in the region would want, particularly as they focus on the post-pandemic recovery, would be to have a regional conflict at the doorstep.\"\n\nThis year's conference comes just a week after China held massive military drills around Taiwan, staging a simulated blockade of the island after it inaugurated a new government that refuses to accept Beijing's insistence that the island is part of China.\n\nChina regards Taiwan as a renegade province that must come under its control, by force if necessary.\n\nThe US, like most countries, does not have formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan but is bound by its own laws to provide the island with the means to defend itself. The US called China's military exercises \"reckless.\"\n\nBilateral contact between the American and Chinese militaries broke down in 2022 after then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, infuriating Beijing.\n\nThat has slowly been reestablished in recent months, and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Chinese Defense Minister Dong Jun, who are both attending the Shangri-La Dialogue, met with each other Friday even before the forum began.\n\nIt was the first face-to-face meeting the two have had since direct talks broke down, though they have spoken previously by phone.\n\nThe two were expected to talk about establishing a channel of direct communication between military commanders responsible for the area around Taiwan and the rest of the region, said Pentagon spokesperson Lt. Col. Marty Meiners.\n\n\"We are committed to delivering on the president's direction to increase military-to-military communication,\" he said.\n\n\"The department will continue to engage in active discussions with PRC (People's Republic of China) counterparts about future engagements between defense and military officials at multiple levels.\"\n\nTan said he wouldn't expect any big breakthroughs from the talks, but that it was important that the two were in direct contact to \"reduce the temperature\" between the two countries.\n\n\"We would probably be expecting too much of the Shangri-La Dialogue to expect any sort of concrete moves forward,\" he said. \"The Shangri-La Dialogue is really providing the opportunity for very incremental steps in trust and confidence building.\"\n\nAustin is due to address the forum Saturday morning, while Dong will on Sunday, the final day.", "source": {"uri": "businessmirror.com.ph", "dataType": "news", "title":

Dong Jun, is the first face-to-face talks between the two defense chiefs and Austin's first such discussions with a Chinese counterpart since late 2022.\n\nThe meeting, on the sidelines of an annual defense conference in Singapore, takes place against a fraught regional backdrop. Beijing - which wields the world's largest navy - continues to aggressively assert disputed territorial claims in the East and South China Seas, while decrying Washington's efforts to strengthen security ties with key allies like Japan, South Korea and the Philippines.\n\nAt the core of those contentions is that China does not want to see America exercise its military power in Asia - a region where the US it has deep, historic security ties and seeks to maintain open waterways and deter North Korean aggression, but where China is widely viewed as wanting to establish its dominance.\n\nA deterioration of US-China military dialogue in recent years raised international concerns about those tensions leading to miscommunications that could veer toward conflict.\n\nIn their roughly 75 minute meeting, both Austin and Dong nodded to their interests in maintaining dialogue, while also pressing each other on key issues, according to statements from each sides.\n\nAustin raised concerns about \"recent provocative\" Chinese military activity around the Taiwan Strait and China's \"role in supporting Russia's defense industrial base,\" according to a readout from Pentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder.\n\nThe US defense chief also \"made clear\" that the US would continue its operations \"safely and responsibly\" wherever international law allows - in an apparent pushback on China's aggressive patrolling of international waters and airspace in the region.\n\nAustin's counterpart said the \"stabilization\" of the military-to-military relations \"does not come by easily and shall be cherished dearly,\" Chinese Defense Ministry spokesperson Wu Qian, told reporters after the meeting, adding that Dong stressed that neither side should \"contain or smear\" the other side, but build mutual trust.\n\nDong also said that when it comes to areas surrounding China, especially the South China Sea, commercial ships and aircraft \"can always operate safely,\" but that \"there is a huge difference between freedom and willfulness, between navigation and trespassing.\"\n\n\"It is important to respect others' security concerns, and security should be mutually respected. No one can pursue one's security at the expense of another country's security,\" Dong said, according to the ministry spokesperson.\n\nRegional tensions\n\nThe two leaders spoke following a period of weeks where regional tensions have been on show.\n\nChina earlier this month staged major war games around Taiwan following the inauguration of the island's new democratically elected president Lai Ching-te. China's ruling Communist Party claims the self-governing democracy as its own, despite never having controlled it.\n\nIts Coast Guard in recent weeks has also fired water cannons and sought to counter Philippine vessels operating in disputed areas of the South China Sea, stoking already heightened tensions with a US treaty ally in the region.\n\nBeijing has also lashed out at what it sees as provocative moves between the US and its allies, as it conducts joint military exercises in the region.\n\nAustin in his talks with Dong reiterated the US call for China not to \"use Taiwan's political transition -- part of a normal, routine democratic process -- as a pretext for coercive measures,\" the Pentagon statement said. Dong, meanwhile, slammed the US for offering a congratulatory message for Lai, calling on it to take \"concrete actions to correct its mistakes,\" according to China's account.\n\nDong also condemned the deployment of an American missile system during military drills in the Philippines last month as a \"threat to regional security,\" and accused Manila of being \"emboldened by outside powers,\" according to Wu. \"Our tolerance for continued and intensified provocations will have a limit,\" the spokesperson quoted Dong as saying in reference to the Philippines.\n\nChina claims historic rights to the bulk of the South China Sea, despite a 2016 ruling at an international tribunal in The Hague ruled in favor of the Philippines against that claim.\n\nThe two sides also discussed Russia's war in Ukraine, with Austin indicating to China that there would be consequences if Beijing continues to support Russia militarily, a senior US defense official said after the meeting.\n\nThe US defense chief \"said quite clearly that if China's support for Russia's defense sector continues than the United States, with our allies, will have to take further measures,\" the official said, while declining to detail what those measures would be.\n\nWashington in recent weeks has said dual-use exports from China are bolstering Russia's defense industrial base as it wages war in Ukraine and have warned Chinese counterparts against providing lethal aid. Dong said China, which claims neutrality in the conflict, had \"honored our promise not to provide weapons to either side of the conflict\" and has strict controls on dual-use exports, according to China's spokesperson.\n\nAustin also discussed US concerns about China's nuclear buildup and cyber attacks on US critical infrastructure, a second US defense official said.\n\nSevered ties\n\nThe sit-down in Singapore follows a call last month between Austin and Dong, who was appointed to his post in late December. The call marked Austin's first at-length conversation with a Chinese counterpart since November 2022.\n\nBeijing had largely suspended high-level military communications following a visit in August of that year from then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan, which sparked Beijing's ire.\n\nThe silence coincided with a period of significant tensions between the two powers, which included high-profile incidents such as a Chinese spy balloon traversing across the continental US and what the US described as an increase in \"coercive and risky\" behavior by Chinese pilots against US aircraft over the East and South China Seas.\n\nUS efforts to re-engage appeared further complicated by the appointment in early 2023 of China's previous Defense Minister Li Shangfu, who had been sanctioned by the US in 2018 over China's purchase of Russian weapons.\n\nAustin and Li had a brief exchange during last year's Shangri-La Dialogue, but no formal talks, with Beijing repeatedly suggesting that the US defense secretary won't get a meeting with Li unless the sanctions were revoked.\n\nEfforts to stabilize that communication hit another complication after Li abruptly vanished from the public eye last August amid a personnel shake-up in Chinese leader Xi Jinping's military ranks.\n\nLi was formally removed from his post without explanation in October and replaced by Dong, a former naval commander, some two months later.\n\nIn China, the defense minister is a largely ceremonial role, serving as the public face of military diplomacy with other countries, while command power resides within the Chinese Communist Party's powerful Central Military Commission led by Xi.\n\nXi and US President Joe Biden had vowed to restore high-level military talks during a summit outside San Francisco in November, seen by both sides as a key step in stabilizing fractious relations.\n\nSeveral weeks later, US and Chinese top generals spoke in a video call, paving the way for this week's in-person meeting between the defense chiefs.\n\nFollowing Friday's meeting, a US defense official said the US side had pressed for calls between China's five theater commanders in the region and US Indo-Pacific Command Commander Adm. Samuel Paparo, adding that those calls could happen soon but had not been scheduled.\n\nAustin also referenced plans to convene a crisis-communications working group by the end of the year, the Pentagon readout said. - CNN", "source": {"uri": "dailynews.co.zw", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China_Sea",

China also claims the democratic self-governing island of Taiwan, and has said it would not rule out using force to take it.\n\nSince territorial hostilities with China surged last year in the South China Sea, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s administration has taken steps to forge new security alliances with a number of Asian and Western countries and allowed a U.S. military presence in more Philippine bases under a 2014 defense pact.\n\nMarcos opens this year's Shangri-La Dialogue, hosted by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, with a keynote address on Friday.\n\nThis week, Marcos already expressed concerns over a new law issued by China giving its coast guard license to seize foreign ships \"that illegally enter China's territorial waters\" and to detain foreign crews for up to 60 days. The same law also made new reference to 2021 legislation that says China's coast guard can fire upon foreign ships if necessary.\n\nWith Philippines ships now regularly confronted by the Chinese, there are concerns that a low-level confrontation could lead to an escalation, said Eugene Tan, a professor of international law at the Singapore Management University.\n\n\"I don't think these countries are really looking to go to war with each other, but the concern with these skirmishes is that sometimes when you have a miscalculation, then things could rapidly deteriorate into the use of force,\" he said.\n\n\"And I think the last thing that countries in the region would want, particularly as they focus on the post-pandemic recovery, would be to have a regional conflict at the doorstep.\"\n\nThis year's conference comes just a week after China held massive military drills around Taiwan, staging a simulated blockade of the island after it inaugurated a new government that refuses to accept Beijing's insistence that the island is part of China.\n\nChina regards Taiwan as a renegade province that must come under its control, by force if necessary.\n\nThe U.S., like most countries, does not have formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan but is bound by its own laws to provide the island with the means to defend itself. The U.S. called China's military exercises \"reckless.\"\n\nBilateral contact between the American and Chinese militaries broke down in 2022 after then-U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, infuriating Beijing.\n\nThat has slowly been re-established in recent months, and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Chinese Defense Minister Dong Jun, who are both attending the Shangri-La dialogue, were expected to meet with each other on Friday even before the forum begins.\n\nIt will be the first face-to-face meeting the two have had since direct talks broke down, though they have spoken previously by phone.\n\nTan said he wouldn't expect any breakthroughs from the talks, but that it was important that the two were in direct contact to \"reduce the temperature\" between the two countries.\n\n\"We would probably be expecting too much of the Shangri-La dialogue to expect any sort of concrete moves forward,\" he said. \"The Shangri-La dialogue is really providing the opportunity for very incremental steps in trust and confidence building.\"\n\nAustin is due to address the forum on Saturday morning, while Dong will on Sunday, the final day.", "source": {"uri":

Pat Ryder.\n\n\"The secretary made clear that the United States will continue to fly, sail, and operate -- safely and responsibly -- wherever international law allows,\" Ryder said. \"He underscored the importance of respect for high seas freedom of navigation guaranteed under international law, especially in the South China Sea.\"\n\nSince territorial hostilities with China surged last year in the South China Sea, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s administration has taken steps to forge new security alliances with a number of Asian and Western countries and allowed a U.S. military presence in more Philippine bases under a 2014 defense pact.\n\nMarcos opens this year's conference, hosted by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, with a keynote address Friday.\n\nThis week, Marcos already expressed concerns over a new law issued by China giving its coast guard license to seize foreign ships \"that illegally enter China's territorial waters\" and to detain foreign crews for up to 60 days. The same law also made new reference to 2021 legislation that says China's coast guard can fire upon foreign ships if necessary.\n\nWith Philippines ships now regularly confronted by the Chinese, there are concerns that a low-level confrontation could lead to an escalation, said Eugene Tan, a professor of international law at the Singapore Management University.\n\n\"I don't think these countries are really looking to go to war with each other, but the concern with these skirmishes is that sometimes when you have a miscalculation, then things could rapidly deteriorate into the use of force,\" he said.\n\n\"And I think the last thing that countries in the region would want, particularly as they focus on the post-pandemic recovery, would be to have a regional conflict at the doorstep.\"\n\nThis year's conference comes just a week after China held massive military drills around Taiwan, staging a simulated blockade of the island after it inaugurated a new government that refuses to accept Beijing's insistence that the island is part of China.\n\nChina regards Taiwan as a renegade province that must come under its control, by force if necessary.\n\nThe U.S., like most countries, does not have formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan but is bound by its own laws to provide the island with the means to defend itself.\n\nIn his talks with Dong, Austin reiterated that the United States remains committed to the one-China policy, but \"expressed concern\" about the recent Chinese exercises, Ryder said.\n\nAustin told Dong that China \"should not use Taiwan's political transition -- part of a normal, routine democratic process -- as a pretext for coercive measures,\" Ryder said.\n\nChina and the U.S. have been gradually restoring defense contacts since they broke down over Pelosi's visit to Taiwan, and Austin and Dong already talked with each other by video conference in April.\n\nIn their meeting Friday, Austin emphasized the importance of keeping open lines of military-to-military communication between American and Chinese commanders, and said \"both sides will resume telephone conversations between theater commanders in the coming months,\" Ryder said.\n\nChinese Defense Ministry spokesperson Wu Qian told reporters after the meeting that it showed the decline in military relations had now stabilized and that the resumption of direct communications was an important step.\n\n\"The communications between the two militaries aims to enhance understanding, eliminate misunderstanding, accumulate mutual trust and achieve stability in relations,\" he said.\n\nMeia Nouwens, a Chinese security and defense expert with the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said that while the resumption of direct communications is important, talking is the minimum that should be expected of two great powers.\n\nDirect military communications are meant to allow commanders to defuse a situation before it escalates, but Nouwens cautioned it will only be effective if Chinese leaders give their commanders the \"political leeway to respond in the moment.\"\n\n\"We have to remember that there is a different political system in each of these two countries and therefore the commanders do not necessarily operate in the same way, or have the same level of political ability to make decisions in the moment or respond,\" she said.\n\nAustin is due to address the forum Saturday morning, while Dong will speak on Sunday, the final day.\n\n___\n\nAP journalists Syawalludin Zain in Singapore and Tara Copp in Washington

Wu said the discussions went on longer than expected and that the two sides agreed to maintain exchanges and communications.\n\nA US official described Austin as candid, firm and professional in the talks, but suggested that one meeting wouldn't be enough to bridge the gulf between Washington and Beijing. A Pentagon statement said the two sides agreed to have theatre-level military commanders resume calls in the coming months and to convene a crisis-communications working group by year-end.\n\nThe US statement also signalled continuing differences, saying Austin expressed concerns about heightened Chinese military activity around Taiwan and China's \"role in supporting Russia's defence industrial base.\" Wu denied that Beijing supplies weapons to Russia and Ukraine and said that the US decision to congratulate Taiwan President Lai Ching-te on his election sent the wrong signal.\n\nThe meeting is the clearest sign of how ties between the world's two biggest economies have somewhat stabilised since Presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping met in California last November. Discussions between the two sides had largely broken down after a Chinese surveillance balloon floated over the American mainland before being shot down in early 2023.\n\nWith that event looming over the conference in Singapore last year, Austin and China's previous defence minister shook hands, but never held direct talks, a point Austin criticised in his speech at the time.\n\nThis year's Singapore meeting marks one of his first times Dong has been seen outside China, nearly a year after his predecessor was ousted amid corruption probes by Xi's government into the People's Liberation Army.\n\nWith the US-China meeting over, the geopolitical focus shifts towards other flash points in the region.\n\nPhilippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. will give the keynote address to the conference on Friday evening. He said he will \"highlight the Philippines' commitment to a rules-based international order and constructive multilateralism.\"\n\nThat's a coded criticism of Beijing's actions in the South China Sea, where Philippine and Chinese ships have collided near disputed islands and reefs on multiple occasions over the last year. Those tensions have raised questions as to what it would take for Manila to invoke its mutual defence treaty with the US.\n\nThere's also Taiwan, where China flexed its military muscle last week by sending over 100 aircraft and dozens of naval vessels to surround the self-ruled island following Lai's inauguration. China views Taiwan as its territory and has harshly criticised Lai for \"seeking independence\" from the mainland\n\nThe US has vowed to defend Taiwan if it comes under attack, and has bolstered alliances around Asia and the Indo-Pacific to prepare for any potential conflict. That includes a bloc known as the \"Squad,\" with Australia, Japan and the Philippines, formed after a meeting last year on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue. This year the four conducted joint maritime patrols within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone.\n\nAustin will also deliver remarks to the conference on Saturday and hold a meeting with counterparts from Japan and South Korea before heading to Cambodia to meet with other regional defence officials.\n\nChinese officials have said less about Dong's itinerary in Singapore, but he is expected to present China's views on global security issues during a speech on Sunday and meet with the Singaporean leadership.\n\nOther issues likely to be discussed at the weekend forum include the widening conflict in the Middle East and Russia's war in Ukraine, now in its third year.\n\nUkraine President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed the 2022 Shangri-La Dialogue by video, a few months after Russia's invasion. Zelensky is now urging US and China leaders to attend a summit to discuss Ukraine's peace blueprint.\n\nFor Southeast Asian nations straddling the US-China divide, the Austin-Dong meeting will be one highlight of the weekend's gathering. Dong said during a video call with Austin last month that the two nations' militaries should cooperate and avoid confrontation, echoing comments Austin made at the conference in 2023.\n\nThat kind of message has been welcomed in the region, where countries are wary over the prospect of an accident sparking an outright conflict.\n\nBut there's also a realisation that the tensions plaguing the region aren't likely to go away, a sentiment echoed by Singapore's new Prime Minister, Lawrence Wong, during his swearing-in ceremony earlier this month.\n\n\"For thirty years since the Cold War ended, we enjoyed unprecedented peace and stability in the Asia Pacific,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, that era is over. It will not return.\"", "source": {"uri": "sg.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military", "type": "wiki",

According to CNN, US officials said ahead of the meeting that Austin is expected to raise concerns with Dong about China's support for Russia.\n\nThe two leaders are meeting for the first time since 2022 and were expected to discuss contentious issues such as Taiwan and the South China Sea, as well as other topics. \"This is an opportunity for the two sides to exchange well-established talking points,\" said Drew Thompson, a visiting senior research fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore who formerly served as a Pentagon official dealing with the Chinese military was cited as saying by the New York Times.\n\nIn his conversation with Admiral Dong via video call in April this year Austin \"reiterated that the United States will continue to fly, sail, and operate - safely and responsibly - wherever international law allows,\" the Pentagon had said at that time. Admiral Dong's predecessor, Gen. Li Shangfu, who was under US sanctions refused to hold talks with Austin in Singapore in 2023.\n\nAustin last held talks with his Chinese counterpart when he spoke with the then defence minister of China Wei Fenghe in Cambodia in November 2022. Dong was appointed China's Defence minister in December. China then named General Li Shangfu as its defence minister. In 2018, the US sanctioned Li under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) when he headed the Equipment Development Department of the Chinese military. The sanctions were related to China's purchase of ten SU-35 combat aircrafts in 2017 and S-400 surface-to-air missile system-related equipment in 2018, according to the State Department, according to a Voice of America report.\n\nUS President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping last year in November near San Francisco to reopen direct military-to-military talks at several levels. In January this year, senior US and Chinese defence officials gathered for two days at the Pentagon to discuss defence relations between the two countries.\n\nEarlier in April, US and Chinese officials held talks aimed at ensuring professional and safe interactions between the two countries' air and naval forces. High-level military communication channels had been closed since Beijing shut them down to protest the 2022 visit to Taiwan by the then-US. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nChina has laid claim on the South China sea while Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam claim the areas around their coasts. An international court ruled in 2016 that China's nine-dash line, on which Beijing bases its claim, was without merit.\n\nRepresentatives from over 40 countries, including Ukraine, along with around 350 journalists, are expected to attend the annual Shangri-la conference that began today and will go on till Sunday, organized by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS).

Wu Qian, who called the official engagement \"positive, practical and constructive.\"\n\n\"The two sides both agreed that a stable U.S.-China military-to-military relationship is important,\" Wu told journalists shortly after the meeting, adding that both sides had agreed to have more communications and exchanges in the future.\n\nThis is the first face-to-face meeting between Austin and Dong. Dong was appointed to his role last December, four months after his predecessor, Li Shangfu, was abruptly removedfrom his post. It is also the first official meeting between the two top defense ministers since 2022, when China cut off key military communication lines with the U.S. after former House speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan.\n\nAlthough both sides see such top-level contact as a positive move, they also confronted each other on issues ranging from Taiwan to the South China Sea during the meeting, according to officials from both sides.\n\n\"The secretary expressed concern about recent provocative PLA activity around the Taiwan Strait, and he reiterated that the PRC should not use Taiwan's political transition -- part of a normal, routine democratic process -- as a pretext for coercive measures,\" Air Force Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder said in a statementafter the meeting.\n\nIn response, Dong reiterated Beijing's position on Taiwan -- that the island of 23 million people belongs to China -- and he accused Washington of \"sending serious and wrong signals to the Taiwan separatist forces,\" after the U.S. State Department congratulated Taiwan's president William Lai on his inauguration in May.\n\nOn the South China Sea, where China has overlapping territorial claims with several Southeast Asian countries, Austin reiterated the U.S. demand for the freedom of navigation under international law. But the Chinese side pushed back, according to Wu: \"No one country can pursue security at the expense of sacrificing another country's security.\"\n\nAnalysts say Beijing is likely to be repeatedly confronted with the South China Sea issue throughout this weekend's conference in Singapore. Philippines' president, Ferdinand Marcos Jr., is listed as a keynote speaker on Friday, where he is expected to highlight China's actions in the South China Sea.\n\nThe two top officials also discussed Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The U.S. accuses China of supporting Russia's defense industrial base. Beijing says it remains committed to not providing arms to either side of the war.", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NPR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emily_feng@npr.org", "name":

China also claims the democratic self-governing island of Taiwan and has said it would not rule out using force to take it.\n\nAustin, who is due to address the conference on Saturday, reiterated the American position to Dong during their talks, according to Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder.\n\n\"The secretary made clear that the United States will continue to fly, sail, and operate safely and responsibly wherever international law allows,\" Ryder said. \"He underscored the importance of respect for high seas freedom of navigation guaranteed under international law, especially in the South China Sea.\"\n\nSince territorial hostilities with China surged last year in the South China Sea, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s administration has taken steps to forge new security alliances with a number of Asian and Western countries and allowed a U.S. military presence in more Philippine bases under a 2014 defense pact.\n\nMarcos opens this year's conference, hosted by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, with a keynote address Friday.\n\nThis week, Marcos already expressed concerns over a new law issued by China giving its coast guard license to seize foreign ships \"that illegally enter China's territorial waters\" and to detain foreign crews for up to 60 days. The same law also made new reference to 2021 legislation that says China's coast guard can fire upon foreign ships if necessary.\n\nWith Philippines ships now regularly confronted by the Chinese, there are concerns that a low-level confrontation could lead to an escalation, said Eugene Tan, a professor of international law at the Singapore Management University.\n\n\"I don't think these countries are really looking to go to war with each other, but the concern with these skirmishes is that sometimes when you have a miscalculation, then things could rapidly deteriorate into the use of force,\" he said.\n\n\"And I think the last thing that countries in the region would want, particularly as they focus on the post-pandemic recovery, would be to have a regional conflict at the doorstep.\"\n\nThis year's conference comes just a week after China held massive military drills around Taiwan, staging a simulated blockade of the island after it inaugurated a new government that refuses to accept Beijing's insistence that the island is part of China.\n\nChina regards Taiwan as a renegade province that must come under its control, by force if necessary.\n\nThe U.S., like most countries, does not have formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan but is bound by its own laws to provide the island with the means to defend itself.\n\nIn his talks with Dong, Austin reiterated that the United States remains committed to the one-China policy, but \"expressed concern\" about the recent Chinese exercises, Ryder said.\n\nAustin told Dong that China \"should not use Taiwan's political transition part of a normal, routine democratic process as a pretext for coercive measures,\" Ryder said.\n\nChina and the U.S. have been gradually restoring defense contacts since they broke down over Pelosi's visit to Taiwan, and Austin and Dong already talked with each other by video conference in April.\n\nIn their meeting Friday, Austin emphasized the importance of keeping open lines of military-to-military communication between American and Chinese commanders, and said \"both sides will resume telephone conversations between theater commanders in the coming months,\" Ryder said.\n\nChinese Defense Ministry spokesperson Wu Qian told reporters after the meeting that it showed the decline in military relations had now stabilized and that the resumption of direct communications was an important step.\n\n\"The communications between the two militaries aims to enhance understanding, eliminate misunderstanding, accumulate mutual trust and achieve stability in relations,\" he said.\n\nMeia Nouwens, a Chinese security and defense expert with the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said that while the resumption of direct communications is important, talking is the minimum that should be expected of two great powers.\n\nDirect military communications are meant to allow commanders to defuse a situation before it escalates, but Nouwens cautioned it will only be effective if Chinese leaders give their commanders the \"political leeway to respond in the moment.\"\n\n\"We have to remember that there is a different political system in each of these two countries and therefore the commanders do not necessarily operate in the same way, or have the same level of political ability to make decisions in the moment or respond,\" she said.\n\nAustin is due to address the forum Saturday morning, while Dong will speak on Sunday, the final day.\n\njournalists Syawalludin Zain in Singapore and Tara Copp in Washington contributed to this story.\n\nFollow 's Asia-Pacific coverage at /hub/asia-pacific", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Li Shangfu, who was under US sanctions refused to hold talks with Austin in Singapore in 2023.\n\nAustin last held talks with his Chinese counterpart when he spoke with the then defence minister of China Wei Fenghe in Cambodia in November 2022. Dong was appointed China's Defence minister in December. China then named General Li Shangfu as its defence minister.\n\nIn 2018, the US sanctioned Li under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) when he headed the Equipment Development Department of the Chinese military. The sanctions were related to China's purchase of ten SU-35 combat aircrafts in 2017 and S-400 surface-to-air missile system-related equipment in 2018, according to the State Department, according to a Voice of America report.\n\nUS President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping last year in November near San Francisco to reopen direct military-to-military talks at several levels.\n\nIn January this year, senior US and Chinese defence officials gathered for two days at the Pentagon to discuss defence relations between the two countries.\n\nEarlier in April, US and Chinese officials held talks aimed at ensuring professional and safe interactions between the two countries' air and naval forces.\n\nHigh-level military communication channels had been closed since Beijing shut them down to protest the 2022 visit to Taiwan by the then-US. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nChina has laid claim on the South China sea while Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam claim the areas around their coasts.\n\nAn international court ruled in 2016 that China's nine-dash line, on which Beijing bases its claim, was without merit.\n\nRepresentatives from over 40 countries, including Ukraine, along with around 350 journalists, are expected to attend the annual Shangri-la conference that began today and will go on till Sunday, organized by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS).

The forum comes at a time of increasing naval assertiveness by China in the South China Sea and the US's military exercises aimed at maintaining freedom of navigation. Key figures, including US and Chinese defense ministers, are expected to meet to discuss reducing tensions.\n\nGovernment leaders, defence officials and diplomats from around the world are gathering in Singapore for Asia's premier security forum this weekend, at a time of increasing tension and competition for influence between the US and China in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nBeijing in recent years has been rapidly expanding its navy and is becoming growingly assertive in pressing its claim to virtually the entire South China Sea, which has led to an increasing number of direct conflicts with other countries in the region, most notably the Philippines and Vietnam.\n\nThe US, meantime, has been ramping up military exercises in the region with its allies to underscore its \"free and open Indo-Pacific\" concept, meant to emphasise freedom of navigation through the contested waters, including the Taiwan Strait.\n\nChina also claims the democratic self-governing island of Taiwan, and has said it would not rule out using force to take it.\n\nSince territorial hostilities with China surged last year in the South China Sea, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s administration has taken steps to forge new security alliances with a number of Asian and Western countries and allowed a US military presence in more Philippine bases under a 2014 defence pact.\n\nMarcos opens this year's Shangri-La Dialogue, hosted by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, with a keynote address on Friday.\n\nThis week, Marcos already expressed concerns over a new law issued by China giving its coast guard license to seize foreign ships \"that illegally enter China's territorial waters\" and to detain foreign crews for up to 60 days. The same law also made new reference to 2021 legislation that says China's coast guard can fire upon foreign ships if necessary.\n\nWith Philippines ships now regularly confronted by the Chinese, there are concerns that a low-level confrontation could lead to an escalation, said Eugene Tan, a professor of international law at the Singapore Management University.\n\n\"I don't think these countries are really looking to go to war with each other, but the concern with these skirmishes is that sometimes when you have a miscalculation, then things could rapidly deteriorate into the use of force,\" he said.\n\n\"And I think the last thing that countries in the region would want, particularly as they focus on the post-pandemic recovery, would be to have a regional conflict at the doorstep.\" This year's conference comes just a week after China held massive military drills around Taiwan, staging a simulated blockade of the island after it inaugurated a new government that refuses to accept Beijing's insistence that the island is part of China.\n\nChina regards Taiwan as a renegade province that must come under its control, by force if necessary.\n\nThe US, like most countries, does not have formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan but is bound by its own laws to provide the island with the means to defend itself. The US called China's military exercises \"reckless''.\n\nBilateral contact between the American and Chinese militaries broke down in 2022 after then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, infuriating Beijing.\n\nThat has slowly been re-established in recent months, and US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin and Chinese Defence Minister Dong Jun, who are both attending the Shangri-La dialogue, were expected to meet with each other on Friday even before the forum begins.\n\nIt will be the first face-to-face meeting the two have had since direct talks broke down, though they have spoken previously by phone.\n\nTan said he wouldn't expect any breakthroughs from the talks, but that it was important that the two were in direct contact to \"reduce the temperature\" between the two countries.\n\n\"We would probably be expecting too much of the Shangri-La dialogue to expect any sort of concrete moves forward,\" he said. \"The Shangri-La dialogue is really providing the opportunity for very incremental steps in trust and confidence building.\" Austin is due to address the forum on Saturday morning, while Dong will on Sunday, the final day.\n\n(This story has not been

Marcos Jr, who has said new South China Sea rules outlined by China's coast guard were an escalation and \"worrisome\".\n\nMarcos told reporters on Wednesday it was significant that he was asked to talk about the South China Sea and that he would present his country's position on the issue.\n\n\"This affects the region and it affects the world,\" he said.\n\nApart from the U.S. delegation headlining Saturday's speech and China featuring on Sunday, this year's edition includes a special session by Indonesia's President-elect Prabowo Subianto, who has said Indonesia was very open to both the U.S. and China.\n\nAnalysts say the dialogue is useful for the bilateral and multilateral military-to-military meetings on the sidelines of plenary sessions and speeches delivered by defence ministers.\n\nThe Russians have been absent from the security meeting since 2022, when the Russian military invaded Ukraine. No Israeli delegation signed up to attend this year.\n\nLast year, China had declined to meet the U.S. delegation. The U.S.-Sino relationship has improved since the last Shangri-la Dialogue, however, and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin will meet his Chinese counterpart, Dong Jun, on Friday.\n\nAustin aims to cool tensions with China even as he brings up regional and global security issues, while reassuring Asian allies that Washington is committed to helping the region counter China.\n\nIn Beijing, China's defence ministry spokesperson Wu Qian said on Thursday that Dong is heading to the Singapore conference but did not confirm a meeting with Austin.\n\n\"China believes that high level China-U.S. strategic military communications helps stabilise military to military relations, China maintains an open attitude towards this,\" Wu said.\n\nDrew Thompson, a former Pentagon official who is now a scholar at the National University of Singapore, cautioned that the conversation might not lead to meaningful outcomes.\n\n\"The U.S. and China have so little trust or consensus about common interests. It doesn't strike me that the dialogue is working towards achieving common objectives, so they are just reading talking points to each other, pushing positions without agreeing on where to go,\" he said.\n\nCollin Koh, a security scholar at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, agreed.\n\n\"The schism between the two powers is so deep that the Sino-U.S. rivalry has become a structural reality,\" he said. \"Maintaining strategic communications is perhaps the best thing we could hope to ensure this strategic contestation doesn't degenerate further.\"\n\nEYES ON CHINA\n\nAlthough analysts expect the strong Western turnout at the dialogue to keep some focus on Ukraine and Gaza, issues related to China will most likely be front and centre.\n\nKoh said Marcos' keynote would put South China Sea issues on the agenda and Taiwan Strait issues will also be raised by the U.S. and close allies.\n\n\"Taiwan is surely a matter of international security concern, especially given the recent Chinese military exercises, but beyond the flagging of crisis stability risks and the potential spectre of tensions erupting into outright armed conflict, I suppose most regional participants will try to avoid making this the dominant agenda for discussion considering the political sensitivities,\" Koh said.\n\nThompson said China had antagonised many of its neighbours, and these countries would look to the U.S. to provide security while deepening cooperation.\n\n\"We've seen pretty rapid development of the security relationship between Korea and Japan, Australian and Japan, the Philippines and Japan, and South Korea providing more and more arms to the region, particularly Southeast Asia,\" he said. \"This is largely in response to China and its much more aggressive foreign policy and its military build up, which is conducted in a very opaque way.\"\n\n(Reporting by Xinghui Kok; additional reporting by Flores Mikhail in Manila, Idrees Ali in Washington and Greg Torode in Hong Kong.

The U.S. defense secretary expressed Washington's concerns about North Korea's \"direct contributions to Russia's ongoing assault on Ukraine.\"\n\nDong reiterated that China has maintained a \"just and impartial position\" on the Ukraine conflict, honored the promise of not providing weapons to either side in the war and strictly controlled the \"export of military items and dual-use goods in accordance with relevant laws and regulations.\"\n\nHe urged the United States not to shift the blame for the ongoing war onto China and said that Beijing will continue to play a constructive role in promoting peace talks, according to Wu.\n\nThe Chinese Defense Ministry said the two sides will have ongoing consultations regarding future exchanges between the two militaries, with engagements between military academies and potential bilateral policy dialogues being the potential starting point.\n\n\"We believe that having meetings is better than no meeting and having dialogues is better than having no dialogue at all,\" Wu told journalists, adding that bilateral exchanges like this meeting can help develop \"the sound and stable\" military-to-military relationship.\n\nSome analysts say the meeting between Austin and Dong is mainly focusing on \"posturing\" and sharing the fundamental and core interests and red lines from Beijing and Washington's perspectives.\n\n\"The talk is not about negotiation or high-level diplomacy but more about establishing lines of communication for the hard work that usually goes on at the lower level,\" Stephen Nagy, a regional security expert at the International Christian University in Japan, told VOA.\n\nWhile military-to-military communication between Beijing and Washington is important and has the effect of de-escalating growing regional tensions, one thing that remains to be seen is whether the Chinese side will \"pick up the phone\" in the event of an actual crisis.\n\n\"Due to the nature of China's political system, power has been highly centralized under Xi Jinping, [so] we are not sure if our Chinese counterpart would be able to pick up the phone, communicate and make decisions in a crisis situation,\" he added.\n\nDespite this uncertainty, some experts say conversations between defense leaders remain \"incredibly helpful.\" The two officials \"can have a conversation about intentions that's incredibly stabilizing to the overall relationship, [but] I don't think there is a lot of room for adjusting each side's red lines,\" Rorry Daniels, managing director of the Asia Society Policy Institute, told VOA by phone.\n\nBut with tensions rising in several parts of Asia, including the Taiwan Strait, South China Sea, and the Korean Peninsula, some observers, say Friday's dialogue between Austin and Dong will be increasingly crucial for the region, especially at a time when there are two ongoing military conflicts in the world.\n\n\"It is a way both sides can turn down the temperature, exchange information in a multilateral security forum, and have corridor diplomacy, which is extremely important for high-context Asian culture that shies away from talking about volatile issues openly and frankly in the public,\" Lim Tai Wei, Professor at the National University of Singapore, told VOA in a video interview.", "source": {"uri": "voanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "VOA Voice of

Wei retired and was replaced by Gen. Li Shangfu in March 2023.\n\nLi mysteriously vanished after only a few months on the job and was sacked without explanation in October 2023 with no immediate replacement, suggesting drama behind the scenes in the Chinese Communist Party hierarchy. In December, the Party appointed People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) Admiral Dong Jun as Li's belated successor.\n\nAustin and Dong will meet on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue, an Asian defense summit hosted annually by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS). This year's meeting will include sessions on the Myanmar junta and U.S. strategic partnerships in the Indo-Pacific region, among other topics.\n\nChina has been harshly critical of those U.S. alliances in the Indo-Pacific, portraying them as a doomed effort by the United States to contain China's rising power. Beijing has alternately bullied and cajoled Indo-Pacific nations to enter its orbit instead.\n\nTaiwan is certain to be high on the list of subjects Austin and Dong will discuss. China staged several days of belligerent military drills, including simulated missile strikes and bombing runs that would have killed millions of civilians if they were real, after the inauguration of President William Lai Ching-te on May 20.\n\nRELATED: NOT AGAIN... Chinese Navy Ship Harasses U.S. Destroyer During Taiwan Strait Maneuver\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party denounced Lai as a \"separatist,\" the same language it used against his predecessor Tsai Ing-wen, and vowed to continue its campaign of diplomatic isolation against Taiwan.\n\nOn Monday, China was able to block Taiwan from participating as an observer in the World Health Assembly (WHA) for the eighth year in a row, a disturbing demonstration of enduring clout from the Communist tyranny that unleashed the Wuhan coronavirus upon the world.\n\nChina is also throwing its weight around in the South China Sea, using force to secure claims on disputed islands that were decisively rejected by international courts almost a decade ago.\n\nThe government of the Philippines, an important U.S. ally, is increasingly concerned about China's belligerent actions near islands within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone.\n\nOn Wednesday, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr., said China's new rules of engagement for its coast guard forces, which could result in the detention of Filipinos or other foreign citizens, were an \"escalation of the situation.\" Marcos is scheduled to give the keynote address at the Shangri-La Dialogue.\n\nRelations between the Pentagon and the Chinese Defense Ministry broke down after then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) visited Taiwan in August 2022. China suspended high-level military talks with the United States in retaliation for Pelosi's visit, but Chinese dictator Xi Jinping agreed to restart them when he met with President Joe Biden in San Francisco in November 2023.\n\nThose military dialogues have not fully resumed yet, almost seven months after Xi made his promise, so Austin and Dong will likely discuss the next steps when they meet in Singapore. The Pentagon announced the Austin-Dong meeting last week, describing it as the follow-up to a teleconference between the two defense chiefs on April 16, but offered no details of the agenda for talks in Singapore.\n\nAustin underwent a medical procedure at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Friday night to deal with bladder issues after his treatment for prostate cancer in December. The Pentagon stated his procedure was successful and \"no changes in his official schedule are anticipated at this time,\" presumably including his trip to Singapore.\n\nThe South China Morning Post (SCMP) anticipated Dong will take a \"tough stance\" with Austin, rejecting all criticism of China's moves against Taiwan and the South China Sea islands.\n\nDong was formerly deputy commander of PLAN forces in both the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea. Interestingly, he has not yet been granted membership in the Central Military Commission (CMC) of the Chinese Communist Party, suggesting his appointment to defense minister could be temporary or provisional. Without a CMC appointment, he has no decision-making power, which theoretically makes him a poor counterpart for Austin. This could also put a great deal of pressure on him to perform well against the U.S. defense chief.\n\nOn the other hand, Dong is not presently under U.S. sanctions - unlike his ill-fated predecessor Li, who was sanctioned by the administration of President Donald Trump in 2018 for buying weapons from Russia. Dong might therefore be in a better position to have constructive talks with Austin.\n\nRELATED: Biden -- U.S. Troops Would Defend Taiwan in Event of Attack from China\n\n\"If Dong and Austin meet, they're likely going to stand their ground on the respective national policies but are likely to agree to seek to maintain crisis stability where possible,\" predicted Collin Koh of the Singapore-based S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.\n\nKoh said \"if\" because the regime in Beijing has not yet confirmed a meeting between Austin and Dong will take place.\n\n\"The U.S. message will emphasize the importance of US alliances and partnerships. The U.S. government can also be expected to emphasize US interest in ensuring stability in the Taiwan situation and South China Sea,\" said Rand Corporation senior defense researcher Timothy Heath.\n\n\"Although China is unlikely to alter its policies in response to the U.S. demands, it is still a good idea to have both sides meet in person and exchange frank views,\" Health suggested.",

Taiwan held presidential election and the inauguration of President Lai Ching-te this month.\n\nThe US Defence official underscored that the United States remains committed to its longstanding one China policy, which is guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the Three US-China Joint Communiques, and the Six Assurances. He also reaffirmed the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.\n\nAusitn also made clear that the United States will continue to fly, sail, and operate -- safely and responsibly -- wherever international law allows. He underscored the importance of respect for high seas freedom of navigation guaranteed under international law, especially in the South China Sea.\n\nThe top US defence official also discussed Russia's unprovoked war against Ukraine and China's role in supporting Russia's defence industrial base. \"The Secretary also expressed concerns about recent provocations from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), including its direct contributions to Russia's ongoing assault on Ukraine,\" the statement read.\n\nToday's meeting follows Austin's April 16 video teleconference call with his Chinese counterpart.\n\nFollowing the meeting Pentagon said the US officials will continue active discussions with their Chinese counterparts about future engagements between defence and military officials at multiple levels.\n\nDefence chiefs and officials from around the world are attending the Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual forum that began here today and will culminate on Sunday.\n\nPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos is scheduled to deliver the Shangri-La Dialogue's keynote speech later today. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had delivered the key note speech at the forum in 2018. Previous keynote speakers have included Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Fumio and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.

Dong Jun discussed Chinese military activities around Taiwan, U.S. operations in the region, North Korea, and China's stance on Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nSenior U.S. defense officials, briefing reporters after the conversation, said Austin also discussed China's \"strategic capabilities\" in regard to space and cyberspace as well as nuclear weapons. In the last several years, Beijing has grown its nuclear arsenal, more than doubling the number of warheads since the start of the decade, according to the Pentagon's analysis.\n\nTop American officials have been warning China for months that continued support for Russia's defense industry -- one of the main reasons Moscow has been able to quickly reconstitute its military -- is unacceptable to Washington.\n\nThat message appeared again in this meeting, one of the American officials said.\n\n\"He [Austin] said quite clearly that if China's support for Russia's defense sector continues, then the United States with our allies will have to take further measures,\" according to the official, who didn't explain what those consequences would be.\n\nAustin and Dong spoke on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue, a defense summit in Singapore that draws officials from across Asia. Austin has attended the event each year in his current role -- except for a yearlong pause during the coronavirus pandemic -- while the U.S. tries to work with more countries in the region, and do so more closely.\n\nThe Pentagon's approach to the Indo-Pacific under the Biden administration has been defined by this kind of team building. The department has expanded defense agreements with Australia, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea and India, among other nations. It has also been able to convince existing allies, in particular Japan and South Korea, to improve their cooperation.\n\nChina's military activities in the region are partly driving these efforts.\n\nChina has repeatedly harassed Philippine vessels trying to resupply an outpost on the Second Thomas Shoal -- a reef in the South China Sea that China claims ownership over, despite a 2016 United Nations ruling stating otherwise. China and the Philippines are among several nations asserting sovereignty over local geographic features.\n\nChina has also grown more aggressive around Taiwan, running a large military exercise around the island weeks before the conference here. China's government considers Taiwan a rogue province and has threatened to take it back by force.\n\nUntil late last year, China's military was conducting what the Pentagon called a series of \"unsafe and unprofessional\" intercepts of U.S. and allied forces. That stopped late last year after President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping met in California.\n\nAustin's meeting with Dong is meant to help improve what some in the region consider an overly tense relationship. Beijing severed military communication with the United States after then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., visited Taiwan in 2022. Since Biden and Xi spoke, the two countries have restarted such talks.\n\nAustin and Dong spoke over the phone in April -- the first time they talked. Dong is China's third defense minister in as many years amid a purge of top military officials due to corruption in the People's Liberation Army.\n\nLast year at the same conference, China's former defense minister declined an offer to meet with Austin, leading to a short handshake between the two. Even though communications have restarted, the lack of agreement between America and China overall often leaves little to talk about.\n\n\"I expect that very little will come out of it,\" Bonnie Glaser, an expert on Sino-U.S. relations at the German Marshall Fund, said of the Austin-Dong summit. \"I think it will be an exchange of talking points.\"\n\nStill, Glaser noted it's good the two sides are engaging each other, a point echoed by the American officials traveling with Austin.\n\nPer the readout, Austin and Dong discussed restarting communication between their two countries' top military officers in the region -- the head of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command and China's eastern and southern theater commanders.\n\nThe conversation also included mention of a Sino-U.S. \"crisis-communications working group\" that would convene by the end of the year.\n\nA separate issue is candor, a second American official said, referencing China's space, nuclear and cyber capabilities.\n\n\"It's continuously been a challenge to engage on those issues,\" the official noted.\n\nBoth Austin and Dong will speak at the conference over the weekend, a symbol of the relationship defining Indo-Pacific security. The International Institute for Strategic Studies, the think tank that hosts the Shangri-La Dialogue, released its annual report on the region ahead of the event. In it, experts warned of a \"draining decade\" marked by competition between the two superpowers that is spilling out beyond issues of security.\n\nTo that end, conversations only have so much value, the first American official noted. China \"remains the Department of Defense's pacing challenge, and no meeting will change that.\"", "source": {"uri": "defensenews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Defense News"}, "authors":

Marcos Jr, who has said new South China Sea rules outlined by China's coast guard were an escalation and \"worrisome\".\n\nMarcos told reporters on Wednesday it was significant that he was asked to talk about the South China Sea and that he would present his country's position on the issue.\n\n\"This affects the region and it affects the world,\" he said.\n\nApart from the U.S. delegation headlining Saturday's speech and China featuring on Sunday, this year's edition includes a special session by Indonesia's President-elect Prabowo Subianto, who has said Indonesia was very open to both the U.S. and China.\n\nAnalysts say the dialogue is useful for the bilateral and multilateral military-to-military meetings on the sidelines of plenary sessions and speeches delivered by defence ministers.\n\nThe Russians have been absent from the security meeting since 2022, when the Russian military invaded Ukraine. No Israeli delegation signed up to attend this year.\n\nLast year, China had declined to meet the U.S. delegation. The U.S.-Sino relationship has improved since the last Shangri-la Dialogue, however, and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin will meet his Chinese counterpart, Dong Jun, on Friday.\n\nAustin aims to cool tensions with China even as he brings up regional and global security issues, while reassuring Asian allies that Washington is committed to helping the region counter China.\n\nIn Beijing, China's defence ministry spokesperson Wu Qian said on Thursday that Dong is heading to the Singapore conference but did not confirm a meeting with Austin.\n\n\"China believes that high level China-U.S. strategic military communications helps stabilise military to military relations, China maintains an open attitude towards this,\" Wu said.\n\nDrew Thompson, a former Pentagon official who is now a scholar at the National University of Singapore, cautioned that the conversation might not lead to meaningful outcomes.\n\n\"The U.S. and China have so little trust or consensus about common interests. It doesn't strike me that the dialogue is working towards achieving common objectives, so they are just reading talking points to each other, pushing positions without agreeing on where to go,\" he said.\n\nCollin Koh, a security scholar at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, agreed.\n\n\"The schism between the two powers is so deep that the Sino-U.S. rivalry has become a structural reality,\" he said. \"Maintaining strategic communications is perhaps the best thing we could hope to ensure this strategic contestation doesn't degenerate further.\"\n\nEYES ON CHINA\n\nAlthough analysts expect the strong Western turnout at the dialogue to keep some focus on Ukraine and Gaza, issues related to China will most likely be front and centre.\n\nKoh said Marcos' keynote would put South China Sea issues on the agenda and Taiwan Strait issues will also be raised by the U.S. and close allies.\n\n\"Taiwan is surely a matter of international security concern, especially given the recent Chinese military exercises, but beyond the flagging of crisis stability risks and the potential spectre of tensions erupting into outright armed conflict, I suppose most regional participants will try to avoid making this the dominant agenda for discussion considering the political sensitivities,\" Koh said.\n\nThompson said China had antagonised many of its neighbours, and these countries would look to the U.S. to provide security while deepening cooperation.\n\n\"We've seen pretty rapid development of the security relationship between Korea and Japan, Australia and Japan, the Philippines and Japan, and South Korea providing more and more arms to the region, particularly Southeast Asia,\" he said. \"This is largely in response to China and its much more aggressive foreign policy and its military build up, which is conducted in a very opaque way.\"\n\n(This story has been refiled to remove an extraneous letter in paragraph 21)\n\nReporting by Xinghui Kok; additional reporting by Flores Mikhail in Manila, Idrees Ali in Washington and Greg Torode in Hong Kong.

It was the US defence secretary's first meeting with a Chinese counterpart since meeting Wei Fenghe in late 2022.\n\nAustin will speak at the Shangri-La Dialogue, the defence forum in Asia sponsored by the Institute for International and Strategic Studies, on Saturday. Dong will follow with a speech on Sunday.\n\nChina called the meeting a \"positive, pragmatic and constructive strategic communication\" and said both sides had shown \"strong interest\" in future meetings.\n\nThe effort to improve communication between the militaries was part of a consensus reached by President Joe Biden and President Xi Jinping in November in an effort to stabilise relations and ensure that competition between the powers \"does not veer into conflict\".\n\nBut contentious topics featured prominently in the talks, which the Chinese defence ministry said lasted 75 minutes.\n\nThe Pentagon said Austin expressed concern about China's \"provocative\" military activity around the Taiwan Strait, and \"reiterated that the PRC [People's Republic of China] should not use Taiwan's political transition -- part of a normal, routine democratic process -- as a pretext for coercive measures\".\n\nLai Ching-te took over as Taiwan's president last week. Washington has criticised Beijing, which has denounced Lai as a \"dangerous separatist\", for conducting its largest military exercises in a year around the island after his inauguration.\n\nIn his inaugural address, Lai stressed the need to protect Taiwan's sovereignty against China.\n\nDong in turn repeated China's position that it regards Taiwan as an internal matter and reiterated Beijing's strong opposition to any US government contact with Taipei.\n\nThe Pentagon said Austin also raised concerns about China's role in supporting Russia's war against Ukraine. Washington has accused Beijing of supplying Moscow with dual-use technologies to rebuild its defence industrial base.\n\nAccording to the Chinese readout, Dong said China had honoured its commitment to not provide weapons to either side, and had limited exports of dual-use goods. Beijing would \"continue to play a constructive role, but we stand firmly against US efforts to shift blame on to us\", said Chinese defence ministry spokesperson Wu Qian.\n\nA senior US defence official said Austin also raised concerns about Chinese \"coercion\" against the Philippines. China's coast guard has repeatedly tried to stop Manila in recent months from supplying troops stationed on the Second Thomas Shoal, a reef inside the Philippines' exclusive economic zone.\n\nAccording to the Chinese readout, Dong objected to the US Army's recent deployment of the Typhon, an intermediate-range missile launch system, to the Philippines, which he warned posed \"a real threat to regional security\".\n\nPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr will also address the forum on Friday, when he is likely to express concern about China's activity in the South China Sea.\n\nWhile Wu urged the US side to \"match their words with deeds\" to realise the consensus reached between Biden and Xi, he acknowledged that the military-to-military relationship was \"at a stage of stabilising from further deterioration\".\n\n\"That doesn't come easily,\" he said.\n\nIn a positive signal, the Pentagon said both sides were working to arrange telephone calls between Admiral Samuel Paparo, the new head of the US Indo-Pacific command, and his Chinese counterparts. China has for several years refused such calls.\n\nA senior US defence official said the sides had not scheduled any calls but were \"encouraged\" by the Chinese response. Wu only said the sides remained in consultations about calls between theatre-level commanders.\n\nThe Pentagon added that the two militaries would convene a \"crisis communications working group\" later this year.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shangri-La_Dialogue", "type":

Dong Jun, is the first face-to-face talks between the two defense chiefs and Austin's first such discussions with a Chinese counterpart since late 2022.\n\nThe meeting, on the sidelines of an annual defense conference in Singapore, takes place against a fraught regional backdrop. Beijing - which wields the world's largest navy - continues to aggressively assert disputed territorial claims in the East and South China Seas, while decrying Washington's efforts to strengthen security ties with key allies like Japan, South Korea and the Philippines.\n\nChina earlier this month staged major war games around Taiwan following the inauguration of the island's new democratically elected president. China's ruling Communist Party claims the self-governing democracy as its own, despite never having controlled it.\n\nIts Coast Guard in recent weeks has also fired water cannons and sought to counter Philippine vessels operating in disputed areas of the South China Sea, stoking already heightened tensions with a US treaty ally in the region.\n\nBeijing has also lashed out at what it sees as provocative moves between the US and its allies, with its Defense Ministry spokesperson on Thursday condemning the deployment of an American missile system during military drills in the Philippines last month.\n\nAustin is expected to raise concerns with Dong about China's support for Russia, US officials said ahead of the meeting. Washington in recent weeks has said dual-use exports from China are bolstering Russia's defense industrial base as it wages war in Ukraine, with US officials warning Beijing against providing Russia with any lethal equipment.\n\nTalks between Austin and Dong are not expected to see substantive progress towards resolving many entrenched issues between them.\n\nAt the core of those contentions is that China does not want to see America exercise its military power in Asia - a region where the US it has deep, historic security ties and seeks to maintain open waterways and deter North Korean aggression, but where China is widely viewed as wanting to establish its dominance.\n\nBut their meeting is seen by international observers as a positive step toward enhancing dialogue that could help to avoid miscommunication or military mishap veering toward conflict.\n\nThe face-to-face follows a call last month between Austin and Dong, who was appointed to his post in late December. The call marked Austin's first at-length conversation with a Chinese counterpart since November 2022.\n\nBeijing had largely suspended high-level military communications following a visit in August of that year from then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan, which sparked Beijing's ire.\n\nThe silence coincided with a period of significant tensions between the two powers, which included high-profile incidents such as a Chinese spy balloon traversing across the continental US and what the US described as an increase in \"coercive and risky\" behavior by Chinese pilots against US aircraft over the East and South China Seas.\n\nUS efforts to re-engage appeared further complicated by the appointment in early 2023 of China's previous Defense Minister Li Shangfu, who had been sanctioned by the US in 2018 over China's purchase of Russian weapons.\n\nAustin and Li had a brief exchange during last year's Shangri-La Dialogue, but no formal talks, with Beijing repeatedly suggesting that the US defense secretary won't get a meeting with Li unless the sanctions were revoked.\n\nEfforts to stabilize that communication hit another complication after Li abruptly vanished from the public eye last August amid a personnel shake-up in Chinese leader Xi Jinping's military ranks.\n\nLi was formally removed from his post without explanation in October and replaced by Dong, a former naval commander, some two months later.\n\nIn China, the defense minister is a largely ceremonial role, serving as the public face of military diplomacy with other countries, while command power resides within the Chinese Communist Party's powerful Central Military Commission led by Xi.\n\nXi and US President Joe Biden had vowed to restore high-level military talks during a summit outside San Francisco in November, seen by both sides as a key step in stabilizing fractious relations.\n\nSeveral weeks later, US and Chinese top generals spoke in a video call, paving the way for this week's in-person meeting between the defense chiefs.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Li Shangfu, who was under US sanctions refused to hold talks with Austin in Singapore in 2023.\n\nAustin last held talks with his Chinese counterpart when he spoke with the then defence minister of China Wei Fenghe in Cambodia in November 2022. Dong was appointed China's Defence minister in December. China then named General Li Shangfu as its defence minister.\n\nIn 2018, the US sanctioned Li under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) when he headed the Equipment Development Department of the Chinese military. The sanctions were related to China's purchase of ten SU-35 combat aircrafts in 2017 and S-400 surface-to-air missile system-related equipment in 2018, according to the State Department, according to a Voice of America report.\n\nUS President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping last year in November near San Francisco to reopen direct military-to-military talks at several levels.\n\nIn January this year, senior US and Chinese defence officials gathered for two days at the Pentagon to discuss defence relations between the two countries.\n\nEarlier in April, US and Chinese officials held talks aimed at ensuring professional and safe interactions between the two countries' air and naval forces.\n\nHigh-level military communication channels had been closed since Beijing shut them down to protest the 2022 visit to Taiwan by the then-US. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nChina has laid claim on the South China sea while Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam claim the areas around their coasts.\n\nAn international court ruled in 2016 that China's nine-dash line, on which Beijing bases its claim, was without merit.\n\nRepresentatives from over 40 countries, including Ukraine, along with around 350 journalists, are expected to attend the annual Shangri-la conference that began today and will go on till Sunday, organized by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS).

Tensions are increasing between China and the US' east Asian allies.\n\nUS and China defense chiefs held their first face-to-face meeting for two years amid escalating tensions over Taiwan and Ukraine.\n\nUS Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met his Chinese counterpart, Minister of National Defense Adm. Dong Jun, at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, the US Department of Defense said Friday.\n\nThe meeting was part of a bid to repair the China-US relationship, which has become severely strained. Last month, China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, said there was a risk relations could \"return to a downward spiral.\"\n\nThe meeting may be among the final opportunities to reset relations and deter Chinese aggression.\n\nTaiwan tensions\n\nAustin discussed China's military exercises around the Taiwan Strait, according to the Pentagon, and \"reiterated that the PRC should not use Taiwan's political transition -- part of a normal, routine democratic process -- as a pretext for coercive measures.\"\n\nThe independent island is the main flash point between Washington and Beijing, with the US signaling that it would help defend it from China, which has long sought to bring it under its control.\n\nDong said that China opposes any US government intervention and that it regards Taiwan as an internal matter.\n\nA central issue on the agenda was reestablishing communication channels between the militaries to head off potential misunderstandings that could result in direct conflict between the nuclear-armed powers.\n\nBeijing's military drills last week, which were among the most threatening China has launched yet, were in response to the inauguration of President William Lai, a champion of Taiwan's independence who is hated by China's government.\n\nChina has also menaced US fighter planes and warships in the region, accusing Washington of seeking to encircle China and curtail what it claims to be its rightful regional ambitions.\n\nThe Pentagon said that \"both sides will resume telephone conversations between theater commanders in the coming months,\" and Austin \"welcomed plans to convene a crisis-communications working group by the end of the year. \"\n\nUkraine remains a flash point\n\nChina and the US also clashed over Beijing's support for Russia in its invasion of Ukraine, which analysts believe China sees as a way of damaging US global power. The US has accused China of supplying Russia with vital dual-use components for its military industry, but China argues that the trade is legitimate.\n\nBut amid a steep downturn in the Chinese economy, China's President Xi Jinping has also softened his stance toward the US in recent months as he seeks US investment.\n\nAt a meeting on the fringes of the APEC summit in San Francisco last year, Xi and President Joe Biden agreed to reopen military communication channels.\n\nIn April, in a meeting with Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Xi said that the relationship between the US and China should be founded on \"mutual respect, peaceful coexistence.\"\n\nAnalysts say the meeting between Austin and Dong is another positive indication of the desire to establish better communications.\n\n\"Even when direct diplomacy fails to resolve key issues, Washington's openness to engage demonstrates to the world that the United States is acting responsibly,\" Paul Triolo, an analyst at the Albright Stonebridge Group, posted on X.\n\n\"Moreover, such engagements provide opportunities to press the Chinese government to change its harmful policies, including support for Russia's war in Ukraine and other threatening actions.\"\n\nThe Pentagon emphasized in its statement that dialogue would continue.\n\n\"Department officials will continue active discussions with their PRC counterparts about future engagements between defense and military officials at multiple levels,\" it said.\n\nBut serious challenges remain.\"The trend for this year has been more engagement, more communications, but not more trust,\" Ian Bremmer, the president and founder of the political-risk consultancy Eurasia Group, told Bloomberg TV last month.\n\nRead the original article on

The same law also made new reference to 2021 legislation that says China's coast guard can fire upon foreign ships if necessary.\n\nWith Philippines ships now regularly confronted by the Chinese, there are concerns that a low-level confrontation could lead to an escalation, said Eugene Tan, a professor of international law at the Singapore Management University.\n\n\"I don't think these countries are really looking to go to war with each other, but the concern with these skirmishes is that sometimes when you have a miscalculation, then things could rapidly deteriorate into the use of force,\" he said.\n\n\"And I think the last thing that countries in the region would want, particularly as they focus on the post-pandemic recovery, would be to have a regional conflict at the doorstep.\"\n\nThis year's conference comes just a week after China held massive military drills around Taiwan, staging a simulated blockade of the island after it inaugurated a new government that refuses to accept Beijing's insistence that the island is part of China.\n\nChina regards Taiwan as a renegade province that must come under its control, by force if necessary.\n\nThe US, like most countries, does not have formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan but is bound by its own laws to provide the island with the means to defend itself. The US called China's military exercises \"reckless\".\n\nBilateral contact between the American and Chinese militaries broke down in 2022 after then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, infuriating Beijing.\n\nThat has slowly been re-established in recent months, and US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin and Chinese Defence Minister Dong Jun, who are both attending the Shangri-La dialogue, were expected to meet with each other on Friday even before the forum begins.\n\nIt will be the first face-to-face meeting the two have had since direct talks broke down, though they have spoken previously by phone.\n\nTan said he wouldn't expect any breakthroughs from the talks, but that it was important that the two were in direct contact to \"reduce the temperature\" between the two countries.\n\n\"We would probably be expecting too much of the Shangri-La dialogue to expect any sort of concrete moves forward,\" he said. \"The Shangri-La dialogue is really providing the opportunity for very incremental steps in trust and confidence building.\"\n\nAustin is due to address the forum on Saturday morning, while Dong will on Sunday, the final day.

China also claims the democratic self-governing island of Taiwan and has said it would not rule out using force to take it.\n\nSince territorial hostilities with China surged last year in the South China Sea, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s administration has taken steps to forge new security alliances with a number of Asian and Western countries and allowed a U.S. military presence in more Philippine bases under a 2014 defense pact.\n\nMarcos opens this year's Shangri-La Dialogue, hosted by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, with a keynote address Friday.\n\nConcerns\n\nThis week, Marcos already expressed concerns over a new law issued by China giving its coast guard license to seize foreign ships \"that illegally enter China's territorial waters\" and to detain foreign crews for up to 60 days. The same law also made new reference to 2021 legislation that says China's coast guard can fire upon foreign ships if necessary.\n\nWith Philippines ships now regularly confronted by the Chinese, there are concerns that a low-level confrontation could lead to an escalation, said Eugene Tan, a professor of international law at the Singapore Management University.\n\n\"I don't think these countries are really looking to go to war with each other, but the concern with these skirmishes is that sometimes when you have a miscalculation, then things could rapidly deteriorate into the use of force,\" he said.\n\n\"And I think the last thing that countries in the region would want, particularly as they focus on the post-pandemic recovery, would be to have a regional conflict at the doorstep.\"\n\nMilitary drills\n\nThis year's conference comes just a week after China held massive military drills around Taiwan, staging a simulated blockade of the island after it inaugurated a new government that refuses to accept Beijing's insistence that the island is part of China.\n\nChina regards Taiwan as a renegade province that must come under its control, by force if necessary.\n\nThe U.S., like most countries, does not have formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan but is bound by its own laws to provide the island with the means to defend itself. The U.S. called China's military exercises \"reckless.\"\n\nBilateral contact between the American and Chinese militaries broke down in 2022 after then-U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, infuriating Beijing.\n\nThat has slowly been reestablished in recent months, and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Chinese Defense Minister Dong Jun, who are both attending the Shangri-La Dialogue, met with each other Friday even before the forum began.\n\nIt was the first face-to-face meeting the two have had since direct talks broke down, though they have spoken previously by phone.\n\nThe two were expected to talk about establishing a channel of direct communication between military commanders responsible for the area around Taiwan and the rest of the region, said Pentagon spokesperson Lt. Col.

Taiwan held presidential election and the inauguration of President Lai Ching-te this month.\n\nThe US Defence official underscored that the United States remains committed to its longstanding one China policy, which is guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the Three US-China Joint Communiques, and the Six Assurances. He also reaffirmed the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.\n\nAusitn also made clear that the United States will continue to fly, sail, and operate -- safely and responsibly -- wherever international law allows. He underscored the importance of respect for high seas freedom of navigation guaranteed under international law, especially in the South China Sea.\n\nThe top US defence official also discussed Russia's unprovoked war against Ukraine and China's role in supporting Russia's defence industrial base. \"The Secretary also expressed concerns about recent provocations from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), including its direct contributions to Russia's ongoing assault on Ukraine,\" the statement read.\n\nToday's meeting follows Austin's April 16 video teleconference call with his Chinese counterpart.\n\nFollowing the meeting Pentagon said the US officials will continue active discussions with their Chinese counterparts about future engagements between defence and military officials at multiple levels.\n\nDefence chiefs and officials from around the world are attending the Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual forum that began here today and will culminate on Sunday.\n\nPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos is scheduled to deliver the Shangri-La Dialogue's keynote speech later today. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had delivered the key note speech at the forum in 2018.

Dong Jun, left, and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, right.\n\nSingapore CNN --\n\nThe US and Chinese defense chiefs are holding a rare in-person meeting Friday as the two powers navigate a contentious security landscape across the Asia-Pacific and a range of frictions between them from China's intimidation of Taiwan to American's strengthening alliances in the region.\n\nThe meeting, between US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and China's Minister of National Defense Adm. Dong Jun, is the first face-to-face talks between the two defense chiefs and Austin's first such discussions with a Chinese counterpart since late 2022.\n\nThe meeting, on the sidelines of an annual defense conference in Singapore, takes place against a fraught regional backdrop. Beijing - which wields the world's largest navy - continues to aggressively assert disputed territorial claims in the East and South China Seas, while decrying Washington's efforts to strengthen security ties with key allies like Japan, South Korea and the Philippines.\n\nChina earlier this month staged major war games around Taiwan following the inauguration of the island's new democratically elected president. China's ruling Communist Party claims the self-governing democracy as its own, despite never having controlled it.\n\nIts Coast Guard in recent weeks has also fired water cannons and sought to counter Philippine vessels operating in disputed areas of the South China Sea, stoking already heightened tensions with a US treaty ally in the region.\n\nBeijing has also lashed out at what it sees as provocative moves between the US and its allies, with its Defense Ministry spokesperson on Thursday condemning the deployment of an American missile system during military drills in the Philippines last month.\n\nAustin is expected to raise concerns with Dong about China's support for Russia, US officials said ahead of the meeting. Washington in recent weeks has said dual-use exports from China are bolstering Russia's defense industrial base as it wages war in Ukraine, with US officials warning Beijing against providing Russia with any lethal equipment.\n\nTalks between Austin and Dong are not expected to see substantive progress towards resolving many entrenched issues between them.\n\nAt the core of those contentions is that China does not want to see America exercise its military power in Asia - a region where the US it has deep, historic security ties and seeks to maintain open waterways and deter North Korean aggression, but where China is widely viewed as wanting to establish its dominance.\n\nBut their meeting is seen by international observers as a positive step toward enhancing dialogue that could help to avoid miscommunication or military mishap veering toward conflict.\n\nSevered ties\n\nThe face-to-face follows a call last month between Austin and Dong, who was appointed to his post in late December. The call marked Austin's first at-length conversation with a Chinese counterpart since November 2022.\n\nBeijing had largely suspended high-level military communications following a visit in August of that year from then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan, which sparked Beijing's ire.\n\nThe silence coincided with a period of significant tensions between the two powers, which included high-profile incidents such as a Chinese spy balloon traversing across the continental US and what the US described as an increase in \"coercive and risky\" behavior by Chinese pilots against US aircraft over the East and South China Seas.\n\nUS efforts to re-engage appeared further complicated by the appointment in early 2023 of China's previous Defense Minister Li Shangfu, who had been sanctioned by the US in 2018 over China's purchase of Russian weapons.\n\nAustin and Li had a brief exchange during last year's Shangri-La Dialogue, but no formal talks, with Beijing repeatedly suggesting that the US defense secretary won't get a meeting with Li unless the sanctions were revoked.\n\nEfforts to stabilize that communication hit another complication after Li abruptly vanished from the public eye last August amid a personnel shake-up in Chinese leader Xi Jinping's military ranks.\n\nLi was formally removed from his post without explanation in October and replaced by Dong, a former naval commander, some two months later.\n\nIn China, the defense minister is a largely ceremonial role, serving as the public face of military diplomacy with other countries, while command power resides within the Chinese Communist Party's powerful Central Military Commission led by Xi.\n\nXi and US President Joe Biden had vowed to restore high-level military talks during a summit outside San Francisco in November, seen by both sides as a key step in stabilizing fractious relations.\n\nSeveral weeks later, US and Chinese top generals spoke in a video call, paving the way for this week's in-person meeting between the defense chiefs.\n\nCNN's Alex Stambaugh contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri":

first in-person meeting at this level in 18 months.\n\nIt comes days after China sent warships and fighter jets near Taiwan, a source of geopolitical tension for the United States and China.\n\nUS Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin and Chinese Defence Minister Dong Jun began their meeting at 12.50pm at the Shangri-La Hotel, ahead of the Shangri-La Dialogue which starts on Friday night.\n\nBoth men had previously spoken over the phone in April, during which they discussed contentious issues including the South China Sea and the Strait of Taiwan.\n\nThis followed a meeting between US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping in San Francisco in November, when they agreed to resume military communication - severed after then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan in August 2022.\n\nBoth countries have since emphasised the need for senior military-to-military communication to prevent unintended conflict.\n\nThe Chinese defence minister who attended last year's Shangri-La Dialogue, General Li Shangfu, had turned down Mr Austin's invitation to meet then, as the US had not removed sanctions placed on him for his role in procuring equipment from Russia.\n\nGen Li then disappeared from public view a few months after the June forum and was removed in October.\n\nAdmiral Dong, who was formerly the Navy chief, replaced Gen Li as defence minister in December.",

Marcos Jr, who has said new South China Sea rules outlined by China's coast guard were an escalation and \"worrisome\".\n\nMarcos told reporters on Wednesday it was significant that he was asked to talk about the South China Sea and that he would present his country's position on the issue.\n\n\"This affects the region and it affects the world,\" he said.\n\nApart from the U.S. delegation headlining Saturday's speech and China featuring on Sunday, this year's edition includes a special session by Indonesia's President-elect Prabowo Subianto, who has said Indonesia was very open to both the U.S. and China.\n\nAnalysts say the dialogue is useful for the bilateral and multilateral military-to-military meetings on the sidelines of plenary sessions and speeches delivered by defence ministers.\n\nThe Russians have been absent from the security meeting since 2022, when the Russian military invaded Ukraine. No Israeli delegation signed up to attend this year.\n\nLast year, China had declined to meet the U.S. delegation. The U.S.-Sino relationship has improved since the last Shangri-la Dialogue, however, and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin will meet his Chinese counterpart, Dong Jun, on Friday.\n\nAustin aims to cool tensions with China even as he brings up regional and global security issues, while reassuring Asian allies that Washington is committed to helping the region counter China.\n\nIn Beijing, China's defence ministry spokesperson Wu Qian said on Thursday that Dong is heading to the Singapore conference but did not confirm a meeting with Austin.\n\n\"China believes that high level China-U.S. strategic military communications helps stabilise military to military relations, China maintains an open attitude towards this,\" Wu said.\n\nDrew Thompson, a former Pentagon official who is now a scholar at the National University of Singapore, cautioned that the conversation might not lead to meaningful outcomes.\n\n\"The U.S. and China have so little trust or consensus about common interests. It doesn't strike me that the dialogue is working towards achieving common objectives, so they are just reading talking points to each other, pushing positions without agreeing on where to go,\" he said.\n\nCollin Koh, a security scholar at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, agreed.\n\n\"The schism between the two powers is so deep that the Sino-U.S. rivalry has become a structural reality,\" he said. \"Maintaining strategic communications is perhaps the best thing we could hope to ensure this strategic contestation doesn't degenerate further.\"\n\nAlthough analysts expect the strong Western turnout at the dialogue to keep some focus on Ukraine and Gaza, issues related to China will most likely be front and centre.\n\nKoh said Marcos' keynote would put South China Sea issues on the agenda and Taiwan Strait issues will also be raised by the U.S. and close allies.\n\n\"Taiwan is surely a matter of international security concern, especially given the recent Chinese military exercises, but beyond the flagging of crisis stability risks and the potential spectre of tensions erupting into outright armed conflict, I suppose most regional participants will try to avoid making this the dominant agenda for discussion considering the political sensitivities,\" Koh said.\n\nThompson said China had antagonised many of its neighbours, and these countries would look to the U.S. to provide security while deepening cooperation.\n\n\"We've seen pretty rapid development of the security relationship between Korea and Japan, Australian and Japan, the Philippines and Japan, and South Korea providing more and more arms to the region, particularly Southeast Asia,\" he said. \"This is largely in response to China and its much more aggressive foreign policy and its military build up, which is conducted in a very opaque way.\"\n\n(Reporting by Xinghui Kok; additional reporting by Flores Mikhail in Manila, Idrees Ali in Washington and Greg Torode in Hong Kong.

Dong on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue, a premier security summit held annually in Singapore. The two defense leaders discussed global and regional security dynamics, including Taiwan and the South China Sea.\n\nAccording to the Pentagon's readout, Mr. Austin delivered the U.S. concerns about the Chinese military's \"provocative\" activities around Taiwan.\n\nWhile the United States does not have diplomatic relations with Taiwan, it maintains robust ties with the democratic island under a framework set out in the Taiwan Relations Act, which obliges Washington to provide Taipei with the means to defend itself.\n\nDuring the meeting with Adm. Dong, Mr. Austin underscored the U.S. commitment to \"its longstanding one China policy, which is guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the Three U.S.-China Joint Communiques, and the Six Assurances,\" the Pentagon statement reads. \"He also reaffirmed the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.\"\n\nMr. Austin reiterated the American position to Adm.

Dong Jun discussed aggressive Chinese behavior around Taiwan, the freedom for U.S. forces to operate in the region, North Korea, and China's support for Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nSenior U.S. defense officials, briefing reporters after the conversation, said that Austin also discussed China's \"strategic capabilities,\" such as space, cyber and nuclear weapons. In the last several years, Beijing has led a faster-than-expected nuclear buildup, more than doubling its number of warheads since the start of the decade.\n\nTop American officials have been warning China for months that continued support for Russia's defense industry -- one of the main reasons Moscow has been able to quickly reconstitute its military -- is unacceptable to Washington.\n\nThat message appeared again in this meeting, one of the American officials said.\n\n\"He [Austin] said quite clearly that if China's support for Russia's defense sector continues, then the United States with our allies will have to take further measures,\" according to the official, who didn't explain what those consequences would be.\n\nAustin and Dong spoke on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue, a defense summit in Singapore that draws officials from across Asia. As secretary, Austin has attended the event each year -- excepting a yearlong pause during the coronavirus pandemic -- while the U.S. tries to work with more countries in the region, and do so more closely.\n\nThe Pentagon's approach to the Indo-Pacific during Joe Biden's presidency has been defined by this kind of team building. It's expanded defense agreements with Australia, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea and other countries, such as India. And it's gotten existing allies, in particular Japan and South Korea, to better cooperate.\n\nMotivating those changes, in part, has been an increasingly assertive China.\n\nBeijing has harassed Philippine vessels trying to resupply an outpost on Second Thomas Shoal -- a reef in the South China Sea that China claims ownership over, despite a 2016 United Nations ruling stating otherwise. It's also grown more aggressive around Taiwan, running a large military exercise around the island only weeks before the conference here.\n\nChina's government considers Taiwan a rogue breakaway province that will eventually unite with the mainland, by force if necessary.\n\nUntil late last year, China's military was conducting what the Pentagon called a series of \"unsafe and unprofessional\" intercepts of U.S. and allied forces. The military equivalent to cutting off a car on the highway, the intercepts risked a collision that could spiral into a crisis. They stopped late last year after Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping met in California.\n\nAustin's meeting with Dong is meant to help cool what many in the region thought was an overheating relationship. Beijing severed military communication with the United States after then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan in the summer of 2022. Since Biden and Xi spoke, the two countries have restarted such talks.\n\nAustin and Dong spoke over the phone in April -- the first time they talked. Dong is China's third defense minister in as many years amid a purge of top military officials due to corruption in the People's Liberation Army. Last year at the same conference, China's former defense minister declined an offer to meet with Austin, leading to a short, awkward handshake between the two.\n\nEven though communications have restarted, the lack of agreement between America and China overall often leaves little to talk about.\n\n\"I expect that very little will come out of it,\" said Bonnie Glaser, an expert on U.S.-China relations at the German Marshall Fund, of the Austin-Dong summit. \"I think it will be an exchange of talking points.\"\n\nGlaser cautioned that she still thinks it's good for the two sides to engage, a point echoed by the American officials traveling with Austin.\n\nPer the readout, Austin and Dong discussed restarting communication between their two countries' top military officers in the region -- the head of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command and China's Eastern and Southern Theater commanders.\n\nThe conversation also included mention of a U.S.-China \"crisis-communications working group\" that would convene by the end of the year.\n\nA separate issue is candor, a second American official said, referencing China's space, nuclear and cyber capabilities specifically.\n\n\"It's continuously been a challenge to engage on those issues,\" the official said.\n\nBoth Austin and Dong will speak at the conference over the weekend, a symbol of the relationship defining Indo-Pacific security. The International Institute for Strategic Studies, the think tank that hosts Shangri-La, released its annual report on the region just before the dialogue began. In it, experts warned of a \"draining decade\" marked by competition between the two superpowers that is spilling out beyond issues of security.\n\nTo that end, conversations only have so much value, the first American official noted.\n\nChina \"remains the Department of Defense's pacing challenge and no meeting will change that.\"", "source": {"uri": "defensenews.com", "dataType": "news",

Marcos Jr, who has said new South China Sea rules outlined by China's coast guard were an escalation and \"worrisome\".\n\nMarcos told reporters on Wednesday it was significant that he was asked to talk about the South China Sea and that he would present his country's position on the issue.\n\n\"This affects the region and it affects the world,\" he said.\n\nApart from the U.S. delegation headlining Saturday's speech and China featuring on Sunday, this year's edition includes a special session by Indonesia's President-elect Prabowo Subianto, who has said Indonesia was very open to both the U.S. and China.\n\nAnalysts say the dialogue is useful for the bilateral and multilateral military-to-military meetings on the sidelines of plenary sessions and speeches delivered by defence ministers.\n\nThe Russians have been absent from the security meeting since 2022, when the Russian military invaded Ukraine. No Israeli delegation signed up to attend this year.\n\nLast year, China had declined to meet the U.S. delegation. The U.S.-Sino relationship has improved since the last Shangri-la Dialogue, however, and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin will meet his Chinese counterpart, Dong Jun, on Friday.\n\nAustin aims to cool tensions with China even as he brings up regional and global security issues, while reassuring Asian allies that Washington is committed to helping the region counter China.\n\nIn Beijing, China's defence ministry spokesperson Wu Qian said on Thursday that Dong is heading to the Singapore conference but did not confirm a meeting with Austin.\n\n\"China believes that high level China-U.S. strategic military communications helps stabilise military to military relations, China maintains an open attitude towards this,\" Wu said.\n\nDrew Thompson, a former Pentagon official who is now a scholar at the National University of Singapore, cautioned that the conversation might not lead to meaningful outcomes.\n\n\"The U.S. and China have so little trust or consensus about common interests. It doesn't strike me that the dialogue is working towards achieving common objectives, so they are just reading talking points to each other, pushing positions without agreeing on where to go,\" he said.\n\nCollin Koh, a security scholar at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, agreed.\n\n\"The schism between the two powers is so deep that the Sino-U.S. rivalry has become a structural reality,\" he said. \"Maintaining strategic communications is perhaps the best thing we could hope to ensure this strategic contestation doesn't degenerate further.\"\n\nEYES ON CHINA\n\nAlthough analysts expect the strong Western turnout at the dialogue to keep some focus on Ukraine and Gaza, issues related to China will most likely be front and centre.\n\nKoh said Marcos' keynote would put South China Sea issues on the agenda and Taiwan Strait issues will also be raised by the U.S. and close allies.\n\n\"Taiwan is surely a matter of international security concern, especially given the recent Chinese military exercises, but beyond the flagging of crisis stability risks and the potential spectre of tensions erupting into outright armed conflict, I suppose most regional participants will try to avoid making this the dominant agenda for discussion considering the political sensitivities,\" Koh said.\n\nThompson said China had antagonised many of its neighbours, and these countries would look to the U.S. to provide security while deepening cooperation.\n\n\"We've seen pretty rapid development of the security relationship between Korea and Japan, Australian and Japan, the Philippines and Japan, and South Korea providing more and more arms to the region, particularly Southeast Asia,\" he said. \"This is largely in response to China and its much more aggressive foreign policy and its military build up, which is conducted in a very opaque way.\"\n\n(Reporting by Xinghui Kok; additional reporting by Flores Mikhail in Manila, Idrees Ali in Washington and Greg Torode in Hong Kong.

'constructive' talks in Singapore", "body": "BEIJING: Chinese Defense Minister Dong Jun and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Friday exchanged views on China-U.S. relations, military-to-military ties, the Taiwan question, the South China Sea issue, the Ukraine crisis and the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.\n\nDong and Austin held talks on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue, Asia's annual defense and security forum, in Singapore on Friday afternoon, the first in-person meeting between Chinese and U.S. defense chiefs since November 2022.\n\n\"It was a positive, pragmatic and constructive strategic communication,\" said Wu Qian, a spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of National Defense, at a press briefing after the meeting, which lasted 75 minutes, longer than the previously scheduled one hour.\n\nThe talks took place according to the agreement between China and the U.S., said Wu.\n\n\"Generally speaking, the talks have helped both sides enhance understanding of each other to avoid miscalculations,\" said Wu.\n\nAs a next step, the two sides will continue to maintain communication and exchanges through military and diplomatic channels, the spokesperson told reporters in Singapore.\n\nOn military-to-military relations\n\nDuring the talks, Dong said the relationship between the two militaries has stabilized, which is hard-won, and the two militaries should adhere to the bottom line of non-conflict and non-confrontation and serve as a real, stable cornerstone of China-U.S. relations, according to a statement issued by the Chinese Ministry of National Defense.\n\nThe purpose of communication between the two militaries is to enhance understanding, eliminate misunderstandings and accumulate mutual trust, said Dong.\n\nThe Chinese defense minister urged the U.S. side not to disregard facts, shift blame, shirk responsibility or attempt to discredit and suppress others.\n\nHe also noted that a sound development of a military-to-military relationship between China and the United States is in the common interest of both sides, and also follows the general expectation of the international community.\n\nThe Chinese defense minister expressed hope that the U.S. will be consistent in its words and deeds, act in the same direction as the Chinese side, and effectively implement the common understandings reached by the two heads of state.\n\nBoth sides should adhere to the principles of peace, stability and trust, strengthen exchanges, take responsibility, and promote exchanges, so as to explore a way for the two militaries to get along with each other that is in line with their mutual interests and meets the expectations of the rest of the world, said Dong.\n\nOn the Taiwan question\n\nThe Chinese defense minister stated China's solid position on the Taiwan question.\n\nDong said the Taiwan question is an utterly internal affair for China in which external forces have no right to interfere, in comments referring to the U.S. side sending \"congratulations\" and a delegation when Lai Ching-te assumed the role of the Taiwan region's new leader weeks ago.\n\nWhat the U.S. has done seriously violates the one-China principle and the three China-U.S. joint communiques, breaches its commitments, and sends a seriously wrong signal to \"Taiwan independence\" separatist forces, he said. \"The Chinese side is resolutely opposed to this.\"\n\nDong urged the U.S. to correct its wrongdoing, abide by the one-China principle, and not to assist \"Taiwan independence\" with force in any way.\n\nOn the South China Sea issue\n\nChina opposes the deployment of a mid-range missile system by the U.S. in the Philippines under the excuse of military exercises, Dong told Austin during the talks.\n\nThat poses a substantial threat to regional security, he said.\n\nDong said the Philippines' faithless and provocative acts on Ren'ai Jiao are closely related to instigation and support from external forces.\n\nChina will continue to resolve differences through consultations on an equal footing on the basis of commitments being honored, but will not condone intensified provocative acts, he said.\n\nOn the Ukraine crisis\n\nDong said China will continue to promote peace talks and play a constructive role in the Ukraine crisis, but it firmly opposes the shifting of blame or dodging of responsibility by the U.S. side.\n\nChina has always maintained an objective and impartial position, and has been promoting a political settlement to the crisis, he said.\n\nThe Chinese side has honored its commitments, refrained from supplying weapons to the two sides in the conflict, and exercised strict control over the export of dual-use items in accordance with law, he said.\n\nOn Middle East tensions\n\nDong also urged the U.S. to abandon double standards and play a positive role in bringing peace back to the Middle East region.\n\nHe noted that the worsening humanitarian catastrophe in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict has caused strong dissatisfaction among people all over the world.\n\nChina and a vast majority of countries have been actively promoting a ceasefire, Dong said, urging the U.S. to show its responsibility as a major country through practical actions.", "source": {"uri": "pakistantoday.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "pakistantoday.com.pk"}, "authors":

The exercises drew concern from several countries, including the United States, Japan, Australia and the European Union.\n\nThe military drills around Taiwan, which were aimed at testing Beijing\u2019s capabilities to blockade the island, were in direct response to Taiwanese leader William Lai Ching-te\u2019s presidential inauguration speech on May 20, which Beijing said was provocative and sent out a \u201cdangerous signal\u201d on Taiwan independence.\n\nThe exercises also came after months of intense confrontations between Chinese coastguard vessels and their Filipino counterparts in disputed waters in the South China Sea.\n\nThe Chinese delegation led by Dong is prepared to use the platform to assert itself in the face of Western criticism for its manoeuvring around Taiwan and in the South China Sea, according to Collin Koh, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.\n\n\u201cBeijing likely already anticipated Taiwan and South China Sea issues will be raised in the forum, but it probably already also prepared to stand its ground on these to stave off sharp questions and comments that are expected from delegates anyway,\u201d Koh said.\n\nDong, the former commander of the PLA Navy, assumed the role of defence minister last December after his predecessor, Li Shangfu, was removed from the post two months earlier. Beijing still has not offered any explanation for the removal of Li, China\u2019s shortest serving defence minister.\n\nBetween 2017 and 2021, he served as deputy commander of the Southern Theatre Command, which oversees the South China Sea. In 2013 and 2014, he served in the East Sea Fleet, which operates in the Taiwan Strait. Both regions have been flashpoints for China. Before that, he served in the North Sea Fleet, which is now a regular player in joint drills with Russia\u2019s navy.\n\nHowever, unlike his counterparts in the United States and other Western countries, as China\u2019s defence minister Dong\u2019s role is primarily as a public representative of the armed forces who mostly handles military diplomacy.\n\nMoreover, Dong\u2019s full promotion appears to be provisional.\n\nUnlike his predecessors, Dong is not yet a member of the Communist Party\u2019s Central Military Commission (CMC), the body that holds the actual command power that is chaired by President Xi Jinping.\n\n\u201cThe PLA defence minister does not command any troops, does not have control over budgets \u2026 and at this point is not even a member of the CMC, so he has no decision-making authority, and is a poor counterpart to the [US] secretary of defence who oversees the defence department and sits in the president\u2019s cabinet,\u201d said Drew Thompson, a visiting senior research fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, at National University of Singapore.\n\nBeijing has yet to confirm if there will be a meeting between Dong and Austin during the forum \u2013 a platform for bilateral and multilateral engagement between defence officials \u2013 while the Pentagon said last week that Austin was preparing to meet Dong during the forum.\n\nDong\u2019s predecessor, Li, had only met Austin briefly at the 2023 Shangri-la Dialogue, which amounted to a handshake and a brief exchange of words. Li was still on a US sanction list at that time over the purchase of military hardware from Russia\u2019s main arms exporter.\n\nThompson did not have high expectations for a meeting between Dong and Austin which he said could be \u201cperformative, intended to signal other countries rather than a sustained, concerted effort to manage differences\u201d.\n\nKoh, from Singapore, said: \u201cIf Dong and Austin meet, they\u2019re likely going to stand their ground on the respective national policies but are likely to agree to seek to maintain crisis stability where possible \u2026 Both Beijing and Washington plausibly recognise the growing need to maintain viable strategic communications.\n\n\u201cIn view of the potentially escalatory scenarios over [the South China Sea] and Taiwan, maintaining this link becomes all the more crucial,\u201d Koh said, adding that he had yet to see both countries fundamentally converging on how they view confidence and security-building measures that are designed to reduce the risks of conflict.\n\nNi Lexiong, a Shanghai-based military analyst, said one \u201cobstacle\u201d for the two defence chiefs had been removed since Dong was not under US sanctions, but he played down the significance of the meeting given the current military rivalry between the two sides.", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South China

Marcos Jr, who has said new South China Sea rules outlined by China's coast guard were an escalation and \"worrisome\".\n\nMarcos told reporters on Wednesday it was significant that he was asked to talk about the South China Sea and that he would present his country's position on the issue.\n\n\"This affects the region and it affects the world,\" he said.\n\nApart from the U.S. delegation headlining Saturday's speech and China featuring on Sunday, this year's edition includes a special session by Indonesia's President-elect Prabowo Subianto, who has said Indonesia was very open to both the U.S. and China.\n\nAnalysts say the dialogue is useful for the bilateral and multilateral military-to-military meetings on the sidelines of plenary sessions and speeches delivered by defence ministers.\n\nThe Russians have been absent from the security meeting since 2022, when the Russian military invaded Ukraine. No Israeli delegation signed up to attend this year.\n\nLast year, China had declined to meet the U.S. delegation. The U.S.-Sino relationship has improved since the last Shangri-la Dialogue, however, and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin will meet his Chinese counterpart, Dong Jun, on Friday.\n\nAustin aims to cool tensions with China even as he brings up regional and global security issues, while reassuring Asian allies that Washington is committed to helping the region counter China.\n\nIn Beijing, China's defence ministry spokesperson Wu Qian said on Thursday that Dong is heading to the Singapore conference but did not confirm a meeting with Austin.\n\n\"China believes that high level China-U.S. strategic military communications helps stabilise military to military relations, China maintains an open attitude towards this,\" Wu said.\n\nDrew Thompson, a former Pentagon official who is now a scholar at the National University of Singapore, cautioned that the conversation might not lead to meaningful outcomes.\n\n\"The U.S. and China have so little trust or consensus about common interests. It doesn't strike me that the dialogue is working towards achieving common objectives, so they are just reading talking points to each other, pushing positions without agreeing on where to go,\" he said.\n\nCollin Koh, a security scholar at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, agreed.\n\n\"The schism between the two powers is so deep that the Sino-U.S. rivalry has become a structural reality,\" he said. \"Maintaining strategic communications is perhaps the best thing we could hope to ensure this strategic contestation doesn't degenerate further.\"\n\nEYES ON CHINA\n\nAlthough analysts expect the strong Western turnout at the dialogue to keep some focus on Ukraine and Gaza, issues related to China will most likely be front and centre.\n\nKoh said Marcos' keynote would put South China Sea issues on the agenda and Taiwan Strait issues will also be raised by the U.S. and close allies.\n\n\"Taiwan is surely a matter of international security concern, especially given the recent Chinese military exercises, but beyond the flagging of crisis stability risks and the potential spectre of tensions erupting into outright armed conflict, I suppose most regional participants will try to avoid making this the dominant agenda for discussion considering the political sensitivities,\" Koh said.\n\nThompson said China had antagonised many of its neighbours, and these countries would look to the U.S. to provide security while deepening cooperation.\n\n\"We've seen pretty rapid development of the security relationship between Korea and Japan, Australian and Japan, the Philippines and Japan, and South Korea providing more and more arms to the region, particularly Southeast Asia,\" he said. \"This is largely in response to China and its much more aggressive foreign policy and its military build up, which is conducted in a very opaque way.\"", "source": {"uri": "investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China_Sea", "type":

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nIt came on the sidelines of the Shangri-La defense forum, Asia's premier security conference, which features defense officials, government leaders and diplomats from around the world.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe weekend talks are being held as wars rage in Gaza and Ukraine, and at a time of increasing tensions and competition for influence between the United States and China in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nBeijing in recent years has been rapidly expanding its navy and is becoming growingly assertive in pressing its claim to virtually the entire South China Sea, which has led to an increasing number of direct conflicts with other countries in the region, most notably the Philippines and Vietnam.\n\nThe U.S., meantime, has been ramping up military exercises in the region with its allies to underscore its \"free and open Indo-Pacific\" concept, meant to emphasize freedom of navigation through the contested waters, including the Taiwan Strait. China also claims the democratic self-governing island of Taiwan and has said it would not rule out using force to take it.\n\nAustin, who is due to address the conference on Saturday, reiterated the American position to Dong during their talks, according to Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder.\n\n\"The secretary made clear that the United States will continue to fly, sail, and operate -- safely and responsibly -- wherever international law allows,\" Ryder said. \"He underscored the importance of respect for high seas freedom of navigation guaranteed under international law, especially in the South China Sea.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nSince territorial hostilities with China surged last year in the South China Sea, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s administration has taken steps to forge new security alliances with a number of Asian and Western countries and allowed a U.S. military presence in more Philippine bases under a 2014 defense pact.\n\nMarcos opens this year's conference, hosted by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, with a keynote address Friday.\n\nThis week, Marcos already expressed concerns over a new law issued by China giving its coast guard license to seize foreign ships \"that illegally enter China's territorial waters\" and to detain foreign crews for up to 60 days. The same law also made new reference to 2021 legislation that says China's coast guard can fire upon foreign ships if necessary.\n\nWith Philippines ships now regularly confronted by the Chinese, there are concerns that a low-level confrontation could lead to an escalation, said Eugene Tan, a professor of international law at the Singapore Management University.\n\n\"I don't think these countries are really looking to go to war with each other, but the concern with these skirmishes is that sometimes when you have a miscalculation, then things could rapidly deteriorate into the use of force,\" he said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"And I think the last thing that countries in the region would want, particularly as they focus on the post-pandemic recovery, would be to have a regional conflict at the doorstep.\"\n\nThis year's conference comes just a week after China held massive military drills around Taiwan, staging a simulated blockade of the island after it inaugurated a new government that refuses to accept Beijing's insistence that the island is part of China.\n\nChina regards Taiwan as a renegade province that must come under its control, by force if necessary.\n\nThe U.S., like most countries, does not have formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan but is bound by its own laws to provide the island with the means to defend itself.\n\nIn his talks with Dong, Austin reiterated that the United States remains committed to the one-China policy, but \"expressed concern\" about the recent Chinese exercises, Ryder said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAustin told Dong that China \"should not use Taiwan's political transition -- part of a normal, routine democratic process -- as a pretext for coercive measures,\" Ryder said.\n\nChina and the U.S. have been gradually restoring defense contacts since they broke down over Pelosi's visit to Taiwan, and Austin and Dong already talked with each other by video conference in April.\n\nIn their meeting Friday, Austin emphasized the importance of keeping open lines of military-to-military communication between American and Chinese commanders, and said \"both sides will resume telephone conversations between theater commanders in the coming months,\" Ryder said.\n\nChinese Defense Ministry spokesperson Wu Qian told reporters after the meeting that it showed the decline in military relations had now stabilized and that the resumption of direct communications was an important step.\n\n\"The communications between the two militaries aims to enhance understanding, eliminate misunderstanding, accumulate mutual trust and achieve stability in relations,\" he said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nMeia Nouwens, a Chinese security and defense expert with the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said that while the resumption of direct communications is important, talking is the minimum that should be expected of two great powers.\n\nDirect military communications are meant to allow commanders to defuse a situation before it escalates, but Nouwens cautioned it will only be effective if Chinese leaders give their commanders the \"political leeway to respond in the moment.\"\n\n\"We have to remember that there is a different political system in each of these two countries and therefore the commanders do not necessarily operate in the same way, or have the same level of political ability to make decisions in the moment or respond,\" she said.\n\nAustin is due to address the forum Saturday morning, while Dong will speak on Sunday, the final day.\n\n___\n\nAP journalists Syawalludin Zain in Singapore and Tara Copp in Washington contributed to this story.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES

The Pentagon said U.S. Department of Defense officials \"will continue active discussions with their PRC counterparts about future engagements between defense and military officials at multiple levels.\"", "source": {"uri": "cnbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNBC"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lim_hui_jie@cnbc.com", "name": "Lim Hui Jie", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd_Austin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lloyd Austin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan_Strait", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan Strait"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admiral", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Admiral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of Defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "One China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wu (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President of the People's Republic of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xi Jinping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videotelephony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Videotelephony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Defense", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Conferences", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Military", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107422447-1717142185135-gettyimages-2154757004-AFP_34U92QN.jpeg?v=1717142217&w=1920&h=1080", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9607060", "eventUri": "eng-9607060", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

warned of war over the US-backed island following the inauguration of President Lai Ching-te, who Beijing has described as a \"dangerous separatist\".\n\nThe dispute over democratic Taiwan, which Beijing considers part of its territory, tops the disputes between the rivals.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's administration and China have been stepping up communication to ease friction between the nuclear-armed rivals, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken visiting Beijing and Shanghai last month.\n\nA key focus has been the resumption of military-to-military dialogue.\n\nChina scrapped military communications with the United States in 2022 in response to then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan.\n\nTensions between Washington and Beijing were stoked further during 2023 by issues including an alleged Chinese spy balloon that was shot down over US airspace, a meeting between Taiwan's then-president Tsai Ing-wen and Pelosi's successor Kevin McCarthy, and American

The event is expected to host over 550 representatives from defence and security institutions from more than 40 countries, highlighting the forum's significance in addressing military and security challenges in the Asia-Pacific region. The Shangri-La Dialogue is crucial in maintaining military dialogue between China and the United States.\n\nChina-US relations have deteriorated in recent years as the United States has intensified economic restrictions on China. In the military domain, the United States has grown increasingly insecure and views China as a military challenge. This perception is influenced by various factors, including China's comprehensive rise, which the U.S. sees as a challenge to its hegemony in the Asia-Pacific region. The U.S. fears that these advancements could disrupt the existing military balance and threaten its regional interests.\n\nThe US has been strengthening its containment of China in the Asia-Pacific region through a series of \"mini-multilateral\" frameworks. In Northeast Asia, the leaders of the United States, Japan, and South Korea held a summit at Camp David in 2023, bringing a trilateral military alliance closer to reality. In the South China Sea, the United States and the Philippines resumed joint military exercises in 2023, which had been suspended, and signed a new defence cooperation agreement allowing the US military to use more military bases in the Philippines. During the 2024 military exercises, the US deployed medium-range missile systems on the Philippine island of Luzon for the first time since the end of the Cold War. Beyond the region, the United States has also strengthened the trilateral security partnership AUKUS with Australia and the United Kingdom, aiming to introduce NATO into the Asia-Pacific. From China's perspective, the United States' regional military strategy in the Asia-Pacific is to gradually connect its alliance agreements with regional countries, forming a collective military system similar to NATO, thereby creating a confrontation between camps.\n\nHowever, the more tense the relationship, the more critical the dialogue between China and the United States at the Shangri-La Dialogue becomes. The absence of dialogue can lead to dangerous assumptions and miscalculations, increasing the risk of unintended escalations and conflicts. The current tensions in China-U.S. military relations are evident in the South China Sea, where the US has been conducting more frequent military drills with the Philippines and countries outside the region, which China perceives as provocative. These actions by the U.S. are a significant factor contributing to the potential for regional conflicts, highlighting the urgency of high-level military dialogue between the two countries.\n\nAccording to the agenda released on the International Institute for Strategic Studies website, the conference's organiser, this year's plenary sessions are divided into seven sections, covering topics such as strengthening crisis management in competition and challenges to the cross-regional security order. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. will also attend and deliver a speech at the dialogue following recent friction between China and the Philippines in the South China Sea. It is foreseeable that there will be many debates during this dialogue. However, debates can sometimes be beneficial, while silence is dangerous. As Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese stated at the opening ceremony of the Shangri-La Dialogue in 2023, dialogue serves as a necessary \"guardrail\" between nations, and \"the silence of the diplomatic deep freeze\" poses greater risks.\n\nAlthough competition between China and the United States is inevitable, the dialogue provides a platform for both countries to express their views, reduce misunderstandings, and explore potential areas of cooperation. Through candid discussions, even if they involve debates, both countries can better understand each other's perspectives and strive to find common ground.\n\nConsidering the differences in strategic interests, it must be acknowledged that the path to improving China-US military relations will be challenging. However, the Shangri-La Dialogue - successfully held 20 times since its inception in 2002, has rapidly expanded in scale and has become one of the most influential multilateral platforms for discussing Asia-Pacific security - could be a crucial starting point for both countries to engage in meaningful dialogue, manage competition, and prevent direct conflicts.\n\nAs the world closely watches the interactions between China and the United States, both nations must seize this opportunity to demonstrate their willingness to communicate and work towards a more stable and secure future for the Asia-Pacific region. In the current situation, China and the United States should leverage this vital platform to enhance understanding, reduce misjudgments, explore opportunities for cooperation, and jointly contribute to stability and security in the Asia-Pacific region.", "source": {"uri": "johnmenadue.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pearls and Irritations"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Li was China\u2019s defence minister at the time, but was ousted a few months later and replaced with Dong in December.\n\nDong and Austin held their first direct talks by phone in April, when Austin underscored the \u201cimportance of respect for high seas freedom of navigation guaranteed under international law, especially in the South China Sea\u201d.\n\nAnalysts say the meeting in Singapore is highly likely to go ahead and will be positive for military ties, but they expect the two sides to remain adamant in their positions on the South China Sea and other hot-button issues.\n\nBenjamin Barton, an associate professor at the University of Nottingham\u2019s Malaysia campus, said Beijing and Washington would continue to push for their own visions of the South China Sea.\n\nHe expected the US to stress \u201cthe need for calm to protect stability and the status quo in light of recent flare-ups between Beijing and Manila\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt also represents an opportunity for both sides to size each other up in terms of potential strategic developments in the short and medium term,\u201d he said.\n\nTimothy Heath, a senior international defence researcher at the Rand Corporation, said exchanging views and building trust could \u201chelp facilitate efforts to manage tensions\u201d and may \u201cencourage them to work together to de-escalate any situation that may arise\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe US message will emphasise the importance of US alliances and partnerships. The US government can also be expected to emphasise US interest in ensuring stability in the Taiwan situation and South China Sea,\u201d Heath said.\n\n\u201cAlthough China is unlikely to alter its policies in response to the US demands, it is still a good idea to have both sides meet in person and exchange frank views.\u201d\n\nZachary Abuza, a professor at the National War College in Washington who specialises in Southeast Asia, said that while the Shangri-La Dialogue would be an opportunity for the two countries to address sensitive issues, practical changes to the South China Sea dispute were unlikely given that Beijing had \u201cno incentive to stop\u201d its actions.\n\n\u201cWhile the US sees China as taking reputational costs from bullying smaller states, Beijing sees it as a sign of strength,\u201d Abuza said, adding that China had faced \u201cfew costs for its actions, so why stop?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am more hopeful that the Singapore gathering will be an opportunity for US and Chinese defence ministers to resume their communications, as there are a host of sensitive issues that really need to be addressed.\u201d\n\nThat view was echoed by Collin Koh, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, who said the fact that they will meet at all \u201cis a good thing\u201d. It follows an agreement between leaders Xi Jinping and Joe Biden in November to restore military communication channels.\n\nKoh noted there had been a gradual improvement in military-to-military interactions. But he expected both sides to \u201cdig their heels in\u201d on issues they were not prepared to compromise on, and he said Dong\u2019s stance at the forum was likely to be just as tough as his predecessors, Li and Wei.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese defence minister isn\u2019t exactly the top military decision-maker. He\u2019s the face of China\u2019s defence establishment,\u201d Koh said, adding that Dong would \u201chave to maintain that tough stance\u201d.\n\nChinese defence ministers have less direct authority in the military than their counterparts in other countries and instead act mainly as the military\u2019s public representative. The power of command rests with the Central Military Commission, chaired by President Xi.\n\nThe three-day Shangri-La Dialogue is likely to see heated debate over the South China Sea, as it has in previous years, as the US and China assert their demands.\n\nChina claims much of the resource-rich waterway but the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei have overlapping claims. An international tribunal dismissed China\u2019s territorial and maritime claims to the South China Sea in 2016 as having no legal basis, but Beijing rejected the ruling and has continued to build outposts on islands and atolls that it controls.\n\nWhile Washington does not have any territorial claims in the disputed waters, it is committed to upholding the freedom of navigation in the South China Sea and supporting its southeast Asian allies, such as the Philippines.\n\nPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr\u2019s keynote speech on the first day of the Singapore forum will be closely watched given the mounting tensions between Manila and Beijing.\n\nIn recent months there have been frequent run-ins between the Chinese and Philippine coastguards near the disputed Scarborough Shoal, a rich fishing ground, and Second Thomas Shoal, where a rusting warship is used as a Philippine military outpost. These tense confrontations have seen water cannons fired and vessels colliding.\n\nChina sent \u201cby far the largest\u201d force to blockade Scarborough Shoal earlier this month, according to former US Air Force official Ray Powell. He said at least four coastguard and 26 large maritime militia ships attempted to \u201cenforce [China\u2019s] claim over the shoal\u201d, which it took control of in 2012.\n\nThat took place days ahead of a Philippine civilian-led supply mission to fishing boats near the disputed atoll. The organisers of the convoy said they had to abandon plans to sail close to Scarborough Shoal after being shadowed by a Chinese vessel.\n\nLast month, the Philippines held its first joint naval drills with the US, Japan and Australia in the South China Sea, prompting China to conduct air and naval patrols in response.\n\nThe US and the Philippines also wrapped up their annual Balikatan joint military exercise this month \u2013 held for the first time beyond the Philippines\u2019 territorial waters. It was followed by an announcement from the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army that it had carried out anti-missile and anti-submarine drills in the South China Sea.\n\nStephen Nagy, a professor of international relations at the International Christian University in Tokyo, said that in his speech at the forum, Marcos Jnr was likely to frame the South China Sea dispute and China\u2019s efforts to \u201cdominate\u201d the region as \u201chighly destabilising\u201d.\n\nNagy expected Marcos Jnr to point to Beijing\u2019s increasing use of grey-zone, or non-military, activities \u2013 such as merchant vessel swarm tactics and the use of water cannons \u2013 which he said were aimed at \u201cneutralising Manila\u2019s abilities to demonstrate sovereignty\u201d.\n\n\u201cI expect him to also highlight that through mini-lateral cooperation with the US, Japan and Australia that Manila is using partnerships to resist revisionist behaviour of China to dominate the region,\u201d he said.\n\nBarton from University of Nottingham Malaysia said Marcos Jnr was likely to \u201cstick to the script\u201d in his speech.\n\nThat would include repeating the line that the Philippines must \u201cdefend what it perceives as its national sovereignty in the face of strategic encroachment and acts of intimidation by the Chinese around the Scarborough Shoal\u201d.\n\n\u201cAt this stage of his term, I don\u2019t see how it would make sense for Marcos to deviate from this affirmed stance. It\u2019s important for him to continue to stand up to China both because it plays to his political distinctiveness \u2013 especially when compared to his predecessor \u2013 and courage at home,\u201d Barton said.\n\n\u201c[Marcos Jnr is] building up his political capital internationally as he is seen as standing up to an emerging powerhouse despite the power asymmetries at stake \u2013 including the importance of trade and investments with and from mainland China.\u201d\n\nBut Koh with the RSIS in Singapore said Marcos Jnr could use the Shangri-La Dialogue to highlight the South China Sea and other security issues and as a chance to open a dialogue with Beijing.\n\nHis speech will likely stress \u201cthat the Philippines is willing to engage in dialogue with China and will not foreclose any peaceful means to address the dispute with China\u201d, according to Koh.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, I think he\u2019s going to emphasise the importance of working collectively with like-minded countries around the region and abroad. So, of course, he\u2019s going to also likely highlight and emphasise the fact that his foreign policy isn\u2019t, in a way, anti-China per se.\u201d", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType":

The last time defense chiefs from the two countries met was in November 2022, when Austin met Dong's predecessor, then-Defense Minister Wei Fenghe. China suspended military-to-military dialogue with the US in 2022 amid soaring tensions over then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan. Though US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed last November to restore some military-to-military communications, issues including Taiwan and the South China Sea remain a source of sharp dispute between the two nations. Earlier this week, the State Department's China coordinator lambasted a senior Chinese diplomat over Beijing's \"dangerous and destabilizing\" actions in the South China Sea and military actions near Taiwan, while China's Foreign Ministry demanded that the US stop playing the \"Taiwan card.\" A Pentagon spokesperson on Wednesday declined to reveal what key topics will be discussed during Austin's meeting with Dong, but the last time the two spoke, they covered a range of security-related topics including Taiwan, the South China Sea, North Korea and Ukraine. Chinese Embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu in comments to Sputnik noted that the two militaries have conducted a series of exchanges and cooperation aimed at stabilizing and improving the bilateral relationship. Beijing hopes the US side will work with the Chinese government in good faith to avoid conflict and confrontation, he added. At the summit in Singapore, Austin will also participate in a series of other meetings, including with Singapore's new Prime Minister Lawerence Wong and other senior Singaporean officials. He will also engage in a multilateral meeting with his counterparts from Southeast Asia, and a Trilateral Ministerial Meeting (TMM) with his counterparts from Japan and South Korea. Austin is also scheduled to travel to France and Cambodia after his stop in Singapore. While in Cambodia, Austin will meet with senior government officials. Austin will conclude his trip in France to participate in several commemorative events for the 80th anniversary of D-Day on June 6.", "source": {"uri": "sputnikglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Austin III, and China's minister of defense held their first face-to-face talks in 18 months on Friday, against a backdrop of distrust over Taiwan, the South China Sea and other regional disputes.\n\nThe meeting in Singapore between Mr. Austin and Adm. Dong Jun, his Chinese counterpart, came after a succession of Biden administration officials has traveled to Beijing for talks about trade imbalances, U.S. restrictions on technology sales to China, Chinese support for Russia throughout its war against Ukraine and other sources of tension.\n\nPresident Biden has made the case that high-level communication channels between the United States and China had to remain open to prevent potential clashes between two of the world's most powerful militaries. Yet military issues have remained the most intractable area of tension between the two nations, and expectations for the meeting between the defense chiefs in Singapore were modest.\n\n\"These are not negotiations with the intention to compromise,\" said Drew Thompson, a visiting senior research fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore who formerly served as a Pentagon official dealing with the Chinese military. \"This is an opportunity for the two sides to exchange well-established talking points.\"\n\nThe military rivalry between the two powers is rooted in longstanding disputes that are not easily resolved. These include China's claim to Taiwan, the island democracy that relies on the United States for security, and Beijing's increasingly assertive claim over vast swaths of the South China Sea, which has alarmed its neighbors.\n\nAdmiral Dong became defense minister late last year after his predecessor abruptly disappeared, apparently caught up in expanding inquiries into corruption or other misdeeds in the People's Liberation Army.

Dong Jun, is the first face-to-face talks between the two defense chiefs and Austin's first such discussions with a Chinese counterpart since late 2022.\n\nThe meeting, on the sidelines of an annual defense conference in Singapore, takes place against a fraught regional backdrop. Beijing - which wields the world's largest navy - continues to aggressively assert disputed territorial claims in the East and South China Seas, while decrying Washington's efforts to strengthen security ties with key allies like Japan, South Korea and the Philippines.\n\nChina earlier this month staged major war games around Taiwan following the inauguration of the island's new democratically elected president. China's ruling Communist Party claims the self-governing democracy as its own, despite never having controlled it.\n\nIts Coast Guard in recent weeks has also fired water cannons and sought to counter Philippine vessels operating in disputed areas of the South China Sea, stoking already heightened tensions with a US treaty ally in the region.\n\nBeijing has also lashed out at what it sees as provocative moves between the US and its allies, with its Defense Ministry spokesperson on Thursday condemning the deployment of an American missile system during military drills in the Philippines last month.\n\nAustin is expected to raise concerns with Dong about China's support for Russia, US officials said ahead of the meeting. Washington in recent weeks has said dual-use exports from China are bolstering Russia's defense industrial base as it wages war in Ukraine, with US officials warning Beijing against providing Russia with any lethal equipment.\n\nTalks between Austin and Dong are not expected to see substantive progress towards resolving many entrenched issues between them.\n\nAt the core of those contentions is that China does not want to see America exercise its military power in Asia - a region where the US it has deep, historic security ties and seeks to maintain open waterways and deter North Korean aggression, but where China is widely viewed as wanting to establish its dominance.\n\nBut their meeting is seen by international observers as a positive step toward enhancing dialogue that could help to avoid miscommunication or military mishap veering toward conflict.\n\nhttps://t.me/apa_az/84348\n\nT\u00fcrkiye's Akinci UAV identifies source of heat suspected to be crash site of Iranian

He said the department \"will continue to engage in active discussions with [People's Republic of China] counterparts about future engagements between defense and military officials at multiple levels.\"\n\nA new channel (the prospect of which was raised by a columnist in Foreign Policy earlier this week) would be the latest in a series of moves by Washington and Beijing to increase dialogue between their two militaries amid rising regional tensions. Indeed, Austin's in-person meeting with Dong on the sidelines of the Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore will be his first.\n\nThe US has raised concerns about China's increasingly assertive behavior in the East and South China Seas, as well as its aggression toward Taiwan and clashes with the Philippines. Just last week, the Chinese military conducted large-scale drills around Taiwan following the inauguration of the self-governing island's new president, Lai Ching-te.\n\nA spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington did not explicitly answer whether China wants the new dialogue but noted to Semafor that US President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping agreed in November 2023 to conduct \"telephone conversations between theater commanders on the basis of equality and respect.\"\n\n\"Recently, China and the United States have carried out a series of military exchanges,\" embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu told Semafor. \"China is willing to continue to work with the United States to implement relevant consensus.\"\n\nKnow More\n\nLyle Morris, a senior fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute, told Semafor that creating the channel would be a \"positive move,\" but that its overall impact was likely to be minimal.\n\n\"[Hotlines] are very limited in utility and value because of how the PRC approaches crisis communications,\" Morris said. Whoever is \"picking up the phone on the [People's Liberation Army] side is going to be very limited in what they can say in real time. Every single thing that is said by the PLA, at any level, has to be vetted, approved, and run up the chain in Beijing.\"\n\n\"If this hotline achieves nothing but the ability for the [Indo-Pacific] commander to pick up the phone during a crisis and say, 'I am seeing situation X, we are preparing to do Y, will you confirm receipt?' And if the PLA says 'copy, confirm receipt,' that's a win for us,\" Morris added.\n\nKurt Campbell, now the No. 2 State Department official, told The Guardian in 2021 that China has generally resisted meaningful military communication. \"In the past, the hotlines that have been set up have just rung, kind of endlessly in empty rooms,\" he said.\n\nEven so, Roy Kamphausen, the president of the National Bureau of Asian Research, told Semafor that a new military channel could have other benefits for the US. \"Participating in mil-mil can play a reassuring role with allies,\" and the Department of Defense has long believed direct communication can help deter adversaries, he said in an email.\n\nThe proposal came up in a call earlier this year during which the Pentagon's Ely Ratner pushed his Chinese counterpart for a dialogue between the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command commander and the heads of China's Eastern and Southern Theater Commands.\n\nMorris told Semafor that a communication line with China's Eastern Theater command would allow the new Indo-Pacific commander, Adm. Samuel Paparo, to establish a rapport with the Chinese commander responsible for China's armed forces near the Taiwan strait. \"Primarily, it's for Taiwan. Because there's such high-tempo operations on both sides around Taiwan that the potential for an accident or crisis to develop is quite high.\"\n\nStep Back\n\nThe increased dialogue between US and Chinese military officials comes despite heightened friction between Washington and Beijing over technology controls, tariffs, and US warnings about China's \"overcapacity.\" China suspended high-level military communications with the US following then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's trip to Taiwan in 2022.

Log in.\n\nThe meeting may be among the final opportunities to reset relations and deter Chinese aggression.\n\nAustin discussed China's military exercises around the Taiwan Strait, according to the Pentagon, and \"reiterated that the PRC should not use Taiwan's political transition -- part of a normal, routine democratic process -- as a pretext for coercive measures.\"\n\nThe independent island is the main flash point between Washington and Beijing, with the US signaling that it would help defend it from China, which has long sought to bring it under its control.\n\nDong said that China opposes any US government intervention and that it regards Taiwan as an internal matter.\n\nA central issue on the agenda was reestablishing communication channels between the militaries to head off potential misunderstandings that could result in direct conflict between the nuclear-armed powers.\n\nBeijing's military drills last week, which were among the most threatening China has launched yet, were in response to the inauguration of President William Lai, a champion of Taiwan's independence who is hated by China's government.\n\nChina has also menaced US fighter planes and warships in the region, accusing Washington of seeking to encircle China and curtail what it claims to be its rightful regional ambitions.\n\nThe Pentagon said that \"both sides will resume telephone conversations between theater commanders in the coming months,\" and Austin \"welcomed plans to convene a crisis-communications working group by the end of the year. \"\n\nChina and the US also clashed over Beijing's support for Russia in its invasion of Ukraine, which analysts believe China sees as a way of damaging US global power. The US has accused China of supplying Russia with vital dual-use components for its military industry, but China argues that the trade is legitimate.\n\nBut amid a steep downturn in the Chinese economy, China's President Xi Jinping has also softened his stance toward the US in recent months as he seeks US investment.\n\nAt a meeting on the fringes of the APEC summit in San Francisco last year, Xi and President Joe Biden agreed to reopen military communication channels.\n\nIn April, in a meeting with Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Xi said that the relationship between the US and China should be founded on \"mutual respect, peaceful coexistence.\"\n\nAnalysts say the meeting between Austin and Dong is another positive indication of the desire to establish better communications.\n\n\"Even when direct diplomacy fails to resolve key issues, Washington's openness to engage demonstrates to the world that the United States is acting responsibly,\" Paul Triolo, an analyst at the Albright Stonebridge Group, posted on X.\n\n\"Moreover, such engagements provide opportunities to press the Chinese government to change its harmful policies, including support for Russia's war in Ukraine and other threatening actions.\"\n\nThe Pentagon emphasized in its statement that dialogue would continue.\n\n\"Department officials will continue active discussions with their PRC counterparts about future engagements between defense and military officials at multiple levels,\" it said.\n\nBut serious challenges remain.\"The trend for this year has been more engagement, more communications, but not more trust,\" Ian Bremmer, the president and founder of the political-risk consultancy Eurasia Group, told Bloomberg TV last month.", "source": {"uri":

Sea.\n\nThe meeting, held on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, a regional security summit, saw Austin and Chinese Defense Minister Dong Jun agree to work on better communications to stabilize military relations and avoid crises, according to a Defense press release. Department. The United States and China will convene a crisis communications working group by the end of the year.\n\nThe two also traded accusations of responsibility for recent tensions between Beijing and Taipei, with Austin expressing concern about China launching large-scale military exercises near Taiwan's airspace and maritime territory, shortly after the inauguration of Taiwanese President Lai Ching-tes last week.\n\nDong accused the United States of sending very wrong signals to Taiwan's separatist forces.\n\nAlthough the meeting did not result in any major announcements, it was long overdue, said Zhou Bo, a retired senior colonel in the Chinese army who currently works at Tsinghua University in Beijing.\n\nZhou said he feared that Taiwan's Lai would prove more provocative than his predecessor, forcing China to conduct even more military exercises around Taiwan and creating a new status quo that Washington does not want to see.\n\nThe United States maintains unofficial relations with Taiwan but does not recognize it as an independent state. However, U.S. policy opposes any Chinese action to forcibly take Taiwan, which China considers its territory, and allows the United States to arm and defend Taiwan.\n\nChina cut off high-level military dialogue with the United States in 2022 to protest then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan. Communications resumed in November when President Biden met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in California.\n\nThe United States has stressed to China the need for such regular exchanges to prevent an accident or military miscalculation in the region from escalating into a crisis. This is particularly important in the South China Sea, where Beijing is engaged in clashes over territorial disputes with US allies like the Philippines, and amid escalating Chinese military activity around Taiwan.\n\nBoth sides said the 75-minute meeting represented progress toward a stabilized relationship. Wu Qian, spokesperson for China's Ministry of National Defense, called it positive, pragmatic and constructive. The United States emphasized China's commitment to resuming on-the-ground telephone conversations within months and convening the Crisis Communications Working Group before the end of the year.\n\nIt's vitally important, said Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Illinois), who attended the conference with a delegation of U.S. lawmakers. We went through a period where Secretary Austin was trying to call and no one was answering the phone. We must have regular contact between our military. And I think it's important for us to officially state our position to each other.\n\nBut there was no sign of progress on the relationship's most contentious issues.\n\nAustin expressed concern over Chinese exercises that surrounded Taiwan, days after Lai was sworn in. [China] Taiwan's political transition, which is part of a normal and routine democratic process, should not be used as a pretext for coercive measures, he said.\n\nDong chastised Washington for sending congratulations and a delegation to the inauguration, and urged the United States to take concrete steps to correct its mistakes, Wu said.\n\nThe standoff over Taiwan and the South China Sea, where China says it is only patrolling its territory and Biden has promised a U.S. response to any attack on Philippine forces or ships, has presented the most daunting obstacles to relaxation.\n\nWe don't want to fight. But there are issues where they are, to some extent, intractable, Adm. Samuel Paparo, commander of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, said Friday during a roundtable discussion.\n\nCui Tiankai, a former Chinese vice foreign minister, who spoke alongside Paparo, suggested that the United States was the real aggressor in the South China Sea.\n\nI don't think anyone should be under the illusion that they could easily violate Chinese sovereignty and integrity without any cost, Cui said.\n\nThe Chinese are also skeptical of the crisis hotline established by Xi and Biden, said Zhao Minghao, a professor of international relations at Fudan University in Shanghai.\n\nChina wants to prevent crises while the US prioritizes crisis management, which gives China the impression that all these communication channels will only encourage the US to create new crises with impunity, he said.\n\nDong, a 63-year-old former Chinese navy chief, was appointed in December, replacing Li Shangfu four months after he abruptly disappeared from public view.\n\nThe reshuffle is part of a broader campaign by Xi that seeks to root out corruption and streamline the command structure to make the People's Liberation Army a world-class force, capable of taking on the United States.\n\nAs defense minister, Dong is primarily responsible for military diplomacy. Operations and strategy are set by Xi and senior officials of the Chinese Communist Party's Central Military Commission. Dong, unlike his predecessor, is not a member of the commission, a fact that some congressional Republicans in attendance pointed out as potentially limiting the meeting's effectiveness.\n\nIt's important to recognize, and I know the secretary does, that this guy is not at all the equivalent of Secretary Austin, said Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), who co-led the Senate delegation with Duckworth. He called the Minister of Defense, but when it comes to the power structure of this country, this government and the Communist Party, he's not even really a player.\n\nDealing with China's rise and its growing frustration with the US presence in areas Beijing considers its backyard has become a difficult exercise for Southeast and East Asian countries. , especially for those who want to strengthen economic ties with China while also relying on the United States for defense. .\n\nManaging concern over Chinese coercion while being optimistic about its economic prospects is now a constant concern for many policymakers in the region, said the International Institute for Strategic Studies, the London-based think tank which organizes the Shangri-La Dialogue, in its annual report. assessment of regional security priorities released Friday.\n\nWhile Beijing's assertiveness has sparked backlash from some, it has also succeeded in deepening its economic and security relations with others, such as Cambodia. U.S. officials have accused China of building a secret naval base in northern Cambodia, although both countries deny it.\n\nLyric Li in Taipei, Taiwan, contributed to this report.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online\n\nLOS ANGELES, CA / ACCESSWIRE / June 24, 2020, / Compare-autoinsurance.Org has launched a new blog post that presents the main benefits of comparing multiple car insurance quotes.

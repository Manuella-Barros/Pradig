The London club have a full squad to choose from except for Cole Palmer and Connor Gallaher. Although many Real Madrid stars are missing, Vinicius Junior will be part of the squad.\n\nChelsea face Real Madrid in the latest of their US-based pre-season friendlies, having lost their last fixture 4-2 to Manchester City over the weekend, in a game they were 2-0 down after five minutes and 4-0 down after 56 minutes. While these are friendlies, purely designed to give players minutes under their belt and to find their feet, for Chelsea they do hold some importance given that over the summer they parted ways with Mauricio Pochettino, a manager who seemed to be getting the best of his squad, and replaced him with Enzo Maresca, a manager who had his fair share of critics last season despite steering Leicester City to the Championship title. For Chelsea, facing Real Madrid will be no less of an arduous task than the City game.\n\nChelsea vs. Real Madrid: Match Information\n\nWhen\n\n7 August 2024\n\nWhere\n\nBank of America Stadium\n\nTime\n\n00:00 BST\n\nLocation\n\nCharlotte, USA\n\nTV\n\nStreamed live on Chelsea's website\n\nRelated Why Chelsea Are Trying to Sell Conor Gallagher\n\nThe Blues have reportedly accepted Atletico Madrid's offer, worth \u00a334 million, for the hard-working midfielder.\n\nForm Guide Chelsea have yet to find any rhythm in pre-season\n\nWhile it wasn't a full-strength Chelsea team that lost to City, there's an argument to suggest it was Chelsea who had more experience on the field, with Moises Caicedo, Reece James, Enzo Fernandez, Mykhailo Mudryk and Christopher Nkunku all starting, while Manchester City made 11 substitutions in the game, bringing on a host of teenagers. Although Chelsea have beaten Mexican side Club America 3-0 in their pre-season campaign, they were also beaten 4-1 by Celtic.\n\nReal Madrid have yet to win in pre-season, albeit they have only played two games, going down 1-0 to AC Milan and then 2-1 to Barcelona on Sunday. Only two players from the starting line-up of Madrid's Champions League Final win over Borussia Dortmund in June started at the weekend against their La Liga rivals. They were Thibaut Courtois and Antonio Rudiger.\n\nBest Odds and Predictions Odds\n\nUnibet are offering 11/10 on a Real Madrid win, with 17/10 on Chelsea being victorious, and a draw at 3/1. Both teams to score is 4/11. Although Chelsea have had some indifferent pre-season results, they have at least scored in every game so far. For both teams not to score it's 9/5. On the over and under betting, they are offering 7/10 on the Spanish side to score more than 1.5 goals and 26/25 to score less than that, with Chelsea being 10/11 to get more than 1.5 goals and 3/4 on getting less.\n\nPrediction\n\nChelsea are likely to have a more experienced team to pick from, but up until now they have been shipping goals in their pre-season campaign. They have played more games than Madrid so far, but the Spaniards will have Vinicius Junior and Endrick to call upon, who could expose any further mistakes Chelsea make at the back, meaning this could result in a Real Madrid win by 2-1.\n\nHead-to-head Record\n\nChelsea vs. Real Madrid competitive matches record\n\nMatches\n\n9\n\nChelsea wins\n\n4\n\nReal Madrid wins\n\n3\n\nDraws\n\n2\n\n19 May 1971\n\nEuropean Cup Winners Cup Final\n\nKaraiskakis Stadium, Greece\n\n1-1 AET\n\n21 May 1971\n\nEuropean Cup Winners Cup Final Replay\n\nKaraiskakis Stadium, Greece\n\nChelsea win 2-1\n\n28 Aug 1998\n\nUEFA Super Cup Final\n\nMonaco\n\nChelsea win 1-0\n\n27 Apr 2021\n\nChampions League semi-final first leg\n\nEstadio Alfredo Di Stefano, Madrid\n\n1-1\n\n5 May 2021\n\nChampions League semi-final second leg\n\nStamford Bridge\n\nChelsea win 2-0\n\n6 Apr 2022\n\nChampions League quarter-final first leg\n\nStamford Bridge\n\nMadrid win 3-1\n\n12 Apr 2022\n\nChampions League quarter-final second leg\n\nBernabeu\n\nChelsea win 3-2\n\n12 Apr 2023\n\nChampions League quarter-final first leg\n\nBernabeu\n\nMadrid win 2-0\n\n18 Apr 2023\n\nChampions League quarter-final second leg\n\nStamford Bridge\n\nMadrid win 2-0\n\nTeam News Madrid's Brazilian stars likely to feature\n\nChelsea have featured a variety of youth and experience in their pre-season campaign so far. It's likely they will continue in such a way. Cole Palmer is still resting after the Euros, while Conor Gallagher appears to be on the verge of leaving for Atletico Madrid. Other than that, Chelsea will have wealth and talent to pick from. Robert Sanchez will probably continue in goal. Reece James should start as captain while Raheem Sterling scored against Manchester City and has been arguably Chelsea's best player in pre-season.\n\nRelated Why Chelsea Have Banished Conor Gallagher From First-Team\n\nChelsea have reportedly told Conor Gallagher he won't be part of the first-team squad next season amid links to Atletico Madrid.\n\nLuka Modric captained Madrid in their friendly with Barcelona, so it's likely he will play a part against Chelsea. Vinicius Junior came on for the last 33 minutes - it's probable that he too will feature against Chelsea. New Brazilian signing Endrick played the first 70 minutes, so Madrid will not be short of attacking options, even in the absence of new signing Kylian Mbappe, who is rumoured to not make his Madrid debut until his new side face Atalanta in the European Super Cup Final in Poland on 14 August. It's unlikely Jude Bellingham will return in a Madrid jersey until then either.\n\nStats via Transfermarkt.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Palmer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cole Palmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_Gallagher", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conor Gallagher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "EFL Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Soccer_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Soccer Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Summer_Time", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British Summer Time"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauricio_Pochettino", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mauricio Pochettino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leicester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mykhailo_Mudryk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mykhailo Mudryk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reece_James_(footballer,_born_1999)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reece James (footballer, born 1999)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karaiskakis_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karaiskakis Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_R\u00fcdiger", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antonio R\u00fcdiger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Club Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thibaut_Courtois", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thibaut Courtois"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Bernab\u00e9u_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Cup_Winners'_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Cup Winners' Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Celtic F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atl\u00e9tico_Madrid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atl\u00e9tico Madrid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A.C.

After all this drama Madrid must start to refocus. With two pre-season losses, this match is their last before the Super Cup final against Atalanta. Vinicius Jr and Rodrygo came on against Barcelona - will we finally see a Brazilian front three that features youngster Endrick?\n\nIt's been an underwhelming pre-season for Chelsea fans. We saw the Blues trying to play the Enzo Maresca way against Man City but mistakes were made and it ended in a 4-2 loss. The Blues seemingly did not have the players but according to Maresca, \"the progress was evident and mistakes were inevitable.\" With fan favourite Connor Gallagher on the way to Atletico Madrid, might a Chelsea young talent shine against Madrid and get a spot for the upcoming season?\n\nEven though it's a friendly, the Real Madrid vs Chelsea live stream promises to be a competitive encounter.

That loss followed an uninspiring 1-0 defeat at the hands of Milan.\n\nCarlo Ancelotti, however, almost certainly won't be concerned by his side's slow start to the summer and there's a chance for Los Blancos to end the tour on a high against a Chelsea side that looks unsure at the start of Enzo Maresca's reign.\n\nThe Blues have won just one of their four pre-season outings so far and were put to the sword by a young Manchester City team on Saturday evening - although it was Erling Haaland who did much of the damage. With the start of the Premier League season closing in, Maresca would love to gain some positive momentum.\n\nHere's 90min's preview of Chelsea vs Real Madrid in Charlotte.\n\nThe Blues have been bolstered by the returns of Moises Caicedo and Enzo Fernandez, who enjoyed extended breaks following their exploits at the Copa America. Both are in contention for starts against Madrid.\n\nVinicius Junior made his first appearance of the tour off the bench against Barcelona and is in line to start on Tuesday evening. Rodrygo is also back in action and ready for minutes. Endrick could lose his place up top, though, given his underwhelming start to the tour.\n\nFederico Valverde has not yet returned to Ancelotti's squad after his Copa America exploits, with David Alaba continuing to nurse his anterior cruciate ligament tear ahead of his comeback later this year.\n\nNico Paz has impressed in the middle of the park and should get the nod against the Blues.\n\nReal Madrid predicted lineup vs Chelsea (4-3-3): Courtois; Vazquez, Militao, Rudiger, Garcia; Paz, Martin, Ceballos; Rodrygo, Guler, Vinicius.\n\nThere have been just a few bright sparks for both of these teams across the pond, with Chelsea enduring plenty of growing pains at the start of Maresca's tenure.

Goalkeeper Filip Jorgensen could make his first appearance for Chelsea having signed from Villarreal this summer. Cole Palmer and Marc Cucurella remain on holiday after Euro 2024.

After tonight, they will take on Atalanta in the UEFA Super Cup before their La Liga opener against Mallorca as they start their defence of their La Liga crown. They are still without seven senior players who have not gone on tour; Fede Valverde, Dani Carvajal, Aurelian Tchouameni, Kylian Mbappe, Eduardo Camavinga, Ferland Mendy and Jude Bellingham. Real Madrid's new signing from Brazil, 18-year-old Endrick, is in the squad and started their last pre-season game against Barcelona.

Real Madrid has lost each of its two friendlies in the United States, including a 2-1 defeat to Barcelona on Saturday.\n\nHere's more details on how you can watch:\n\nHere's some of the latest Real Madrid news, courtesy of the Associated Press:\n\nMADRID (AP) -- Carlo Ancelotti says he expects Real Madrid to be his last club job and is \"not so excited\" about coaching a national team.\n\nAncelotti has a contract at Santiago Bernabeu Stadium for another two years.\n\nLast season, Brazil hoped to lure him.\n\nHowever, the 65-year-old Italian is not enamored by the thought of swapping a club for a country.\n\n\"My idea is that Real Madrid will be my last club,\" he told former Chelsea midfielder Jon Obi Mikel's Obi One podcast. \"If there is an opportunity for a national team, I don't know.\n\n\"I'm not so excited at coaching a national team because I would lose what I like most, the day to day. I really enjoy what I'm doing.\n\n\"This is my season number 29 as a coach. It's true that I have won a lot but imagine the number of titles I lost.\"\n\nAncelotti was the first manager to win the domestic titles at Europe's top five major leagues. He's also the most successful coach in Champions League history: Winning with Madrid in 2014, 2022 and 2024 across two stints, and with AC Milan in 2003 and 2007.", "source": {"uri": "cleveland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cleveland"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirecTV_Stream", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DirecTV Stream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN2", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Ancelotti", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlo Ancelotti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cable television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FuboTV", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FuboTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Bernab\u00e9u_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "A.C.

That loss followed an uninspiring 1-0 defeat at the hands of Milan.\n\nCarlo Ancelotti, however, almost certainly won't be concerned by his side's slow start to the summer and there's a chance for Los Blancos to end the tour on a high against a Chelsea side that looks unsure at the start of Enzo Maresca's reign.\n\nThe Blues have won just one of their four pre-season outings so far and were put to the sword by a young Manchester City team on Saturday evening - although it was Erling Haaland who did much of the damage. With the start of the Premier League season closing in, Maresca would love to gain some positive momentum.\n\nHere's 90min's preview of Chelsea vs Real Madrid in Charlotte.\n\nThe Blues have been bolstered by the returns of Moises Caicedo and Enzo Fernandez, who enjoyed extended breaks following their exploits at the Copa America. Both are in contention for starts against Madrid.\n\nChelsea are still without Cole Palmer and Marc Cucurella, while Conor Gallagher is closing in on a move to Atletico Madrid. Injuries are currently keeping Nicolas Jackson and Axel Disasi out of action.\n\nThere could be a start for new signing Filip Jorgensen in goal, with Raheem Sterling and Noni Madeuke - scorers against Man City - likely to come back into the team.\n\nChelsea predicted lineup vs Real Madrid (4-2-3-1): Jorgensen; James, Badiashile, Colwill, Chilwell; Dewsbury-Hall, Fernandez; Madueke, Nkunku, Sterling; Guiu.\n\nVinicius Junior made his first appearance of the tour off the bench against Barcelona and is in line to start on Tuesday evening. Rodrygo is also back in action and ready for minutes. Endrick could lose his place up top, though, given his underwhelming start to the tour.\n\nFederico Valverde has not yet returned to Ancelotti's squad after his Copa America exploits, with David Alaba continuing to nurse his anterior cruciate ligament tear ahead of his comeback later this year.\n\nNico Paz has impressed in the middle of the park and should get the nod against the Blues.\n\nReal Madrid predicted lineup vs Chelsea (4-3-3): Courtois; Vazquez, Militao, Rudiger, Garcia; Paz, Martin, Ceballos; Rodrygo, Guler, Vinicius.\n\nThere have been just a few bright sparks for both of these teams across the pond, with Chelsea enduring plenty of growing pains at the start of Maresca's tenure. While it's very early doors, there are reasons to be concerned.\n\nThe Blues were suffocated by City last time out but should benefit from facing a Madrid side that showed last season they're far from a coherent unit when trying to win the ball back higher up the pitch.\n\nChelsea should have some success in possession on Tuesday evening but, given the structural issues they've encountered so far, it's hard to imagine the Blues shunning Madrid in Charlotte.\n\nWith a couple of superstars returning, Madrid could run riot in transition and inflict more summer misery on Maresca.", "source": {"uri": "90min.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "90min.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzo_Maresca", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Enzo Maresca"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzo_Fern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raheem_Sterling", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Raheem Sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Ancelotti", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlo Ancelotti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "A.C.

In recent years, the revenue has grown to the point where other teams can't possibly compete, a part of the reason new Galacticos like Kylian Mbappe are joining the team. Manchester City had the highest income before Real Madrid but now the Madrid giants have reclaimed the top spot.\n\nCan the income continue to grow even further? Real Madrid's brand and fanbase are huge and there may even be some ways that they can potentially grow it further. Madrid's Income Opportunities\n\nReal Madrid makes money in a lot of ways, including incredible levels of prize money. UEFA's competitions can be extremely lucrative for teams who are looking to grow their income and Madrid consistently reaches the later rounds of the tournament. Real has won the competition more than anyone else, of course.\n\nAs time goes on, the coverage of sports is becoming more digital and a lot of the teams are taking this further by entering teams in other competitions, including esports. This has happened for a long time now and certain teams have expanded to basketball and similar tournaments. Real Madrid's biggest rivals in Spain come from Barcelona, and they may be an example to follow in terms of embracing esports. If someone looks through the LoL odds on a betting platform, they will notice that there are teams affiliated with other organizations, including Barcelona FC. Sajator and Whiteknight are among the players for the rival Barcelona, and there could potentially be a grudge fixture in online gaming rather than on the football pitch!\n\nReal Madrid's only involvement in some of the esports tournaments has come in the form of EA24 or FIFA games and tournaments, but that could change - games like LoL provide an opportunity to get involved with growing esports industries. The LoL World Championship Finals often get millions of viewers and this is a chance for football teams to get involved and grow their fanbase.\n\nAs long as a lot of people can remember, Real Madrid shirts have flown off the shelves, previously with names like Zidane or Beckham on them! Now, there's a new generation of stars, and one star in particular that has recently joined is Kylian Mbappe.\n\nFollowing on from the World Cup superstar Mbappe, the team has young players who could become superstars in their own right, like young Endrick, who recently revealed his desire to stay with Madrid for his whole career.\n\nMerchandise has long been a huge source of income and revenue for Madrid, and Jude Bellingham is a popular name on the back of shirts, but now the Champions League winners may have some new superstars.\n\nShirt sales aren't the only source of revenue, and the club sells a wide range of merchandise like training gear, and also branded accessories and memorabilia. These products are sold both online and in physical stores, catering to the global fanbase.\n\nThe Real Madrid brand is one of the most recognizable in all of sports and fans spend their money to wear the badge (on everything they can, sometimes). Sponsorship\n\nSuperstars (and the huge brand of Real Madrid) also brings sponsorship opportunities. Forbes shared that Real has the highest shirt value in European club soccer with a deal worth \u20ac190 million from kit supplier Adidas. There is also the sponsor Emirates, which brings in a further \u20ac70 million a year.\n\nCompanies are eager to associate their names with Real Madrid when they consider its global reach and prestigious status. Brand alignment can be very helpful and there are billions of people watching football every year, so a name or logo emblazoned on the shirt can be hugely beneficial. Broadcasting\n\nVirtually every top club team relies on broadcasting rights, worth a fortune to the top European clubs. As well as getting money through this route, Real Madrid has a strong online presence, with millions of followers on social media platforms. This digital footprint allows the club to engage directly with fans and attract advertising revenue. The club also offers a subscription-based service, Real Madrid TV, providing exclusive content to its supporters and having more autonomy about the money from broadcasting - some think that more clubs could go in this direction in the future. Conclusion\n\nMadrid's income is already eye-watering for a lot of people, and it is easy to understand why top players gravitate towards the team (as do the top trophies). We haven't even discussed some of the revenue sources, like ticket sales, as these remain pretty stable due to season tickets. By thinking ahead and getting involved with growing areas like esports, Real Madrid's financial strategy could change, and this leads to more talent on the pitch as well as a stable future for a global sports brand.", "source": {"uri": "managingmadrid.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Managing Madrid"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esports", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Esports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_competitions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA competitions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "EFL Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Beckham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Beckham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinedine_Zidane", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zinedine Zidane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FC Barcelona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adidas"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Education and Training", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Real_Estate", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Real Estate", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/community/sbnu_logo_minimal/364/large_managingmadrid.com.minimal.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792526", "eventUri": "eng-9792526", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

The outswinger is met by Latasa, who heads over.\n\nBadiashile does well to cut out a ball across the six-yard box but concedes a corner, which Chelsea clear at the front post.\n\nMudryk plays a neat-one two with Enzo but Asencio times his challenge to perfection inside his own box to clear the danger for Real.\n\nChelsea will now have a free-kick just outside the box on the right. Madueke takes but wastes it and misses the target by quite some way.\n\nBrahim has been named man of the match.\n\nMartin takes aim from just outside the Chelsea box and his effort fizzes past Jorgensen's right-hand post.\n\nModric receives a standing ovation from the Real fans as he goes off.\n\nMudryk has won a corner for Chelsea on the left. They take it short and then send it in, but Real clear their lines.\n\nThe corner is sent in by Modric but Chelsea head away. We are approaching the final 10 minutes.\n\nReal have a corner on the left but they will make a double change before they take it.\n\nPaz shoots from outside the box but it is a fairly comfortable save for Jorgensen.\n\nRudiger has been booked for dissent. Pretty difficult to get yellow cards in pre-season but Rudiger has succeeded.\n\nMudryk wins the ball in his own half and drives forward. He makes it all the way to the edge of the Real box and then shoots, but his effort misses the goal by a country mile as the ball sails into the stands.\n\nRudiger gives the ball away poorly inside his own half and Caicedo wins it for Chelsea. It comes to Guiu, who shots from distance but his effort is straight at Lunin.\n\nVinicius Junior's cross is deflected behind by Badiashile for a Real corner on the right. Rodrygo takes but Chelsea clear their lines.\n\nNot long after Real have another corner on the same side as Brahim's cross is also blocked by Badiashile. Rodrygo sends it in again and this delivery is better. Militao wins the header and it goes just wide of the far post.\n\nOpportunity for Guiu. He is found by Enzo and attempts a shot from just outside the box but he cannot find the target.\n\nChance for Brahim to get his second of the night. Vinicius Junior is sent in behind the Chelsea defence. He lays it back to Brahim on the edge of the box, but his curling effort goes wide.\n\nBig chance for Chelsea inside the opening minute of the second half. James sends Sterling in behind the Real defence. Sterling lays it off to Guiu, who then in turn finds Nkunku sprinting into the box. Lunin, having only just come on, makes a good save to deny Nkunku.\n\nThere is the whistle and Real Madrid lead 2-1 at the break in Charlotte.\n\nGusto is now back on his feet but is still feeling some pain in his neck.\n\nPlay is halted as Gusto is down. Replays show Militao had given Gusto quite the shove in the back.\n\nReal have a corner on the left as Colwill blocks a cross. Modric sends it in and Jorgensen punches it away from danger.\n\nThree added minutes at the end of this first half.\n\nRodrygo cuts in from the left and takes aim from the edge of the box but his effort misses the target. Half-time is fast approaching.\n\nEnzo has an effort from the edge of the box that goes wide of Courtois' right-hand post. Even if it had been on target Courtois had it covered.\n\nMadueke (39')\n\nChelsea do now have a goal back. Enzo dinks a cross to the back post and Madueke is on hand to head past Courtois, who got stuck in no-man's land and will be disappointed he did not commit either way.\n\nChelsea should have a goal back. Sterling plays a neat one-two with Gusto and has a simple pass across the six-yard box to tee up Nkunku for an easy finish, but Sterling gets it wrong and his ball across is too heavy. A big wasted chance for Chelsea.\n\nChelsea look like they are in trouble again as Brahim runs towards their area but Gusto times a challenge well to win the ball back for Chelsea.\n\nBrahim (28')\n\nReal Madrid double their lead. Brahim is found in behind the Chelsea defence and goes around Jorgensen. From a very tight angle he manages to slide the ball into the net and that is a great finish. Real now 2-0 to the good.\n\nGood defending from Militao but Chelsea should do better there. Nkunku gets past a rash Rudiger and is running towards the Real Madrid box. Chelsea have numbers and Nkunku finds Sterling on the left-hand side of the box, but Militao gets across to shield the ball and see it behind for a goal-kick.\n\nChelsea are on the ropes here as Real Madrid come close to scoring twice in quick succession.\n\nModric drives in a cross from the byline on the right-hand side of the box, which forces Jorgensen into a save with his legs.\n\nCeballos (19')\n\nReal Madrid take the lead. Diaz is played in behind and advances into the Chelsea box. He spots the run of Vazquez on the right-hand side of the box and slides it to him. Vazquez's shot is deflected and ends up rolling into the far corner as Ceballos slides in to help the ball into the net.\n\nBig, big chance for Real Madrid. Chelsea make an absolute mess of clearing their lines from inside their own box. Colwill loses it to Brahim, who should slot home but instead misses the target. Big let-off for Chelsea there.\n\nAction at both ends. Sterling has a shot blocked inside the Real Madrid box and then it goes down to the other end. Vinicius Junior runs at James inside the box and goes past him. Just as he is lining up a shot, James slides in. The referee decides that James got the ball, despite Vinicius Junior wanting a penalty.\n\nColwill is lucky there. He gets his header back to his goalkeeper Jorgensen all wrong and Vinicius Junior gets to it first. He goes around Jorgensen but the touch is heavy and the chance goes begging.\n\nNkunku, having been fed down the right by Madueke, tries to find Guiu in the middle but it is intercepted.\n\nMoments later Rudiger takes out Madueke down the right and Chelsea will have a free-kick in a good position. In a competitive match Rudiger would probably have seen yellow there.\n\nJames sends it in but Real head away.\n\nThere are four former London-based players in the Real Madrid starting XI tonight. Rudiger and Courtois played in the blue of their opponents tonight, whilst Modric and Ceballos called the two halves of north London home. They also have another former Premier League player in their starting XI in the form of Brahim Diaz, who used to be on Manchester City's books.\n\nThe first chance of the night goes to Chelsea and Sterling and he should score. Madueke lays it back to Nkunku on the edge of the box and he sends a cross to the far post. He picks out Sterling, who has a free header, but he somehow misses the target. That is a poor miss.\n\nMadueke gets to the byline on the right and sends in a cross to Sterling beyond the far post. He tries to send in a cross from the left-hand side of the box but gets it all wrong and goes into the side netting for a goal-kick.\n\nWe are under way in Charlotte.\n\nBoth sides have emerged from the tunnel and we are just moments away from kick-off in Charlotte.\n\nReal Madrid: Courtois, Vazques, Militao, Rudiger, Garcia, Martin, Modric, Ceballos, Vinicius Junior, Brahim, Rodrygo.\n\nSubstitutes: Lunin, Gonzalez, Arda Guler, Endrick, Vallejo, Asencio, Paz, Latasa, Ramon, Lorenzo, Obrador, de Leon, Martinez.\n\nOne man who is not with the Chelsea squad is Conor Gallagher, who is closing in on a move to Atletico Madrid. Having consulted with Kieran Trippier, Gallagher has decided to join Diego Simeone's side. Matt Law has the latest on Gallagher's imminent exit.\n\nMatt Law has the very latest.\n\nGood evening and welcome to coverage of the pre-season friendly between Chelsea and Real Madrid from Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nChelsea have not had the best of pre-seasons to say the least. Their US tour started with a 2-2 draw against League One Wrexham before a heavy 4-1 defeat to Celtic. They secured their first win on tour against Club America, winning 3-0, but then lost 4-2 to Manchester City. After tonight, they will play Inter Milan on Sunday before their Premier League opener against Manchester City at Stamford Bridge. Goalkeeper Filip Jorgensen could make his first appearance for Chelsea having signed from Villarreal this summer. Cole Palmer and Marc Cucurella remain on holiday after Euro 2024. One man who isn't with the Chelsea squad is Conor Gallagher, who is on the verge of a \u00a334 million move to Atletico Madrid.\n\nReal Madrid have played two pre-season games so far; a 1-0 defeat to AC Milan and a 2-1 loss against Barcelona. After tonight, they will take on Atalanta in the UEFA Super Cup before their La Liga opener against Mallorca as they start their defence of their La Liga crown. They are still without seven senior players who have not gone on tour; Fede Valverde, Dani Carvajal, Aurelian Tchouameni, Kylian Mbappe, Eduardo Camavinga, Ferland Mendy and Jude Bellingham. Real Madrid's new signing from Brazil, 18-year-old Endrick, is in the squad and started their last pre-season game against Barcelona. The last time these two sides met competitively came in April 2023, where Real Madrid came out on top convincingly, winning 4-0 on aggregate in the Champions League quarter-finals.", "source": {"uri":

Thanks to its economically intelligent presidents, most notably Florentino Perez, Madrid has never had a shortage of funds, which means the club has almost always found a way to sign the players it desires, no matter the price tag.\n\nIn today's article, we will take a look at five clubs that have benefitted the most from Los Blancos' open-minded transfer policy, raking the most money in transfer fees. Let's begin!\n\nReal Madrid has splurged a sizable \u20ac128 million ($139.97 million) in transfer fees on FC Porto players over the years. So far, five players have left the Portuguese giants for the Spanish powerhouse.\n\nThe journey started with Secretario in July 1996, who moved to Madrid for a mere \u20ac1.5 million ($1.64 million). In 2007, Madrid signed one of the best center-backs in history from Porto, paying \u20ac30 million ($32.81 million) for the services of Pepe. Eight years later, Casemiro (\u20ac15 million - $16.40 million) and Danilo (\u20ac31.5 million - $34.45 million) moved from Porto to Madrid. Real Madrid did business with FC Porto once more in July 2019, lapping up Eder Militao for \u20ac50 million ($54.68 million).\n\nReal Madrid have paid \u20ac131 million ($143.27 million) to Olympique Lyon in transfer fees, bringing in four players from the French outfit. Defensive midfielder Mahamadou Diarra was the Whites' first signing in August 2006. He joined the club for a handsome \u20ac26 million ($28.43 million) fee. Three years later, Madrid signed Karim Benzema for a mere \u20ac35 million fee. Given the trophy-laden 14-year-long career he had at the Bernabeu, it is safe to brand it one of the best bargain buys of the century.\n\nMariano Diaz and Ferland Mendy are the remaining two transfers. Madrid paid \u20ac21.5 million ($23.51 million) for striker Diaz in August 2018 and \u20ac48 million ($52.49 million) for left-back Mendy in 2019.\n\nReal Madrid have signed only two players from Tottenham Hotspur over the years, splurging a sizable \u20ac136 million ($148.74 million) in transfer fees. In the summer of 2012, Real Madrid paid \u20ac35 million ($38.28 million) to sign Luka Modric from Spurs. Initially, it looked like a poor signing, as he had not hit the ground running at the Santiago Bernabeu. However, it changed for the better soon after, and he has gone on to create an untouchable legacy at Madrid. Over the last 12 years, he has helped Los Blancos to six UEFA Champions League trophies and four La Liga titles amongst others, and he still has plenty of gas left in the tank.\n\nA season after signing Modric, Real Madrid paid a then-record \u20ac101 million fee to sign Gareth Bale from Spurs. The Welshman could not attain Modric's longevity, but he also did enough to become a part of the Real Madrid folklore. Before leaving the club in 2022, Bale won five UEFA Champions League trophies and three La Liga titles with Madrid, emerging as the most successful British player of all time.\n\nReal Madrid has signed just three players from AS Monaco over the years, paying them \u20ac155 million ($169.52 million) in fees. In the summer of 1967, they signed Miguel Perez from Monaco, but it was a free transfer.\n\nAfter 47 years, the Whites once again did business with Monaco, signing 2014 FIFA World Cup sensation James Rodriguez for an eye-popping \u20ac75 million ($82.02 million) fee. Los Merengues turned to Monaco once more in July 2022, this time going after their defensive mastermind Aurelien Tchouameni. They beat Liverpool in the transfer race, prizing the Frenchman away from Monaco for a cool \u20ac80 million ($87.49 million) fee.\n\nReal Madrid has an excellent relationship with Premier League powerhouse Chelsea, with the Whites signing as many as seven players from the Blues, including two loan transfers. So far, Madrid has paid Chelsea a whopping \u20ac200 million ($218.73 million) in transfer fees.\n\nEden Hazard's transfer from Chelsea in the summer of 2019 cost Real Madrid the most, with the Pensioners earning \u20ac121 million ($133.33 million) for him. Thibaut Courtois, who moved to the Santiago Bernabeu after the 2018 FIFA World Cup, is tied in second place with Arjen Robben, with both players coming for \u20ac35 million ($38.28 million). Riccardo Carvalho also left West London for Madrid, earning the English team \u20ac8 million ($8.75 million) in transfer fees. Kepa Arrizabalaga -- who cost Madrid \u20ac1 million ($1.09 million) in loan fees -- and Michael Essien have been the two loan signings, whereas Antonio Rudiger has been the only free transfer from Chelsea to Real Madrid.", "source": {"uri": "sportslens.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportslens.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sushan_chakraborty@sportslens.com", "name": "Sushan Chakraborty",

Mandatory Credit: Steven Bisig-USA TODAY Sports / Steven Bisig-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Utah Utes are heading to the Big 12 conference this year, but don't get too comfortable because significant changes might be right around the corner. From teams packing into consolidated leagues to a shift in television contracts, the college football landscape is about to look like the Wild West.\n\nFormer coach turned analyst Rick Neuheisel believes we're going to see this play out in Utah's favor over the next six years with the opportunity of joining a premium conference when the dust settles. He addressed the issue of future realignment efforts on his radio show last week.\n\n\"I will be shocked if (Utah) is not in the SEC or the Big Ten by the next go-around, by 2030, because people are going to say, 'We need that team in our league,''' Neuheisel said.\n\nUtah will be looking to grow over the next few years in the Big 12, which could translate into being part of the 12-team College Football Playoff. After 13 years of Pac-12 competition, they'll be at the top in a two-or-three team race.\n\nThe Utes were forced to deal with the fallout after a majority of the Pac-12 schools left for better opportunities. Any of the Big 12 schools would jump over to the Big Ten or SEC overnight. The difference in the revenue share is enough to not even think twice about another option.\n\n\"We know what Kyle Whittingham can do,\" Neuheisel added. \"There is no Oklahoma and Texas in the Big 12. The home field at Rice-Eccles is as valuable as anywhere else in the Big 12. To me, Utah is the team to really watch.\"\n\nNeuheisel understands the marketability of the Utes with Whittingham calling the shots. But it's the consistent approach that sets them apart from others. \"The formula is almost always the same,\" Neuheisel said. \"You win with defense, and you try to be as productive as you can on offense.\"\n\nUtah opens the 2024 season with Southern Utah at Rice-Eccles Stadium on Aug 30.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_Utes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Utah Utes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Big 12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Husky_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Husky Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Neuheisel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rick Neuheisel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Whittingham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Whittingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Huskies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Huskies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pac-12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Football_Playoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College Football Playoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southeastern Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice\u2013Eccles_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rice\u2013Eccles Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Utah_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southern Utah University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/College_and_University", "label": "dmoz/Sports/College and University", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rope_Skipping/Clubs_and_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rope Skipping/Clubs and Teams", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_6221,h_3499,x_0,y_213/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/all_utes/01j0rr0s3tjayh06kbka.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669446", "eventUri": "eng-9669446", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-08-30", "textStart": 2133, "textEnd": 2139}, {"amb": false, "date": "2011-11-", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

That doesn't mean they are perfect, but they certainly have come a long way from their Mountain West and beginning of Pac-12 play.\n\nWith starter Cam Rising back for the Utes, all eyes were on the backup quarterback race between sophomore Brandon Rose and freshman Isaac Wilson. Offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Andy Ludwig walked away pleased with both quarterback's progress.\n\n\"I'm fired up with the growth and maturity of Brandon Rose,\" Ludwig said. \"He had some opportunities last spring but in fall camp the injuries set him back. He's made the absolute most of that time and come back a better player. He's more confident, more poised in the pocket, and better system understanding. I'm very pleased with his progress to date. There is still plenty of work to do through the course of summer. With Isaac Wilson- the skill set is definitely there, but you are talking about a young man that was a high school senior on Friday and then came in and was a college freshman on Monday. He's still learning a lot, but the arm talent, athleticism and the football savvy are there. He's still just learning the ins and outs of Utah offensive football.\"\n\nOne of the interesting questions coming out of spring for the Utes was whether or not they may pursue a transfer quarterback for added depth.\n\nAs Ludwig put it at the time if head coach Kyle Whittingham wanted a quarterback they were going to go after a quarterback. Not too long afterward Utah brought in former five-star quarterback Sam Huard.\n\n\"If the head coach wants to do that, that's what we'll do,\" Ludwig said.", "source": {"uri": "ksltv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KSLTV.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_Utes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Utah Utes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big 12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Lake_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Salt Lake City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Salt Lake City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Wilson_(American_politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Isaac Wilson (American politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pac-12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvis_Whitted", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alvis Whitted"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Ludwig", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andy Ludwig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_West_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mountain West Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophomore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sophomore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freshman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Whittingham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Whittingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "High school football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669446", "eventUri": "eng-9669446", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Salt Lake City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Shinofield chose Utah over Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado State, and others. He took an official visit to SLC eariler this month and was sold on the culture with Whittingham and his staff.\n\nAt 6-foot-6 and 275 pounds, Shinofield has the potential to play inside or out on the offensive line. He's a natural fit at the tackle spot but could adjust if needed. He'll need a few upgrades to his game at the next level.

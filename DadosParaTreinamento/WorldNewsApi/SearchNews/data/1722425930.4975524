{"id": 243259014, "title": "Martin Mull, hip comic and actor from 'Fernwood Tonight' and 'Roseanne,' dies at 80", "text": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Martin Mull, whose droll, esoteric comedy and acting made him a hip sensation in the 1970s and later a beloved guest star on sitcoms including ''Roseanne'' and ''Arrested Development,'' has died, his daughter said Friday. Mull's daughter, TV writer and comic artist Maggie Mull, said her father died at home on Thursday after ''a valiant fight against a long illness.'' Mull, who was also a guitarist and painter, came to national fame with a recurring role on the Norman Lear-created satirical soap opera ''Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman,'' and the starring role in its spinoff, ''Fernwood Tonight,'' on which he played Barth Gimble, the host of a satirical talk show. ''He was known for excelling at every creative discipline imaginable and also for doing Red Roof Inn commercials,'' Maggie Mull said in an Instagram post. ''He would find that joke funny. He was never not funny. My dad will be deeply missed by his wife and daughter, by his friends and coworkers, by fellow artists and comedians and musicians, and\u2014the sign of a truly exceptional person\u2014by many, many dogs.'' Known for his blonde hair and well-trimmed mustache, Mull was born in Chicago, raised in Ohio and Connecticut and studied art in Rhode Island and Rome. He combined his music and comedy in hip Hollywood clubs in the 1970s. ''In 1976 I was a guitar player and sit-down comic appearing at the Roxy on the Sunset Strip when Norman Lear walked in and heard me,\" Mull told The Associated Press in 1980. ''He cast me as the wife beater on 'Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman.' Four months later I was spun off on my own show.'' In the 1980s he appeared in films including ''Mr. Mom\" and ''Clue,'' and in the 1990s had a recurring role on ''Roseanne.'' He would later play private eye Gene Parmesan on ''Arrested Development,'' and would be nominated for an Emmy in 2016 for a guest turn on ''Veep.'' ''What I did on 'Veep' I'm very proud of, but I'd like to think it's probably more collective, at my age it's more collective,'' Mull told the AP after his nomination. ''It might go all the way back to 'Fernwood.''' Other comedians and actors were often his biggest fans. ''Martin was the greatest,'' ''Bridesmaids'' director Paul Feig said in an X post. ''So funny, so talented, such a nice guy. Was lucky enough to act with him on The Jackie Thomas Show and treasured every moment being with a legend. Fernwood Tonight was so influential in my life.", "summary": "Martin Mull, whose droll, esoteric comedy and acting made him a hip sensation in the 1970s and later a beloved guest star on sitcoms including ''Roseanne'' and ''Arrested Development,'' has died, his daughter said Friday.", "url": "https://www.startribune.com/martin-mull-hip-comic-and-actor-from-fernwood-2-night-and-roseanne-dies-at-80/600377161/", "image": "https://arc.stimg.co/startribunemedia/HZZP5GET7WGLHOSTAQ4C5Z5WC4.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 01:32:25", "author": "ANDREW DALTON", "authors": ["ANDREW DALTON"], "language": "en", "catgory": "entertainment", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.144}

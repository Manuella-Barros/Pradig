A viral video highlighting the various benefits of sharing a bed with a furry friend has sparked debate among social media users.A caption on the clip, shared by TikTok user @myla.thebluestaffy, which has had over 789,000 views since it was posted on May 10, reads: \"The best sleep companion.\" The footage shows a dog lying on what appears to be a blanket, while it is caressed by a hand, and the pup is later shown sleeping wrapped in another blanket.The video goes on to note how allowing your dog to sleep in your bed will \"change his life,\" outlining the benefits of it, such as improved physical health for the owner and the reduction of unwanted canine behaviors such as separation anxiety.Is It Healthy to Let Dogs Sleep in Bed With You?According to a survey by the American Pet Products Association, 62 percent of small dogs, 41 percent of medium-sized dogs and 32 percent of large dogs sleep with their owners, WebMD reported in April 2012.But is it healthy to allow dogs to sleep with you in your bed? Experts say there are benefits, but it also comes with some drawbacks.Despite these drawbacks, a significant number of people prefer the company of their pets at night. In a survey of 2,400 U.S. adults conducted by YouGov in 2021 on behalf of mattress company Slumber Yard, 24 percent said they'd rather share a bed with their dog than a domestic partner.Veterinarian Dr. Bethany Hsia, co-founder of CodaPet, told Newsweek \"Sharing a bed with your dog can be an enjoyable experience, offering numerous benefits for both you and your dog,\" such as the following: It can strengthen the bond between you. Hsia said: \"The close contact creates a sense of security and familiarity, fostering a deeper emotional connection.\" Steve Dale, a certified animal behavior consultant, agreed, telling Newsweek that sharing a bed helps to \"cement the bond and trust\" between humans and their dogs. Dale added that \"studies support that oxytocin, the so-called love hormone, rises for dogs and people. And there's a sense of security felt for dogs and people.\" Dogs naturally generate body heat, \"making them excellent cuddle buddies during cold nights. Their presence can help keep you warm and cozy, ensuring a more restful sleep,\" said Hsia. Our canine companions can \"help alleviate feelings of anxiety or stress, allowing for better sleep quality,\" noted Hsia. Having a dog in the room while you sleep can provide an added layer of security against intruders or other potential threats. Referring to the aforementioned Slumber Yard survey, Dale noted that single women said they \"felt more protected, and sleep was less disturbed even than sleeping with a human partner who may get up in the middle of the night or who snores.\" The latest viral TikTok video showcases these positive aspects, emphasizing the emotional and physical comfort dogs can provide.However, Hsia and Dale also warn of potential downsides, such as the following: Dogs may move around during the night or make noises that disrupt your sleep cycle, leading to restless nights and fatigue during the day. \"This is particularly true for larger dogs,\" Hsia noted. Many dogs snore too, Dale said, explaining that previous research has shown that \"our sleep is sometimes actually disturbed by wiggly dogs, occasional barking, and those dogs who do snore.\" Sharing a bed with a large dog or multiple small pups may lead to space constraints, \"making it difficult for both you and your pets to get comfortable enough for restful sleep,\" she added. Allowing your dog in your bed may \"increase the risk of contracting parasites such as fleas or ticks from your dog's fur,\" the veterinarian noted. Dale also highlighted that while sharing a bed with a dog might not cause separation anxiety, it also doesn't prevent or treat it. The post sparked discussion among users on TikTok, with some sharing that they love sleeping with their dogs.Tracy said: \"Nothing better than a Staffy snuggle pup!!\" and Dog Mom For Life wrote@ \"I literally wake up like 12 times a night to feel my dog's breathing.\"Joanne Gero ND said: \"1000 percent better than a human!!!\"Others were less keen on the idea, such as venhey who wrote: \"No dogs in my bed only human ones.\"BowieTheFrenchie said: \"My dog snores too loud I can't,\" and jade <3 wrote: \"My dog snores, sounds like a pig, takes the whole bed, can't stay still.\"Shannon noted: \"Ya tried it I got no sleep.

Jeff Landry on Wednesday signed into law the Louisiana Giving All True Opportunity to Rise Program, also known as the GATOR scholarship.\n\n\"Governor Jeff Landry is an education freedom fighter,\" American Federation For Children Senior Fellow Corey DeAngelis told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"His unwavering leadership makes Louisiana the 11th state to go all-in on school choice. Republicans like Mr. Landry are helping the GOP cement itself as the Parents Party. Red states are engaging in friendly competition to empower all families with education freedom,\" he added.\n\nHERE'S WHY RURAL REPUBLICANS ARE FINALLY BEGINNING TO SHIFT AND SUPPORT SCHOOL CHOICE\n\nThe school choice program would create a state education savings account for low-income families starting in 2025. Parents can use the money to send their children to private school.\n\nThe Education Savings Account is a school choice model that enables parents to use public funds to cover a variety of education expenses, including private school tuition, instructional materials and homeschooling costs.\n\nWhile other states have passed universal school choice legislation, Louisiana's bill will have a phased-in approach in terms of eligibility.\n\nAccording to the bill, during the first phase, students must come from a family with a total income at or below 250% of the federal poverty line, but eligibility will eventually extend universally.\n\nThe signing of the GATOR scholarship bill comes after six Louisiana Democrats bucked their party by supporting the measure in April.\n\nOne of the lawmakers acknowledged the risk of major push-back from his Democrat counterparts for supporting the measure.\n\n\"I know the political ramifications for me for voting for this bill,\" Louisiana Democratic State Rep. Jason Hughes said on the House chamber floor.\n\nURBAN CHARTER SCHOOLS BODE SUCCESS FOR LOW-INCOME, NON-WHITES, COLLEGE ENROLLMENT: REPORT\n\nHughes was the only Democrat to vote for the bill that passed the Louisiana Appropriations Committee before it was sent to the House floor.\n\nDemocrats have historically voted against school choice measures, with one reason being that teachers unions, who oppose school choice, heavily donate to them.\n\nAfter passing the House chamber floor by a supermajority 71-32 vote, the bill passed the Senate on May 30th by a 23-14 vote. The measure was primed to be signed into law as Landry had previously made a \"pledge\" to enact school choice legislation into law.\n\n\"Louisiana lawmakers should be applauded for enacting the Louisiana GATOR Scholarship program, which will dramatically expand education freedom and choice in the Pelican State,\" Jason Bedrick of the Heritage Foundation told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"The Louisiana GATOR Scholarship will replace the state's limited and over-regulated voucher program with a well-designed education savings account policy that will give all Louisiana families the freedom and flexibility to customize their child's education.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Bayou State joined a wave of red states passing school choice legislation, with Arizona beginning the phenomenon in 2022.\n\nTexas appears to be next on the horizon after voters ousted several anti-school choice incumbents in the Republican primaries.

Jeff Landry on Wednesday signed legislation making the Pelican State the 16 state in the nation to enact K-12 Education Savings Accounts and the 11 to offer education choice to every K-12 student, following Alabama earlier this year.\n\nThe legislation creates the Louisiana Giving All True Opportunity to Rise -- LA GATOR -- Scholarships, which families can use to choose the learning environments that align with their values and work best for their kids.\n\nAs with other ESA policies, parents can use the LA GATOR Scholarships to pay for private school tuition, textbooks, curricular materials, special-needs therapy, and more.\n\n\"The LA Gator Program puts parents in the driver's seat and gives every child the opportunity for a great education. When parents are committed to the value of their child's education, government should never get in the way,\" said Landry, a Republican. \"School choice is now a reality in the state of Louisiana!\"\n\nMost students will be eligible for scholarships worth about $5,200 annually, which is just over a third of the average per-pupil spending at Louisiana district schools. Students with special needs and children from low-income families can receive higher scholarship amounts.\n\nThe scholarships will initially be limited to students who are switching from a district or charter school, are entering kindergarten, or who are from families earning no more than 250% of the federal poverty level. In the second year, families earning up to 400% of the federal poverty line will be eligible, and in the third year, the scholarships will be open to all K-12 students in Louisiana.\n\nMore than a quarter of K-12 students nationwide are currently or soon will be eligible for a publicly funded education choice policy. Including privately funded tax-credit scholarship policies, more than 36% of students nationwide are eligible for a private education choice policy.\n\nThe new scholarship policy is an example of how the school choice movement has moved in a more free-market and family-centric direction. Instead of relying on bureaucrats to provide top-down accountability, the new policy trusts parents to provide bottom-up accountability.\n\nThe LA GATOR Scholarships will replace the state's overregulated school voucher program, which produced the nation's first negative results in a random-assignment study on the effects of a school choice policy on participating students' academic performance.\n\n\"Equalitarian\" regulations intended to guarantee access and quality -- such as open admissions requirements, price controls, and mandating the state test -- backfired by chasing away high-performing private schools.\n\nFortunately, Louisiana lawmakers have learned from their state's own mistakes, as well as the success of states such as Arizona and Florida, which have shown that a free-market approach to education does a better job of providing a high degree of access and quality.\n\nThe new scholarship policy eschews the harmful regulations of its predecessor.\n\nLouisiana's embrace of universal school choice also shows the success of efforts by conservatives to channel parents' frustrations over \"woke\" ideology in traditional public schools into public support for policies that empower parents to choose schools that align with their values.\n\n\"Our people seek government that reflects their values,\" said Landry during his Jan. 8 inauguration. \"They demand that our children be afforded an education that reflects those wholesome principles, and not an indoctrination behind their mother's back.\"\n\nThe same week that the Louisiana Legislature gave the green light to the LA GATOR Scholarships, it also approved legislation curbing the ability of \"woke\" teachers to indoctrinate students in radical gender ideology behind parents' backs.\n\nSimilar to Given Name Act policies in other states, Louisiana's HB 121 would prohibit public school employees, including teachers, from referring to children by pronouns that are inconsistent with their sex, or any name other than the student's legal name or common derivatives thereof.\n\nToo often, school officials have begun the process of \"socially transitioning\" confused children all while keeping their parents in the dark. Going forward, Louisiana schools will no longer be able to subvert and supersede parents by making decisions concerning their children's physical, mental, and emotional well-being without their knowledge and consent.\n\nAnother bill, HB 122, restricts discussion in government-run schools about sexual orientation and gender identity \"in a manner that deviates from state content standards or curricula developed or approved by public school governing authorities.\"\n\nThe bill properly recognizes that public school teachers are not free agents, but rather public employees hired by the public to perform a particular job. Parents and the public at large expect teachers to carry out the job they were hired to do without exploiting their position to indoctrinate a captive audience of children in a radical ideology.\n\nLouisiana's school choice win is also evidence that advocates' short-term hyperpartisan strategy will pay bipartisan dividends in the long term. If Republicans gain an electoral advantage over Democrats by embracing school choice, eventually the Democrats will have to embrace school choice, too. We're already seeing the signs in places like Louisiana.\n\nWhen the Louisiana House of Representatives on April 8 passed the bill to create the LA GATOR Scholarships, the vote was 71-32, including six Democrats. That might not sound like a lot, but that's one-fifth of the Democratic caucus. Moreover, whereas bipartisan efforts to advance school choice legislation typically involve bills to create small, targeted, and overregulated policies like the one the LA GATOR Scholarships are replacing, these Democrats voted for a Republican-led effort to enact education choice for all.\n\nThere's still a long way to go. After all, most of the Louisiana House Democrats and all the state Senate Democrats voted against school choice. But as education choice policies become the norm and not just the exception, it will be increasingly difficult for members of any political party to stand in their way.", "source": {"uri":

(CITC) -- Louisiana joined the growing list of U.S. states adopting universal school choice Wednesday by approving the implementation of education savings accounts.\n\nGov. Jeff Landry signed off on the Louisiana Giving All True Opportunity to Rise (LA GATOR) program Wednesday. The legislation allows K-12 education savings accounts to be gradually phased in to the state beginning in 2025, with families making less than 250% of the federal poverty level qualifying first. All families will be eligible by the third phase.\n\nFamilies can use the education savings accounts to cover a variety of expenses related to non-public schooling, including tuition, textbooks and examination fees. Additional expenses not specified in the LA GATOR program can be approved by the state's Board of Elementary and Secondary Education.\n\nGov. Landry, a Republican, said last month the LA GATOR program builds upon his pledge to \"enact bold change\" to improve education in the state.\n\nThe LA Gator Program puts parents in the driver's seat and gives every child the opportunity for a great education,\" the governor said. \"When parents are committed to the value of their child's education, government should never get in the way.\"\n\nAngela Morabito, a spokesperson for the Defense of Freedom Institute, cheered the news Wednesday, telling Crisis in the Classroom (CITC) it's a sign the \"education freedom movement is gaining momentum every day.\"\n\n\"Parents deserve the opportunity to choose the best educational option for their child, and it's great news that even more people will have that freedom soon,\" Morabito said.\n\nHowever, some educators in the state disagree.

Landry Signs School Choice Scholarship Program Into Law", "body": "Louisiana became the latest state to introduce school choice legislation on Wednesday, allowing parents to use public funds to support their children's education, either at public or private schools.\n\nGov. Jeff Landry (R-La.), who took office in January, signed Senate Bill 313 into law on June 19. He hailed the measure as fulfilling a campaign promise to reform the state's education system and said it would \"bring common sense back to our classrooms.\"\n\nThe legislation formed part of a package of education bills signed by the governor, dubbed the \"Dream Big Package.\" His office described the measures as being designed to prioritize learning, reduce bureaucracy, and return to fundamental educational values. The centerpiece is the Louisiana GATOR (Give All a True Opportunity to Rise) Scholarship Program, commonly referred to as school choice.\n\n\"A strong education system leads to a strong economy and a strong state. Our historic Dream Big Package puts the focus back on our kids, and allows Louisiana to follow in the footsteps of our neighbors in the South,\" Mr. Jeff Landry said in a statement. \"I am thankful to the legislature for their commitment to making the education system in Louisiana one that students, parents, and teachers can all be proud of.\"\n\nSchool choice, which has been a partisan issue, saw a notable shift in support when six Louisiana Democrats in the state's lower chamber crossed the aisle to vote in favor of the final passage of House Bill 745. The bill then advanced to the upper chamber and ultimately reached the governor's desk for approval.\n\nState Rep. Jason Hughes, a Democrat, told the House floor that he knew \"the political ramifications for me for voting for this bill\" before it passed in a 71-32 vote in April.\n\n\"But I don't need this $16,800 a year job bad enough to watch our children continue to live in poverty, trapped in failing schools, and not try to do something,\" Mr. Hughes said.\n\n\"And in the event I'm not reelected, this is what I know: my steps are ordered. My heart is pure,\" he continued. \"I came here to do tough things. I came here to make tough decisions. And I came here to put children first.\"\n\nData from EdChoice, an Indiana nonprofit, show that nearly 360,000 students from more than 20 states attended various schools with support from their state's school choice program. The schools they attended included private schools, charter schools, magnet schools, homeschooling, and online learning. The programs also supported inter/intra-district transfers and other customized learning accommodations, according to EdChoice.\n\nMore than 30 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, have ESA and tax-credit programs. These programs offer vouchers and/or tax-credit scholarships for students, assessed on family income. EdChoice reported that in 2021, more than 350,000 students were beneficiaries of these programs.\n\nThe National Education Association (NEA) has argued that school choice programs drain critical funding from public schools, especially harming rural schools, which serve as community hubs and major employers. They emphasize that vouchers benefit wealthy families, lack accountability, and do not improve student outcomes.\n\nThe union advocates for preserving public education funding to support all students and maintain essential community services. Last year, the NEA stated that there is \"scant evidence that voucher programs produce any improvement in student academic achievement.\"\n\nThe Louisiana governor's office said in a statement that the GATOR legislation \"will allow parents to choose the school that best suits their child's needs.\"\n\n\"GATOR Scholarships provide parents with a scholarship account that allows them to customize their child's education. These scholarship accounts can be used for school tuition and fees, tutoring, educational therapies, textbooks and curricula, dual enrollment courses, uniforms, and transportation,\" the governor's office stated.\n\nNotably, the measure was passed by a Republican supermajority legislature and signed by a Republican governor. Mr. Landry defeated the former Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, who opposed school choice programs and had vetoed similar legislation in the past.\n\nLouisiana is the 11th state to pass school choice legislation.", "source": {"uri":

See the list.", "body": "Governor Jeff Landry signs bills related to his education plan on Wednesday, June 19, 2024, at Our Lady of Fatima Catholic School in Lafayette.\n\nGov. Jeff Landry took a victory lap Wednesday as he signed a series of education bills into law that he promised will transform schooling in Louisiana.\n\nThe \"Dream Big\" package of nearly 20 bills mostly impacts the landscape of K-12 education in the state and puts the focus back on students, he said. The new laws would send more public tax dollars to private schools, require public schools to display the Ten Commandments in classrooms and bar talk about gender identity or sexual orientation in school, among other changes.\n\n\"Today, we fulfill our promise to bring drastic reform to our educational system and bring common sense back to our classrooms,\" Landry said to a roomful of supporters, state legislators, parents and students at Fatima Catholic School in Lafayette.\n\nMany of the education bills signed Wednesday were among the most controversial in the three-month legislative session that ended June 3. Proposals aimed at LGBTQ+ children incensed LGBTQ+ families and advocacy organizations, while the plan to place the Ten Commandments in classrooms sparked the ire of groups that advocate for the separation of church and state, as is outlined in the Constitution.\n\nThe governor's signing of the latter bill on Wednesday triggered lawsuit threats hours later from the American Civil Liberties Union and the ACLU of Louisiana, as well as Americans United for the Separation of Church and State and the Freedom from Religion Foundation.\n\n\"The First Amendment promises that we all get to decide for ourselves what religious beliefs, if any, to hold and practice, without pressure from the government,\" the groups said in a joint statement.\n\n\"Politicians have no business imposing their preferred religious doctrine on students and families in public schools.\"\n\nLandry's allies in the Legislature have balked at claims that the bill violates federal law, saying that the intent of such displays is to honor state and national history and culture. At a Republican fundraiser in Tennessee last week, Landry said he \"can't wait to be sued\" over the proposal.\n\nESA bill, LGBTQ+ bills\n\nLandry also on Wednesday signed into law hissignature achievement this session, a bill that, in theory, will give state tax dollars to any parent who wants to send their children to private school. But it was only a partial victory.\n\nAfter fierce resistance from critics who said the program would dismantle public education and decimate the state budget, lawmakers passed a comprise a bill that was far more modest than what Landry and his conservative allies -- including some influential GOP donors -- had sought.\n\nThe bill, sponsored by Sen. Rick Edmonds, R-Baton Rouge, will create new taxpayer-funded vouchers to subsidize students' private education. The new vouchers, known as \"education savings accounts,\" or ESAs, will replace Louisiana's existing voucher system, which pays for students from low-income families to attend private school.\n\nThe ESA program, named LA GATOR, will offer parents more flexibility: In addition to private school tuition, they can spend the state grants on tutoring, textbooks, special-education services or other approved expenses.\n\nInitially, the money would go to low-income families, students with disabilities and students seeking to transfer out of public schools. But eventually, any parent might be able to apply for the subsidies regardless of financial need and even if their children already attend private school.\n\nHowever, it's unclear when -- or if -- that will happen.\n\nTo secure the bill's passage, Landry and his allies agreed to remove language that made all families eligible for vouchers by the program's third year in operation. Now, the state board of education will set the timeline for expanding eligibility.\n\nMost significantly, the Legislature will decide each year how much state money to spend on the vouchers. If all students become eligible, including the tens of thousands who already attend private school, the program could cost well over $500 million per year, according to an estimate by the nonpartisan Public Affairs Research Council of Louisiana.\n\nThat change allowed the state flexibility, Edmonds said Wednesday, and is one of the things that sets the program apart from those used in other states.\n\nWith the state staring at a major budget shortfall next year when a sales tax is set to expire -- and with public colleges already bracing for massive funding cuts -- lawmakers will almost certainly balk at paying for a hugely expensive new program. Instead, they might opt to fund a limited number of vouchers, indefinitely delaying the date when limits would be removed and all families become eligible for tuition subsidies.\n\nSen. Glen Womack, R- Harrisonburg, who chairs the Senate finance committee and voted against the program, said the goal of improving education must be paired with fiscal responsibility.\n\n\"We know we need a change,\" he said, \"but it's not an open checkbook.\"\n\nRep. Matthew Willard, D-New Orleans, said he was grateful that the final bill was \"watered down\" so that it won't \"don't blow up the state's budget.\" However, he said the voucher program will do little to improve outcomes for the majority of students who remain in public schools.\n\n\"If we really want to continue moving the needle on public education in Louisiana,\" he said, \"then we have to continue investing in public education in Louisiana -- not diverting that money to send to private schools.\"\n\nLandry also signed into law bills that require students to get their parents' permission to go by a different name or pronoun at school and that ban discussion of LGBTQ+ issues in schools, which have been praised by proponents as tools to protect students and inform parents. Critics have said the bills unfairly target the LGBTQ+ community and could force students back into the closet.\n\nHere's a list of bills Landry signed Wednesday:\n\nHB 46, authored by Rep.

Jeff Landry and his GOP Legislature have set the stage for parents to secure state-funded private school tuition for their children, but it could be years before the program and money is widely available.\n\nLandry signed Baton Rouge Republican Sen. Rick Edmonds' House Bill 313 to create education savings accounts into law this week, along with nearly 20 other K-12 bills the governor believes will elevate Louisiana's education rankings.\n\n\"Today, we fulfill our promise to bring drastic reform to our educational system and bring common sense back to our classrooms,\" Landry said Wednesday during a bill signing event at Fatima Catholic School in Lafayette.\n\nThe original education savings account bills in the House and Senate proposed private school tuition awards as high as $5,100 for students from higher-income families, $7,500 for students from lower-income families and $15,000 for students with special needs.\n\nIt would have been phased in beginning this fall for low-income students and available to all students regardless of financial need in the third year.\n\nBut warnings that the fully funded program could eventually cost as much as $500 million caused lawmakers to slow implementation and allow the state education board to craft a plan to gradually create the program.\n\nLouisiana currently funds a voucher program in which the state pays for students to attend private schools if they are stuck in public schools that are rated C, D or F schools. The voucher program currently covers private school tuition for about 6,000 students at an annual cost of $45 million.\n\nThe education savings accounts will offer more flexibility. In addition to private school tuition, the awards can be spent on tutoring, textbooks, special-education services or other approved expenses.\n\nStill, Landry and supporters said the compromise law eventually will reach their goal of having state dollars follow the student no matter what education choice they make.\n\nIt's unclear when the first awards will be granted or how much they will be. Lawmakers will have to fund the program each year like they do with the popular college tuition program TOPS.\n\nLow-income students are still expected to get first shot at the program when it is implemented.\n\nMore: Louisiana first state to require Ten Commandments displayed in public school classrooms", "source": {"uri": "theadvertiser.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Advertiser"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Landry", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Landry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Private school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Edmonds", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rick Edmonds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K\u201312", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "K\u201312"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baton_Rouge,_Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baton Rouge, Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baton Rouge, Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_voucher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "School voucher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Special education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lafayette,_Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lafayette, Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lafayette, Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_lower_class", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American lower class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOPS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TOPS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ten Commandments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Child_and_Adolescent", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Child and Adolescent", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Education", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Education", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/College_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/College Financing", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/19/USAT/74150694007-usatsi-23558244.jpg?auto=webp&crop=3874,2179,x0,y129&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666178", "eventUri": "eng-9666178", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

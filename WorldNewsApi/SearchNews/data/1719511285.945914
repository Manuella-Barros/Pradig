{"id": 223758274, "title": "Amazon Just Cut Some of Our Favorite Wireless Earbuds for Running by $40", "text": "It can often be an exercise in futility to find a pair of wireless earbuds that stay in place during a workout. Luckily, we've found a pair that work beautifully. The Shokz OpenFit earbuds tick all of the important boxes for those with active lifestyles. These bone conduction headphones are some of our favorite running earbuds and are the perfect option for fitness buffs. You can save a bundle on these buds at Amazon today, too: they've dropped to a record-low price of just $140. That's a savings of $40 off their usual price, but this limited-time deal won't last long. Choose between both black and beige colorways and scoop them up before this discount passes you by. Because the Shokz OpenFit are earbuds with ear hooks they're more likely to stay secured when performing strenuous activity. They also have an IP54 rating, so they'll handle sweat, dust and the elements in general, but don't plan to go swimming with them. It's also worth mentioning that the controls are touch-based, which might be frustrating for some who prefer the more tactile feel of a button. Beyond that, the audio fidelity is surprisingly good, and the app even lets you fiddle around with the EQ so you can set it just right, but note that there's no noise cancelation. The OpenFit features an open design that fires sound into your ears using what Shokz dubs \"air conduction\" technology. Being open-ear, you still have an awareness of your surroundings which is handy when pounding pavements or lifting weights in the gym. As for battery life, you can get up to seven hours on the earbuds plus another 21 hours or so in the charging case, giving you a total of 28 hours. Unfortunately, it doesn't have wireless charging, but you can get an hour's worth of battery with a five-minute charge, so even if you're in a hurry, you can get some battery life out of it. The case charges via USB-C. All in all, it's a solid set of earbuds if you're looking for something for your workouts.

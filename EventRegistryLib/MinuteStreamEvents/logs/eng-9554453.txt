Paul Sarlo, D-Bergen, the committee's chairman - was met again with a vocal opposition on Thursday in Trenton.\n\nSarlo introduced the bill by saying that legislative officials had met with various working groups but he did acknowledge that \"all amendments and all recommendations were not accepted as part of a compromise.\"\n\nHe said that there are also suggestions from the Assembly and the governor's office that have been included.\n\n'Deeply flawed' legislation moves forward -- despite considerable public opposition\n\nAdvocates such as media attorney Thomas Cafferty described the updated bill as \"deeply flawed\" and said it would, if passed, \"thwart public access.\" He spoke specifically about the provision related to attorney fees, which the bill would not require agencies to pay in the event a denial is taken to court.\n\n\"It should not be lost that the current structure of attorney fees requires the court finds the denial access was wrongful and the fees are reasonable,\" he said. \"There is judicial oversight as it exists now.\"\n\nAttorney CJ Griffin, who has represented NorthJersey.com and The Record and various other media organizations in successful OPRA cases dozens of times, pointed out records being requested \"belong to the public.\"\n\n\"Our taxpayers pay for all those records to be created. We deserve access to those records,\" she said.\n\nWhile Sarlo had mentioned New Jersey Citizen Action as an organization involved in the discussions on the bill since it first appeared, executive director Dena Mottola Jaborska \"objected to the characterization that we helped shape this bill.\"\n\n\"The concerns around commercial use and privacy are really just excuses for what this bill really does -- which ... actually gets in the way of public participation in our democracy by making it harder to request documents,\" she said. \"The concerns we have and what we think this bill now does is targets the public. It targets people who need to be using OPRA to keep democracy healthy.\"\n\nBut not everyone was opposed to the bill. Michael Cerra, executive director of the League of Municipalities, was joined on a panel by mayors from Deptford, Plainfield and Bethlehem Township.\n\nHe said that if the League had written the bill it \"would go even further\" but that it was a \"very good bill.\"\n\nCerra also spoke out against a poll conducted by FDU which found that 81% of respondents were opposed to the bill.\n\nOur view: Amended OPRA bill an absolute sham. Gov. Murphy, veto this affront to democracy\n\nThree senators -- Testa, O'Scanlon and Zwicker -- vote no\n\nWhile the bill saw more than three hours of testimony, it ultimately cleared committee with a vote of 10-3.\n\nState Sen. Michael Testa and state Sen. Declan O'Scanlan, both Republicans, and state Sen. Andrew Zwicker, an Democrat, all voted against the bill.\n\nTesta said that during his time in office he's learned that the public is \"starving for more transparency and accountability in government\" and the \"public perception\" is that this bill restricts those things.\n\nO'Scanlon and Zwicker also said that they recognize that OPRA needs to be modernized in some way but that this bill is \"not there yet.\"\n\nZwicker said after the meeting that the strong opposition from groups that use OPRA to \"do their work and hold government accountable was very convincing.\"\n\nHe went on to say that there are things that were mentioned during testimony that he would need to look into further especially the idea that a government agency can sue a requester and that the terms of that \"vague.\"\n\nAs had happened in March, state Sen. Gordon Johnson, D-Bergen, was not on hand and a placard displaying the name of a different lawmaker was displayed in Johnson's place. This time it was state Sen. Joseph Cryan. Similarly, state Sen. Robert Singer's placard sat in place of state Sen. Doug Steinhardt.\n\nBoth Singer and Cryan voted in favor of the bill but did not appear at the hearing that lasted for more than three hours.\n\nWhen reached by phone on Wednesday, Senate President Nick Scutari said that the amendments \"speak for themselves\" and \"there were a lot of amendments made on behalf of the lawyers and advocates so I think it's a significant opportunity to help maintain municipal level costs.\"\n\nScutari voted during the committee meeting in place of state Sen. Patrick Diegnan, who according to the Senate Majority Office was unable to attend due to a death in the family.\n\nSince the bill was first heard in committee in March, Republicans in both chambers have joined as sponsors -- state Sen. Anthony Bucco in the upper chamber and Assemblywoman Victoria Flynn in the lower chamber.\n\nWhat would the legislation do to curtail OPRA?\n\nWhile some amendments were provided to The Record and other media outlets earlier in the week, a second set of amendments to the bill became available shortly after the meetings scheduled 10 a.m. start time and had still not been posted on the legislative website even after the meeting ended.\n\nThe version of the bill that the committee voted on after about three hours testimony includes the renewed ability to make anonymous requests and the removal of exemptions for call and email logs and digital calendars.\n\nIt also implements stricter requirements on how to requests things like texts and emails including specific accounts, times, topics and titles.\n\nThere are modifications to the provision limiting access to metadata to allow for access only to the \"portion that identifies authorship, identity of editor, and time of change.\"\n\nLanguage restricting data brokers and commercial entities that resell information obtained through OPRA was also removed.\n\nAmong the parts that remain include one of the most controversial, known as the fee-shifting provision, remains largely intact. This provision previously required public record custodians that had not, according to a judge, properly provided records to pay the requesters' attorney fees out of pocket.\n\nThe bill initially changed that to say winners of OPRA lawsuits \"may\" be entitled to legal fees if the public agency is found to have knowingly violated the law or unreasonably denied access. In its amended form, the bill still eliminates the attorney fee requirement but does allow for judges to decide that fees are warranted if the denial was unreasonable, if the agency \"acted in bad faith, or knowingly and willfully violated\" the law.\n\nThe amendments also include language that would allow for a court to \"issue a protective order limiting the number and scope of requests the requester may make\" if they \"sought records with the intent to substantially interrupt the performance of government function.\"\n\nWhile the proposed legislation was pulled from consideration before the Assembly Appropriations Committee just minutes before the panel was to convene in March, it is expected to appear there Friday afternoon.\n\nThe legislation was first enacted in 2002 and requires local, county and state government entities to provide the public with access to government records in New Jersey.", "source": {"uri": "northjersey.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "North

Ultimately, advocates say the bill would make it harder for people to get public documents, with one going so far as to say it would \"decimate\" access to public records.\n\nThe New Jersey State League of Municipalities, which lobbies for local government officials who are subject to the current records law, remains one of the bill's major supporters. The new amendments are \"a positive step forward to modify and reform OPRA,\" said Michael Cerra, its executive director.\n\nAccording to a draft of the amended S-2930 and public records, the bill would continue to allow governmental agencies to deny requests for officials' emails, make it difficult for lawyers to win legal fees for objecting to the denial of records and let agencies sue people for submitting requests that \"substantially impair\" their operations. Language that is even tougher than the initial bill would allow a judge to limit or outright ban someone from seeking records from any governmental body statewide.\n\nNumerous individuals and organizations that opposed the bill two months ago when the Senate Budget Committee first approved it, continue to oppose it, including some that had meetings with Senate Democrats or staff since that vote.\n\n\"Even after an outpouring of public opposition to S-2930 -- a bill that will undermine the public's ability to hold government officials accountable based on the language that has been reported and shared thus far -- New Jersey legislators and legislative leadership are continuing to fast-track their attempts to decimate the Open Public Records Act,\" said Sarah Fajardo, policy director for ACLU-NJ. \"Though the bill was initially pulled from consideration following overwhelming public outcry, many lawmakers have been reluctant to prioritize government transparency or act on the significant concerns voiced by their constituents. The ACLU-NJ believes that New Jersey must strengthen and expand access to public records, not restrict it.\"\n\nThe Senate Budget Committee is scheduled to hold a hearing Thursday at 10 a.m. on the amended bill, the text of which was still not available to the public on the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services' website as of Wednesday afternoon. NJ Spotlight News has reviewed a copy of the bill. The Assembly Appropriations Committee has scheduled a hearing on the bill for Friday at noon. Both the Senate and Assembly have voting sessions scheduled for Monday, and while the board lists for those are not yet available, the bill could be posted for final passage.\n\nFirst introduced March 4, the bill was on the fast track for approval. Senate and Assembly committees held hearings on the bill and at the same time approved it despite several hours of testimony, almost all of it in opposition. Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin (D-Middlesex) pulled the measure before its next scheduled hearing and Sen. Paul Sarlo (D-Bergen), its chief sponsor in the upper house, pledged meetings with stakeholders to discuss amendments.\n\nLawmakers plan to consider the amended bill less than a month after an FDU Poll said that 81% of registered voters oppose changing OPRA and only 14% approved tightening access to public records.\n\nThe revised bill 'still guts OPRA.' -- CJ Griffin, director, Justice Gary S. Stein Public Interest Center\n\nAmong the major amendments in the bill is one that removes most references to data brokers, who obtain public records en masse and make them available to others, often for sale. Bill sponsors and supporters initially had said OPRA amendments were needed because fulfilling data broker requests was taxing public records custodians' time and municipal resources. The amended bill would increase the amount of time a data broker might have to wait to get a response to a request from seven to 14 days but would also allow these brokers to get data sooner if they pay higher fees.\n\nThe bill also made broad concessions for unions, which had also opposed the bill, stating specifically that anyone who is part of a collective-bargaining agreement can get a host of data, including in regard to workplace safety, public bidding and wages and payroll.\n\nIt removed a provision that would have created a task force to study public access to police records and recommend changes. Records advocates had argued that was an attempt by the Legislature to reverse a number of recent court decisions that granted public access to such documents as police use-of-force reports. Cerra said he hopes this is an area lawmakers will address in the future.\n\nOtherwise, changes in language did nothing to assuage advocates' concerns that the bill would hurt the public's access to documents that both the press and public have used to expose government wrongdoing.\n\n\"No changes were made to the red lines that make this bill fatally flawed and we remain adamantly opposed to the bill,\" said Maura Collinsgru, director of policy and advocacy with NJ Citizen Action, one of the groups that met with Senate Democrats about amendments. \"These include fee-shifting, the ability of public agencies to sue requestors, the high level of specificity needed for requests, and other obstacles that make harder or more expensive for the public to access government records.\"\n\nFor instance, she said, the first version of the bill would have required a court to determine a denial of records was \"knowing and willful\" before ordering the agency to pay the fees of the lawyer who brought the suit on behalf of an individual or organization. That was changed to finding that the custodian acted in \"bad faith.\" That would still mean lawyers who take cases would run the risk of not getting paid, as most individuals appealing denials could not afford the hours of legal work that go into appeals. So lawyers would take fewer cases and more public records would remain secret.\n\nCerra defended the change, saying the current rates charged by attorneys who represent requesters denied access to records are unacceptably high and need to be reined in.\n\n\"The loudest critics have faith in the judges and/or GRC to determine if access to a government record was improperly denied, but are concerned that the same judge and/or GRC can determine the award of fees based on the facts,\" Cerra wrote in an email. \"It is also important to note that the attorneys who are demanding mandatory prevailing attorney fees are charging significantly more than the attorneys for the public agency. The range for public agencies, depending on size and operations, usually falls under $200 an hour. Meanwhile, the private sector attorneys often demand fees more than double and sometimes triple that rate.\"\n\nGriffin also said that while the bill dropped the prohibition against being able to request an email log, the bill later says that a custodian does not have to fulfill a request if it requires the creation of a new government record, which agencies have argued in the past is the case.\n\n\"So it codifies their argument, which means you won't get them anymore,\" Griffin said.\n\nShe noted the bill also tweaked a provision that would allow an agency to sue a requester, changing the term \"harassment\" as a reason for a suit, to a person seeking to \"substantially impair\" agency operations. And the bill added a new section stating that if a judge either curtails a person's ability to file public records requests or bars them altogether, that ruling would apply in every jurisdiction throughout the state.\n\n'Ultimately, the legislation punishes the public for seeking information that is rightfully theirs.' -- Jesse Burns, executive director, League of Women Voters of New Jersey\n\nAs amended, this bill would allocate $10 million, $2 million more than in its original form, to help put more public records online and fund the Government Records Council, which is an alternative to the courts for settling records disputes. But that body, which would be revamped by the bill, typically has had a large backlog of cases and has not published performance statistics or an annual report in more than a decade.\n\nA 2015 review by the Center for Public Integrity gave the state's OPRA law an F for access to public information. A 2019 study by David Cuillier, director of the Brechner Freedom of Information Project at the University of Florida College of Journalism and Communications, ranked New Jersey 48th -- ahead of only Mississippi, Arkansas and Alabama -- for its public records laws and transparency.\n\nLike other advocates, Jesse Burns, executive director of the League of Women Voters of New Jersey, said lawmakers should be improving access to public records, not making it more difficult.\n\n\"Ultimately, the legislation punishes the public for seeking information that is rightfully theirs,\" Burns said. \"The intense opposition to this legislation is a direct result of how passionately the public feels about the importance of access to public records to protecting our democracy.

Paul Sarlo, D-Bergen -- cleared the budget committee, which Sarlo chairs, one week later -- but not before dozens of advocates spoke out against the bill and what it would do.\n\nDays later, the proposed legislation was pulled from consideration before the Assembly Appropriations Committee just minutes before the committee was to convene.\n\nNow, the legislation has resurfaced and is on the agenda for consideration before Sarlo's committee on Thursday, according to a legislative schedule posted online Monday afternoon.\n\nThe amendments that will accompany the bill have not been posted online.\n\nOur view: Gov. Murphy, you must not allow the Legislature to decimate transparency, OPRA\n\nState Senate President Nick Scutari said in March he thought that by mid-April the Legislature will take up the bill, with \"mostly clarification amendments\" and that the Legislature would \"try\" to make the amendments available for viewing before they are heard in committee.\n\n\"Those amendments are being worked on as we speak, and they're bicameral and bipartisan, so both sides of the aisle and both houses are coming up with things that are going to satisfy both, and I think you're going to see the bill overwhelmingly pass,\" Scutari said in March.\n\nThat bipartisan support shows in the addition of Republican sponsors in both chambers -- state Sen. Anthony Bucco in the upper chamber and Assemblywoman Victoria Flynn in the lower chamber.\n\nSarlo had said at the end of March that he's \"made it clear. If we don't get this done by the first week of April, I gave it a great shot and we'll probably table it for another 20 years.\"\n\nHow would the legislation change OPRA?\n\nIn its current form, the bill creates exemptions for access to email and call logs, dog license information, email addresses and even digital calendars. Requests for email would need to include a \"specific subject matter\" and \"discrete and limited time period\" as well as a specific person, instead of a title or government department.\n\nThe bill would also ban the release of metadata, which is the information about when an electronic file was created and who created it.\n\nCharlie Stile: The backlash on OPRA and the NJ primary are real. Democrats better pay attention\n\nRequests that an agency thinks could lead to \"harassment\" could be denied, and an official OPRA request form would need to be used. One of the most noted changes would be to the policy regarding attorney's fees in the event of a lawsuit.\n\nRequesters who win OPRA lawsuits \"may\" be entitled to legal fees if the public agency is found to have knowingly violated the law or unreasonably denied access.\n\nThe legislation was first enacted in 2002 and requires local, county and state government entities to provide the public with access to government records in New Jersey.\n\nGov. Phil Murphy would not comment on the specifics of pending legislation during a regular \"Ask Governor Murphy\" segment on WNYC in March, but did say he thought OPRA needed to be tweaked, given the way that technology has changed in the years since it was implemented, and said he had heard anecdotally about concerns regarding commercial use of the process.\n\n\"We are all in on transparency,\" Murphy said. \"I would think if you get something that would address some of the things I just mentioned in a fair way that doesn't undermine transparency, that's something that I'm open-minded to ... I haven't seen anyone with nefarious behavior here. I think there are people who are legitimately trying to address some issues with the system, but we are all in on transparency most importantly.

Instead, the new measure would allow government clerks up to 14 days to respond to requests for records and allow for commercial interests to pay up to twice the cost of producing the records.\n\n\"When both sides are potentially not thrilled, you have a good compromise,\" Senate Budget Committee Chairman Paul Sarlo said.\n\nCivil rights groups, citizens and media organizations testified Thursday against the measure, citing in particular the end of what they said was a key component of the law: attorney fee shifting, which under current law provides for government agencies to pay legal fees only if the government is found to have improperly denied records.\n\nThat provision is important, according to attorney CJ Griffin, who testified in opposition Thursday, because journalists and the public often don't have the funds to pursue costly legal cases to obtain records.\n\n\"If your goal is to handle commercial requests ... this bill doesn't do it,\" Griffin said. \"This bill instead guts transparency.\"\n\nDebate simmers over fate of effort to overhaul New Jersey's public records law\n\nA legislative effort to revamp New Jersey's Open Public Records Act is stalled, but critics continue advocating against it.\n\nThe post Debate simmers over fate of effort to overhaul New Jersey's public records law appeared first on New Jersey Monitor.\n\nThe bill's sponsors countered that a court could determine that attorneys' fees were warranted if a government records custodian acted in bad faith.\n\nAnother new provision of the proposed measure that drew opposition Thursday was the authorization for lawsuits to be brought in state Superior Court for records that requesters have determined to be interrupting \"government function.\"\n\nSarlo said he thought the criticism was inaccurate, but didn't specify.\n\nLori Buckelew, a top official with the League of Municipalities that pushed for the legislation, said the changes are necessary to protect taxpayer dollars from the abuses of overburdensome records requests.\n\nPaul Mordany, the mayor of Deptford, Gloucester County, said his town has 200 pending requests, only three of which are from town residents. The rest are from lawyers, real estate developers and other commercial interests. The stress wears on the town clerk responsible for handling the requests under the Open Public Records Act, or OPRA, he said.\n\n\"I literally sat in her office more than one time as she literally cried over OPRA requests,\" he said.\n\nAccess to officials' emails and other public records regularly results in news stories shedding light on how government works.\n\nIn 2018, for instance, the records law resulted in the disclosure of emails showing the then-governor's administration working with the executives of a utility company lobbying lawmakers for a $300 million bailout for its nuclear plants.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Critics call it a \"corruption-codifying\" bill. (Dave Whitney | Getty Images)\n\nNew Jersey lawmakers plan to consider on Thursday an amended version of a bill that would add restrictions to the state's Open Public Records Act, with the changes meant to appease critics -- who remain very much unappeased.\n\nTransparency advocates and community activists testified against the bill for hours at two March hearings held just days after the bill was introduced. Lawmakers yanked it from a scheduled vote amid continuing discontent a few days later to make amendments. A draft of those amendments circulated this week, renewing outcry from critics who plan to protest what they call the \"corruption-codifying OPRA secrecy bill\" at the Senate's budget and appropriations committee meeting Thursday, where it'll be heard.\n\n\"Even after an outpouring of public opposition to S2930 -- a bill that will undermine the public's ability to hold government officials accountable based on the language that has been reported and shared thus far -- New Jersey legislators and legislative leadership are continuing to fast-track their attempts to decimate the Open Public Records Act,\" said Sarah Fajardo, policy director of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey. \"The ACLU-NJ believes that New Jersey must strengthen and expand access to public records, not restrict it.\"\n\nThe ACLU-NJ, League of Women Voters of New Jersey, and other groups mounted a petition drive and urged residents to call and write their legislators to oppose the bill, which the league called \"an attack on the public's right to PUBLIC records.\"\n\nThe bill's sponsors -- Sens. Paul Sarlo (D-Bergen) and Anthony Bucco (R-Morris) and Assembly members Joe Danielsen (D-Somerset), Vicky Flynn (R-Monmouth), and Reginald Atkins (D-Union) -- say OPRA needs more restrictions to protect against privacy invasions and commercial abuse.\n\nThe amendments would tweak one of the more controversial provisions of the original bill -- fee-shifting.\n\nThe law now says public entities \"shall\" pick up the bill for court battles over denied records that they lose, which supporters say ensures that court costs won't dissuade journalists and citizen watchdogs from fighting for records they believe were wrongly denied.\n\nUnder the bill, \"shall\" would become \"may,\" meaning fee-shifting becomes discretionary. Critics warn that means the public will be less likely to challenge records denials if they have to shoulder legal costs themselves, so records won't get disclosed and government will get less transparent.\n\nOne amendment tweaks the \"may\" back to \"shall\" -- only if the public agency is determined to have acted in bad faith.

Gov. Murphy, veto this affront to democracy - Editorial", "body": "If you cast your ballot for Democrats this fall, that's a vote to preserve the great tradition of our American democracy -- at least that's the message strategists are using in their presidential and congressional campaigns, and across down-ballot races, too.\n\nHere in New Jersey, though, it becomes harder and harder to believe.\n\nLast year, the reigning Democrats in Trenton pushed through the loathsome Elections Transparency Act, which upended our nonpartisan election watchdog, the New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission, weakened robust campaign finance laws that targeted pay-to-play laws, and allowed deep-pocketed political donors and corporations to spend more on New Jersey elections.\n\nAs we said then -- and since -- this legislation should never have been signed. It badly damaged New Jersey's standards for good government.\n\nThis year -- after a failed attempt in 2023 -- we saw the same Democrats, led by Senate President Nicholas Scutari, target the New Jersey Open Public Records Act. The statute, enacted in 2002, gives the public broad access to public documents and government data. An alleged reform bill, sponsored by state Sen. Paul Sarlo, the Bergen County Democrat, moved swiftly through the state Senate's budget committee two months ago.\n\nSarlo's legislation was disastrous -- in our view, it was nothing short of a stunning broadside to government transparency. The bill is antithetical to the democratic traditions that Democrats -- including Gov. Phil Murphy -- are vowing to protect.\n\nSarlo's bill, as we noted in March, would have, among other things, limited public access to government email, addresses, email addresses, digital calendars, call logs and dog license information. It also would have banned the release of metadata -- information about when electronic files were created -- and would have allowed records custodians to deny requests judged to lead to possible \"harassment.\" Finally, the proposed bill would have changed policy related to fees recouped by attorneys who sue for access to records.\n\nIn short, Sarlo's bill would have gutted swaths of OPRA, a tool essential to our journalism and to the public's fundamental right to know.\n\nIn an hours-long state Senate budget committee hearing on the proposed law, advocates, attorneys, public officials and members of the Legislature all expressed grave doubts about the alleged reform.\n\nAfter we published an editorial demanding that the governor veto the bill if it was passed, the Assembly pulled the bill from consideration. Legislative leaders, facing significant pressure, promised amendments later in the spring.\n\nNJ open records law could be gutted: Here's what NorthJersey.com has unearthed using OPRA\n\nAmendments disappoint -- and transparency is at risk\n\nWell, this week, amendments -- now introduced by a bipartisan cabal -- have become clear.\n\nThe amended bill, set to make its official debut before the state Senate budget committee later today, is as unacceptable and egregious as its predecessor. It would:\n\nEssentially, the worst parts of the original proposal are intact -- even after members of the Legislature heard concerns from advocates again last week at a Garden State Initiative forum and at a forum held at Ryder University.\n\nAnd just as it was in March, this embarrassment of a bill appears to be on a fast track. The Assembly Appropriations Committee is set to consider it Friday. A vote could come as soon as Monday.\n\nAssemblyman Brian Bergen, a Morris County Republican, was an outspoken critic of the bill as first proposed two months ago. In a conversation this week, Bergen conveyed a basic truth about the new law: Its sponsors took a travesty of a bill and made it only slightly less bad.\n\n\"The truth is, those pushing this bill have bad intentions,\" Bergen said this week. \"They want to limit transparency in government. They could amend it 1,000 times and change words around to confuse us, but we know their goal. And we have to stop them.\"\n\nCJ Griffin, an attorney well known across the state for her work and advocacy around OPRA, was equally sanguine.\n\n\"Democracy, transparency and accountability feel under constant assault the past year,\" Griffin said. \"Folks are shocked that even after a poll showed 81% of the public does not want this bill to pass, the Legislature is still forging ahead to gut OPRA. When government is less transparent, deep distrust grows. So does the amount of corruption and waste. Hopefully Governor Murphy, Speaker Coughlin and a bunch of brave lawmakers step up and put a stop to this atrocious bill.\"\n\nIt's up to Murphy\n\nTo date, 2024 has been a year of tectonic change in New Jersey's political sphere.\n\nSen. Bob Menendez goes on trial Monday in a federal bribery case. Rep. Andy Kim appears to have prevailed in a heated Democratic primary to replace Menendez, dispatching Tammy Murphy, the first lady, from the race. In pursuing that office, Kim also unleashed a maelstrom by filing a federal lawsuit to eliminate the county line -- the long-held practice of giving candidates endorsed by county-level political organizations preferential placement on New Jersey ballots.\n\nThe restive grassroots of the New Jersey Democratic Party were pivotal in advancing Kim's candidacy -- and there was palpable public support to trash the line. Democratic voters clearly believe in our democracy -- even as their elected representatives eschew that notion in pursuit of raw political power.\n\nAs we did in March, we will again lay the burden to stop this unabashed attempt to consolidate power -- and circumvent the democracy our legislative leaders claim to love -- at the feet of Gov. Phil Murphy.\n\nBefore the Assembly pulled the bill in March, Murphy, who has said he supports changes to OPRA to accommodate technology, made his position on transparency crystal-clear. Speaking on one of his regular WNYC \"Ask the Governor\" segments, he was unequivocal.\n\n\"We are all in on transparency,\" Murphy said. \"I would think if you get something that would address some of the things I just mentioned in a fair way that doesn't undermine transparency, that's something that I'm open-minded to ... I haven't seen anyone with nefarious behavior here. I think there are people who are legitimately trying to address some issues with the system, but we are all in on transparency most importantly. Period. Full stop.\"\n\nGovernor, these proposed changes to OPRA would do just that -- they would undermine transparency and democracy.\n\nShould the bill pass both chambers of the Legislature, you must veto it.", "source": {"uri": "northjersey.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "North Jersey"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Murphy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5,

Most notably, the elimination of mandatory \"fee shifting\" -- the requirement that governments found to have improperly denied records requests pay the requesters' legal costs -- remains in the bill. But it's been tweaked so that a judge has no discretion if the government agency had operated in \"bad faith.\" A new section of the bill would bar people who requested camera footage from disclosing images of a subject's \"intimate parts.\"\n\nA lot of the advocates who spoke out against the OPRA overhaul haven't weighed in on the amendments yet, but the most prominent one, CJ Griffin, was not assuaged. The bill is scheduled for a Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee hearing Thursday, and if it's anything like the hearing in March, it will not be a short one.\n\nMeanwhile, the Senate Community and Urban Affairs committee approved legislation, NJ S2702, that would require New Jersey's six Charter Law counties to only vote by ordinance on the base salary of high-ranking officials, instead of \"compensation,\" as the current law states.\n\nState Sen. Brian Stack introduced this bill, which is backed by the New Jersey Association of Counties, in response to this report by the state Comptroller that alleged high-ranking Union County officials were paid stipends and tuition reimbursements without the county going through the ordinance process.\n\nComptroller Kevin Walsh -- whom the New Jersey Association of Counties has been targeting a lot lately -- said the bill would give the public less input on officials' pay, removing a check and balance by no longer having the same stringent public notice requirements for ordinances.\n\n\"I urge caution and a re-thinking of the role of the public when the people with the greatest access to power and access to the greatest perks get paid,\" Walsh said.\n\nNJ Citizen Action's Maura Collinsgru said at the hearing she was concerned about the weakened transparency from this bill, as well as the OPRA legislation.\n\nBut after ripping the comptroller in his testimony, New Jersey Association of Counties Executive Director John Donnadio said the public will still get notice of resolutions and said the bill is just clarifying precedent.\n\n\"If feel like there's a conflict of interest here for the comptroller to come up and testify in a public hearing in opposition to a bill where he's conducting an investigation -- the same investigation -- in two other of the charter counties right now,\" Donnadio said, apparently making news.

After spending two months huddling with advocates and interest groups, lawmakers on Monday released the highly anticipated amendments to a bill to overhaul the 22-year-old Open Public Records Act. ... The original bill, NJ S2930 (24R), first proposed in March, drew an outpouring of criticism that stalled its progress following approval in committees in both houses on March 11. Advocates and interest groups were most concerned with the bill's elimination of \"fee shifting\" -- the requirement that courts and the Government Records Council award attorneys fees to those who successfully appeal the denial of a records request -- instead leaving it up to a judge's discretion. Under the amendments released Monday, it would still be up to a judge's discretion, unless they determine that the denial was made in \"bad faith.\" In that case, the awarding of attorneys' fees would be mandatory. Attorney C.J. Griffin, who frequently litigates records request denials and was the bill's most outspoken critic, said the amendments still \"gut\" fee shifting and that the amount of government transparency will vary county by county because of judges' personal views on the fee shifting.\n\nLADY GAG -- \"Gag order in sex harassment case found unconstitutional by state's high court, adding victim has right to speak freely,\" by NJ Advance Media's Ted Sherman: \"The N.J.

Calling the regulation 'unconstitutionally overbroad,' the court said the scope of the rule would 'cause countless victims and witnesses to surrender their protected right to speak freely about harassment and discrimination.' ... At issue was a complaint filed by Viktoriya Usachenok, who filed an internal complaint in 2016 with the Equal Employment Opportunity and Affirmative Action office in the Department of the Treasury where she then worked, alleging a hostile work environment. She accused a supervisor of 'pervasive sexual harassment' that included stalking, sexual propositioning, unwelcome gifts, physical touching, and assault. ...

But last month, Fulop condemned the Middlesex County party as a descendant of the machine corruption wielded by legendary Jersey City Mayor Frank 'I am the Law' Hague. The cheerleader now has become a reformer -- and a scold. Fulop brushed aside suggestions that rank opportunism ... 'I don't think that I've ever, politically speaking, been entirely embraced by the county organizations,' he said in an interview in a cafe\u0301 next to City Hall one day last week.\"\n\n-- \"It's Nurse Appreciation Week.

'I am deeply honored and humbled to have received the Democratic endorsement for the 10th congressional seat,' McIver said. 'This moment is not just a personal achievement but a testament to the trust and confidence that the community has placed in me to carry on the legacy of dedicated public service set by the late Honorable Donald M. Payne, Jr. and his father.' McIver, 38, has emerged as the frontrunner in the July 16 special Democratic primary to fill the remaining months of Payne's term.\"\n\n-- \"Essex united for McIver,\" by InsiderNJ's Max Pizarro: \"The CD-10 seat will go to LaMonica McIver, on the strength of a united front by Newark Mayor Ras Baraka and Essex County Democratic Committee Chairman LeRoy Jones, the two main players in the district. Others may contend for the seat left vacant by the death of U.S. Rep. Donald Payne, Jr, (D-10) but McIver, the Newark City Council President, stands poised as a clear favorite following a weekend of key-player meetings. Essex Mayors will back McIver. Ministers, too. The support of Irvington Mayor Tony Vauss is key here, as it was Team Irvington Strong that bucked Baraka for a vacant LD-28 Senate seat in 2022. This time, the politically muscular Vauss supports Baraka's choice for the seat, longtime Baraka ally McIver.\"\n\n-- \"State economic development official expected to run for Payne's House seat\"\n\n-- \"How Rutgers student protest was peacefully resolved\"\n\n-- Rutgers University president stands by decision to negotiate to end protests\n\n-- House education committee calls on Rutgers University and Northwestern University leaders to testify\n\n-- \"Opinion: Menendez and Cuellar cases sound the alarm on foreign influence on Congress\"\n\n-- \"Former Paterson robbery squad sergeant has agreed to repay city $200K\"\n\n-- \"Sherrill will combat Trump N.J. visit with a day of action to stand up to GOP nominee\"\n\nJOSHI'S ISLAND -- \"NBT lawsuit reveals videos of Edison cops detaining busload of immigrants,\" by New Brunswick Today's Charlies Kratovil: \"New Brunswick Today filed the lawsuit, with the help of an OPRA attorney, after the EPD failed to release official recordings they were holding onto from the encounter. Videos recorded by the body-worn cameras on each of the four responding officers' uniforms depict their questionable detention of approximately 38 people, most of whom were not allowed to get off the bus for the duration of the interaction. The recordings also capture the group of responding cops bantering among themselves about the situation, joking and fantasizing about sicking a 'drug dog' on the immigrants and escorting the bus out of town at gunpoint. 'Have your service weapon pointed out your window at all times,' joked Officer Zachary Dlabik. 'Get out of Edison!' added Officer Spadaro, making his hand into the shape of a gun. ... Dlabik's tone turned serious, as he walked with his colleagues to an idling police cruiser and lamented the situation that was playing out just a couple of hours into the New Year.

Kenneth Burns: \"Nearly half of the 140 school districts facing cuts in New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy's proposed budget are in South Jersey, according to a WHYY News analysis. At least 30 districts are facing cuts of at least 10%. Burlington County, overall, has the most number of districts that will experience reductions in aid. 'It's not fair,' said state Sen. Latham Tiver, who represents a part of Burlington County where ten school districts are experiencing cuts in state aid. Using the Lenape Regional High School District as an example, Tiver said officials were not expecting reduced state funding of almost 20% or $4.7 million. ... State Sen.

CRDA Deputy Director Maisha Moore said Tony Mart raised about $19,000 from other sources for the event. CRDA board member Brett Matik said that isn't enough for the organization to pay its own salaries. 'While I think all of these activities are phenomenal for Atlantic City, I do think the organizations need to start having some other funding sources besides us,' Matik said.

The state's 130 recreational dispensaries had roughly $201 million in non-medical cannabis sales during the first three months of the year, about 4.4% more than they reported in the last quarter of 2023, when recreational sales totaled $192.6 million. The growth reflects a marked slowdown from the final quarter of 2023, when recreational marijuana sales grew by about 8.9% in what was then the lowest growth quarter on record, and it could herald the end of surging growth the adult-use market has enjoyed since its launch despite persistently high prices. ... Some cannabis boosters suggested the slowdown was a result of regular business cadence and shifting seasonal demand. ... Others pointed to New Jersey's persistently high cannabis prices to explain the flagging growth, noting prices here are among the nation's highest.\"\n\n-- \"After traumatic brain injury, Rider senior lands dream job before graduation\"", "source": {"uri": "politico.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "POLITICO"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Walsh_(Gaelic_footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Walsh (Gaelic footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_State_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey State Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comptroller", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Comptroller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Fulop", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steven Fulop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocacy_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Advocacy group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidentiality", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Confidentiality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fintech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fintech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Public_Records_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Open Public Records Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_Council_of_Newark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Municipal Council of Newark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Payne_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Payne Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Lesniak", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Raymond Lesniak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Wildstein", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Wildstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bar (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevens_Institute_of_Technology", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stevens Institute of Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_ordinance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Local ordinance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheerleading", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cheerleading"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Separation of powers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutgers_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rutgers University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conflict of interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Precedent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_County,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Union County, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Union County, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middlesex_County,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middlesex County, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Middlesex County, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ras_J._Baraka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ras J.

Fierce defenders of public records access butted heads with concerned mayors and municipal clerks over the proposed measure.\n\n\"The bill remains deeply flawed,\" said media attorney Thomas Cafferty. \"Many records that are currently available to the public will be cloaked in secrecy, or otherwise made more difficult to obtain, if the bill is enacted.\"\n\n\"We're not trying to destroy democracy,\" argued Deptford Mayor Paul Medany. \"We're trying to help protect the people who service democracy.\"\n\nCritics claim that state Sen. Paul Sarlo (D-Bergen), the bill's sponsor, is rushing the measure through. It's his second attempt to fast-track the bill, after the first one got pulled following a firestorm of protest. In Sarlo's view, OPRA's an out-of-date law that's turned been taken advantage of by commercial data miners and lawyers.\n\n\"I think you'll hear today, it's about attorney fees, and about a cottage industry of folks making money off the taxpayers of NJ,\" Sarlo said. \"I'm not sure how to resolve this but we've done our best.\"\n\nThe amended version requires requests include more specific information, with names and dates, and shifts the cost of attorney fees. It also lets agencies to sue people if their requests \"substantially impair\" government operations. An overflow crowd heard mayors, clerks and lobbyists urge lawmakers to vote \"yes.\"\n\nProgressive groups, media lawyers and unions argued that OPRA as it stands is crucial, noting it helped break open the Bridgegate case by uncovering the critical \"time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee\" email.\n\nThe Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee cleared the bill by a vote of 10-3. Dissenting were state Sens. Andrew Zwicker (D-Middlesex), Declan O'Scanlon (R-Monmouth) and Michael Testa (R-Cumberland).\n\n\"At some point, we're long overdue for OPRA reform for a lot of the reasons we heard from people backing the bill today,\" O'Scanlon said. \"I just don't think this bill is there yet.\"\n\nThe Assembly Budget Committee will hear testimony on this bill Friday.

{"id": 231345772, "title": "So You Scored a Ticket to the Olympics? Now Try to Land a Hotel Room", "text": "Gold medals are one thing, but for many wealthy Americans heading to Paris for the Olympics, running July 26 to Aug. 11, there\u2019s more to their must-dos than seeing Simone Biles, Sha\u2019Carri Richardson and LeBron James compete \u2014 or spotting NBC Sports\u2019 \u201cchief superfan commentator\u201d Leslie Jones taking in the action. \u201cThe top request is an Herm\u00e8s appointment,\u201d says Jason Squatriglia of travel agency Embark Beyond. \u201cIt has to be a guaranteed leather goods [meeting], not just to get in the store and skip the line. They want to know they\u2019ll be shown, perhaps, a mini Kelly or an exotic.\u201d It\u2019s a hint of the caliber of clients he\u2019s sending to the Games. \u201cThese are not your traditional sports fans \u2014 these are your F1, Art Basel, Frieze clients, who want to do the best of the best and turn it into an exclusive shopping experience, like shutting Boucheron down on Place Vend\u00f4me.\u201d Budget isn\u2019t a barrier, either: For one family of four, a four-night stay is costing $280,000, and that\u2019s only to cover their accommodation at Le Meurice (the Louis XVI-decorated five-star spot moments from the Tuileries), where everyone from Grace Kelly to Justin Bieber has stayed. Paris is the latest city to see the Olympic torch arrive, along with millions of visitors \u2014 an expected 10 million, in fact, or almost 10 times as many as Rio de Janeiro hosted in 2016, for the last Summer Games to be unaffected by COVID-19. That surge is due both to pandemic-throttled, pent-up excitement and the built-in appeal of the City of Light. \u201cI am really looking forward to the events that are located at major Parisian landmarks. I think it will be spectacular \u2014 imagine watching an Olympic event [such as beach volleyball] under the Eiffel Tower. Magical!\u201d says figure skating gold medalist Tara Lipinski, who will be a commentator for the closing ceremonies. There\u2019s continued availability at many luxe properties, note insiders. Many of the greedily required excessive minimums when bookings opened \u2014 as much as 18 nights \u2014 have since been softened, albeit not the prices; Squatriglia says that most upscale hotels are charging up to two and a half times their typical rates. Top spots include the H\u00f4tel Plaza Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e (where guests can find cheeky red dumbbells awaiting them in their rooms), the InterContinental Paris Le Grand, the Four Seasons Hotel George V and Rosewood\u2019s Crillon, where Taylor Swift has stayed. It\u2019s right by Place de la Concorde, where the 3\u00d73 basketball competition will take place. (Many rooms are still available in Paris during the Summer Games via booking.com.) The Intercontinental Le Grand, for one, is primed and ready. The property has kept a team of physical therapists and coaches on tap for its staff since last September, with pilates, yoga and other classes laid on so they can finesse their own fitness in preparation for the Games. \u201cWe have two sporting coaches, working in the hotel to prepare the team physically and emotionally,\u201d says the property\u2019s GM Christophe Laure, who\u2019s also organizing internal Olympics between staff capped with a medal ceremony after the official Games concludes. For the most desirable suites in Paris for his clients, Squatriglia has resorted to trading favors, such as, say, offering a hotelier some backstage Broadway access for their French travelers next time they\u2019re in New York. Jonathan Alder, founder of Jonathan\u2019s Travels, says his clients are budgeting $200,000 or more for their trips. One client, a family of five, is combining Paris with an adventure trip to Iceland, flying private from the Arctic Circle to the City of Light. The parents will stay at the Eiffel Tower View Suite at the Shangri-La Paris, where Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9 have overnighted; it will set them back around $13,000 per day. \u201cIt\u2019s non-refundable, or cancelable, for any reason, and all fully paid for the day it opened up,\u201d says Alder. This family isn\u2019t alone: most high-end advisers note that this event has seen a shift in travel patterns for regulars. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten to know kids I knew existed but never had their information and preferences,\u201d says Squatriglia, \u201cI\u2019ve been working with clients for years and this is the first time they\u2019re going as a family unit.\u201d The experiences at the Paris Games are more tightly controlled than ever before, after IMG-owned On Location scored an exclusive contract from the International Olympic Committee to manage hospitality for Paris, the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Games and Los Angeles 2028. The pick of the various packages is the On the Finish Line option \u2014 which can go up to around $9,225 per person, hotel stay not included \u2014 offering everything from gourmet dining to finish-line tickets and athlete meet-and-greets. On Location\u2019s Paul Caine acknowledges it\u2019s been challenging to help Olympic regulars understand that they can\u2019t simply sidestep official channels as they might have in the past. \u201cAnyone who didn\u2019t go with us, but went with their legacy provider now? They will not make that decision for Milan or L.A.,\u201d he says. Caine calls out the chance to experience the immersive opening ceremony, which will ditch the traditional stadium setting and instead unfurl along the banks of the Seine; On Location will host parties on some of Paris\u2019 famed bridges for VIP viewing. Alder, meanwhile, is encouraging his clients to linger at the Shangri-La to avoid the crowds and ticket prices \u2014 he\u2019s seen them cost up to $17,000 per person. \u201cThe hotel backs on to the river,\u201d he says, \u201cso with the opening ceremonies right there, you might be able to see some of it from your room, or host a party on the balcony to watch as it goes by.\u201d Restaurants are a particular challenge in Paris, which boasts more than 120 Michelin stars. In-demand spots have introduced minimums, agents explain, insisting that clients commit to spending perhaps $5,000 or more for supper to guarantee a hard-to-score table. \u201cThey want to know whether they\u2019ll be ordering bottles of Macallan,\u201d Squatriglia says. Philip Haslett, who runs French Promise, a local agency for VIPs, is fielding requests for such top spots as Girafe (overlooking the Eiffel tower) and Le Gabriel at La R\u00e9serve, which just earned three Michelin stars, as well as Don Juan II, the 36-seat river cruise with chef Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Anton. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like ticket touters: People are booking tables in advance, and hanging on to them to sell to someone who needs it later,\u201d Haslett notes. Entertainment industry power players will also likely be spotted at Trocad\u00e9ro restaurant Gigi Rigolatto, known for its spectacular views, where Endeavor will host a hospitality lounge. Scoring an after-hours tour of top monuments won\u2019t be straightforward, either, as another operator explains \u2014 and all thanks to manpower: \u201cSecurity is being used elsewhere, so they can\u2019t do any VIP stuff.\u201d Perhaps the biggest hurdle for elite visitors to the Olympics is logistical. Parisian airspace is tightly controlled, effectively banning helicopters \u2014 the closest landing pad is in Issy-les-Moulineaux to the southwest; without traffic, that\u2019s a 15-minute ride to downtown. Of course, there are likely to be jams, and chauffeurs are already scarce. Drivers are operating with 12-hour minimums, or triple the typical window, and though there will be VIP lanes, access remains murky. One of Alder\u2019s clients has laid out $140,000 on cars alone, mostly thanks to a focus on the equestrian events, which are being held at the palace of Versailles. It\u2019s also unclear how VIPs will be whisked to and from Charles de Gaulle airport without waiting; the VIP greeter services there are notoriously unreliable. \u201cSometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn\u2019t,\u201d says one agent. But private jet bookings haven\u2019t seen a huge uptick quite yet. David Gitman of Florida-based Monarch Air, for example, hasn\u2019t seen significant volume, but anticipates a spike at the end of June. Fractional ownership specialist VistaJet reports stronger demand, mostly in the run-up to the opening. Jade-Li English \u2014 an agent with Klutch Sports Group who represents a number of WNBA stars who are expected to compete at the games \u2014 tells THR that she\u2019ll be in Paris this year for a \u201csolid 10 days.\u201d \u201cI plan on doing as much as I possibly can but obviously supporting clients first and foremost,\u201d says English. \u201cObviously, the Olympics are a once-in-a-lifetime type of moment.\u201d In addition to the women\u2019s basketball games, English hopes to be able to see the athletic stars like Biles, Richardson and Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce compete. \u201cIt\u2019s about really enjoying a truly world event,\u201d adds English. Some spectators though are avoiding the crowds by heading to the satellite events. Olympic windsurfing is in Tahiti, while sailing will be based in Marseille. Fraser Yachts has seen a specific request from a client for an 88-foot yacht so they can watch \u2014 and potentially follow \u2014 the action there. They insisted on a vessel outfitted with Jet Skis ready to go. \u201cA lot of my clients, they\u2019re dying to go to the Olympics, and they don\u2019t care about the prices. But even like that, they can\u2019t get in,\u201d says Squatriglia, noting that he\u2019s still coming up short scoring gymnastics tickets for one client, a hedge funder, his wife and two adult daughters. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen this much demand in years.\u201d The potential issues are one reason he plans to be on-site. \u201cI might even end up driving a vehicle for them myself.\u201d A version of this story first appeared in the June 5 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.

They planned to use a two-part process: First, they would use IVF, where an egg is combined with a sperm in a lab, and second, they would work with an agency to hire a surrogate who would have the fertilized egg implanted and would carry the baby to term. They planned to have the IVF covered by insurance and planned to pay for the surrogacy out of pocket.\n\nBriskin took a job as an assistant district attorney at the New York County District Attorney's Office in Manhattan in 2017, and he learned soon after that the city's health plan doesn't cover IVF benefits for gay men. Briskin left that job in March 2022, but he is still covered under the city's plan through a federal law called COBRA, which allows employees to continue to receive health care coverage from their former employer for up to three years if they pay the full premium.\n\nThe couple filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in April 2022 and hoped that it would encourage the city to change its policy. However, that didn't happen.\n\nPeter Romer-Friedman, who runs his own firm, Peter Romer-Friedman Law PLLC, based in Washington, D.C., said the city responded to the EEOC charge with a position statement arguing that it doesn't provide IVF benefits to surrogates and, as a result, it would not provide benefits to Briskin and Maggipinto. Romer-Friedman called the city's argument a red herring, because he said Briskin and Maggipinto have never sought any benefits for a surrogate.\n\n\"They're seeking fertilization of donated eggs with their sperm, and those are things that are provided to other people under the plan,\" Romer-Friedman said. \"So, in our view, the city offered no legitimate, legal or factual explanation for treating Corey and Nicholas differently than other couples who get IVF benefits.\"\n\nRomer-Friedman is representing the couple alongside David Lopez, who was general counsel for the EEOC from 2010-2016.\n\nA city hall spokesperson said Mayor Eric Adams' administration \"proudly supports the rights of LGBTQ+ New Yorkers to access the health care they need.\"\n\n\"The city has been a leader in offering IVF treatments for any city employee or dependent covered by the city's health plan who has shown proof of infertility, regardless of gender identity or sexual orientation,\" the spokesperson said. \"The city will review the details of the complaint.\"\n\nRomer-Friedman said that in order to bring a lawsuit under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, a federal law that prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex and national origin, a party is required to first file an EEOC complaint. After a six-month EEOC investigation, the party can choose to go to court.\n\nThe couple's lawsuit argues that the city's exclusion of gay men from being eligible for IVF benefits violates Title VII, the equal protection and due process clauses of the 14th Amendment and New York state and New York City human rights laws.\n\nThe city categorically denies IVF benefits to gay men because it requires employees to meet its definition of infertility in order to qualify, the suit argues. The city defines infertility as the inability to conceive a child through male-female unprotected intercourse in a consecutive 12-month period or through intrauterine insemination, or IUI. Under this definition, single women and lesbian couples can qualify as infertile and receive IVF benefits if they undergo IUI and don't become pregnant, according to the complaint.\n\n\"But gay men, although equally incapable of conceiving a child without IVF, are always denied access to IVF under the City's healthcare plan,\" the complaint states. \"By defining 'infertility' in this exclusionary manner, single female employees, female employees with male partners, female employees with female partners, and male employees with female partners are always potentially eligible for some IVF benefits under the City's healthcare plan, but gay male employees -- whether individually or with male partners -- are never eligible for any IVF benefits.\"\n\nThrough its health care plan, the suit argues, the city \"denies gay men equal treatment and makes it much harder for gay men to have biological children than other employees and their partners.\"\n\nSince 2022, Briskin said, he and Maggipinto have started their journey to become parents. They have received donated embryos that are awaiting transfer to a surrogate, and they hope to have their first child within the next year. However, they are paying for all of the services out of pocket. So far, they have spent about $80,000, and they just received another $9,000 medical bill this week for prescription medications necessary for the IVF process, they said. They expect to pay about $100,000 for the IVF costs, and surrogacy can cost an additional $165,000, according to documents filed with the couple's 2022 EEOC complaint.\n\nDue to the costs, Briskin left the public sector and took a job at a private law firm.\n\n\"I certainly had to make the difficult decision to leave the public sector, which I clearly felt very strongly about -- I worked as a public servant for the first decade of my career,\" Briskin said. \"And that decision was driven in large part by our need to make sure that we can finance this ourselves.\"\n\nBriskin said they've mostly received support from those who have heard about their case, and that people have been \"flabbergasted at the notion that we are even having to have this fight in New York City in 2024.\" But the couple has had a few critics, they said, who have argued that Briskin and Maggipinto don't need the benefits because they are both lawyers.\n\nMaggipinto said they have been fortunate enough to be able to save money to have children, but that their fight isn't about money.\n\n\"If this were just about the money, we would have pursued a settlement with the city and not bothered with all the frustration that this brings, but if there's any point that I would want to make, it's that the policy needs to change,\" Maggipinto said. \"I would love the city to just answer the question directly: What exactly is the holdup? Why are you denying us equal treatment? They've come up with nothing.\"\n\nSince the couple filed their EEOC charge, Romer-Friedman said that 10 New York City council members introduced a bill to offer IVF benefits to city employees regardless of whether they can meet the city's definition of \"infertility,\" and two federal courts have held that health care plans that exclude same-sex couples, specifically lesbian couples, from IVF benefits may violate federal nondiscrimination laws, such as Title VII.\n\nCurrently, just seven states, including New York, require IVF benefits to include same-sex couples, according to a report from nonprofit news website Stateline, though these policies don't explicitly require coverage for gay men.\n\nFor more from NBC Out, sign up for our weekly newsletter.\n\nCORRECTION (May 9, 2024, 12:55 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated the law firm for which Peter Romer-Friedman works.

They planned to use a two-part process: First, they would use IVF, where an egg is combined with a sperm in a lab, and second, they would work with an agency to hire a surrogate who would have the fertilized egg implanted and would carry the baby to term. They planned to have the IVF covered by insurance and planned to pay for the surrogacy out of pocket.\n\nBriskin took a job as an assistant district attorney at the New York County District Attorney's Office in Manhattan in 2017, and he learned soon after that the city's health plan doesn't cover IVF benefits for gay men. Briskin left that job in March 2022, but he is still covered under the city's plan through a federal law called COBRA, which allows employees to continue to receive health care coverage from their former employer for up to three years if they pay the full premium.\n\nThe couple filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in April 2022 and hoped that it would encourage the city to change its policy. However, that didn't happen.\n\nPeter Romer-Friedman, an attorney with Washington, D.C.-based firm Gupta Wessler PLLC, who is representing the couple, said the city responded to the EEOC charge with a position statement arguing that it doesn't provide IVF benefits to surrogates and, as a result, it would not provide benefits to Briskin and Maggipinto. Romer-Friedman called the city's argument a red herring, because he said Briskin and Maggipinto have never sought any benefits for a surrogate.\n\n\"They're seeking fertilization of donated eggs with their sperm, and those are things that are provided to other people under the plan,\" Romer-Friedman said. \"So, in our view, the city offered no legitimate, legal or factual explanation for treating Corey and Nicholas differently than other couples who get IVF benefits.\"\n\nA city hall spokesperson said Mayor Eric Adams' administration \"proudly supports the rights of LGBTQ+ New Yorkers to access the health care they need.\"\n\n\"The city has been a leader in offering IVF treatments for any city employee or dependent covered by the city's health plan who has shown proof of infertility, regardless of gender identity or sexual orientation,\" the spokesperson said. \"The city will review the details of the complaint.\"\n\nRomer-Friedman said that in order to bring a lawsuit under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, a federal law that prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex and national origin, a party is required to first file an EEOC complaint.

But, the couple told Gay City News in a joint interview two years ago, they later learned that their insurance plan did not cover benefits \"because we didn't satisfy the definition of infertility.\"\n\nThe couple said at the time that they could not afford the out-of-pocket expenses associated with IVF services. Briskin described his government salary as one that paid him only \"a fraction\" of the salaries of other attorneys who graduated with him.\n\nThey sought to rectify the issue diplomatically, but that went nowhere, forcing them to file a class action discrimination complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).\n\nAs the EEOC investigated the case, however, the couple became aware that the city covers IVF for other employees in the same situation as them: For example, when a male employee's female partner is unable to produce viable eggs, the city will pay for the fertilization of the eggs the couple receive from a female donor, they said -- and even in cases with females who are viable but not covered by insurance, the city will pay the costs of fertilizing her eggs. But when gay male couples attempt to seek to fertilize donated eggs, they are not covered.\n\nThis, the couple alleges, amounts to discrimination in violation of federal, state, and local anti-discrimination laws, in addition to the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the United States and New York Constitutions. Even after filing the EEOC complaint, the couple says, the discriminatory policy continues. According to NBC News, the couple's attorneys said an EEOC complaint is required, along with a six-month investigation, before advancing a lawsuit under Title VII.\n\nNew York has taken steps to make it easier for LGBTQ individuals to start families, including the state's legalization of gestational surrogacy. A New York State Department of Financial Services directive from 2021 told insurers to \"provide immediate coverage of diagnostic and treatment services... for the diagnosis and treatment of infertility ('basic infertility treatments') for individuals who are unable to conceive due to their sexual orientation or gender identity and are covered under individual, small group, and large group health insurance policies and contracts.\"\n\nSome members of the City Council seem to agree on the need for further reform. A City Council bill proposed in March by out Queens Councilmember Lynn Schulman and co-sponsored by nine others -- including LGBTQIA+ Caucus Co-Chairs Erik Bottcher of Manhattan and Tiffany Cab\u00e1n of Queens -- would require the city to cover some or all of the costs of assisted reproduction without conditioning it on an infertility diagnosis or discriminating on the basis of marital or partnership status.\n\nThe plaintiffs, however, are hoping their case reverberates beyond the confines of the five boroughs. Their attorneys -- Peter Romer-Friedman, who comes from a civil rights and class action law firm, and former general counsel of the EEOO David Lopez -- hope that the case could mandate employers across the US to provide IVF benefits to gay male employees.\n\n\"Gay men are entitled to equal treatment in the workplace, including when employers like the City of New York offer IVF benefits to their employees,\" Romer-Friedman said in a written statement. \"The City of New York is treating gay men like second-class citizens when it comes to IVF benefits. While we're prepared to fight as long as it takes to win equal treatment for gay male employees of the City of New York, we hope that the city's leaders will work with us now to reform this discriminatory policy and ensure that all city employees and their partners can access IVF.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the mayor said the city would review the details of the complaint.\n\n\"The Adams

New York City has about 300,000 employees and its healthcare plan covers about 1.25 million people, according to the complaint.\n\n(Reporting by Daniel Wiessner in Albany, New York, Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi and Michael Erman)", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_men", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gay men"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Class action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterosexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heterosexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Council", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assisted reproductive technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_orientation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual orientation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Protection_Clause", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equal Protection Clause"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment_discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Employment discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Due process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Precedent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albany,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Albany, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Albany, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Compensation_and_Benefits", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Compensation and Benefits", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Infertility", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Infertility", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Law", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 63}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554026", "eventUri": "eng-9554026", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

It could expand coverage for workers nationwide", "body": "A gay couple is suing New York City for denying them in vitro fertilization benefits, claiming the city's current healthcare plan discriminates against gay male employees.\n\nThe class action lawsuit lawsuit was filed Thursday by former New York City assistant district attorney Corey Briskin and his husband, Nicholas Maggipinto. The couple claims the city's healthcare plan has \"categorically excluded\" gay male employees and their partners from receiving IVF benefits, despite offering those same benefits to employees in different-sex relationships, single women and women in same-sex relationships.\n\nThis is the first class action lawsuit to argue that employers must provide gay male employees IVF benefits if those same benefits are offered to other employees, according to a press release from the law firm working with the plaintiffs.\n\nIf successful, the law firm representing Briskin and Maggipinto says the case could extend fertility benefits to gay male couples across the country.\n\n\"We're looking to change the entire legal landscape so that gay men are not going to ever be excluded from IVF,\" Peter Romer-Friedman, the founder of civil rights and class action law firm Peter Romer-Friedman Law PLLC, told USA TODAY.\n\n'Still a lot of hurdles': For LGBTQ+ couples, the path to in vitro fertilization is harder\n\nThe lawsuit claims that New York City's healthcare plan violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act by denying them IVF coverage offered to other employees.\n\nThe issue lies in the city's definition of \"infertile\" as the inability to conceive a child through male-female sexual intercourse or through a procedure called intrauterine insemination, or IUI, in which prepared sperm is placed directly in a uterus.\n\nUnder this definition, same-sex couples can be deemed infertile after 12 months of unsuccessful attempts to conceive. Same-sex and single female partners can be deemed infertile if they are unable to get pregnant with IUI. But the lawsuit argues that this leaves no way for men to qualify as infertile, making it \"much harder\" for gay men to have biological children.\n\nPlaintiffs estimate that the city's \"outdated\" definition has deprived of IVF and family-building benefits to \"hundreds and possible thousands\" of city employees. Without such benefits - which cover 75% of IVF costs, according to the lawsuit - gay couples are left paying more out-of-pocket for the costly procedure.\n\nA single round of IVF \u2012 a medical procedure where eggs and sperm are combined in a lab dish and then transferred into a uterus \u2012 can cost tens of thousands of dollars. That, combined with surrogacy costs, means gay men can expect to pay more than $177,950 to conceive a biological child, according to estimates from the advocacy group Men Having Babies.\n\nInstead, the lawsuit points to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine's recently-updated definition of infertility, which includes those who cannot achieve a successful pregnancy due to \"medical, sexual, and reproductive history, age, physical findings, diagnostic testing, or any combination of those factors.\"\n\n\"(Healthcare) plans that cover infertility need to stay up-to-date on current medical practices,\" said Betsy Campbell, chief engagement officer at Resolve, an infertility advocacy organization. \"Our hope is that all plans and laws will reflect this updated definition of infertility that is inclusive of all people who are struggling to build their families.\"\n\nThe lawsuit says Briskin and Maggipinto have been wanting to grow their family through IVF since 2017.\n\nBriskin asked former Mayor Bill de Blasio's administration in 2021 to provide him and other gay male employees equal IVF benefits but was denied, according to the lawsuit. The couple went on to file a discrimination charge against New York City with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission the following year.\n\nThe city has argued that Briskin and Maggipinto were ineligible for IVF benefits because its healthcare plan does not provide benefits to surrogates, according to the lawsuit. The couple, in turn, argued that they were not seeking reimbursement for any surrogacy charges and \"simply wanted coverage for the same IVF services\" provided to other employees.\n\nThe couple was granted a \"right to sue\" letter from the Department of Justice in March.\n\nIs IVF tax deductible? IVF may be tax deductible, but LGBTQ+ couples less likely to get write-offs\n\nThe lawsuit names Mayor Eric Adams and former mayor Bill de Blasio as defendants. A city hall spokesperson told USA TODAY the city would review the details of the complaint.\n\n\"The Adams administration proudly supports the rights of LGBTQ+ New Yorkers to access the health care they need,\" reads the statement. \"The city has been a leader in offering IVF treatments for any city employee or dependent covered by the city's health plan who has shown proof of infertility, regardless of gender identity or sexual orientation.\"\n\nBriskin left his role as assistant district attorney in 2022 but remains covered by the city's healthcare plan through COBRA. Last year, Briskin and Maggipinto went forward with fertility treatment without IVF coverage provided by the city, which they claim would have awarded them tens of thousands of dollars in benefits.\n\nThe lawsuit says the couple had donor eggs fertilized with their sperm late last year and hopes to transfer the embryos to a surrogate later this year.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_men", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gay men"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_insemination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial insemination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_firm", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Law firm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Class action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infertility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_relationship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Same-sex relationship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sperm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uterus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fertility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Society_for_Reproductive_Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Society for Reproductive Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surrogacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual intercourse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_de_Blasio", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bill de Blasio"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex_Offenses", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex Offenses", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Activism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Family_and_Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Family and Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 48}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/mLoOk5pyOVkdcVKcmfxt9w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD0xMDc3O2NmPXdlYnA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/usa_today_money_325/c70897d9a48e8316ccfc121cb566ed08", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554026", "eventUri": "eng-9554026", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 452990533, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 12, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 12}}}

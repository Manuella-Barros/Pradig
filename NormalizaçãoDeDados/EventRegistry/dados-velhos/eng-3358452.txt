The funds received will help ensure the timely completion of the proposed development and the attainment of the underlying economic and social impact envisaged,\" he said.\n\nIheanacho said several studies, including the front-end engineering design as well as the environmental impact assessment, had been completed, adding that about $250m would be required to complete the refinery.\n\nThe Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Dr. Ibe Kachikwu, who commended the commitment of Iheanacho to the refinery project, said financing was one of the major challenges facing most of those that had been licensed to build refineries in the country.\n\nHe said, \"We all know it is very difficult to raise funds and, therefore, when you hear that the USTDA is extending its hands of fellowship and support to provide the initial seed funding required to go beyond the detailed engineering design, that also shows that behind him (the visionary of this project) there is a partner that is likely to support and provide the financing required to establish the refinery.\n\n\"For him to be able to bring down to this island the US ambassador is another demonstration of the commitment and determination to do whatever is necessary to see this project come on stream.\n\nKachikwu, who was represented by the Executive Director/Coordinator, Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation, Refinery, Downstream and Infrastructural Development, Mr. Rabiu Suleiman, promised to provide all the necessary support required by the company to make the refinery a reality.\n\nHe said he was working hard to see how the company could be granted a pioneer status and secure various duty waivers, import facilitation of equipment and engineering review.\n\nThe minister urged the company to take the host communities along in order to create a harmonious relationship with them.\n\nThe US Ambassador to Nigeria, Mr. Stuart Symington, while commending Iheanacho for the commitment to the project, said, \"He is investing at a time with the government that believes profoundly in the power of the individual citizens and entrepreneurs, and he is doing it at a time with a government that believes Nigeria can do what can be done anywhere in the world.\"\n\nThe Managing Director, VFuels, Mr. Souheil Abboud, said the company was proud to partner the USTDA to further develop the refinery, adding, \"We believe very strongly in our commitment to serving the Nigerian people and are enthusiastic that the USTDA shares the same vision and commitment.\"\n\nHe said the refinery would be a model for those looking to improve Nigeria's local refining capacity and would contribute to the growing demand for fuels and electricity.\n\nThe USTDA helps companies to create the US jobs through the export of the US goods and services for priority development projects in emerging economies.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

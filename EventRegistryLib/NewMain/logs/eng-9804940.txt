That is, except for the big white banner that hangs over the front door, with five interlocking Olympic rings in the center and Reeves' name right beneath them.\n\nInside, a half dozen wooden weightlifting platforms dot the no-frills space. In the middle of Reeves' platform is a white square with an image of the Olympic flame and the words \"Paris 2024.\"\n\nExpectations are high that a member of the U.S. women's weightlifting team could win gold at the Summer Olympics. And among the team's most promising athletes is Reeves -- a 21-year-old college student who is already breaking U.S. weightlifting records.\n\n\"It's incredibly exciting because she is having all this success and she's having it at such a young age,\" says Cara Heads-Slaughter, who was a member of the U.S. women's weightlifting team in 2000.\n\n\"She's on track to be the best U.S. weightlifter in women's history.\"\n\nInside the Chattanooga gym, Reeves begins her routine with coach Steve Fauer, whom she has trained with since she started focusing on weightlifting at age 13.\n\nWhile Paris will be her first Olympic games, it's far from her first time competing on the world stage. She took first place in her weight class at the IWF World Cup Paris qualifier in Thailand earlier this year.\n\n\"It just comes down to having her prepared,\" Fauer says. \"I don't see why we're not going to win the gold medal. We're knocking on the door of world records. I mean, why not?\"\n\nOlympic weightlifters compete in two events.\n\nThere's the clean and jerk, where a lifter hoists -- or cleans -- the bar to the top of their chest and then presses it overhead.\n\nAnd then there's the snatch, where a lifter grabs the bar with a wide grip and lifts it overhead in one continuous motion.\n\nThe weights are obviously heavy -- but Olympic weightlifting isn't all about brute strength. These lifts are full of technical precision.\n\n\"The lift is happening way too fast for you to be thinking, 'OK, feet, hips, arms,'\" says Reeves. \"So for me, it's looking for a feeling. I know the feeling of a good day, I know the feeling of a good lift, as soon as the bar leaves the floor sometimes.\"\n\nIn competition, athletes get three attempts at each lift. Their heaviest snatch and heaviest clean and jerk combined makes up their total. And the lifter with the highest total wins.\n\nReeves will compete in the 71 kilogram weight class at the Olympics. In her final qualifier she lifted a 118kg snatch and a 150kg clean and jerk for a 268kg total. That's about 590 pounds.\n\nBack in Chattanooga, Reeves is setting up for a 111kg snatch.\n\n\"Eleven more kilos than this would be a world record,\" she says. \"And that is my goal at the Olympics.\"\n\nReeves' parents met in a gym and owned their own crossfit center when she was growing up.\n\nShe wasn't a big fan of cardio and instead shifted her focus to weightlifting, where she soon started winning national competitions.\n\nThat led to serious family discussions: where is this all going? Is this something we need to start taking seriously or are we just having fun?\n\n\"And either path is totally OK,\" Reeves' mom, Amber, recalls telling her daughter. \"It was, you know, led by her desire at that point.\"\n\nThese days, Reeves trains alongside her sister Haley, who is two years younger and also a competitive weightlifter.\n\n\"It's definitely inspiring and motivating to train with someone at this level,\" Haley says. \"I mean, the amount of time we spend in the gym is doubled outside of the gym.\"\n\nReeves is similarly grateful that her training partner happens to be her sister, best friend and roommate. \"I love having her in here,\" she says. \"She knows exactly what I'm doing and what I'm going through in and out of lifting.\"\n\nReeves competed in seven qualifiers in this Olympic cycle, and kept improving her total and setting records.\n\nAnd if you watch her compete, there's one thing that stands out: Just after finishing a big lift, she seems to always have a smile on her face.\n\nThat's one of the reasons why Mike Gattone, USA Weightlifting's head coach, calls her a \"fun-loving calm machine.\" It's a trait that Gattone says separates the elite weightlifters from the rest: an almost superhuman belief in their own ability.\n\n\"I mean 'machine' in the best way,\" he says. \"She's on this roll where she's so confident in herself and her abilities. If she's focusing on them, she's pretty darn unstoppable.\"\n\nSome athletes tweak their training ahead of big competitions, but Reeves says she tries to create as much consistency as she can.\n\n\"Anything I really do in training, I do in competition,\" she says. \"I try to practice keeping it parallel across the board. The way that I walk up to the bar, the way that I approach the bar, the way they put chalk on my hands -- everything is the same.\"\n\nThis focus on repetition has contributed to her success so far. So much so that she's been called one of this generation's greatest weightlifters.\n\nShe'll get the chance to cement that legacy when she takes the platform in Paris on Friday.\n\nTo Reeves, though, all this talk of being a generational talent is a bit premature -- and she laughs when asked about it.\n\n\"Well, the generation's not over yet,\" she says. \"So how do you know?\"", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NPR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vincent_acovino@npr.org", "name": "Vincent Acovino", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "juana_summers@npr.org", "name": "Juana Summers", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "christopher_intagliata@npr.org", "name": "Christopher Intagliata", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snatch_(weightlifting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Snatch (weightlifting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gym", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gym"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_weightlifting", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic weightlifting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chattanooga,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chattanooga, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chattanooga, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_and_jerk", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Clean and jerk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_Reeves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olivia Reeves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_symbols", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic symbols"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_flame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic flame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IWF_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IWF World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobic_exercise", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aerobic exercise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hip"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrossFit", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CrossFit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Weightlifting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USA Weightlifting"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Olympic_Lifting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Olympic Lifting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4500x2531+0+234/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc0%2F30%2F80764472488490a90d19cae15b29%2Foliviareeves-01.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9804940", "eventUri": "eng-9804940", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

And she came back from running and there were tears. She did not want to do it any more. And her passion just became about, you know, lifting weights because she really enjoyed that part of exercise.\"\n\nAt 13, Olivia's focus shifted to weightlifting, and her parents began to see she had real promise as an athlete.\n\n\"She started winning national competitions for her age group and weight class,\" Jason Reeves, her father, said.\n\nAmber chimed in. \"Then, having a discussion with Olivia of, like, where do you see this going, you know? I mean, is this something we need to take seriously and invest some real energy, effort and time into this? Or are we just kind of having fun?

The competition is made up of two lifts, the snatch and clean and jerk. After three attempts in each, your best score in each is added together to determine your total.\n\nReeves calmed her nerves by lifting 112kg in her first attempt in the snatch to take the lead at the time. She would then up her weight to 115kg and reclaim the lead in her second successful attempt.\n\nSnatch world record holder Angie Paola Palacios Dajomes from Ecuador would set the bar at 116kg with only Reeves left to go in her final attempt. Reeves would then successfully lift 117kg in her final attempt to take the lead and set a new Olympic record in the process.\n\nReeves was considered the heavy favorite when it comes to the clean and jerk lift. She did not disappoint.\n\nShe made lifting 140kg in the clean and jerk look easy in her first attempt as she took the overall lead. She would follow that up with a 145kg lift to secure gold.\n\nHer total of 262 was five clear of the field.\n\nMari Leivis Sanchez from Colombia took home the silver medal with a total of 257. Palacios Dajomes won bronze with a total of 256.\n\nReeves becomes the first weightlifter from the United States to win a gold medal since Tara Nott in Sydney in 2000, the first year women's weightlifting was included in the Olympic Games.", "source": {"uri": "local3news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Local3News.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_bobick@local3news.com", "name": "Ben Bobick", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snatch_(weightlifting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Snatch (weightlifting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_weightlifting", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olympic weightlifting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_and_jerk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clean and jerk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_class", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Weight class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuador", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ecuador"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ecuador"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tara_Cunningham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tara Cunningham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Olympic_Lifting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Olympic Lifting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/local3news.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/c0/9c0f23d2-5680-11ef-a993-83efe38ef378/66b670d7b165d.preview.png?crop=1582%2C831%2C0%2C104&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9804940", "eventUri": "eng-9804940", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

She opened her first attempt with a conservative 112kg, 9kg shy of her personal best in competition, to ensure that she gets on the scoreboard. The 21-year-old breathed a huge sigh of relief after she successfully completed the lift in one fluid movement.\n\nShe then increased to 115kg in her second attempt and matched Romanian Elena Loredana Toma's second attempt, an Olympic record. For Reeves' third and final snatch, she broke that record with a shaky 117kg snatch where she nearly stepped off the back of the platform.\n\nIn Toma's third attempt, the six-time consecutive European champion failed to match Reeves' 117kg, leaving the Romanian in third. Ecuador's Angie Palacios D\u00e1jomes, the silver medalist at the 2023 World Championship who then bested Reeves' total by 2kg, was in second place with a 116kg snatch.\n\nThe gold was then all but Reeves' to lose. No other woman in the 71kg session could match her on the clean & jerk, if she's able to register her first attempt at 140kg.\n\nAnd she did.\n\nIt left her with an untouchable total of 257kg. She wouldn't even have to take her second and third attempts to win gold, but she did hit a flawless 150kg for her second attempt. Her third attempt at 150kg would have been another Olympic record but she couldn't get under the jerk.\n\nThe first-time Olympian is now an Olympic champion with the total of 262kg.\n\nMari Leivis Sanchez of Colombia took silver on Friday, while Palacios Dajomes earned the bronze.\n\nWeightlifters from China typically dominate the sport, but due to changes in the qualification process --- each country was allowed to send only three women and three men to Paris 2024, one for each weight class. The number of weight classes was also reduced from 14 to 10.\n\nChina's Liao Guifang, 2023 World Champion and weightlifting total world record holder (273kg), would have been Reeve's biggest threat to gold but she wasn't selected to join the team.\n\nReeves' parents own a CrossFit gym and she has been competing since she was young. She holds an impressive number of 15 American records in youth, junior and senior categories.\n\nShe's the 2023 World Cup gold medalist in the 71kg and fans are looking for her to soon break the world record in both the snatch (121kg) and clean & jerk (154kg). Reeves' personal competition best is 120kg for the snatch and 151kg for the clean & jerk.\n\nIf these numbers don't mean anything to you, just know that Reeves is incredibly strong. She can squat more than three times her body weight, according to the number revealed by NPR. That's 224kg, or nearly 500 pounds, and she's only getting stronger.\n\nShe has added 26kg to her total since the first Olympic qualifier, according to USA Weightlifting.", "source": {"uri": "nbcboston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Boston"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snatch_(weightlifting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Snatch (weightlifting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_weightlifting", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olympic weightlifting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Romania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Romania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_Reeves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olivia Reeves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loredana_Toma", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Loredana Toma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angie_Palacios", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Angie Palacios"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIVB_Volleyball_Women's_World_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIVB Volleyball Women's World Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_and_jerk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clean and jerk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_class", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Weight class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuador", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ecuador"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ecuador"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liao_Guifang", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liao Guifang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_FIBA_Basketball_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Weightlifting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USA Weightlifting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_qualification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup qualification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squat_(exercise)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Squat (exercise)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gym", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gym"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NPR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrossFit", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CrossFit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Olympic_Lifting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Olympic Lifting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://media.nbcboston.com/2024/08/GettyImages-2166073036-e1723231554969.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9804940", "eventUri": "eng-9804940", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

The snatch involves weightlifters picking up the weight with a wide grip and lifting it over their heads in one continuous motion. The clean and jerk is a two-step process, requiring the weightlifter to lift the weight to a point below the chin before pressing it above their head and holding.\n\nWeightlifters in the competition will get three attempts at each the snatch and the clean and jerk.

Paris will be Reeves' first Olympic games, but not her first time competing on the world stage. She took first place in her weight class at the IWF World Cup Paris qualifier in Thailand earlier this year. And she's already breaking U.S. weightlifting records.\n\nSome background - Olympic weightlifters compete in two events:\n\nEach athlete gets three attempts at both lifts. Their heaviest snatch and heaviest clean and jerk combined make up their total - and the lifter with the highest total wins.\n\nReeves will compete in the 71 kg weight class. In her final qualifier, she lifted a 118kg snatch and a 150kg clean and jerk for a 268kg total. That's about 590 pounds.\n\nConsider This host Juana Summers visited the gym earlier this summer to meet the weightlifter and her longtime coach, Steve Fauer, as they prepared to head to Paris. As she set up for a 111kg snatch, she told Summers:\n\n\"Eleven more kilos than this would be a world record...and that is my goal at the Olympics.\"\n\nFar from the pomp and circumstance of the Paris games, Reeves trained for her Olympic debut in a gym in Chattanooga, Tennessee. It's tucked away in an industrial park, and fairly nondescript - except for the big white banner with Olivia's name and the Olympic rings hanging over the door.\n\nOlivia is 21 years old and finishing up her undergraduate degree at the University of Tennessee Chattanooga; she's also expecting to graduate later this year.\n\nGrowing up, her parents owned a Crossfit gym. Olivia's mom, Amber, worked there full time, and she said that Olivia wasn't a big fan of cardio, recalling one memorable workout:\n\n\"There was running involved. And she came back from running and there were tears. She did not want to do it any more. And her passion just became about, you know, lifting weights because she really enjoyed that part of exercise.\"\n\nAt 13, Olivia's focus shifted to weightlifting, and her parents began to see she had real promise as an athlete.\n\n\"She started winning national competitions for her age group and weight class,\" Jason Reeves, her father, said.\n\nAmber chimed in. \"Then, having a discussion with Olivia of, like, where do you see this going, you know? I mean, is this something we need to take seriously and invest some real energy, effort and time into this? Or are we just kind of having fun? And either path is totally OK.\"\n\nWeightlifting has been part of the Olympics since the first modern games were held in 1896. But women didn't start competing at the Olympic level until 24 years ago - in 2000.\n\nThat year, Tara Nott Cunningham brought home a gold medal in weightlifting, and she's the first and only American woman to do that. Reeves could be next.\n\n\"It just comes down to having her prepared,\" coach Steve Fauer told NPR. \"I don't see why we're not going to win the gold medal. We're knocking on the door of world records. I mean, why not?\"\n\nThough she's early in her career, Reeves is already being lauded as one of the generation's greatest weightlifters.\n\n\"It's incredibly exciting because she is having all this success and she's having it at such a young age,\" said Cara Heads Slaughter, who was a member of the women's weightlifting team in 2000. \"She's on track to be the best U.S. weightlifter in women's history.\"\n\nFor her part, Reeves is focused on her goals and staying consistent.\n\n\"I try to practice keeping it parallel across the board. The way I walk up to the bar, the way I approach the bar, the way they put chalk on my hands - everything is the same.\"\n\nBut she told Consider This host Juana Summers recently that, while she's tried to keep her training routine consistent, she's had to make new routines in Paris as she prepares to step onto the platform at the Olympics for the first time on Friday, August 9.", "source": {"uri": "opb.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "opb"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Olympic_Lifting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Olympic Lifting", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://opb-opb-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/F43PH4NHILWF2AJIC57O7FZUXE.png?auth=fbe9179cdd88a9c336b88490edbe918ce8768c562473c58513f7a71ce659d377&width=1200&height=675&smart=true", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9804940", "eventUri": "eng-9804940", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-09", "textStart": 3897, "textEnd": 3905}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

She opened her first attempt with a conservative 112kg, 9kg shy of her personal best in competition, to ensure that she gets on the scoreboard. The 21-year-old breathed a huge sigh of relief after she successfully completed the lift in one fluid movement.\n\nShe then increased to 115kg in her second attempt and matched Romanian Elena Loredana Toma's second attempt, an Olympic record. For Reeves' third and final snatch, she broke that record with a shakey 117kg snatch where she nearly stepped off the back of the platform.\n\nIn Toma's third attempt, the six-time consecutive European champion failed to match Reeves' 117kg, leaving the Romanian in third. Ecuador's Angie Palacios D\u00e1jomes, the silver medalist at the 2023 World Championship who then bested Reeves' total by 2kg, was in second place with a 116kg snatch.\n\nThe gold was then all but Reeves' to lose. No other woman in the 71kg session could match her on the clean & jerk, if she's able to register her first attempt at 140kg.\n\nWeightlifters from China typically dominate the sport, but due to changes in the qualification process --- each country was allowed to send only three women and three men to Paris 2024, one for each weight class. The number of weight classes was also reduced from 14 to 10.\n\nChina's Liao Guifang, 2023 World Champion and weightlifting total world record holder (273kg), would have been Reeve's biggest threat to gold but she wasn't selected to join the team.\n\nReeves' parents own a CrossFit gym and she has been competing since she was young. She holds an impressive number of 15 American records in youth, junior and senior categories.\n\nShe's the 2023 World Cup gold medalist in the 71kg and fans are looking for her to soon break the world record in both the snatch (121kg) and clean & jerk (154kg).

That's nearly 500 pounds, and she's only getting stronger\n\nIt has been 24 years since women were first allowed to compete in weightlifting at the Olympics.\n\nTeam USA's Olivia Reeves was just three years old when Tara Nott-Cunningham won the country's first and only gold. Now, 21-year-old Reeves is aiming to break a world record at the Paris Olympics and if everything goes to plan, she could make history on her way to becoming one of the greatest weightlifters in U.S. history.\n\nReeves will compete in the women's 71kg session on Thursday, Aug. 9, at 1:30 p.m. ET. You can stream live on Peacock or watch on USA Network at 5:30 p.m. ET.\n\nWeightlifters from China typically dominate the sport, but due to changes in the qualification process --- each country was only allowed to send three women and three men to Paris 2024, one for each weight class. The number of weight classes was also reduced from 14 to 10.\n\nChina's Liao Guifang, 2023 World Champion and weightlifting total world record holder (273kg), would have been Reeve's biggest threat to gold but she wasn't selected to join the team.\n\nReeves isn't without competition by any means.\n\nEcuador's Angie Palacios D\u00e1jomes was the silver medalist at the 2023 World Championship, beating Reeves' total by 2kg, and she's also eyeing the top spot in Paris after placing sixth in Tokyo. Another likely contender for gold is Loredana Toma of Romania, a six-time consecutive European champion.\n\nReeves' parents own a CrossFit gym and she has been competing since she was young. She holds an impressive number of 15 American records in youth, junior and senior categories.\n\nShe's the 2023 World Cup gold medalist in the 71kg and fans are looking for her to soon break the world record in both the snatch (121kg) and clean & jerk (154kg). Reeves' personal competition best is currently 120kg for the snatch and 151kg for the clean & jerk, and she can at least easily break the Olympic records (115kg & 148kg).\n\nIf these numbers don't mean anything to you, just know that Reeves is incredibly strong. She can squat more than three times her body weight, according to the number revealed by NPR. That's 224 kg, or nearly 500 pounds, and she's only getting stronger.\n\nShe has added 26kg to her total since the first Olympic qualifier, according to USA Weightlifting.\n\nThe snatch and clean & jerk are powerful movements where athletes move massive amounts of weights on the barbell, oftentimes over twice their body weight, to an overhead position in mere seconds.\n\nThese movements appear simple, but they are incredibly technical and it can take several years to master how to move efficiently. The competition also appears straightforward. Athletes lift the barbell one at a time and the weight on the bar can only increase, never decrease, but coaches behind the scenes are playing chess as they plan their athlete's rest time and next attempts.\n\nSnatch\n\nThe snatch is the more technical of the two movements. Lifters must move the barbell from the floor to above their head in one fluid movement. They can't re-bend and extend their elbows once the weight is overhead, a controversial rule that many fans argue robs athletes of good lifts.\n\nClean & Jerk\n\nAs the name suggests, the clean & jerk are two separate movements counted as one combined lift. The clean portion of the lift involves the athlete \"cleaning\" the barbell up to the front rack position, or supported on top of their collarbone and shoulders.\n\nThe jerk includes the athlete elevating the weight by jumping and quickly pressing the barbell overhead. The same elbows rule applies to the jerk.\n\nThree judges, two side judges and one in the front, signal a white light for a good lift and a red light for no lift. Athletes need at least two white lights for the lift to count. However, there's a jury panel that will review and make the final decision.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC New York"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

After conquering an Olympic qualifier, Olivia Reeves enters the 157-pound division as the top-ranked lifter and gold-medal favorite.\n\nIn a sport teeming with inspirational quotes about no gain without pain, what's unusual about Reeves is how she got here. Instead of grinding away in the gym for countless hours, she soared to the peak of international weightlifting by doing the opposite.\n\nShe trains half as much as other world-class lifters.\n\nPut another way, her secret to lifting weights is not lifting weights.\n\nFor example, the top three finishers in Wednesday's men's 134-pound competition, including American bronze medalist Hampton Morris, said they lift at least six times a week, for no less than 15 hours per week. The American champ in 2000, Tara Nott-Cunningham, had seven or eight weekly sessions, each 90 minutes to two hours long, said Team USA coach Mike Gattone.\n\nBut Reeves lifts just four times a week. Three sessions are two hours long. The fourth is 90 minutes. The total: just 7.5 hours a week.\n\n\"It's unusual for this level, but it works for me,\" she said.\n\nReeves makes each session count by making them intense, lifting 90% of the maximum weight she can handle. Ample rest between sessions keeps her fresh.\n\n\"When you train often, you can't go heavy as often because when you have a lot of volume, you're really tired,\" she said.\n\nThis approach isn't a personal quirk. It's backed by evidence.\n\n\"It's not about how many times you lift,\" said John DeWitt, director of applied sports science for Rice University athletics. \"It's about how much you lift, the intensity.\" In other words, muscles respond better to fewer but more challenging reps, compared with more reps at lighter weights.\n\nRest matters too. People don't get stronger while lifting, DeWitt said, but rather in recovery, when their bodies adapt to the load placed on them.\n\nThe data doesn't come just from people pumping iron on Earth. There's also extraterrestrial evidence.\n\nAs a National Aeronautics and Space Administration exercise scientist, DeWitt observed how astronauts returned from the International Space Station with bone and muscle loss, even though they used the treadmill and a weight-resistance machine onboard.\n\nSo scientists upped the workout intensity, replacing the treadmill that maxed out at 7 miles per hour with one that maxes out at 12.4 miles an hour -- under a 5-minute mile. A new weight machine doubled the resistance, to 600 pounds. The result: Astronauts consistently came back in better shape, DeWitt said.\n\nThis research backs up Reeves's training plan. But her coach didn't develop it to build muscle. He was afraid of chasing away his best-ever pupil.\n\nReeves started lifting weights in fourth grade, at her parents' CrossFit gym in Chattanooga, Tenn. Getting serious about it three years later, she started working with Steve Fauer, who had decades of experience honed by trial and error.\n\nEspecially error. \"I'm probably the dumbest coach in the world,\" Fauer said.\n\nFor years, the former University of Nebraska strength coach had seen promising young weightlifters walk into his gym. Then, after pounding through 300 to 500 reps over nine weekly sessions, they walked out and never came back.\n\n\"You can see the kids get beat up, but I would keep pushing because that's what everybody does,\" he said. \"What I should've done was back off.\"\n\nSo with Reeves, he prioritized keeping it fun. They started with three sessions a week. As she sailed through youth competitions, they added a fourth. They monitored whether her progress would plateau.\n\nIt didn't, so the regimen stuck. \"Why would I be training nine times a week when I'm getting the same results training four times a week?\" Fauer said.\n\nReeves set personal bests at the weightlifting World Cup in April. She lifted 260 pounds in the snatch, which involves lifting the barbell above the head in one motion, and 331 pounds in the two-phase clean and jerk.\n\nThe less-is-more approach lets her train while studying sociology at the University of Tennessee, Chattanooga. After she graduates in December, she's considering a master's and career in public health.\n\nTo the delight of Team USA, she said she believes she can pursue that and still squeeze in 7.5 hours per week lifting weights.", "source": {"uri": "livemint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc",

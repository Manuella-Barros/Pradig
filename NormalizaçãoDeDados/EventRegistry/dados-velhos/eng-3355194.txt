"isDuplicate": false, "body": "After German chancellor candidate Martin Schulz called for a Europe-wide quota for electric cars, the debate among German politicians, the EU and carmakers has picked up steam. In China, such a quota already exists.\n\nHours after Social Democrat hopeful Martin Schulz called for a binding, Europe-wide quota on electric cars, German Economics Minister Brigitte Zypries on Friday endorsed Schulz' proposal.\n\nA European e-mobility quota could \"add pressure on carmakers to offer demand-based electric cars,\" Zypries said in a statement, adding it would lead a significant increase in the share of electric vehicles. Other German ministers, including Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks (SPD), also welcomed Schulz' proposal.\n\nWith his five-point program aimed at modernizing Germany's scandal-hit car industry, SPD election candidate Schulz revved up the e-car quota debate in an apparent attempt to invigorate his sluggish election campaign.\n\n\"When it comes to electric vehicles, the German car industry clearly has to improve,\" Schulz said in his program. US carmaker Tesla, a pioneer in electric cars, had \"been mocked for too long\" and German carmakers could no longer afford to display their current level of \"arrogance.\"\n\nSchulz also stressed the need for greater investment in the production of battery cells in Germany, and not to rely on foreign manufacturers.\n\nThe SPD candidate's proposals came as Germany's largest carmaker, Volkswagen, was still reeling from the Dieselgate affair. Just last month, it came to light that Germany's three largest car manufacturers - Volkswagen, BMW and Daimler - had allegedly colluded since the 1990s in an attempt to fix prices to stay ahead of foreign rivals.\n\nGermany, which is encouraging consumers to purchase e-cars with buyer's premiums, pledged to reduce carbon emissions by 40 percent by 2020 compared with 1994 levels and aims to have 1 million electric cars by then. On Friday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel neither rejected nor approved Schulz' demand. A government spokesperson said every proposal with the goal to advance e-mobility was \"welcome in principle.\"\n\nQuota faces opposition from politicians, the EU and carmakers\n\nWhile Merkel remained neutral, other members of her party objected to Schulz' proposal on Friday. \"A firm European e-car quota is the wrong path,\" CDU's Vice Chairman Michael Fuchs said. Instead of dictating the tech sector, what's needed are ambitious, Europe-wide emission regulations, according to Fuchs. While Germany's pro-business FDP also rejected a quota, The Green party demanded that only emissions-free vehicles should be registered in Germany starting in 2030.\n\nRead more: How eco-friendly are electric cars?\n\nA comment by Deputy Economy Minister Matthias Machnig (SPD) on Monday had kickstarted the debate. Machnig said Germany should consider introducing binding quotas for electric cars to help the automobile sector recover from the diesel emissions scandal and keep its place as a leading producer.\n\n\"We should talk about a binding target to really get electromobility going in Europe and also in Germany,\" said Machnig, reacting to a report in German newspaper Handelsblatt that cited European Union sources as saying the European Commission wanted to accelerate the retreat from combustion engines by setting a quota for low emissions cars such as electric cars from 2025.\n\nBut the European Union said on Monday it had no plans to introduce quotas for electric cars for an automobile sector seeking to recover from the Volkswagen diesel scandal.\n\n\"Generally speaking, the European Commission is looking into ways to promote use of low carbon energy and transport but none of them includes quotas for electric cars,\" a spokeswoman for the EU executive said.\n\nRead more: Opinion: Don't overstate Dieselgate\n\nThe pro-quota demands also set up a possible policy clash with German carmakers, whose lobby group says it opposes such quotas. The VDA auto industry lobby was quoted as saying: \"We think such sales quotas are the wrong choice.\"\n\nDuring last week's Diesel summit in Berlin, carmakers had agreed to install software updates in about 5 million vehicles to reduce the level of harmful emissions. Schulz, however, in his program attacked the resolution, dismissing it as a measure to appease carmakers.\n\nSchulz, a former president of the European Parliament, called for a second summit in the fall and warned that if the latest round of software updates proved to be insufficient, carmakers would would face paying out of their own pockets to provide the necessary technical upgrades.\n\nChina is forging ahead\n\nWhile the a e-car quota debate just got off the ground in Europe, China, the world's biggest carbon emitter, is already promoting an electric vehicle quota and building up an e-car industry. These efforts are part of a larger, multibillion-dollar investment in clean energy infrastructure as the country battles to clear up the notorious choking pollution enveloping its biggest cities, including Beijing.\n\nLast year, sales of so-called \"new energy vehicles\" (NEVs) in China jumped 53 percent to 507,000 units.\n\nIn early June, Daimler and VW were among a string of top German companies to unveil major business deals with the People's Republic. The automakers agreed to build electric cars in China, which they described as the world's biggest market for \"electromobility.\"\n\nVolkswagen announced it would \"develop, produce and market electric vehicles as well as mobility services\" in a 50-50 joint venture with carmaker JAC. VW, the world's largest carmaker, aims to sell some 1.5 million electric cars per year in China by 2025, thanks to its deals with JAC and competitors SAIC and FAW. Its first vehicles jointly designed with JAC are scheduled to roll off the production line in 2018.\n\nThe European indecision as to e-car quotas is to be seen in the context of a global debate on the auto industry's continued reliance on the combustion engine. Britain and France plan to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2040 in a bid to reduce air pollution.\n\n\"Competition for tomorrow's clean mobility is now open. Worldwide. That's not good news for Germany's car industry\" as it wrestles with scandal, wrote columnist Petra Pinzler in the German weekly Die Zeit this week.", "timeCrawl": "15:24:00", "sim": 0.7843137383460999, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8647690", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "id": 144, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines_and_E-zines", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines and E-zines", "id": 416, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "id": 418, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts", "id": 419, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Thematic", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Thematic", "id": 420, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "id": 462, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

candidates began six weeks of campaigning before the September election.\n\nAs potential political damage looms over the diesel cheating scandal amid accusations of collusion between government and industry, Merkel and Schulz placed the blame on executives of auto titans such as Volkswagen AG and Daimler AG. At a political rally in Dortmund on Saturday, the chancellor said decision-makers had swept violations \"under the carpet,\" while Schulz took a swipe at \"irresponsible managers.\"\n\n\"We have a situation in which managers who make millions, at VW, at Daimler, have slept through the future,\" Schulz told broadcaster ZDF on Sunday. \"Because of the cost savings on their balance sheets, they failed to invest in the areas where they should have.\"\n\nThe politicians struck the sharper tone as they entered the last phase of electioneering ahead of the Sept. 24 contest, with polls showing Merkel's Christian Democratic-led bloc well ahead of the SPD. Schulz insisted that with German voters beginning to pay attention in the final weeks, he shouldn't be ruled out as a potential chancellor.\n\n\"I think I have a good chance to lead the next government; we still have six weeks left,\" Schulz told ZDF.\n\nMerkel, 63, back in the public eye after a three-week break, during which the diesel scandal dominated headlines in Europe's largest economy, made her first of a scheduled 50 campaign rallies in the western city of Dortmund. She sounded a pro-labor message in a bastion of Social Democratic politics.\n\n\"There's a lot that still needs to be cleared up,\" Merkel said, responding to a drumbeat of negative news about diesel pollution and corporate misconduct. \"When I say industry, I'm thinking first of all of the corporate leadership.\"\n\nWhile Merkel made her selling point as a bastion of stability in a world upended by global crises, Schulz, the 61-year-old former president of the European Parliament, took advantage of his outside status to blast away at U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nAsked by a studio guest at broadcaster RTL whether he fears a nuclear war, Schulz hammered the U.S. leader, an \"unpredictable personality,\" for his inflamed rhetoric against North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\n\"I can understand this concern very well,\" Schulz told the guest. \"What worries me is that an American president like Mr. Trump lowers himself to the level of a North Korean dictator.\"\n\nFor a QuickTake Q&A on the German election, click here\n\nMerkel's bloc maintained its lead with 38 percent support in an Emnid survey published by Bild am Sonntag newspaper. The SPD climbed a percentage point to 24 percent, the poll showed. A separate poll earlier in the week published by broadcaster ARD showed that Merkel's personal popularity had dropped 10 points to 59 percent, though still outstripped Schulz, who had a 33 percent approval rating.\n\nSpeaking at the Dortmund rally in Germany's Ruhr Valley industrial heartland, Merkel voiced support for the minimum wage, a Social Democratic initiative introduced under her coalition government with the SPD.

challenger in September's federal election, insisted on Sunday that he could still bring home a defiant victory despite poor performances in the polls.\n\nSchulz, the leader of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), is lagging behind Merkel's conservatives by between 14 and 17 percentage points in election polls, six weeks before Germans cast their votes on September 24.\n\nBut in an interview with German broadcast ZDF on Sunday, the former president of the European Parliament claimed he could still run the next government and said he would be open to forming another grand coalition with Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU).\n\n\"I reckon that I have a good chance to lead the next government,\" the SPD chairman said.\n\nSchulz also had stern words for the carmakers implicated in the Dieselgate scandal, saying consumers in Germany should not have to pay for the errors of \"irresponsible managers\" working at the likes of Volkswagen and Daimler.\n\n\"The problem is that we are in a situation where managers who earn millions at Volkswagen and Daimler fell asleep at the wheel ... and failed to invest there where they should have,\" Schulz told ZDF.\n\nThe Dieselgate scandal dates back to 2015 when Volkswagen fitted engines with so-called defeat devices, or software that enabled diesel cars to perform far better in emissions tests in a laboratory than in real driving conditions.\n\nThe car-making giant admitted that 11 million cars had installed the illegal software, enabling them to spew out more poisonous nitrogen oxides than tests suggested they would.\n\nLast month, the EU's anti-fraud watchdog OLAF revealed that Volkswagen fraudulently secured \u20ac400 million in loans from the European Investment Bank to develop the engine at issue in the Dieselgate scandal. The company is also at the heart of recent reports that several automakers colluded to thwart competition in the automobile sector.", "timeCrawl": "16:55:00", "sim": 0.6117647290229797, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 512, "date": "2017-09-24", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 524}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8943157", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "id": 276, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "id": 301, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines_and_E-zines", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines and E-zines", "id": 416, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Makes_and_Models", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Makes and Models", "id": 461, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Software_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Software Engineering", "id": 1156, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

The ruling Georgian Dream party, as expected, pushed through the override on May 28. Its alliance with the Democratic Georgia party holds 84 of the chamber's 150 seats. A simple majority of 76 votes was needed to cancel Zurabishvili's veto. Lawmakers then voted 84-4 to pass the bill. Most opposition deputies had walked out of the chamber ahead of the vote. The approval came despite last-minute appeals from the European Union and several member states to Georgian lawmakers not to override the veto of a law frequently referred to as the \"Russian law\" because of its resemblance to legislation introduced by the Kremlin to silence opposition and free speech. The law now goes back to Zurabishvili to be signed. If she refuses, the speaker of parliament, Georgian Dream member Shalva Papuashvili, can sign the law and publish it. Hundreds of mostly young protesters chanting \"No Russian law!\" and \"Slaves!\" while waving Georgian and EU flags massed peacefully at the back entrance of the legislature amid a heavy presence of riot police. Further protests were expected later in the day. Zurabishvili told the crowd not to let the 84 parliamentarians who voted for bill have the final say. The 84 deputies who voted for the law are \"nobody compared to those who are here today -- the new Georgia, the Georgia of the future,\" she said, encouraging demonstrators to save their anger and energy for nationwide elections in October. \"We must now do everything we can to prepare for October 26, which will be our answer to today. Are you angry today? Get angry, but let's get down to business,\" she said, calling for a campaign to collect signatures for a referendum. A referendum isn\u2019t possible, however, because it would have to be held across all Georgian territory, and currently 20 percent is occupied by Russia. A plebiscite would be possible, but it\u2019s not binding. The law requires civil society and media organizations that receive more than 20 percent of funding from foreign sources to submit to oversight that could encompass sanctions for as-yet-undefined criminal offenses. Critics have said the legislation was introduced by Georgian Dream, founded by Russia-friendly Georgian tycoon Bidzina Ivanishvili, in order to cement the party's grip on power ahead of elections later this year seen as crucial for Georgia's Euro-Atlantic path. Georgian Dream has insisted that it remains committed to joining Western institutions and the law was only meant to increase transparency on NGO funding. Georgia's civil society has for years sought to move the country away from the influence of Russia, which still maintains thousands of troops in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, two breakaway Georgian regions that Moscow recognized as independent states following a five-day war with Tbilisi in 2008. Both the United States and the European Union have warned Georgian Dream that ignoring criticism and cracking down violently on protesters will have negative consequences. After the party pushed the bill through, a U.S. State Department spokesman said the United States condemns the parliament's decision and told reporters that Georgian Dream's actions and anti-Western rhetoric threaten the country's democratic trajectory. The European Union said it \"deeply regrets\" the decision to override Zurabishvili's veto. \"The EU has stressed repeatedly that the law adopted by the Georgian Parliament goes against EU core principles and values. Its enactment leads to a backsliding on at least three out of the nine steps (on disinformation; on polarization; on fundamental rights and involvement of Civil Society Organizations) set out in the Commission's recommendation for candidate status endorsed by EU leaders and will negatively impact Georgia's EU path,\" the statement said. \"We urge the Georgian authorities to reverse this trend and to return firmly on the EU path. There is still time to change the dynamics -- but a strong commitment by the governing authorities is needed,\" the statement said. It also said its member states \"are considering all options to react to these developments.\" Georgia obtained the coveted status of EU candidate country in December, but it has yet to start actual accession talks, which could last for years. There had been hope such talks could start later this year, but Brussels has warned that the \"foreign agent\" law could endanger the path toward Europe. Parliament speakers from seven EU member countries -- the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, France, Netherlands, and Poland -- on May 27 issued a joint statement calling on the Georgian lawmakers to scrap the legislation. The statement addressed to Papuashvili says recent developments in Georgia are \"disturbing\" and the Georgian government's actions contradict the values and principles that Georgia undertook to respect. \"The spirit and content of the Law on Foreign Transparency adopted by the Parliament of Georgia are incompatible with European norms and values. The law as it stands seeks to silence media and civil society organizations that play a vital role in a democratic society and are instrumental in helping Georgia on its path to the EU,\" the statement said. \"We urge you to withdraw this law and engage in a meaningful and inclusive dialogue with organized civil society and citizens. We also urge you to respect the fundamental values by upholding the rights of people to assembly and discontinue the use of violence and intimidation against peaceful demonstrators.\" EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on May 27 that the bloc had started weighing options should Georgia enact the law. He said a decision will be made next month. Georgian Ombudsman Levan Ioseliani also warned on May 27 that the law needs changes to limit the damage it will bring to civil society.", "summary": "Georgia has announced that a Chinese consortium submitted the sole bid to build a sprawling deep-sea port in Anaklia, ending a multiyear political saga over the megaproject that puts Tbilisi\u2019s growing ties with Beijing in the spotlight.", "url": "https://www.rferl.org/a/anaklia-georgia-china-port-winner/32970697.html", "image": "https://gdb.rferl.org/44E6A02A-3C27-439B-83DB-4935F73DC0E4_w1080_h608.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:14:45", "author": "Reid Standish", "authors": ["Reid Standish"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.041}

A 73-year-old British man died of a suspected heart attack and dozens were injured after the Boeing 777, which was flying from London\u2019s Heathrow airport to Singapore on May 21, ran into turbulence that hurled people and items around the cabin. The plane, with 211 passengers and 18 crew members, made an emergency landing in Bangkok. Singapore\u2019s Transport Ministry said investigators, including those from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing, had compiled a chronology of events based on the preliminary analysis of the flight\u2019s data and cockpit voice recorders. Early findings showed the aircraft was passing over the south of Myanmar at 37,000 feet (11,277 meters) feet when it began to experience vibration due to changes in the gravitational force, the ministry said. The plane then climbed to an altitude of up to 37,362 feet (11,387 meters) and increased speed possibly due to an updraft, it said. The plane\u2019s autopilot then sought to pitch the jet downwards to its earlier altitude. \u201cThe aircraft experienced a rapid change in G (gravitational force) \u2026 this likely resulted in the occupants who were not belted up to become airborne\u201d before falling back down later, the ministry said. \u201cThe rapid changes in G over the 4.6 second duration resulted in an altitude drop of 178 feet \u2026 this sequence of events likely caused the injuries to the crew and passengers.\u201d During the turbulence, it said a pilot was heard calling out saying the fasten seat belt sign had been switched on. It said recorded data indicated the pilots manually controlled the plane for 21 seconds to stabilize it before reengaging the autopilot. The plane made a normal, controlled descent and didn\u2019t encounter further turbulence until it landed in Bangkok almost an hour later, the ministry said, adding that investigations are ongoing. Passengers have described the \u201csheer terror\u201d of the aircraft shuddering, loose items flying and injured people lying paralyzed on the floor of the plane. Twenty-six people remained hospitalized in Bangkok on Wednesday. Hospital authorities earlier said injuries included spinal or spinal cord damage, skull or brain injuries and damage to bones or internal organs. It was unclear what caused the turbulence. Most people associate turbulence with heavy storms, but the most dangerous type is so-called clear air turbulence. Wind shear can occur in wispy cirrus clouds or even in clear air near thunderstorms, as differences in temperature and pressure create powerful currents of fast-moving air. According to a 2021 report by the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, turbulence accounted for 37.6% of all accidents on larger commercial airlines between 2009 and 2018. The Federal Aviation Administration has said there were 146 serious injuries from turbulence from 2009 to 2021.", "summary": "<p>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) \u2014 Rapid changes in the gravitational force led to a 178-feet (54-meter) altitude drop of a&#8230; <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://www.thenationalherald.com/gravitational-changes-178-feet-drop-caused-injuries-on-singapore-airlines-jet-that-hit-turbulence/\">Continue reading <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Gravitational Changes, 178-Feet Drop Caused Injuries on Singapore Airlines Jet that Hit Turbulence</span></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.thenationalherald.com/gravitational-changes-178-feet-drop-caused-injuries-on-singapore-airlines-jet-that-hit-turbulence/\">Gravitational Changes, 178-Feet Drop Caused Injuries on Singapore Airlines Jet that Hit Turbulence</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.thenationalherald.com\">The National Herald</a>.</p>", "url": "https://www.thenationalherald.com/gravitational-changes-178-feet-drop-caused-injuries-on-singapore-airlines-jet-that-hit-turbulence/", "image": "https://www.thenationalherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AP24143326378046-1-scaled.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:08:04", "author": "Achilleas Kouremenos", "authors": ["Achilleas Kouremenos"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.412}

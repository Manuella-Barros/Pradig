Transfer Talk brings you all the latest buzz on rumours, comings, goings and, of course, done deals! Top Story: Chelsea, Newcastle hold further Isak talks Chelsea have shown further interest in signing Newcastle United striker Alexander Isak this summer, reports Sky Sports. New Blues manager Enzo Maresca is keen to add a proven Premier League goal scorer to his squad, and the 24-year-old Sweden international fits that description. He scored 25 goals across all competitions last season, including 21 goals from 30 league appearances, achieving that tally despite missing two parts of the season due to a recurring groin injury. The Magpies need to offload a player to comply with Profitability and Sustainability Regulations before July 1, and it reportedly would take a transfer fee of more than \u00a3100 million to consider letting their main striker depart. The club don't want to see any of their key players leave but are aware that they could incur a points deduction if they raise funds through outgoing transfers. Chelsea's first enquiry landed earlier this week and there was further contact between the two clubs on Friday. Paper Gossip - Manchester United are seriously considering a move to sign Bayern Munich centre-back Matthijs de Ligt, reports The Athletic, which adds that the 24-year-old Netherlands international is seen as an increasingly viable option for their backline. There haven't yet been any negotiations between the clubs and any potential move is independent of their efforts to sign Everton's Jarrad Branthwaite. - In other Red Devils news, Fabrizio Romano writes that the Old Trafford outfit and Paris Saint-Germain have been in touch again regarding Manuel Ugarte. PSG are willing to let the 23-year-old Uruguay midfielder leave and he is open to a move to the Premier League, although there are also other clubs interested. - Juventus, Bayern Munich and various Premier League clubs are all interested in Atalanta forward Ademola Lookman, according to The Mail. La Dea face a struggle to keep the 26-year-old Nigeria international, as he is happy in Italy but is also keeping his options open going into preseason. - Real Madrid are interested in Sporting CP centre-back Gon\u00e7alo Inacio rather than Ant\u00f3nio Silva of Benfica, according to AS. Inacio has impressed at club level this season and has a \u20ac60m release clause in his contract. - AC Milan could look to sign Chelsea's Romelu Lukaku and AS Roma's Tammy Abraham as an alternative to Bologna striker Joshua Zirkzee, reports Gazzetta dello Sport. The Rossoneri were willing to pay Zirkzee's \u20ac40m release clause but the 23-year-old's agent, Kia Joorabchian, is said to be demanding \u20ac15m in commission, which means the total financial package would be similar to what is required to sign Lukaku or Abraham. - Bayern Munich winger Kingsley Coman is among the players that Fenerbahce dream of signing this summer, reports Sky Sport Deutschland's Florian Plettenberg. It's an unlikely deal, however, as the 28-year-old has other plans.", "summary": "Chelsea haven't given up hope of completing a \u00a3100m-plus deal for Newcastle United striker Alexander Isak.

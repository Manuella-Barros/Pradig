At some point -- and unless China changes course -- allies need to impose a cost. There should be consequences,\" Stoltenberg added.\n\nIn addition to the 32 members of the NATO alliance, the summit will also bring in four key partners from the Asia-Pacific: Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea.\n\nChina argues that it is not sending lethal assistance to either side -- unlike the United States and other Western nations.\n\nBeijing steered clear of a weekend summit in Switzerland promoted by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that reaffirmed Kyiv's demands for Russia to leave Ukrainian territory for any peace.\n\nStoltenberg said that Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit this week to North Korea, which has supplied shells to Moscow despite being under UN sanctions, further showed how Moscow was \"dependent\" on authoritarian leaders.\n\nTrump -- who in the past has voiced admiration for Putin -- has boasted that he can quickly end the war, likely by pressing Ukraine to accept demands.\n\nTrump has long raged over what he sees as unfairness in NATO, founded to counter the Soviet Union.\n\nOn the campaign trail, he has suggested he would encourage Russia to \"do whatever the hell they want\" if NATO members do not \"pay your bills.\"\n\nIn the Oval Office, Stoltenberg told Biden that 23 of the 32 allies now met a pledge to spend at least two percent of GDP on defense, as the Ukraine invasion brings new security fears to Europe.\n\nA 2014 NATO summit set the funding goal that was then met by only three countries -- the United States, Britain and Greece. Stoltenberg last reported that 20 countries were achieving the target.\n\n\"NATO allies are this year increasing defense spending by 18 percent. That's the biggest increase in decades,\" Stoltenberg said.\n\nIn a sharply different message than Trump, Biden hailed NATO, saying that since it has successfully \"deterred further Russian aggression in Europe\" through its promise to \"defend every inch of NATO territory.\"\n\nIn an unstated bid to \"Trump-proof\" future efforts, Stoltenberg wants the Washington summit to commit the alliance to provide at least 40 billion euros ($43 billion) a year in military aid to Ukraine and to put NATO in charge of coordination.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after his Wilson Center speech, Stoltenberg did not criticize Trump but pointed to the damage done on the battlefront by the delay in Congress approving a $60 billion package for Ukraine.\n\n\"Regardless of who's going to be the next president of the United States,\" Stoltenberg said, \"I believe that we should minimize the risk.\"\n\nStoltenberg, who led NATO throughout Trump's 2017-2021 presidency, said that successive US administrations had \"an absolutely valid point to say that European allies are spending too little.\"\n\n\"The good news is that's changing,\" Stoltenberg said.\n\n\"We're not saying that we are satisfied, but we are in

(AP)\n\nA record 23 of NATO's 32 member nations are hitting the Western military alliance's defense spending target this year, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Monday, as Russia's war in Ukraine has raised the threat of expanding conflict in Europe.\n\nThe estimated figure is a nearly fourfold increase from 2021, when only six nations were meeting the goal. That was before Russian President Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, The Associated Press said.\n\n\"Europeans are doing more for their collective security than just a few years ago,\" Stoltenberg said in a speech at the Wilson Center research group.\n\nAfter the speech, Stoltenberg met at the White House with President Joe Biden. The US president said the alliance has become \"larger, stronger and more united than it's ever been\" during Stoltenberg's tenure.\n\nBiden spoke affectionately of Stoltenberg, calling him \"pal\" and saying he wished that Stoltenberg, who has been NATO's secretary general since 2014, could serve another term when the current one expires in October.\n\n\"Together, we've deterred further Russian aggression in Europe,\" Biden said. \"We've strengthened NATO's eastern flank ,making it clear that we'll defend every single inch of NATO territory.\"\n\nStoltenberg noted that allies were buying more military equipment from the US \"So NATO is good for US security, but NATO is also good for US jobs.\" he said.\n\nNATO members agreed last year to spend at least 2% of their gross domestic product on defense. The surge in spending reflects the worries about the war in Ukraine.\n\nPoland, at more than 4%, and tiny Estonia both lead the United States this year in the percentage of their GDP they spend on defense. Both countries border Russia.\n\nDefense spending across European allies and Canada was up nearly 18% this year alone, the biggest increase in decades, according to NATO's estimated figures released Monday.\n\nSome countries also are concerned about the possible reelection of former President Donald Trump, who has characterized many NATO allies as freeloading on US military spending and said on the campaign trail that he would not defend NATO members that don't meet defense spending targets.\n\n\"Shifting US administrations have had the absolutely valid point to say that US allies are spending too little,\" Stoltenberg told reporters. \"The good news is that's changing.\"\n\nStoltenberg's visit is laying the groundwork for what's expected to be a pivotal summit of NATO leaders in Washington next month. The mutual-defense alliance has grown in strength and size since Russia's invasion of Ukraine two years ago, with both Sweden and Finland joining.\n\nDefense spending by many European countries fell after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union seemed to neutralize what was then the prime security threat to the West.\n\nBut after Russia seized Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014, NATO members unanimously agreed to spend at least 2% of their GDP on defense within a decade. The full-scale invasion that Putin launched in 2022 spurred European countries newly on the front line of a war in the heart of Europe to put more resources into meeting that target.\n\nMuch of the focus of the summit is expected to address what NATO and NATO member governments can do for Ukraine as it faces unrelenting air and ground attacks from its more powerful neighbor. They so far have resisted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's appeals to take his country into the bloc as long as the war is still on.\n\nStoltenberg pointed to efforts to bolster Ukraine in the meantime. That includes NATO streamlining the eventual membership process for Ukraine, and individual NATO nations providing updated arms and training to Ukraine's military, including the US giving it F-16s and bringing Ukrainian pilots to the US for training on the advanced aircraft.\n\n\"The idea is to move them so close to membership that when the time comes, when there is consensus, they can become a member straight away,\" Stoltenberg said.\n\nHowever Russia's offensive concludes, only taking Ukraine into the alliance will dissuade Putin from trying again in the future to conquer Ukraine, the NATO chief said.\n\n\"When the fighting ends, NATO membership\" for Ukraine \"assures that the war really ends,\" he said.\n\nThe prospect of Ukraine joining NATO has long been anathema to Putin, and it was one of his stated motivations for seizing Crimea. He offered last week to order an immediate cease-fire if Ukraine renounced plans to join the alliance, an offer that was dismissed by Ukraine.\n\nA weekend conference held in Switzerland was billed as a first step toward peace and ended with pledges to work toward a resolution but had few concrete deliverables.\n\nKyiv's outgunned and outnumbered forces are battling to hold back the bigger Russian army, which has taken over chunks of territory after political squabbles led to delays in delivering US and European military aid. Ukraine has been short of troops, ammunition and air defenses in recent months as the Kremlin's forces try to cripple the national power supply and punch through the front line in eastern parts of the country.", "source": {"uri": "english.aawsat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asharq Al-Awsat English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

At some point -- and unless China changes course -- allies need to impose a cost. There should be consequences,\" Stoltenberg added.\n\nIn addition to the 32 members of the NATO alliance, the summit will also bring in four key partners from the Asia-Pacific: Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea.\n\nChina argues that it is not sending lethal assistance to either side -- unlike the United States and other Western nations.\n\nBeijing steered clear of a weekend summit in Switzerland promoted by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that reaffirmed Kyiv's demands for Russia to leave Ukrainian territory for any peace.\n\n- Rising NATO spending -\n\nStoltenberg said that Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit this week to North Korea, which has supplied shells to Moscow despite being under UN sanctions, further showed how Moscow was \"dependent\" on authoritarian leaders.\n\nTrump -- who in the past has voiced admiration for Putin -- has boasted that he can quickly end the war, likely by pressing Ukraine to accept demands.\n\nTrump has long raged over what he sees as unfairness in NATO, founded to counter the Soviet Union.\n\nOn the campaign trail, he has suggested he would encourage Russia to \"do whatever the hell they want\" if NATO members do not \"pay your bills.\"\n\nIn the Oval Office, Stoltenberg told Biden that 23 of the 32 allies now met a pledge to spend at least two percent of GDP on defense, as the Ukraine invasion brings new security fears to Europe.\n\nA 2014 NATO summit set the funding goal that was then met by only three countries -- the United States, Britain and Greece. Stoltenberg last reported that 20 countries were achieving the target.\n\n\"NATO allies are this year increasing defense spending by 18 percent. That's the biggest increase in decades,\" Stoltenberg said.\n\nIn a sharply different message than Trump, Biden hailed NATO, saying that since it has successfully \"deterred further Russian aggression in Europe\" through its promise to \"defend every inch of NATO territory.\"\n\n- Bracing for Trump -\n\nIn an unstated bid to \"Trump-proof\" future efforts, Stoltenberg wants the Washington summit to commit the alliance to provide at least 40 billion euros ($43 billion) a year in military aid to Ukraine and to put NATO in charge of coordination.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after his Wilson Center speech, Stoltenberg did not criticize Trump but pointed to the damage done on the battlefront by the delay in Congress approving a $60 billion package for Ukraine.\n\n\"Regardless of who's going to be the next president of the United States,\" Stoltenberg said, \"I believe that we should minimize the risk.\"\n\nStoltenberg, who led NATO throughout Trump's 2017-2021 presidency, said that successive US administrations had \"an absolutely valid point to say that European allies are spending too little.\"\n\n\"The good news is that's changing,\" Stoltenberg said.\n\n\"We're not saying that we are satisfied, but we are in a totally different place now than we were back in 2014,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "spacewar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SpaceWar"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

That was before Russian President Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\n\"Europeans are doing more for their collective security than just a few years ago,\" Stoltenberg said in a speech at the Wilson Center research group.\n\nAfter the speech, Stoltenberg met at the White House with President Joe Biden. The U.S. president said the alliance has become \"larger, stronger and more united than it's ever been\" during Stoltenberg's tenure.\n\nBiden spoke affectionately of Stoltenberg, calling him \"pal\" and saying he wished that Stoltenberg, who has been NATO's secretary general since 2014, could serve another term when the current one expires in October.\n\n\"Together, we've deterred further Russian aggression in Europe,\" Biden said. \"We've strengthened NATO's eastern flank, making it clear that we'll defend every single inch of NATO territory.\"\n\nStoltenberg noted that allies were buying more military equipment from the U.S. \"So NATO is good for U.S. security, but NATO is also good for U.S. jobs,\" he said.\n\nNATO members agreed last year to spend at least 2% of their gross domestic product on defense. The surge in spending reflects the worries about the war in Ukraine.\n\nPoland, at more than 4%, and tiny Estonia both lead the United States this year in the percentage of their GDP they spend on defense. Both countries border Russia.\n\nDefense spending across European allies and Canada was up nearly 18% this year alone, the biggest increase in decades, according to NATO's estimated figures released Monday.\n\nSome countries also are concerned about the possible reelection of former President Donald Trump, who has characterized many NATO allies as freeloading on U.S. military spending and said on the campaign trail that he would not defend NATO members that don't meet defense spending targets.\n\n\"Shifting U.S. administrations have had the absolutely valid point to say that U.S. allies are spending too little,\" Stoltenberg told reporters. \"The good news is that's changing.\"\n\nStoltenberg's visit is laying the groundwork for what's expected to be a pivotal summit of NATO leaders in Washington next month. The mutual-defense alliance has grown in strength and size since Russia's invasion of Ukraine two years ago, with both Sweden and Finland joining.\n\nDefense spending by many European countries fell after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union seemed to neutralize what was then the prime security threat to the West.\n\nBut after Russia seized Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014, NATO members unanimously agreed to spend at least 2% of their GDP on defense within a decade. The full-scale invasion that Putin launched in 2022 spurred European countries newly on the front line of a war in the heart of Europe to put more resources into meeting that target.\n\nMuch of the focus of the summit is expected to address what NATO and NATO member governments can do for Ukraine as it faces unrelenting air and ground attacks from its more powerful neighbor. They so far have resisted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's appeals to take his country into the bloc as long as the war is still on.\n\nStoltenberg pointed to efforts to bolster Ukraine in the meantime. That includes NATO streamlining the eventual membership process for Ukraine, and individual NATO nations providing updated arms and training to Ukraine's military, including the U.S. giving it F-16s and bringing Ukrainian pilots to the U.S. for training on the advanced aircraft.\n\n\"The idea is to move them so close to membership that when the time comes, when there is consensus, they can become a member straightaway,\" Stoltenberg said.\n\nHowever Russia's offensive concludes, only taking Ukraine into the alliance will dissuade Putin from trying again in the future to conquer Ukraine, the NATO chief said.\n\n\"When the fighting ends, NATO membership\" for Ukraine \"assures that the war really ends,\" he said.\n\nThe prospect of Ukraine joining NATO has long been anathema to Putin, and it was one of his stated motivations for seizing Crimea. He offered last week to order an immediate cease-fire if Ukraine renounced plans to join the alliance, an offer that was dismissed by Ukraine.\n\nA weekend conference held in Switzerland was billed as a first step toward peace and ended with pledges to work toward a resolution but had few concrete deliverables. It was attended largely by Western nations, and Russia was not invited. China sat it out and then India, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and Mexico did not sign the meeting's final document Sunday.\n\nKyiv's outgunned and outnumbered forces are battling to hold back the bigger Russian army, which has taken over chunks of territory after political squabbles led to delays in delivering U.S. and European military aid. Ukraine has been short of troops, ammunition and air defenses in recent months as the Kremlin's forces try to cripple the national power supply and punch through the front line in eastern parts of the country.\n\nPresident Joe Biden meets with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in the Oval Office at the White House, Monday, June 17, 2024.

That was before Russian President Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\n\"Europeans are doing more for their collective security than just a few years ago,\" Stoltenberg said in a speech at the Wilson Center research group in Washington.\n\nAfter the speech, Stoltenberg met at the White House with US President Joe Biden.\n\nThe US president said that the alliance has become \"larger, stronger and more united than it's ever been\" during Stoltenberg's tenure.\n\nBiden spoke affectionately of Stoltenberg, calling him \"pal\" and saying he wished that Stoltenberg, who has been NATO secretary-general since 2014, could serve another term when the current one expires in October.\n\n\"Together, we've deterred further Russian aggression in Europe,\" Biden said. \"We've strengthened NATO's eastern flank ,making it clear that we'll defend every single inch of NATO territory.\"\n\nStoltenberg said that allies were buying more military equipment from the US.\n\n\"So NATO is good for US security, but NATO is also good for US jobs.\" he said.\n\nNATO members agreed last year to spend at least 2 percent of their GDP on defense. The surge in spending reflects worries about the war in Ukraine.\n\nPoland, at more than 4 percent, and tiny Estonia both lead the US this year in the percentage of their GDP they spend on defense. Both nations border Russia.\n\nDefense spending across European allies and Canada was up nearly 18 percent this year alone, the biggest increase in decades, according to NATO's estimated figures released on Monday.\n\nSome nations also are concerned about the possible re-election of former US president Donald Trump, who has characterized many NATO allies as freeloading on US military spending and said on the campaign trail that he would not defend NATO members that do not meet defense spending targets.\n\n\"Shifting US administrations have had the absolutely valid point to say that US allies are spending too little,\" Stoltenberg told reporters. \"The good news is that's changing.\"\n\nStoltenberg's visit is laying the groundwork for what is expected to be a pivotal summit of NATO leaders in Washington next month.\n\nThe mutual-defense alliance has grown in strength and size since Russia's invasion of Ukraine two years ago, with both Sweden and Finland joining.\n\nDefense spending by many European nations fell after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union seemed to neutralize what was then the prime security threat to the West, but after Russia seized Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014, NATO members unanimously agreed to spend at least 2 percent of their GDP on defense within a decade.\n\nThe full-scale invasion that Putin launched in 2022 spurred European nations newly on the front line of a war in Europe to put more resources into meeting that target.\n\nMuch of the focus of the summit is expected to address what NATO and NATO member governments can do for Ukraine. They so far have resisted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's appeals to take his nation into the bloc as long as the war is still ongoing.\n\nStoltenberg pointed to efforts to bolster Ukraine in the meantime. That includes NATO streamlining the eventual membership process for Ukraine, and individual NATO nations providing updated arms and training to Ukraine's military, including the US giving it F-16s.\n\n\"The idea is to move them [Ukraine] so close to membership that when the time comes, when there is consensus, they can become a member straight away,\" Stoltenberg said.", "source": {"uri":

There should be consequences,\" Stoltenberg said at the Wilson Center in Washington.\n\nStoltenberg said that in the past two years 90 percent of Russian microelectronics originated in China, and that China was working to improve Russian satellite capabilities.\n\n\"Threats are not regional,\" Stoltenberg said. \"China is fueling the largest armed conflict in Europe since World War II, and at the same time it wants to maintain good relations with the West.\"\n\nWhite House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby also said China was continuing to provide Russia with components for military equipment and weapon systems.\n\nSpeaking at a briefing on June 17, he said microelectronics had helped \"shore up...what would have been a truly crumbling Russian defense industrial base.\" Kirby added that the United States had raised the issue with China.\n\nStoltenberg noted that NATO faces threats from China related to Russia along with threats from China related to the Indo-Pacific and the Arctic.\n\nRussia has also built up relations with North Korea, and on June 17 the Kremlin announced that President Vladimir Putin will embark on a two-day visit to North Korea starting on June 18. Putin is expected to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for talks focused on expanding military cooperation.\n\nThe deepening relationship is a concern for the United States, Kirby said.\n\n\"We know North Korean ballistic missiles are being used to hit Ukrainian targets,\" he said.\n\nBoth Pyongyang and Moscow have denied accusations about North Korean weapons transfers, which would be in violation of UN Security Council resolutions.\n\nStoltenberg said the \"growing alignment between Russia and its authoritarian friends in Asia makes it even more important that we work closely with our friends in the Indo-Pacific.\"\n\nNon-NATO members Australia, Japan, South Korea, and New Zealand will attend the July 9-11 NATO summit in Washington as observers.\n\nThe secretary-general said Russia's ongoing war against Ukraine will be the \"most urgent topic\" for discussion at the summit, along with NATO defense spending.\n\nStoltenberg said he will announce new defense-spending figures for NATO allies later on June 17 when he meets U.S. President Joe Biden.\n\n\"This year, more than 20 allies spent at least 2 percent of GDP on defense,\" Stoltenberg said, previewing the announcement.\n\nThe increase in defense spending has bolstered Ukraine's defense capabilities, according to Stoltenberg, adding that the path to peace is more weapons for Ukraine.\n\nDefense spending by many European countries has risen sharply since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and NATO officials have been keen to stress that its European members are now stepping up to the plate.\n\nAlthough Ukraine will not become a member of the alliance at the Washington summit, Stoltenberg said NATO will \"build a bridge\" to future membership for Ukraine and praised the NATO-Ukraine Council set up last year at the summit in Vilnius.\n\n\"We are helping to ensure that the Ukrainian armed forces are more and more interoperable with NATO, meet NATO standards, and meet NATO doctrines,\" Stoltenberg said. \"The idea is to move them so close to membership that when we reach a consensus, we can make them members straight away.\"\n\nIn his remarks at the Wilson Center, Stoltenberg did not mention earlier comments reported by The Telegraph that NATO is in talks to deploy more nuclear weapons.\n\nThe British newspaper quoted Stoltenberg as saying that the weapons would be taken out of storage and placed on standby.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called the comments \"nothing but another escalation of tension,\" saying they appeared to contradict the communique of the Ukraine Conference that said any threat or use of nuclear weapons in the Ukraine context was inadmissible.\n\nCopyright (c) 2024.

This was before Russian President Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\n\"Europeans are doing more for their collective security than just a few years ago,\" Stoltenberg said in a speech at the Wilson Center research group.\n\nAfter the speech, Stoltenberg met at the White House with President Joe Biden. The US president said the alliance has become \"larger, stronger and more united than it's ever been\" during Stoltenberg's tenure.\n\nBiden spoke affectionately of Stoltenberg, calling him \"pal\" and saying he wished that Stoltenberg, who has been NATO's secretary general since 2014, could serve another term when the current one expires in October.\n\n\"Together, we've deterred further Russian aggression in Europe,\" Biden said. \"We've strengthened NATO's eastern flank ,making it clear that we'll defend every single inch of NATO territory.\"\n\nNATO members agreed last year to allocate at least 2% of their GDP to defense, with the surge in spending reflecting concerns about the war in Ukraine.\n\nPoland, with over 4%, and tiny Estonia, both of which border Russia, lead the United States this year in the percentage of their GDP spent on defence.\n\nDefence spending across European allies and Canada was up nearly 18% this year alone, the biggest increase in decades, according to NATO's estimated figures released on Monday.\n\nSome countries are also concerned about the possible reelection of former President Donald Trump, who has characterised many NATO allies as freeloading on US military spending and has stated on the campaign trail that he would not defend NATO members failing to meet defence spending targets.\n\n\"Shifting US administrations have had the absolutely valid point to say that US allies are spending too little,\" Stoltenberg told reporters. \"The good news is that's changing.\"\n\nNATO leaders to meet in Washington next month\n\nStoltenberg's visit is laying the groundwork for what's expected to be a pivotal summit of NATO leaders in Washington next month. The mutual defense alliance has grown in strength and size since Russia's invasion of Ukraine two years ago, with both Sweden and Finland joining.\n\nMuch of the focus of the summit is expected to address what NATO and NATO member governments can do for Ukraine as it faces unrelenting air and ground attacks from its more powerful neighbour. They so far have resisted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's appeals to take his country into the bloc as long as the war is still on.\n\nStoltenberg pointed to efforts to bolster Ukraine in the meantime. That includes NATO streamlining the eventual membership process for Ukraine, and individual NATO nations providing updated arms and training to Ukraine's military, including the US giving it F-16s and bringing Ukrainian pilots to the US for training on the advanced aircraft.\n\n\"The idea is to move them so close to membership that when the time comes, when there is consensus, they can become a member straight away,\" Stoltenberg said.\n\nHowever Russia's offensive concludes, only taking Ukraine into the alliance will dissuade Putin from trying again in the future to conquer Ukraine, the NATO chief said.\n\n\"When the fighting ends, NATO membership\" for Ukraine \"assures that the war really ends,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo

Olivier Hoslet/Pool via REUTERS\n\nMore than 20 NATO members will meet the alliance's target of allocating at least 2% of GDP to defense this year, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Monday, highlighting how allies have raised military spending since Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nStoltenberg told US President Joe Biden at the White House that the number of NATO allies now meeting that spending target compares to less than 10 members five years ago.\n\n\"Across Europe and Canada, NATO allies are this year increasing defense spending by 18%, that's the biggest increase in decades, and 23 allies are going to spend 2% of GDP or more on defense this year,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking earlier at the Wilson Center think tank, Stoltenberg said the increase in defense spending by the allies \"is good for Europe and good for America, especially since much of this extra money is spent here in the United States.\"\n\nStoltenberg was in Washington for preparations for next month's NATO summit in the US capital, a topic that he and Biden discussed as well.\n\nBiden said the alliance is facing one of the most consequential moments for Europe since World War Two as Ukraine battles Russian forces.\n\n\"We've strengthened NATO's eastern flank making it clear that we'll defend every single inch of NATO territory,\" said Biden.\n\nStoltenberg said that when NATO leaders set the 2% of GDP target at their summit in 2014, only three members - the United States, Greece and Britain - met that target.\n\nAt that time, there were 28 members. NATO now has 32 members.\n\nMeeting with reporters after his appearance, Stoltenberg said the trend in increased military spending by NATO members was triggered by Russia's seizure of Crimea in 2014.\n\nNATO defense spending has become highly contentious in recent years, particularly as former U.S. President Donald Trump has accused Europeans of spending too little on their own security and relying on the United States for protection.\n\nEarlier this year, Trump - the presumptive Republican candidate in this year's U.S. presidential election - sparked outrage by suggesting he would not protect NATO members that failed to spend enough on defense and would even encourage Russia to attack them.\n\nDefense spending by many European nations has risen sharply since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and NATO officials have been keen to stress that its European members are now stepping up to the plate.\n\nNATO defense spending will be a major topic at next month's alliance summit in Washington, Stoltenberg said, followed by Russia's war against Ukraine.\n\nHe warned that the delay in the provision of U.S. military aid to Ukraine that occurred earlier this year cannot be allowed to happen again.", "source": {"uri": "tbsnews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Business Standard"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

AFP-Yonhap\n\nMore than 20 NATO members will meet the alliance's target of allocating at least 2 percent of GDP to defense this year, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Monday, highlighting how allies have raised military spending since Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nStoltenberg told U.S. President Joe Biden at the White House that the number of NATO allies now meeting that spending target compares to less than 10 members five years ago.\n\n\"Across Europe and Canada, NATO allies are this year increasing defense spending by 18 percent, that's the biggest increase in decades, and 23 allies are going to spend 2 percent of GDP or more on defense this year,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking earlier at the Wilson Center think tank, Stoltenberg said the increase in defense spending by the allies \"is good for Europe and good for America, especially since much of this extra money is spent here in the United States.\"\n\nStoltenberg was in Washington for preparations for next month's NATO summit in the U.S. capital, a topic that he and Biden discussed as well.\n\nBiden said the alliance is facing one of the most consequential moments for Europe since World War Two as Ukraine battles Russian forces.\n\n\"We've strengthened NATO's eastern flank making it clear that we'll defend every single inch of NATO territory,\" said Biden.\n\nStoltenberg said that when NATO leaders set the 2 percent of GDP target at their summit in 2014, only three members -- the United States, Greece and Britain -- met that target.\n\nAt that time, there were 28 members. NATO now has 32 members.\n\nMeeting with reporters after his appearance, Stoltenberg said the trend in increased military spending by NATO members was triggered by Russia's seizure of Crimea in 2014.\n\nNATO defense spending has become highly contentious in recent years, particularly as former U.S. President Donald Trump has accused Europeans of spending too little on their own security and relying on the United States for protection.\n\nEarlier this year, Trump -- the presumptive Republican candidate in this year's U.S. presidential election -- sparked outrage by suggesting he would not protect NATO members that failed to spend enough on defense and would even encourage Russia to attack them.\n\nDefense spending by many European nations has risen sharply since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and NATO officials have been keen to stress that its European members are now stepping up to the plate.\n\nNATO defense spending will be a major topic at next month's alliance summit in Washington, Stoltenberg said, followed by Russia's war against Ukraine.\n\nHe warned that the delay in the provision of U.S. military aid to Ukraine that occurred earlier this year cannot be allowed to happen again.

This was before Russian President Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\n\"Europeans are doing more for their collective security than just a few years ago,\" Stoltenberg said in a speech at the Wilson Center research group.\n\nAfter the speech, Stoltenberg met at the White House with President Joe Biden. The US president said the alliance has become \"larger, stronger and more united than it's ever been\" during Stoltenberg's tenure.\n\nBiden spoke affectionately of Stoltenberg, calling him \"pal\" and saying he wished that Stoltenberg, who has been NATO's secretary general since 2014, could serve another term when the current one expires in October.\n\n\"Together, we've deterred further Russian aggression in Europe,\" Biden said. \"We've strengthened NATO's eastern flank ,making it clear that we'll defend every single inch of NATO territory.\"\n\nNATO members agreed last year to allocate at least 2% of their GDP to defense, with the surge in spending reflecting concerns about the war in Ukraine.\n\nPoland, with over 4%, and tiny Estonia, both of which border Russia, lead the United States this year in the percentage of their GDP spent on defence.\n\nDefence spending across European allies and Canada was up nearly 18% this year alone, the biggest increase in decades, according to NATO's estimated figures released on Monday.\n\nSome countries are also concerned about the possible reelection of former President Donald Trump, who has characterised many NATO allies as freeloading on US military spending and has stated on the campaign trail that he would not defend NATO members failing to meet defence spending targets.\n\n\"Shifting US administrations have had the absolutely valid point to say that US allies are spending too little,\" Stoltenberg told reporters. \"The good news is that's changing.\"\n\nStoltenberg's visit is laying the groundwork for what's expected to be a pivotal summit of NATO leaders in Washington next month. The mutual defense alliance has grown in strength and size since Russia's invasion of Ukraine two years ago, with both Sweden and Finland joining.\n\nMuch of the focus of the summit is expected to address what NATO and NATO member governments can do for Ukraine as it faces unrelenting air and ground attacks from its more powerful neighbour. They so far have resisted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's appeals to take his country into the bloc as long as the war is still on.\n\nStoltenberg pointed to efforts to bolster Ukraine in the meantime. That includes NATO streamlining the eventual membership process for Ukraine, and individual NATO nations providing updated arms and training to Ukraine's military, including the US giving it F-16s and bringing Ukrainian pilots to the US for training on the advanced aircraft.\n\n\"The idea is to move them so close to membership that when the time comes, when there is consensus, they can become a member straight away,\" Stoltenberg said.\n\nHowever Russia's offensive concludes, only taking Ukraine into the alliance will dissuade Putin from trying again in the future to conquer Ukraine, the NATO chief said.\n\n\"When the fighting ends, NATO membership\" for Ukraine \"assures that the war really ends,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "euronews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Euronews

NATO now has 32 members.\n\nMeeting with reporters after his appearance, Stoltenberg said the trend in increased military spending by NATO members was triggered by Russia's seizure of Crimea in 2014.\n\nNATO defense spending has become highly contentious in recent years, particularly as former U.S. President Donald Trump has accused Europeans of spending too little on their own security and relying on the United States for protection.\n\nEarlier this year, Trump - the presumptive Republican candidate in this year's U.S. presidential election - sparked outrage by suggesting he would not protect NATO members that failed to spend enough on defense and would even encourage Russia to attack them.\n\nDefense spending by many European nations has risen sharply since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and NATO officials have been keen to stress that its European members are now stepping up to the plate.\n\nNATO defense spending will be a major topic at next month's alliance summit in Washington, Stoltenberg said, followed by Russia's war against Ukraine.\n\nHe warned that the delay in the provision of U.S. military aid to Ukraine that occurred earlier this year cannot be allowed to happen again.", "source": {"uri": "timeslive.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "Times LIVE"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

At some point -- and unless China changes course -- allies need to impose a cost. There should be consequences.\"\n\nIn addition to the 32 members of the NATO alliance, the summit will also bring in four key partners from the Asia-Pacific: Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea.\n\nChina argues that it is not sending lethal assistance to either side -- unlike the United States and other Western nations.\n\nStoltenberg said that Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit this week to North Korea, which has supplied shells to Moscow despite being under UN sanctions, further showed how Moscow was \"dependent\" on authoritarian leaders.\n\nBeijing steered clear of a weekend summit in Switzerland promoted by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that reaffirmed Kyiv's demands for Russia to leave Ukrainian territory for any peace.\n\nRussia has insisted that it is interested in talks, but has demanded Ukrainian forces withdraw from territory seized by Moscow.\n\n'Trump-proof' alliance\n\nTrump -- who in the past has voiced admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin -- has boasted that he can quickly end the war, likely by pressing Ukraine to accept demands.\n\nIn an unstated effort to \"Trump-proof\" future efforts, Stoltenberg wants the Washington summit both to put NATO in the lead of coordination on Ukraine and to set up a way for long-term military funding.\n\n\"The more credible our long-term support, the quicker Moscow will realize it cannot wait us out,\" he said.\n\n\"It may seem like a paradox, but the path to peace is more weapons for Ukraine.\"\n\nThe US Congress in April approved some $60 billion in new military funding for Ukraine but only after months of political fighting and opposition by some of Trump's Republican allies.\n\n\"Regardless of who's going to be the next president of the United States,\" Stoltenberg told reporters of the delay, \"I believe that we should minimize the risk.\"\n\nStoltenberg said he would also tell Biden of the rising number of NATO members that are meeting a goal set in 2014 of spending two percent of GDP on defense.\n\nTrump has long raged over what he sees as unfairness in the alliance founded in the Cold War.\n\nOn the campaign trail, he has suggested that he would encourage Russia to \"do whatever the hell they want\" to any NATO member that does not \"pay (its) bills.\"\n\nAsked about Trump's criticism, Stoltenberg, who led NATO throughout the mogul's 2017-2021 presidency, said that successive US administrations had \"an absolutely valid point to say that European allies are spending too little.\"\n\n\"The good news is that's changing,\" Stoltenberg said.\n\n\"We're not saying that we are satisfied, but we are in a totally different place now than we were back in 2014.\"", "source": {"uri": "rfi.fr", "dataType": "news", "title":

At some point -- and unless China changes course -- allies need to impose a cost. There should be consequences,\" he said.\n\n\"China is fueling the largest armed conflict in Europe since World War II, and, at the same time, it wants to maintain good relations with the West,\" he pointed out.\n\nStoltenberg was speaking at the Wilson Center in Washington, DC. His remarks were dismissive of \"isolationism,\" which he saw as illogical in a deeply interconnected world.\n\n\"The vast Atlantic and Pacific Oceans do not protect the U.S. in an age of rising global challenges: intercontinental ballistic missiles, strategic submarines, the weaponization of space, and increased cyber and terrorist attacks,\" he observed.\n\nStoltenberg saw Chinese dictator Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin joining forces to oppose NATO and the United States, using the invasion of Ukraine as a hammer blow to shatter the post-World War II international order. He suggested the best way to make Putin look for an exit from Ukraine was to make it clear that he cannot outlast NATO's resources or wear down its resolve.\n\n\"It may seem like a paradox, but the path to peace is, therefore, more weapons for Ukraine. I strongly welcome the $60 billion package that the U.S. Congress passed in April. This is significant and complements efforts by other NATO allies,\" he said.\n\nStoltenberg blasted China for \"sharing high-end technologies, like semiconductors and other dual-use items,\" with Russia. He suggested China's support was a major factor in Putin's calculations that he might be able to outlast NATO and Ukraine.\n\n\"Russia is receiving support from others, too. North Korea has delivered over one million artillery shells, and Iran has delivered thousands of deadly Shahed drones. In exchange, Pyongyang and Tehran are receiving Russian technology and supplies to help them advance their missile and nuclear capabilities,\" he said, contending that stronger NATO unity was the best way to push back against this malign alliance.\n\nStoltenberg said he had invited Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea to July's NATO summit in Washington to discuss how they can work together to \"uphold the international rules-based order and protect our shared values.\"\n\nThis is actually one of China's common talking points: the U.S. is scheming to build an \"Asian NATO\" with countries like Japan and South Korea, so China must forge closer ties with its own allies to push back.\n\nDuring the question-and-answer session after his speech, Stoltenberg addressed such talking points from China and Russia by stressing that NATO has always been a \"defensive alliance,\" while Russia is clearly the aggressor in Ukraine. He argued that a strong defensive posture was the best way to dissuade aggressive powers like Russia from contemplating further invasions, and he suggested China should, likewise, factor a strong Western deterrence into its calculations of conquest:\n\nI think there's this idea that we can distinguish between the threats we see in Europe, posed by Russia, and the threats and the challenges in Asia, Asia Pacific, posed by China, that we can separate those is wrong. Our security is global, not regional, and that's very clearly demonstrated in Ukraine.\n\n...\n\nIf President Putin prevails in Ukraine, it's not only a tragedy for the Ukrainians. It sends a very clear message to President Putin but also to President Xi that when they use military force, when they violate international law, they achieve what they want. So, if you're afraid of Chinese aggression in the South China Sea or Taiwan, then you should be very concerned about Ukraine.\n\nStoltenberg said some of the European NATO allies were \"a bit slow\" to see China as a global threat, but the U.S. persuaded them to adjust their thinking at the end of the last decade. He was \"optimistic\" that the \"agile and adaptable\" NATO could rise to the challenge of handling two hostile great powers.\n\nThe Chinese government denounced Stoltenberg's remarks on Tuesday, accusing the NATO chief of \"shifting blame\" for the war in Ukraine and \"sowing discord.\"\n\n\"The world has seen what kind of role NATO has played in the Ukraine crisis. What the NATO should do is reflect on itself, rather than smear and attack China,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian sneered.\n\n\"What NATO should do is reflect on itself, rather than smear and attack China. China is not a creator of or a party to the Ukraine crisis. We are committed to promoting talks for peace,\" Lin insisted.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_hayward@breitbart.com", "name":

Stoltenberg announced on Monday that NATO was prepared to take on a larger role in Ukraine's security in the meantime.\n\n\"I expect that when we meet next month, we will agree to have a NATO role in providing security assistance and training,\" Stoltenberg said. \"This will reduce the burden on the United States and strengthen our support to Ukraine.\"\n\nThat is possible in part because the number of allies meeting their informal commitments to spend at least 2% of their gross domestic product on their militaries has soared. When NATO allies made the pledge in 2014, only three members -- including the United States -- met that mark, Stoltenberg said. About five years ago, roughly 10 did, he said, and this year more than 20 of the alliance's 32 members will.\n\nStoltenberg also said allies have increased military spending this year by 18% -- the biggest jump in decades.\n\nThe reassurances from the two leaders come as questions have arisen anew about the alliance and the commitment to Ukraine. Russia has recently made advances on the front lines after a temporary delay in military aid to Ukraine caused by congressional gridlock. And Biden's main rival in the November election, former President Donald Trump, has expressed skepticism toward assistance for Ukraine and the value of NATO itself.\n\nAlso Read: | Biden offers citizenship path to spouses of Americans in sweeping election-year move\n\nBut Biden made clear in remarks before the meeting that he considers NATO essential. \"Together, we've deterred further Russian aggression in Europe,\" he said.\n\nNext month's summit is expected to build on efforts secured by Western allies at the Group of 7 summit in Italy last week, which included the approval of a $50 billion loan to Ukraine backed by unlocking frozen Russian assets, and a new, 10-year security pact signed by Biden and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that would train and equip Ukraine's forces.\n\nThe increase in spending by NATO allies is likely to blunt one line of attack from Trump, who has long criticized other members of the alliance for not paying their fair share. But his potential return to the White House has left other members of NATO fearful for the future of the alliance.\n\nTrump threatened to withdraw the United States from the alliance if European countries did not increase their spending, and in February said he would encourage Russia to \"do whatever the hell they want\" to NATO members if they had failed to pay. This month, more than 40 House Republicans voted to defund the organization, alleging that too many members were not meeting the 2% commitment.\n\nAlso Read: | US, India share unique bond of friendship: White House\n\nIn an address at a Washington think tank before Monday's meeting with Biden, Stoltenberg appeared to acknowledge the difficulties Trump's allies in Congress had caused for Ukraine by holding up $60 billion in aid, which was eventually approved in April.

At some point, and unless China changes course, allies need to impose a cost. There should be consequences,\" Stoltenberg added.\n\nBeijing has aided Moscow's efforts to evade sanctions and restore its defense industrial base to make up for the use of resources over the more than two years since Russia invaded Ukraine. The Russians expected the war to last only a matter of weeks.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken reiterated last month that the United States hasn't seen evidence of China providing weapons to Russia for use in Ukraine, though it has provided what he described as \"critical inputs that have allowed Russia to accelerate its own production.\"\n\nIn a follow-up private conversation with reporters, Stoltenberg acknowledged it is \"too early\" to determine the long-term implications of Beijing siding with the likes of Russia, Iran, and North Korea over the West.\n\n\"My message to allies is that, but also to Beijing, in the long run, they cannot continue propping up the most brutal war of aggression that has been seen in Europe since the Second World War,\" he explained. \"Being the main supporter of Russia's war efforts in Europe, which is our most serious security challenge, and, at the same time, believe that they're going to have a normal relationship with European allies.\"\n\nThe alliance should consider the \"costs and consequences\" of China's support for Russia's war efforts during next month's NATO summit in Washington, he said.\n\nIn addition to the 32 members of the NATO alliance, leaders from four Asia-Pacific countries will be in attendance for NATO's 75th-anniversary summit: Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea.\n\nThe secretary-general is in Washington this week and will meet with President Joe Biden, Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan, and Blinken, among others.\n\nAlternatively, Russian leader Vladimir Putin is expected to travel to North Korea later this week, which Stoltenberg said \"demonstrates how close the alignment\" between the two countries has become and that it shows Putin is \"dependent\" on \"authoritarian leaders\" for support.\n\nStoltenberg cautioned that Russia would likely use any decrease in its wartime objectives to reconstitute for future aggression, and he referenced Russia's invasions of Georgia in 2008, Crimea in 2014, and further into Ukraine in 2022.\n\nThe best way, he argued, to ensure Ukraine does not fall victim to Russian aggression once this war ends is for Ukraine to get NATO membership. A major component of the alliance is Article 5, which means member states consider an attack against one of the members as an attack against itself. So, if Ukraine were to join the alliance before the war is over, it would put the alliance squarely in conflict with Russia, and it is Stoltenberg's belief that Ukraine should be admitted to NATO to prevent a future war once this one ends or pauses.\n\nHe also recently said the alliance was looking to deploy more of its nuclear weapons, given the current threat landscape.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\n\"I won't go into operational details about how many nuclear warheads should be operational and which should be stored, but we need to consult on these issues,\" he told the Telegraph. \"That's exactly what we're doing.\"\n\nThe U.S. and NATO are working to ensure Ukraine has continued support, even as the U.S. and several European countries are about to have elections featuring candidates who may reduce or completely end support for Ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors":

Well, Beijing cannot have it both ways. At some point, unless China changes course, allies need to impose a cost.\"\n\nRT reports: Stoltenberg has repeatedly attacked China since the Ukraine crisis began in February 2022, arguing that Beijing was enabling Russia to fight against Kiev, a \"European friend\" of NATO. He has made such comments even as NATO states prolonged the conflict by providing hundreds of billions of dollars in economic and military aid to Ukraine.\n\nMonday's rebuke marked some of his most pointed criticism yet, suggesting that NATO may ramp up sanctions against China. He also called out North Korea and Iran for being supportive of Russia's defense-industrial complex.\n\nStoltenberg reiterated an assertion that NATO - a military bloc originally formed against the Soviet Union - needs to get more involved in the Indo-Pacific to counter the \"growing alignment between Russia and its authoritarian friends in Asia.\" He noted that he invited the leaders of Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand to next month's NATO summit in Washington to work together on upholding the \"international rules-based order.\"\n\nChina is providing Russia with semiconductors and other key technologies with military applications, including parts needed to make missiles and tanks, Stoltenberg said. He added that Beijing also has supplied Russia with improved satellite and imaging capabilities. \"All of this enables Moscow to inflict more death and destruction on Ukraine, bolster Russia's defense-industrial base, and evade the impact of sanctions and export controls.\"\n\nThe NATO chief also spoke of his China concerns in an interview with the BBC on Monday. Asked about what the Western military bloc might do about the issue, he said there was an \"ongoing conversation\" about possible sanctions. \"At some stage, we should consider some kind of economic cost if China doesn't change their behavior,\" he said.\n\nBeijing has repeatedly defied demands from the US and other NATO nations to join in sanctioning and isolating Russia.

Well, Beijing cannot have it both ways. At some point, unless China changes course, allies need to impose a cost.\"\n\nStoltenberg has repeatedly attacked China since the Ukraine crisis began in February 2022, arguing that Beijing was enabling Russia to fight against Kiev, a \"European friend\" of NATO. He has made such comments even as NATO states prolonged the conflict by providing hundreds of billions of dollars' in economic and military aid to Ukraine.\n\nMonday's rebuke marked some of his most pointed criticism yet, suggesting that NATO may ramp up sanctions against China. He also called out North Korea and Iran for being supportive of Russia's defense-industrial complex.\n\nStoltenberg reiterated an assertion that NATO - a military bloc originally formed against the Soviet Union - needs to get more involved in the Indo-Pacific to counter the \"growing alignment between Russia and its authoritarian friends in Asia.\" He noted that he invited the leaders of Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand to next month's NATO summit in Washington to work together on upholding the \"international rules-based order.\"\n\nChina is providing Russia with semiconductors and other key technologies with military applications, including parts needed to make missiles and tanks, Stoltenberg said. He added that Beijing also has supplied Russia with improved satellite and imaging capabilities. \"All of this enables Moscow to inflict more death and destruction on Ukraine, bolster Russia's defense-industrial base, and evade the impact of sanctions and export controls.\"\n\nThe NATO chief also spoke of his China concerns in an interview with the BBC on Monday. Asked about what the Western military bloc might do about the issue, he said there was an \"ongoing conversation\" about possible sanctions. \"At some stage, we should consider some kind of economic cost if China doesn't change their behavior,\" he said.\n\nBeijing has repeatedly defied demands from the US and other NATO nations to join in sanctioning and isolating Russia. Chinese leaders have pushed a peace plan to end the fighting and have pointed out that Russia's legitimate security concerns cannot be ignored.\n\nEarlier this year, the Chinese Foreign Ministry denounced NATO as a \"walking war machine that causes chaos wherever it goes.\" Beijing has accused NATO of meddling in Asian affairs, saying the bloc is a \"terrible monster\" and has extended a \"black hand\" toward the region.", "source": {"uri": "rt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RT"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jens_Stoltenberg", "type":

Stoltenberg announced on Monday that NATO was prepared to take on a larger role in Ukraine's security in the meantime.\n\n\"I expect that when we meet next month, we will agree to have a NATO role in providing security assistance and training,\" Stoltenberg said. \"This will reduce the burden on the United States and strengthen our support to Ukraine.\"\n\nThat is possible in part because the number of allies meeting their informal commitments to spend at least 2 per cent of their gross domestic product on their militaries has soared. When NATO allies made the pledge in 2014, only three members -- including the United States -- met that mark, Stoltenberg said. About five years ago, roughly 10 did, he said, and this year more than 20 of the alliance's 32 members will.\n\nStoltenberg also said allies have increased military spending this year by 18 per cent -- the biggest jump in decades.\n\nThe reassurances from the two leaders come as questions have arisen anew about the alliance and the commitment to Ukraine. Russia has recently made advances on the front lines after a temporary delay in military aid to Ukraine caused by congressional gridlock.

At some point -- and unless China changes course -- allies need to impose a cost. There should be consequences.\"\n\nIn addition to the 32 members of the NATO alliance, the summit will also bring in four key partners from the Asia-Pacific: Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea.\n\nChina argues that it is not sending lethal assistance to either side -- unlike the United States and other Western nations.\n\nStoltenberg said that Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit this week to North Korea, which has supplied shells to Moscow despite being under UN sanctions, further showed how Moscow was \"dependent\" on authoritarian leaders.\n\nBeijing steered clear of a weekend summit in Switzerland promoted by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that reaffirmed Kyiv's demands for Russia to leave Ukrainian territory for any peace.\n\nRussia has insisted that it is interested in talks, but has demanded Ukrainian forces withdraw from territory seized by Moscow.\n\n- 'Trump-proof' alliance -\n\nTrump -- who in the past has voiced admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin -- has boasted that he can quickly end the war, likely by pressing Ukraine to accept demands.\n\nIn an unstated effort to \"Trump-proof\" future efforts, Stoltenberg wants the Washington summit both to put NATO in the lead of coordination on Ukraine and to set up a way for long-term military funding.\n\n\"The more credible our long-term support, the quicker Moscow will realize it cannot wait us out,\" he said.\n\n\"It may seem like a paradox, but the path to peace is more weapons for Ukraine.\"\n\nThe US Congress in April approved some $60 billion in new military funding for Ukraine but only after months of political fighting and opposition by some of Trump's Republican allies.\n\n\"Regardless of who's going to be the next president of the United States,\" Stoltenberg told reporters of the delay, \"I believe that we should minimize the risk.\"\n\nStoltenberg said he would also tell Biden of the rising number of NATO members that are meeting a goal set in 2014 of spending two percent of GDP on defense.\n\nTrump has long raged over what he sees as unfairness in the alliance founded in the Cold War.\n\nOn the campaign trail, he has suggested that he would encourage Russia to \"do whatever the hell they want\" to any NATO member that does not \"pay (its) bills.\"\n\nAsked about Trump's criticism, Stoltenberg, who led NATO throughout the mogul's 2017-2021 presidency, said that successive US administrations had \"an absolutely valid point to say that European allies are spending too little.\"\n\n\"The good news is that's changing,\" Stoltenberg said.\n\n\"We're not saying that we are satisfied, but we are in a totally different place now than we were back in 2014.\"\n\nsct/des\n\nMore from this section\n\nChurch of Scientology

News Investigates US: Dust Devil Spotted In Olathe, Colorado SILVER LINING: Swimmer from Darien recalls tragic shark attack in Turks and Caicos\n\nTrump -- who in the past has voiced admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin -- has boasted that he can quickly end the war, likely by pressing Ukraine to accept demands.\n\nIn an unstated effort to \"Trump-proof\" future efforts, Stoltenberg wants the Washington summit both to put NATO in the lead of coordination on Ukraine and to set up a way for long-term military funding.\n\n\"The more credible our long-term support, the quicker Moscow will realize it cannot wait us out,\" he said.\n\n\"It may seem like a paradox, but the path to peace is more weapons for Ukraine.\"\n\nThe US Congress in April approved some $60 billion in new military funding for Ukraine but only after months of political fighting and opposition by some of Trump's Republican allies.\n\n\"Regardless of who's going to be the next president of the United States,\" Stoltenberg told reporters of the delay, \"I believe that we should minimize the risk.\"\n\nStoltenberg said he would also tell Biden of the rising number of NATO members that are meeting a goal set in 2014 of spending two percent of GDP on defense.\n\nTrump has long raged over what he sees as unfairness in the alliance founded in the Cold War.\n\nOn the campaign trail, he has suggested that he would encourage Russia to \"do whatever the hell they want\" to any NATO member that does not \"pay (its) bills.\"\n\nAsked about Trump's criticism, Stoltenberg, who led NATO throughout the mogul's 2017-2021 presidency, said that successive US administrations had \"an absolutely valid point to say that European allies are spending too little.\"\n\n\"The good news is that's changing,\" Stoltenberg said.\n\n\"We're not saying that we are satisfied, but we are in a totally different place now than we were back in 2014.\"\n\nsct/des", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType":

Watch in the player above.\n\nOn Monday, Stoltenberg met at the White House with President Joe Biden. The U.S. president said the NATO alliance has become \"larger, stronger and more united than it's ever been\" during Stoltenberg's tenure.\n\nBiden spoke affectionately of Stoltenberg, calling him \"pal\" and saying he wished that Stoltenberg, who has been NATO's secretary general since 2014, could serve another term when the current one expires in October.\n\n\"Together, we've deterred further Russian aggression in Europe,\" Biden said. \"We've strengthened NATO's eastern flank ,making it clear that we'll defend every single inch of NATO territory.\"\n\nStoltenberg noted that allies were buying more military equipment from the U.S. \"So NATO is good for U.S. security, but NATO is also good for U.S. jobs.\" he said.\n\nNATO members agreed last year to spend at least 2% of their gross domestic product on defense. The surge in spending reflects the worries about the war in Ukraine.\n\nPoland, at more than 4%, and tiny Estonia both lead the United States this year in the percentage of their GDP they spend on defense. Both countries border Russia.\n\nDefense spending across European allies and Canada was up nearly 18% this year alone, the biggest increase in decades, according to NATO's estimated figures released Monday.\n\nSome countries also are concerned about the possible reelection of former President Donald Trump, who has characterized many NATO allies as freeloading on U.S. military spending and said on the campaign trail that he would not defend NATO members that don't meet defense spending targets.\n\n\"Shifting U.S. administrations have had the absolutely valid point to say that U.S. allies are spending too little,\" Stoltenberg told reporters. \"The good news is that's changing.\"\n\nStoltenberg's visit is laying the groundwork for what's expected to be a pivotal summit of NATO leaders in Washington next month.

(BSS/AFP) - China on Tuesday urged NATO to \"stop shifting blame\" over the Ukraine war after the Western military alliance's chief accused Beijing of worsening the conflict through support of Russia.\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Monday called for China to face consequences for what US officials have called a major export push to rebuild Russia's defence industry.\n\nChina presents itself as a neutral party in the Ukraine war, and says it is not sending lethal assistance to either side, unlike the United States and other Western nations.\n\nOn Tuesday Beijing said NATO \"should engage in self-reflection rather than arbitrary smears and attacks on China\".\n\nDomestically, Russian President Vladimir Putin has framed the 2022 invasion as a defensive move against an expanding NATO.\n\n\"We advise (NATO) to stop shifting blame and sowing discord, not add fuel to the fire and instigate confrontation, but rather do something practical for the political settlement of the crisis,\" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said at a regular press briefing.\n\nChina and Russia's strategic partnership has only grown closer since the invasion of Ukraine, but Beijing has rebuffed Western claims that it is aiding Moscow's war effort.\n\nIt has however offered a critical lifeline to Russia's isolated economy, with trade booming since the conflict began.\n\nAnd G7 foreign ministers on Friday expressed \"strong concern\" about transfers of dual use materials and weapons components from Chinese businesses to Russia being used by Moscow for its military expansion.\n\nChina steered clear of a weekend summit in Switzerland promoted by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that reaffirmed Kyiv's demands for Russia to leave Ukrainian territory for any peace to be won.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping \"has tried to create the impression that he is taking a back seat in this conflict, to avoid sanctions and keep trade flowing,\" Stoltenberg said Monday on a visit to Washington.\n\n\"But the reality is that China is fuelling the largest armed conflict in Europe since World War II,\" he said, warning that \"at some point... there should be consequences\".\n\nNATO next month celebrates its 75th anniversary with a summit in Washington that aims to send a decisive long-term message of support for Ukraine ahead of President Joe Biden's re-election fight against Republican candidate Donald Trump.\n\n\"The more credible our long-term support, the quicker Moscow will realise it cannot wait us out,\" Stoltenberg said.\n\n\"It may seem like a paradox, but the path to peace is more weapons for Ukraine,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "bssnews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS)"}, "authors": [],

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Monday called for China to face consequences for what US officials have called a major export push to rebuild Russia's defence industry.\n\nChina presents itself as a neutral party in the Ukraine war, and says it is not sending lethal assistance to either side, unlike the United States and other Western nations.\n\nBeijing said NATO \"should engage in self-reflection rather than arbitrary smears and attacks on China\".\n\nDomestically, Russian president Vladimir Putin has framed the 2022 invasion as a defensive move against an expanding NATO.\n\n\"We advise (NATO) to stop shifting blame and sowing discord, not add fuel to the fire and instigate confrontation, but rather do something practical for the political settlement of the crisis,\" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said at a regular press briefing.\n\nChina and Russia's strategic partnership has only grown closer since the invasion of Ukraine, but Beijing has rebuffed Western claims that it is aiding Moscow's war effort.\n\nIt has, however, offered a critical lifeline to Russia's isolated economy, with trade booming since the conflict began.\n\nAnd G7 foreign ministers on Friday expressed \"strong concern\" about transfers of dual-use materials and weapons' components from Chinese businesses to Russia being used by Moscow for its military expansion.\n\nChina steered clear of a weekend summit in Switzerland promoted by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky that reaffirmed Kyiv's demands for Russia to leave Ukrainian territory for any peace to be won.\n\nChinese president Xi Jinping \"has tried to create the impression that he is taking a back seat in this conflict, to avoid sanctions and keep trade flowing,\" Stoltenberg said Monday on a visit to Washington.\n\n\"But the reality is that China is fuelling the largest armed conflict in Europe since World War II,\" he said, warning that \"at some point... there should be consequences\".\n\nNATO next month celebrates its 75th anniversary with a summit in Washington that aims to send a decisive long-term message of support for Ukraine ahead of president Joe Biden's re-election fight against Republican candidate Donald Trump.\n\n\"The more credible our long-term support, the quicker Moscow will realise it cannot wait us out,\" Stoltenberg said.\n\n\"It may seem like a paradox, but the path to peace is more weapons for Ukraine,\" he said. - Nampa/AFP", "source": {"uri": "neweralive.na", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Era Live"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

U.S. officials are reportedly facing criticism from European countries for not willing to go as far as countries closer to Russia would prefer.\n\nKyiv did not receive the much-desired invitation nor a firm deadline to join the alliance during last year's 2023 NATO summit in Vilnius, even though NATO took steps to tighten cooperation. Ukrainian officials have voiced hope that the Washington meeting, scheduled for July 9-11, will bring a more definite signal.\n\nAccording to CNN, US and German officials have proposed giving Ukraine a \"bridge\" to NATO at next month's summit rather than an \"irreversible path\" that NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg specified earlier this year and is currently favored by the UK and numerous Eastern and Central European countries.\n\nA senior American official told CNN that the Biden Administration does not think the word \"irreversible\" would earn the support of the entire alliance, particularly Hungary. The U.S. reportedly believes it is close to an agreement with allies on the language.\n\nOne Central European diplomat said that \"most Central Eastern European countries are disappointed by the Biden administration's ambiguity and procrastination\" in outlining a concrete path forward for Ukraine's entrance into NATO.\n\nA second official said that European allies had been directly lobbying the White House to push for a commitment to Ukraine's NATO membership.\n\nEarlier this year, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that a consensus had not been reached among NATO member states regarding Ukraine's entrance but that the alliance is \"currently working on it.\"\n\nStoltenberg also said that the alliance aims to help Ukraine get as close as possible to NATO standards as part of its integration process, adding that there is \"a lot of work ahead.\"\n\n\"At the same time, we need to make you [Ukraine] as interoperable as possible. And integrate you as much as we can,\" he said.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in turn, noted that Ukraine will join NATO only after Russia's full-scale invasion ends. The president hopes that Ukraine's victory against Russia will help to reach a perfect agreement among all NATO member states.", "source": {"uri": "kyivindependent.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Kyiv Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jens_Stoltenberg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jens Stoltenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_states_of_NATO", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member states of NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_summit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NATO summit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Europe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central Europe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilnius", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vilnius"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vilnius"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lithuania"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_General_of_NATO", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secretary General of NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Europe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lobbying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Officiating", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Officiating", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2157532257.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659612", "eventUri": "eng-9659612", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-09", "dateEnd": "2024-07-11", "textStart": 648, "textEnd": 657}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 224, "textEnd": 231}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

It will be painstakingly debated by the allies in the days leading up and then heavily scrutinized, as it will outline to the world - Russia in particular - what the goals are for Ukraine within NATO.\n\n\"At the (Washington) Summit, we'll be taking concrete steps to bring Ukraine closer to NATO and ensure that there's a bridge to membership, a bridge that's strong and well-lit,\" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at a NATO Foreign Ministerial in Prague in late May.\n\nA senior US official said that Biden administration officials do not think the word \"irreversible\" would get the support of the entire alliance, pointing in particular to Hungary as a likely holdout. The official said the US believes they are close to a resolution with all allies on the language but declined to preview the decision.\n\nSome NATO members are also reluctant to use the word because Ukraine has yet to implement all of the necessary democratic and anti-corruption reforms necessary for membership, a separate US official said.\n\nWith the summit about a month away, the topic remains a central point of tension in ongoing conversations.\n\n\"Most Central European countries are disappointed by the Biden administration's ambiguity and procrastination\" when it comes to outlining a concrete pathway forward for Ukraine, a Central European diplomat told CNN.\n\nA second European official whose country is more aggressive on Ukraine's membership than the US said that European allies have been directly lobbying the White House to make Ukraine's pathway as clear as possible.\n\n\"We instinctively feel a new path should be laid out,\" the second official said. \"Fast tracking [Ukraine's membership] should be looked at.\"\n\nIn April, Stoltenberg told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv that \"the work we are undertaking now puts you on an irreversible path towards NATO membership, so that when the time is right, Ukraine can become a NATO member straightaway.\"\n\nStill, there is a general recognition that NATO's position out of the summit needs to have advanced from last year's meeting in the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius, when the allies declared that \"Ukraine's future is in NATO\" but didn't offer a timeline. Members of the alliance announced at the time that they would remove the requirement for a Membership Action Plan for Ukraine, making it easier for the country to join the alliance, but still declined to offer a timeline on how long that might take.\n\nThat was met with fury by Zelensky who posted on X that it was \"unprecedented and absurd\" not to have been offered a timeline for membership.\n\nVague commitment in 2008\n\nIt was back in 2008 at a NATO summit in Budapest that Ukraine was first offered a vague commitment of an invitation to join in the future. Ukrainians often invoke the lack of clarity dating back 16 years as an argument for deserving more, particularly when under attack by Russia.\n\n\"I'm certain that we will also have language expressing that Ukraine will become a member of the alliance,\" Stoltenberg said Tuesday at a news conference at the US State Department. \"The exact language, exactly what we will agree ... are now discussed among allies. But I'm confident we have a good solution, agreement by the summit.\"\n\nThe Biden administration has trumpeted its newly signed ten-year defense pact with Ukraine, which calls itself \"a bridge to Ukraine's eventual membership in the NATO Alliance.\"\n\nBut for many Europeans that doesn't go far enough.\n\n\"Of course we'd be for 'irreversible,'\" a third Eastern European official said.\n\nIt's \"not a big secret we are eager to get more\" than the US, the official added, adding they hope the US administration can remain \"flexible\" ahead of the formal meetings next month.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said last week that peace talks would only begin with Ukraine if Kyiv officially gives up on its NATO aspirations.\n\n\"As soon as Kyiv declares that it is ready for such a decision,\" Putin said on Friday, \"an order to cease fire and begin negotiations will immediately follow from our side, literally at the same minute.\"\n\nA key component of NATO membership is a mutual defense pact known as Article V that commits NATO allies to defend any member that is attacked. Ukraine has been intensifying its push to join NATO since it was first attacked by Russia in 2014.\n\nSince the war in Ukraine began in 2022, Ukrainian and European officials have accused the US of being too afraid of provoking Putin and escalating the conflict. Ukraine has both been grateful and frustrated as it watched the US offer bigger and bigger weapons packages, but at a slower pace than it has needed.\n\nLast month Stoltenberg indirectly criticized the Biden administration for not allowing Ukraine to use US weapons to fire into Russia, which Ukrainians have said amounts to them fighting with one hand tied behind their back.\n\n\"This is a war of aggression by Russia against Ukraine,\" Stoltenberg told The Economist. \"Ukraine has the right to defend themselves. And that includes striking targets on Russian territory.\"\n\nOn May 30 the Biden administration announced that Ukraine could fire into Russia but only in a limited way: at military targets across the border from the city of Kharkiv and not with the most formidable US weapons, the long-range ATACMS missile.\n\nLondon has often been much more forward-leaning than Washington on weaponry for Ukraine and how it's used. Generally, throughout the conflict, British officials, the closest US allies in NATO, have consistently hoped the White House would take a more aggressive stance.\n\nOfficials who CNN spoke with emphasized that when it comes to the NATO communique that no decisions have been made yet and the language is still actively under discussion ahead of the summit.\n\n\"When the text is on the table and the countries start to negotiate we can see the full picture,\" the Eastern European official said. \"We are ready to negotiate; of course we would like to have it be as ambitious as possible.\"\n\nCNN's Jennifer Hansler contributed reporting.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kylie_atwood@cnn.com", "name": "Kylie Atwood",

Join us in this fight.\n\nChina should face consequences for its continued support of Russia amidst the ongoing war with Ukraine, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on June 17.\n\nAlthough China officially maintains a neutral stance on Russia's full-scale war in Ukraine and denies providing lethal aid, Beijing and Moscow continue to strengthen their ties. This was underscored by Putin's visit to Chinese President Xi Jinping in May.\n\n\"Beijing cannot have both,\" Stoltenberg said. \"At some point - unless China changes course - allies must make it pay. There must be consequences.\"\n\nOver the past two years, Stoltenberg said, 90% of Russian microelectronics have come from China. Beijing is also reportedly working to improve the capabilities of Russian satellites.\n\n\"The threats are not regional. China is fomenting the biggest armed conflict in Europe since World War II, and at the same time, it wants to maintain good relations with the West.\"\n\nStoltenberg emphasized the importance of NATO relations with countries in the Indo-Pacific as Russia expands its partnership with China and North Korea. Non-NATO countries such as Japan, Australia, South Korea, and New Zealand will attend the upcoming NATO summit, which is scheduled for July 9-11.\n\nChina has denied giving Russia military assistance in its full-scale against Ukraine. At the same time, the U.S. has previously accused China of giving Russia \"every support behind the scenes\" towards its war in Ukraine, describing its actions as \"destabilizing in the heart of Europe.\"", "source": {"uri": "kyivindependent.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Kyiv Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jens_Stoltenberg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jens Stoltenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_General_of_NATO", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secretary General of NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President of the People's Republic of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xi Jinping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Satellite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_summit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NATO summit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Biochemical", "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Biochemical", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Fine-Chemical_Intermediates", "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Fine-Chemical Intermediates", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2156857286.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659612", "eventUri": "eng-9659612", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-09", "dateEnd": "2024-07-11", "textStart": 1288, "textEnd": 1297}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-17", "textStart": 219, "textEnd": 226}], "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

the Ukraine war, and says it is not sending lethal assistance to either side, unlike the United States and other Western nations.\n\nOn Tuesday Beijing said NATO \"should engage in self-reflection rather than arbitrary smears and attacks on China\".\n\nDomestically, Russian President Vladimir Putin has framed the 2022 invasion as a defensive move against an expanding NATO.\n\n\"We advise (NATO) to stop shifting blame and sowing discord, not add fuel to the fire and instigate confrontation, but rather do something practical for the political settlement of the crisis,\" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said at a regular press briefing.\n\nChina and Russia's strategic partnership has only grown closer since the invasion of Ukraine, but Beijing has rebuffed Western claims that it is aiding Moscow's war effort.\n\nIt has however offered a critical lifeline to Russia's isolated economy, with trade booming since the conflict began.\n\nAnd G7 foreign ministers on Friday expressed \"strong concern\" about transfers of dual use materials and weapons components from Chinese businesses to Russia being used by Moscow for its military expansion.\n\nChina steered clear of a weekend summit in Switzerland promoted by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that reaffirmed Kyiv's demands for Russia to leave Ukrainian territory for any peace to be won.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping \"has tried to create the impression that he is taking a back seat in this conflict, to avoid sanctions and keep trade flowing,\" Stoltenberg said Monday on a visit to Washington.\n\n\"But the reality is that China is fuelling the largest armed conflict in Europe since World War II,\" he said, warning that \"at some point... there should be consequences\".\n\nNATO next month celebrates its 75th anniversary with a summit in Washington that aims to send a decisive long-term message of support for Ukraine ahead of President Joe Biden's re-election fight against Republican candidate Donald Trump.\n\n\"The more credible our long-term support, the quicker Moscow will realise it cannot wait us out,\" Stoltenberg said.\n\n\"It may seem like a paradox, but the path to peace is more weapons

This call was a response to NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg's assertions that China was exacerbating the crisis by supplying technology to Russia. This exchange highlights the escalating geopolitical tensions and the differing narratives surrounding the conflict between Western powers and China.\n\nLin Jian, a spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry, addressed the issue during a regular press briefing. He emphasized that China has consistently positioned itself as a neutral entity in the Ukraine conflict, advocating for peace and dialogue. \"What NATO should do is self-reflection, not arbitrary smear and attack China,\" Lin stated. He reiterated that China is neither a creator nor a participant in the Ukraine crisis and highlighted the international community's recognition of China's \"objective and impartial position\" and its \"constructive role.\"\n\nLin's comments reflect Beijing's frustration with what it perceives as unfounded accusations from NATO and other Western entities. He called for NATO to focus on contributing to a political settlement of the crisis rather than exacerbating tensions. \"We urge the NATO side to stop shifting blame and sowing discord, not fuel the flame and stoke bloc confrontation, but rather do something practical for the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis,\" Lin added.\n\nStoltenberg's remarks, made during a visit to Washington, represented a significant escalation in the rhetoric from the Western alliance. He accused China of exacerbating the conflict through technological support to Russia, a claim echoed by U.S. officials who allege a major export push from China aimed at rebuilding Russia's defense capabilities. Stoltenberg argued that China should face consequences for its actions, drawing attention to Beijing's substantial trade relations with Moscow, which have surged since the onset of the war.\n\n\"China presents itself as a neutral party in the Ukraine war, and says it is not sending lethal assistance to either side, unlike the United States and other Western nations,\" Stoltenberg noted. However, he contended that China's support, even if not explicitly military, has been crucial in sustaining Russia's war effort. \"At some point... there should be consequences,\" Stoltenberg warned.\n\nChina's relationship with Russia has grown notably closer since the invasion of Ukraine. This strategic partnership, while beneficial for both countries, has drawn criticism from the West. Despite allegations of aiding Moscow's war effort, Beijing has consistently denied providing lethal assistance. Nonetheless, the economic ties between the two nations have provided Russia with a critical economic lifeline amidst Western sanctions.\n\nTrade between China and Russia has flourished, with Chinese businesses allegedly supplying dual-use materials and weapons components to Russia. These materials, although not directly classified as military equipment, can be utilized for military purposes, thereby supporting Russia's military operations indirectly. This dual-use technology transfer has raised alarms in Western capitals, prompting calls for stricter scrutiny and potential sanctions.\n\nThe G7 foreign ministers recently expressed \"strong concern\" over the transfer of dual-use materials from Chinese businesses to Russia. This concern underscores the broader apprehension within the international community about the nature of China's involvement in the conflict. However, Beijing's official stance remains one of neutrality and advocacy for peace.\n\nChina's absence from a recent summit in Switzerland, organized by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, further highlights the complexities of its position. The summit reaffirmed Kyiv's demands for Russia to withdraw from Ukrainian territory, a stance that China has not openly supported. Chinese President Xi Jinping has sought to maintain a delicate balance, projecting an image of non-involvement to avoid sanctions and preserve economic ties with the West.\n\nAs NATO prepares to celebrate its 75th anniversary with a summit in Washington, the alliance is expected to reaffirm its long-term support for Ukraine. Stoltenberg emphasized the importance of sustained military aid to Ukraine, arguing that such support is crucial for achieving peace. \"The more credible our long-term support, the quicker Moscow will realise it cannot wait us out,\" Stoltenberg stated. \"It may seem like a paradox, but the path to peace is more weapons for Ukraine,\" he added.\n\nThis assertion reflects a fundamental divergence in the approaches of NATO and China to the Ukraine crisis. While NATO advocates for increased military support to force a resolution, China calls for diplomatic efforts and negotiations. This dichotomy illustrates the broader geopolitical struggle between Western and non-Western powers, each promoting different pathways to peace and stability.\n\nIn conclusion, the exchange between NATO and China over the Ukraine crisis highlights the intricate and often contentious nature of international diplomacy. As the conflict drags on, the differing perspectives of key global players will continue to shape the course of events, with significant implications for global security and stability.", "source":

Unlike the West, China has not directly provided countless aid packages to Russia, but China has kept trade open and exchanged technology with Moscow. Stoltenberg believes China must face \"consequences\" for not aligning with NATO.\n\nThe West is theoretically not at war with Russia or China. NATO is on the offensive, completely stepping over boundaries and harassing foreign nations to instigate World War III. Then they tell the public and mainstream media to announce that they are merely protecting their own people from our enemies who have done absolutely nothing to earn such a title.\n\nUnder this line of thinking, the NATO alliance could punish anyone who dissents from their global autocratic authority. \"Beijing cannot have it both ways. At some point -- and unless China changes course -- allies need to impose a cost. There should be consequences,\" Stoltenberg said at the Wilson Center in Washington. He honed in on China trading microelectronics with Russia that has improved Russia's satellite proficiencies. China and Russia have agreed to an open partnership, yet China is not involved in this war.\n\nShould NATO also punish India, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, and others for continuing to trade with Russia? NATO has absolutely no authority to demand that other nations shun Russia from the global economy. They know that these proposed sanctions would not deter China from conducting business with Russia. Instead, these \"consequences\" will cause China and all other non-NATO nations to back away from trading with the West entirely. Will they do the same to nations who continue to trade with China once they redirect their focus to Taiwan? Will they force \"consequences\" upon nations who do not support Israel?\n\nThe Neocons are decimating the economies of western nations by deterring trade. There is no common sense in the boardrooms as the only objective is to fan the flames of war by any means necessary. China already stepped away from Western trade in a major way and now they are actively provoking China to take retaliatory measures.\n\nNATO has zero reason to back Ukraine on paper as it is not a member. They do not plan to offer Ukraine membership at the upcoming Washington summit, but Stoltenberg said they will place the framework to \"build a bridge\" to future membership. Stoltenberg congratulated NATO members for contributing more to the alliance this year than ever before.

At some point -- and unless China changes course -- allies need to impose a cost. There should be consequences,\" he added.\n\nChina argues that it is not sending lethal assistance to either side -- unlike the United States and other Western nations.\n\nBeijing steered clear of a weekend summit in Switzerland promoted by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that reaffirmed Kyiv's demands for Russia to leave Ukrainian territory for any peace.\n\nRussia has insisted that it is interested in talks, but has demanded Ukrainian forces to withdraw from territory seized by Moscow.\n\nTrump -- who in the past has voiced admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin -- has boasted that he can quickly end the war, likely by pressing Ukraine to accept demands.\n\nIn an unstated effort to \"Trump-proof\" future efforts, Stoltenberg wants the Washington summit both to put NATO in the lead of coordination on Ukraine and to set up a way for long-term military support.\n\n\"The more credible our long-term support, the quicker Moscow will realize it cannot wait us out,\" he said.\n\n\"It may seem like a paradox, but the path to peace is more weapons for Ukraine.\"\n\nThe US Congress in April approved some $60 billion in new military funding for Ukraine but only after months of delay due to political fighting and opposition by some of Trump's Republican allies.", "source": {"uri": "tbsnews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Business Standard"}, "authors": [],

What happens in Europe matters for Asia, what happens in Asia matters for us. This is clearly demonstrated in Ukraine where Iran, North Korea, and China are fueling Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine,\" Stoltenberg said.\n\nStoltenberg expressed concern about Russia's potential support for North Korea's missile and nuclear programs. He highlighted China's role in propping NATO to strengthen ties in the Asia-Pacific amid Putin's visit to North Korea up Russia's war economy. In response, NATO intends to strengthen partnerships with Asia-Pacific partners at the upcoming NATO summit in Washington to address the linked challenges faced in Europe, Asia, and the Asia-Pacific.\n\n\"I fully agree that China cannot have it both ways. They cannot continue to have normal trade relationships with countries in Europe and at the same time fuel the biggest war we have seen in Europe since the Second world war. This has to have consequences for China,\" he said.\n\nSecretary Blinken commented on President Putin's travels to North Korea, emphasizing Russia's desperate attempts to strengthen relations with countries that can supply it with resources necessary for its ongoing war against Ukraine.\n\nHe noted that North Korea is providing significant munitions and other weapons to Russia, while Iran is supplying drones and other armaments used against civilians and infrastructure in Ukraine.\n\nAdditionally, Blinken expressed deep concerns about China, not for supplying weapons directly, but for supporting Russia's defense industry, enabling the production of more tanks, munitions, and missiles.\n\n\"The fastest way to end the war [in Ukraine] is for Putin to be disabused of the notion that he can outlast Ukraine and all of Ukraine's supporters but also if he knows that the fuel he needs for his war machine won't be there anymore,\" Blinken said, referring to China, North Korea and Iran, supporting Russia's military efforts.\n\nRegarding Ukraine, Stoltenberg mentioned that NATO is discussing many military deliverables for Ukraine before the upcoming summit. They have already agreed on a plan for NATO training and security assistance for Ukraine, and new announcements of more military support are upcoming.\n\nOn 17 June, US National Security Communications Advisor John Kirbyy stated that Putin's visit to North Korea is \"an attempt to flirt with autocracies.\" He noted that the relations between these countries threaten not only Ukrainian civilians suffering from North Korean ballistic missiles launched by Russia but it also affects the security of the Korean Peninsula as a whole.", "source": {"uri": "euromaidanpress.com", "dataType":

This has to stop.\"\n\nHe again called for China to face \"consequences\" if it keeps backing Russia. It is \"too early to say\" what kind of consequences China should face for supporting Russia, Stoltenberg said, but added that China \"cannot continue to have normal trade relationships with Europe.\"\n\n\"Unless China changes its behavior, it has to be addressed,\" Stoltenberg said.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said in response to Stoltenberg's comments that NATO should \"reflect on itself, rather than attack China.\"\n\nLin blamed NATO for Russia's war of aggression in Ukraine and said the \"relevant parties\" should \"stop deflecting the blame and sowing discord.\"\n\nBlinken and Stoltenberg referred to security as global and emphasized the importance of strengthening Indo-Pacific partnerships at the upcoming NATO summit, scheduled to take place in Washington on July 9-11.\n\nBlinken echoed the words of Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and said, \"What's happening in Ukraine today may well be happening in East Asia tomorrow.\"\n\nStoltenberg and Blinken also mentioned Russian President Vladimir Putin's June 17-18 visit to North Korea, the first such visit from a Russian head of state in 24 years.\n\nBlinken condemned North Korea for providing \"significant munitions to Russia for use in Ukraine.\"\n\nStoltenberg said NATO was \"concerned about the potential support that Russia provides to North Korea

It is a significant move for several reasons. In concrete terms, the main aim is for NATO to take the lead on coordinating both the delivery of weapons and the training of Ukrainian soldiers. Until now, the United States has led in these areas. The shift of responsibility from the U.S. to NATO may seem a minor detail given Washington's unaltered status as the most important member of the defensive alliance. Nevertheless, the change is significant, in view of the impending threat of a second Donald Trump presidency, and the ex-president's frequent insults and threats to withdraw the U.S. from NATO. While such a drastic scenario remains unlikely, even in the event of Trump's reelection, putting supranational institutions in charge of the framework for assisting Ukraine, thereby also rendering the system Trump-proof, is indeed a sensible measure. It is also consistent with President Joe Biden's stated aim at the G7 summit that aid to Ukraine should be less beholden to U.S. domestic politics. Of course, this would not do anything to stop Trump cutting back on funding, but that's a different issue.\n\nThe concerns raised when the plan was introduced as NATO's \"Ukraine mission\" do not warrant much attention. The German government immediately objected to the label because it wanted to clarify there was no NATO mission in Ukraine and thus avoid generating grist for Russian war propaganda. Not an unreasonable objection in itself. Yet, it also showed that Berlin appeared to mistake Moscow for an adversary sensible to finer diplomatic details, as opposed to the propaganda machine and self-declared denier of facts that it is. If the Kremlin or the Russian Ministry of Defense wants to protest about something, it will come right out and do so, no matter what Brussels or Berlin have decided to call a particular initiative.\n\nMoscow's Fantasy War with the West\n\nStoltenberg's plan to strengthen support for Ukraine through NATO, on the other hand, is precisely the right way to deal with the constant threats from Moscow. Every step to bolster and unite NATO in supporting Ukraine ultimately enhances NATO's deterrence and defense posture.\n\nNotwithstanding the prolific output of the Russian propaganda mill fabricating its fantasy war with the West, the stakes of mounting an attack on any member of the alliance remain as high as ever for Moscow. The more NATO undertakes substantive activities, particularly along its Eastern flank, the less likely Russia will be tempted to test the strength of NATO members' collective resolve.\n\nAccording to Stoltenberg, closer cooperation among NATO members could also lead to sharing the long-term costs of supporting Ukraine, together with a more determined response to Russia's current hybrid warfare, most notably its acts of sabotage and cyberattacks. Many individual member states still appear not to have fully grasped the gravity of these proliferating attacks. Consequently, it has never been more important that NATO, for one, recognizes how serious they are.", "source": {"uri": "watchingamerica.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Watching America"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_General_of_NATO", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secretary General of NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jens_Stoltenberg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jens Stoltenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Propaganda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supranational_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supranational union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Germany", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet of Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberattack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cyberattack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_states_of_NATO", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member states of NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moscow Kremlin"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_(Russia)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defence (Russia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabotage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sabotage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659612", "eventUri": "eng-9659612", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

"body": "Outgoing Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, who on Thursday sealed the race to be the next head of NATO, will take the reins of the Western military alliance at a perilous moment.\n\nWith Russia's war in Ukraine raging through a third year, leading power the United States set for a crunch election, and China rising, NATO is grappling with major challenges.\n\nHere are the key issues set to fill Rutte's in-tray when he is expected to take over in October:\n\nLooming over the 32-nation alliance is the potential return of former US president Donald Trump to the White House after November elections.\n\nThe volatile ex-reality TV star reportedly mulled withdrawing the United States from NATO during his first term -- and threatened not to protect allies that do not spend enough on defence.\n\nOutgoing NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg was credited with averting a major crisis that could have seen the magnate blow a hole in the alliance.\n\nShould Trump be elected, Rutte will need all the diplomatic skill he acquired during more than 13 years in charge of the Netherlands to ward off any weakening of Washington's role.\n\nEuropean allies will be informally war-gaming options to try to steward Trump and have already been showcasing their increased spending to keep him on board.\n\nWhile the threat from Trump may not come to pass, one inescapable reality will be the situation on the battlefield in Ukraine.\n\nNATO countries -- spearheaded by the United States -- have provided 99 percent of the foreign military aid that has helped keep Kyiv's forces in the fight since 2022.\n\nAs the war drags on towards its fourth year, Rutte will have a key role in rallying Kyiv's backers to make sure support does not dry up.\n\nNATO at its summit in Washington is set to take over a greater role in coordinating arms deliveries -- and wants countries to make a long-term pledge.\n\nKyiv at the same time is also pushing for membership of NATO.\n\nThe United States and Germany have blocked any concrete progress on that front -- but pressure looks likely to grow in the coming years.\n\nBalancing the expectations from Ukraine against the reluctance of leading allies will be a major task.\n\nRegardless of how the war in Ukraine pans out, NATO allies say they are likely to face a threat from Russia for decades to come.\n\nLast year the alliance signed off on its most comprehensive defence plans since the end of the Cold War, aimed at stopping any potential attack by Moscow.\n\nWhile officials insist the combined might of NATO could currently defeat a Russian military weakened by the Ukraine war, the Kremlin is already looking to rebuild its forces.\n\nRutte's core task will be to try to make sure NATO is ready while seeing tensions do not spill over into a possible nuclear conflict with Russia.\n\nSome allies estimate Russia could be prepping for a potential war with the alliance within a decade.\n\nThat gives NATO countries a shrinking window of opportunity to plug the gaps in key weaponry and personnel they need to put the new plans into action.\n\nTop of the list are air defences, longer-range missiles, and making sure there are ample

In April it issued a plan to reach 1.76% by 2030.\n\nOther NATO members \"are concerned about the fiscal balance, they want to spend money on health (and) education\" he said, adding that \"if we're not able to preserve peace, then what we do on health and climate change and education ... will fail\".\n\n(Reporting by David Ljunggren; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com",

Rutte at NATO?", "body": "Brussels (Belgium) (AFP) - Outgoing Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, who on Thursday sealed the race to be the next head of NATO, will take the reins of the Western military alliance at a perilous moment.\n\nWith Russia's war in Ukraine raging through a third year, leading power the United States set for a crunch election, and China rising, NATO is grappling with major challenges.\n\nHere are the key issues set to fill Rutte's in-tray when he is expected to take over in October:\n\nTrump 2.0?\n\nLooming over the 32-nation alliance is the potential return of former US president Donald Trump to the White House after November elections.\n\nThe volatile ex-reality TV star reportedly mulled withdrawing the United States from NATO during his first term -- and threatened not to protect allies that do not spend enough on defence.\n\nOutgoing NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg was credited with averting a major crisis that could have seen the magnate blow a hole in the alliance.\n\nShould Trump be elected, Rutte will need all the diplomatic skill he acquired during more than 13 years in charge of the Netherlands to ward off any weakening of Washington's role.\n\nEuropean allies will be informally war-gaming options to try to steward Trump and have already been showcasing their increased spending to keep him on board.\n\nKeep Ukraine going\n\nWhile the threat from Trump may not come to pass, one inescapable reality will be the situation on the battlefield in Ukraine.\n\nNATO countries -- spearheaded by the United States -- have provided 99 percent of the foreign military aid that has helped keep Kyiv's forces in the fight since 2022.\n\nAs the war drags on towards its fourth year, Rutte will have a key role in rallying Kyiv's backers to make sure support does not dry up.\n\nNATO at its summit in Washington is set to take over a greater role in coordinating arms deliveries -- and wants countries to make a long-term pledge.\n\nKyiv at the same time is also pushing for membership of NATO.\n\nThe United States and Germany have blocked any concrete progress on that front -- but pressure looks likely to grow in the coming years.\n\nBalancing the expectations from Ukraine against the reluctance of leading allies will be a major task.\n\nFit to fight Russia?\n\nRegardless of how the war in Ukraine pans out, NATO allies say they are likely to face a threat from Russia for decades to come.\n\nLast year the alliance signed off on its most comprehensive defence plans since the end of the Cold War, aimed at stopping any potential attack by Moscow.\n\nWhile officials insist the combined might of NATO could currently defeat a Russian military weakened by the Ukraine war, the Kremlin is already looking to rebuild its forces.\n\nRutte's core task will be to try to make sure NATO is ready while seeing tensions do not spill over into a possible nuclear conflict with Russia.\n\nSome allies estimate Russia could be prepping for a potential war with the alliance within a decade.\n\nThat gives NATO countries a shrinking window of opportunity to plug the gaps in key weaponry and personnel they need to put the new plans into action.\n\nTop of the list are air defences, longer-range missiles, and making sure there are ample stocks of staples like artillery shells.\n\nAs the conflict in Ukraine has exposed, Western firms were ill-prepared to meet the demands of a full-scale war after decades of underinvestment.\n\nProduction has begun to ramp up but Rutte will have to keep the pressure on to make sure industry is fit for purpose -- and allies keep buying what is required.\n\nA decade after NATO set a target for allies to spend two percent of their gross domestic product on defence, only 23 hit that bar this year.\n\nThe new NATO boss will have to corral the laggards to make good on the target and make sure others do not slip back.\n\nAnd there are already calls for the alliance to go even further and considerably ratchet up its spending beyond the current two-percent floor.\n\nFor notoriously frugal Dutchman Rutte -- who only got the Netherlands to the target in his last year in office -- that could be a hard sell.\n\nChina threat\n\nFurther afield, NATO eyes are also increasingly drawn to another potent rival: China.\n\nWhile the alliance is bound in its founding treaty to the Euro-Atlantic area, Washington has increasingly been pushing allies to pay more attention to the risks posed by Beijing.\n\nChina's burgeoning partnership with Russia has propelled the threat in the minds of many European allies and seen NATO build up ties with allies such as Japan, South Korea and Australia.\n\nBut some -- notably France -- remain wary of diverting NATO's attention away from its principal theatre and the new NATO chief will have to perform a careful balancing act.", "source": {"uri": "rfi.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "RFI"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

to Putin: what key challenges face Rutte at NATO?", "body": "Outgoing Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, who on Thursday sealed the race to be the next head of NATO, will take the reins of the Western military alliance at a perilous moment.\n\nWith Russia's war in Ukraine raging through a third year, leading power the United States set for a crunch election, and China rising, NATO is grappling with major challenges.\n\nHere are the key issues set to fill Rutte's in-tray when he is expected to take over in October:\n\n- Trump 2.0? -\n\nLooming over the 32-nation alliance is the potential return of former US president Donald Trump to the White House after November elections.\n\nThe volatile ex-reality TV star reportedly mulled withdrawing the United States from NATO during his first term -- and threatened not to protect allies that do not spend enough on defence.\n\nOutgoing NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg was credited with averting a major crisis that could have seen the magnate blow a hole in the alliance.\n\nShould Trump be elected, Rutte will need all the diplomatic skill he acquired during more than 13 years in charge of the Netherlands to ward off any weakening of Washington's role.\n\nEuropean allies will be informally war-gaming options to try to steward Trump and have already been showcasing their increased spending to keep him on board.\n\n- Keep Ukraine going -\n\nWhile the threat from Trump may not come to pass, one inescapable reality will be the situation on the battlefield in Ukraine.\n\nNATO countries -- spearheaded by the United States -- have provided 99 percent of the foreign military aid that has helped keep Kyiv's forces in the fight since 2022.\n\nAs the war drags on towards its fourth year, Rutte will have a key role in rallying Kyiv's backers to make sure support does not dry up.\n\nNATO at its summit in Washington is set to take over a greater role in coordinating arms deliveries -- and wants countries to make a long-term pledge.\n\nKyiv at the same time is also pushing for membership of NATO.\n\nThe United States and Germany have blocked any concrete progress on that front -- but pressure looks likely to grow in the coming years.\n\nBalancing the expectations from Ukraine against the reluctance of leading allies will be a major task.\n\n- Fit to fight Russia? -\n\nRegardless of how the war in Ukraine pans out, NATO allies say they are likely to face a threat from Russia for decades to come.\n\nLast year the alliance signed off on its most comprehensive defence plans since the end of the Cold War, aimed at stopping any potential attack by Moscow.\n\nWhile officials insist the combined might of NATO could currently defeat a Russian military weakened by the Ukraine war, the Kremlin is already looking to rebuild its forces.\n\nRutte's core task will be to try to make sure NATO is ready while seeing tensions do not spill over into a possible nuclear conflict with Russia.\n\nSome allies estimate Russia could be prepping for a potential war with the alliance within a decade.\n\nThat gives NATO countries a shrinking window of opportunity to plug the gaps in key weaponry and personnel they need to put the new plans into action.\n\nTop of the list are air defences, longer-range missiles, and making sure there are ample stocks of staples like artillery shells.\n\nAs the conflict in Ukraine has exposed, Western firms were ill-prepared to meet the demands of a full-scale war after decades of underinvestment.\n\nProduction has begun to ramp up but Rutte will have to keep the pressure on to make sure industry is fit for purpose -- and allies keep buying what is required.\n\n- Money matters -\n\nAll that will take cash -- and lots of it.\n\nA decade after NATO set a target for allies to spend two percent of their gross domestic product on defence, only 23 hit that bar this year.\n\nThe new NATO boss will have to corral the laggards to make good on the target and make sure others do not slip back.\n\nAnd there are already calls for the alliance to go even further and considerably ratchet up its spending beyond the current two-percent floor.\n\nFor notoriously frugal Dutchman Rutte -- who only got the Netherlands to the target in his last year in office -- that could be a hard sell.\n\n- China threat -\n\nFurther afield, NATO eyes are also increasingly drawn to another potent rival: China.\n\nWhile the alliance is bound in its founding treaty to the Euro-Atlantic area, Washington has increasingly been pushing allies to pay more attention to the risks posed by Beijing.\n\nChina's burgeoning partnership with Russia has propelled the threat in the minds of many European allies and seen NATO build up ties with allies such as Japan, South Korea and Australia.\n\nBut some -- notably France -- remain wary of diverting NATO's attention away from its principal theatre and the new NATO chief will have to perform a careful balancing act.\n\ndel/ec/rlp\n\nMore from this section\n\nOne Man's Tragedy Becomes a Treasure: Announcing the Release of 'Concrete Dreams'\n\nStack Sports and The Fellowship of Christian Athletes (FCA) Renew

At some point -- and unless China changes course -- allies need to impose a cost. There should be consequences,\" Stoltenberg said at the Wilson Center.\n\nChina denies sending lethal assistance to either side, unlike the United States and other Western nations. It avoided a recent summit in Switzerland where Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reiterated demands for Russia to withdraw from Ukrainian territory.\n\nAmid concerns about future US support, particularly if former President Donald Trump wins reelection, Stoltenberg emphasized the need for long-term military backing for Ukraine. He believes that robust support will show Moscow that it cannot outlast Western resolve.\n\n\"The more credible our long-term support, the quicker Moscow will realize it cannot wait us out,\" Stoltenberg said, adding that \"the path to peace is more weapons for Ukraine.\"\n\nThe US Congress recently approved $60 billion in new military funding for Ukraine, following delays caused by political disputes and opposition from some Trump allies.", "source": {"uri": "tribune.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Express Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jens_Stoltenberg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jens Stoltenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_General_of_NATO", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secretary General of NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson_International_Center_for_Scholars", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xi Jinping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Screenshot-2024-06-18-0955451718686567-0/Screenshot-2024-06-18-0955451718686567-0.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659612", "eventUri": "eng-9659612", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

Minister Mark Rutte, who on Thursday sealed the race to be the next head of NATO, will take the reins of the Western military alliance at a perilous moment.\n\nWith Russia's war in Ukraine raging through a third year, leading power the United States set for a crunch election, and China rising, NATO is grappling with major challenges.\n\nHere are the key issues set to fill Rutte's in-tray when he is expected to take over in October:\n\n- Trump 2.0? -\n\nLooming over the 32-nation alliance is the potential return of former US president Donald Trump to the White House after November elections.\n\nThe volatile ex-reality TV star reportedly mulled withdrawing the United States from NATO during his first term -- and threatened not to protect allies that do not spend enough on defence.\n\nOutgoing NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg was credited with averting a major crisis that could have seen the magnate blow a hole in the alliance.\n\nShould Trump be elected, Rutte will need all the diplomatic skill he acquired during more than 13 years in charge of the Netherlands to ward off any weakening of Washington's role.\n\nEuropean allies will be informally war-gaming options to try to steward Trump and have already been showcasing their increased spending to keep him on board.\n\n- Keep Ukraine going -\n\nWhile the threat from Trump may not come to pass, one inescapable reality will be the situation on the battlefield in Ukraine.\n\nNATO countries -- spearheaded by the United States -- have provided 99 percent of the foreign military aid that has helped keep Kyiv's forces in the fight since 2022.\n\nAs the war drags on towards its fourth year, Rutte will have a key role in rallying Kyiv's backers to make sure support does not dry up.\n\nNATO at its summit in Washington is set to take over a greater role in coordinating arms deliveries -- and wants countries to make a long-term pledge.\n\nKyiv at the same time is also pushing for membership of NATO.\n\nThe United States and Germany have blocked any concrete progress on that front -- but pressure looks likely to grow in the coming years.\n\nBalancing the expectations from Ukraine against the reluctance of leading allies will be a major task.\n\n- Fit to fight Russia? -\n\nRegardless of how the war in Ukraine pans out, NATO allies say they are likely to face a threat from Russia for decades to come.\n\nLast year the alliance signed off on its most comprehensive defence plans since the end of the Cold War, aimed at stopping any potential attack by Moscow.\n\nWhile officials insist the combined might of NATO could currently defeat a Russian military weakened by the Ukraine war, the Kremlin is already looking to rebuild its forces.\n\nRutte's core task will be to try to make sure NATO is ready while seeing tensions do not spill over into a possible nuclear conflict with Russia.\n\nSome allies estimate Russia could be prepping for a potential war with the alliance within a decade.\n\nThat gives NATO countries a shrinking window of opportunity to plug the gaps in key weaponry and personnel they need to put the new plans into action.\n\nTop of the list are air defences, longer-range missiles, and making sure there are ample stocks of staples like artillery shells.\n\nAs the conflict in Ukraine has exposed, Western firms were ill-prepared to meet the demands of a full-scale war after decades of underinvestment.\n\nProduction has begun to ramp up but Rutte will have to keep the pressure on to make sure industry is fit for purpose -- and allies keep buying what is required.\n\nA decade after NATO set a target for allies to spend two percent of their gross domestic product on defence, only 23 hit that bar this year.\n\nThe new NATO boss will have to corral the laggards to make good on the target and make sure others do not slip back.\n\nAnd there are already calls for the alliance to go even further and considerably ratchet up its spending beyond the current two-percent floor.\n\nFor notoriously frugal Dutchman Rutte -- who only got the Netherlands to the target in his last year in office -- that could be a hard sell.\n\n- China threat -\n\nFurther afield, NATO eyes are also increasingly drawn to another potent rival: China.\n\nWhile the alliance is bound in its founding treaty to the Euro-Atlantic area, Washington has increasingly been pushing allies to pay more attention to the risks posed by Beijing.\n\nChina's burgeoning partnership with Russia has propelled the threat in the minds of many European allies and seen NATO build up ties with allies such as Japan, South Korea and Australia.\n\nBut some -- notably France -- remain wary of diverting NATO's attention away from its principal theatre and the new NATO chief will have to perform a careful balancing act.", "source": {"uri": "today.rtl.lu", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTL Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Rutte", "type": "person", "score":

I will miss you.\n\nYou know, I believe this is one of the most important moments for Europe since World War II. I think you do too. NATO was founded 75 years ago and - I think the lessons we've learned then and to stand together to defend and deter aggression have been consequential.\n\nAnd we have made NATO - you - under your leadership - - we have made it bigger, stronger and more united than ever. So, I want to thank you, Mr. Secretary General, for the extraordinary work you have done.\n\nTogether, we deterred further Russian aggression in Europe. I think we - well, I know we've welcomed Finland and Sweden into the Alliance. And we have strengthened NATO's eastern flank, making it clear that we defend every inch of NATO territory well.\n\nAnd, Jens, we - a very important announcement to make today: A record number of allies are meeting NATO's commitment of at least 2 percent of their GDP on defense. And, in fact, the number has doubled since we took office - since I took office.\n\nAnd I'm looking forward to building on all of that progress next month when we have the 75th meeting here in Washington.\n\nAnd I look forward to our discussion today.\n\nSo I want to thank you for being here. We have a lot to talk about. And I mean honestly, you've been amazing. I only wish you to extend your mandate for another 10 years.\n\nPresident Biden, dear Joe, thank you so much for your kind words - the words. And thank you very much for your personal commitment to NATO, to our Transatlantic Alliance.\n\nAnd, also, many thanks for hosting the NATO Summit here in Washington, DC, next month. At that summit, we will celebrate the 75th anniversary of the most successful alliance in history, but we will also make important decisions about the future - not least on the issue and importance of investing in our security.\n\nAnd today, we are able to release new figures on defense spending. They show that across Europe and Canada, NATO allies are increasing defense spending by 18 percent this year. This is the largest increase in decades. And 23 allies will spend 2 percent of GDP or more on defense this year. This is more than twice as much as four years ago and shows that the European Allies and Canada are indeed stepping up and taking up their share of shared responsibility to protect all of us in the NATO Alliance.\n\nIt is also important for the United States to know that much of this money is actually spent here in the United States. Allies are buying more and more equipment from the US So NATO is good for US security, but NATO is also good for US jobs.\n\nMr. President, and I also thank you for your strong leadership in Ukraine. And congratulations on the bilateral security agreement you signed with President Zelenskyy, with Ukraine.\n\nEuropean allies are also stepping up and matching US contributions, military support for Ukraine. And I expect that when we meet here next month, we will agree to have NATO in the lead role in providing security assistance and training and also that the Allies will agree to increase financial and military support for Ukraine . This will reduce the burden on the United States and strengthen our support for Ukraine.\n\nI think it's important to understand that the stronger our support for Ukraine is, the sooner this war can end, because the sooner President Putin realizes that he can't wait for us.\n\nIt is in -- supporting Ukraine is not charity.

Keep in mind Putin's objective from day one was to erase Ukraine from the map, to ends its existence as an independent country, to subsume it into Russia. That has failed.\n\nBut going forward, we want to make sure that Ukraine is a success, that it stands strongly on its own feet militarily, economically, democratically, and that's exactly what we're enabling Ukraine to do. And that is the mark of success going forward. Again, decisions that will be made at the [NATO] summit will further that effort, and more to be said in a few weeks' time.\"\n\nDetails: Blinken said the US is working to expedite the arrival of US-supplied aid to the front in Ukraine. He also expressed that it is \"very effective in terms of stabilising the front lines and making sure that the Russians could be stopped in their offensive\", adding that \"what makes the biggest difference is the extraordinary courage and resilience of the Ukrainians themselves\".\n\nHe also noted that new sanctions are being imposed on Russia as necessary \"to keep the pressure up, so that the aggression ultimately ends\".\n\nBlinken also mentioned China's assistance to the Russian military machine.\n\n\"We're looking at countries that are supporting Russia's defence industrial base, which is allowing Russia to continue the war, including China. As President Biden has made clear, we have a real concern not with the - not with weapons being supplied by China to Russia. That's not what they're doing. What they are doing, as you've heard me discuss many times, is providing critical support to Russia's defence industrial base. Some 70 percent of the machine tools that Russia is importing are coming from China; 90 percent of the microelectronics coming from China.

For Stoltenberg, by \"standing together, we prevent war and preserve peace\". Which would sound well and good, except the biggest conflict in Europe since the end of World War II was the elephant standing beside them trumpeting the lie of such claims.\n\nAlthough he meant it in another way, Blinken probably voiced a truth when he thanked Stoltenberg for his 10-year tenure, saying \"This would not have happened without your leadership\".\n\nThe head of NATO has always been a loyal linchpin of the US' warmongering schemes for NATO, as shown by his readiness to echo the US' false propaganda that China is \"fueling Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine\". This is deflection from the real reason the conflict has erupted, which Blinken also inadvertently made clear when he said \"We're growing our defense industrial bases\". Something that the US is compelled to do since that is where its true national security economic dependency lies.\n\nWhich is a primary reason why, contrary to the false-versus-fact revisionism of NATO, Russia's overtures to join the organization were repeatedly rebuffed and it was instead ever more firmly positioned as a threat. It is also why the organization is now adopting the same aggressive posture toward China. Blinken's warning that Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida may have said it best when he remarked \"what's happening in Ukraine today may well be happening in East Asia tomorrow\" was again significant, but not in the way he intended. Stoltenberg loyally playing his part, said that China cannot \"have it both ways\" between the West and Russia, and threatened that if China does not change its course, \"there should be consequences\".\n\nIt is the US and its NATO allies' support that has turned Ukraine into a bloody crucible in which to hammer Russia in a prolonged war of attrition. It is clear that the architects of the conflict also have blueprints drawn up for a similar scenario in Asia. The US continues to fabricate and reinforce wrong perceptions of the root cause of the Ukraine crisis. It has never been genuinely committed to defusing the conflicts.\n\nSmearing China will not help end the Ukraine crisis any sooner. It will only lay bare the hypocrisy of the US-led NATO and show how it is itching to light another fuse in Asia.", "source": {"uri": "chinadaily.com.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "China Daily"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jens_Stoltenberg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jens Stoltenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_General_of_NATO", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secretary General of NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Collective security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterrence_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deterrence theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_revisionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Historical revisionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_aggression", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "War of aggression"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_territory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dependent territory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Propaganda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fumio_Kishida", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fumio Kishida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attrition_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attrition warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "East Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Japan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Tug-of-War", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Tug-of-War", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202406/20/66736d30a31095c551b3b893.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659612", "eventUri": "eng-9659612", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

At some point -- and unless China changes course -- allies need to impose a cost. There should be consequences,\" Stoltenberg added.\n\nIn addition to the 32 members of the Nato alliance, the summit will also bring in four key partners from the Asia-Pacific: Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea.\n\nChina argues that it is not sending lethal assistance to either side -- unlike the United States and other Western nations.\n\nBeijing steered clear of a weekend summit in Switzerland promoted by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that reaffirmed Kyiv's demands for Russia to leave Ukrainian territory for any peace.\n\nStoltenberg said that Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit this week to North Korea, which has supplied shells to Moscow despite being under UN sanctions, further showed how Moscow was \"dependent\" on authoritarian leaders.\n\nTrump -- who in the past has voiced admiration for Putin -- has boasted that he can quickly end the war, likely by pressing Ukraine to accept demands.\n\nTrump has long raged over what he sees as unfairness in Nato, founded to counter the Soviet Union.\n\nOn the campaign trail, he has suggested he would encourage Russia to \"do whatever the hell they want\" if Nato members do not \"pay your bills.\"\n\nIn the Oval Office, Stoltenberg told Biden that 23 of the 32 allies now met a pledge to spend at least two percent of GDP on defense, as the Ukraine invasion brings new security fears to Europe.\n\nA 2014 Nato summit set the funding goal that was then met by only three countries -- the United States, Britain and Greece. Stoltenberg last reported that 20 countries were achieving the target.\n\n\"Nato allies are this year increasing defense spending by 18 percent. That's the biggest increase in decades,\" Stoltenberg said.\n\nIn a sharply different message than Trump, Biden hailed Nato, saying that since it has successfully \"deterred further Russian aggression in Europe\" through its promise to \"defend every inch of NATO territory.\"\n\nIn an unstated bid to \"Trump-proof\" future efforts, Stoltenberg wants the Washington summit to commit the alliance to provide at least 40 billion euros ($43 billion) a year in military aid to Ukraine and to put Nato in charge of coordination.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after his Wilson Center speech, Stoltenberg did not criticize Trump but pointed to the damage done on the battlefront by the delay in Congress approving a $60 billion package for Ukraine.\n\n\"Regardless of who's going to be the next president of the United States,\" Stoltenberg said, \"I believe that we should minimize the risk.\"\n\nStoltenberg, who led Nato throughout Trump's 2017-2021 presidency, said that successive US administrations had \"an absolutely valid point to say that European allies are spending too little.\"\n\n\"The good news is that's changing,\" Stoltenberg said.\n\n\"We're not saying that we are satisfied, but we are in a totally different place now than we were back in 2014,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "thedailystar.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He added that Beijing is also working to provide Moscow with improved satellite capabilities.\n\nQuote: \"President Xi has tried to create the impression that he is taking a back seat in this conflict.

At some point - and unless China changes course - Allies need to impose a cost,\" he said.\n\nStoltenberg also pointed out that the more reliable the long-term support for Ukraine, the sooner Moscow will realise that it cannot wait out the Western countries.\n\n\"It may seem like a paradox, but the path to peace is therefore more weapons for Ukraine,\" Stoltenberg summed up.\n\nBackground:\n\nLast week, the G7 countries announced that they would continue to take measures against entities in China and third countries that materially support the Russian military machine in its war of aggression against Ukraine.\n\nThe US Department of Treasury has identified more than a dozen schemes to evade sanctions against Russia's defence industrial base and has imposed restrictions on more than 90 foreign individuals and companies, primarily from China and T\u00fcrkiye.\n\nThey also announced the expansion of the secondary sanctions mechanism against Russia.\n\nIt

It will be painstakingly debated by the allies in the days leading up and then heavily scrutinized, as it will outline to the world - Russia in particular - what the goals are for Ukraine within NATO.\n\n\"At the summit, we'll be taking concrete steps to bring Ukraine closer to NATO and ensure that there's a bridge to membership, a bridge that's strong and well-lit,\" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at a NATO Foreign Ministerial in Prague in late May.\n\nA senior US official said that Biden administration officials do not think the word \"irreversible\" would get the support of the entire alliance, pointing in particular to Hungary as a likely holdout. The official said the US believes they are close to a resolution with all allies on the language but declined to preview the decision.\n\nSome NATO members are also reluctant to use the word because Ukraine has yet to implement all of the necessary democratic and anti-corruption reforms necessary for membership, a separate US official said.\n\nWith the summit about a month away, the topic remains a central point of tension in ongoing conversations.\n\n\"Most Central European countries are disappointed by the Biden administration's ambiguity and procrastination\" when it comes to outlining a concrete pathway forward for Ukraine, a Central European diplomat told CNN.\n\nA second European official whose country is more aggressive on Ukraine's membership than the US said that European allies have been directly lobbying the White House to make Ukraine's pathway as clear as possible.\n\n\"We instinctively feel a new path should be laid out,\" the second official said. \"Fast tracking [Ukraine's membership] should be looked at.\"\n\nIn April, Stoltenberg told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv that \"the work we are undertaking now puts you on an irreversible path towards NATO membership, so that when the time is right, Ukraine can become a NATO member straightaway.\"\n\nStill, there is a general recognition that NATO's position out of the summit needs to have advanced from last year's meeting in the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius, when the allies declared that \"Ukraine's future is in NATO\" but didn't offer a timeline. Members of the alliance announced at the time that they would remove the requirement for a Membership Action Plan for Ukraine, making it easier for the country to join the alliance, but still declined to offer a timeline on how long that might take.\n\nThat was met with fury by Zelenskyy who posted on X that it was \"unprecedented and absurd\" not to have been offered a timeline for membership.\n\n\"I'm certain that we will also have language expressing that Ukraine will become a member of the alliance,\" Stoltenberg said Tuesday at a news conference at the US State Department. \"The exact language, exactly what we will agree ... are now discussed among allies. But I'm confident we have a good solution, agreement by the summit.\"\n\nThe Biden administration has trumpeted its newly signed ten-year defense pact with Ukraine, which calls itself \"a bridge to Ukraine's eventual membership in the NATO Alliance.\"\n\nBut for many Europeans that doesn't go far enough.\n\n\"Of course we'd be for 'irreversible,\" a third Eastern European official said.\n\nIt's \"not a big secret we are eager to get more\" than the US, the official added, adding they hope the US administration can remain \"flexible\" ahead of the formal meetings next month.\n\nLondon has often been much more forward-leaning than Washington on weaponry for Ukraine and how it's used. Generally, throughout the conflict, British officials, the closest US allies in NATO, have consistently hoped the White House would take a more aggressive stance.", "source": {"uri":

Getting the tone and substance right is vital for internal cohesion amongst member countries but also to send the right signals to Moscow and Beijing.\n\nLast year's summit held in Vilnius achieved marked progress on strengthening alliance defense and deterrence, but acrimony surrounding Kyiv's to receive an invitation to join NATO -- despite significant progress on other fronts -- overshadowed the summit's proceedings.\n\nThis year a successful NATO summit in Washington would demonstrate clear progress on four interrelated fronts -- mission, money, membership and messaging -- with consideration for Ukraine playing a key role in all four.\n\nMission: Boost Deterrence\n\nThe war against Ukraine and the reinvigorated threat perception of Russia has imbued NATO with a new sense of purpose and focus. In the case of the war in Ukraine, there is unanimous consensus that Kyiv must win, even if there's still little international consensus on what \"winning\" means now, in the third year of war. In the case of Russia's threat perception, Moscow's aggression against Ukraine confirmed the worst fears of the eastern members of NATO and reignited, especially amongst Western members, long-dormant awareness of the importance of defense and security in the modern era.\n\nThe Washington summit represents an opportunity to double-down on and strengthen existing trendlines in NATO defense and deterrence. The regional defense plans agreed to at Vilnius form a foundation on which to build, and here progress is vital.\n\nFor example, increased standardization across munitions and attendant increases in interoperability are necessary to increase overall readiness. Reaching concrete agreements on these matters would send a clear signal to Russia about the seriousness of the alliance to see Ukraine through to victory and defend against any future predation.\n\nAccompanying standardization efforts, NATO member-states must reinvigorate Europe's defense industrial base. This means practical action in the form of contracts and other market signals, not simply empty verbal commitments and political statements of intent.\n\nThree years into the war and the defense industrial bases of the United States and Europe are far from performing at the levels necessary for sustained, high-intensity convention war. The reason? Almost exclusively an unwillingness by the private sector to lean forward on necessary investments without clear, actual long-term contracts from governments in Washington and across Europe.\n\nMoney: More, More Consistently\n\nFor NATO, continued forward momentum on meeting the 2 percent of GDP spending is vital to signal to Russia the alliance's commitment to long-term defense and deterrence, but also to offset concerns amongst Republicans in Washington (and President Donald Trump) that Europe isn't spending its fair share. Whether the United Kingdom's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's 2.5 percent commitment becomes a new spending floor, as some have privately suggested it should, is likely a bridge too far for the Washington summit.\n\nFor Ukraine, individual spending packages, like the long-delayed US supplemental are insufficient both to the task at hand and as a symbol of Western commitment. Yes, the resources are important, but the inconsistency of funding -- at least from Washington -- severely complicates Kyiv's mid-term and long-term planning.\n\nIf Kyiv is unsure of whether resources are forthcoming, how can leaders there prepare for future operations? In practice, they cannot. Ukraine needs long-term, multi-year spending packages from NATO member-states to allow Kyiv to plan effectively and to signal to Russia the alliance's resolve. And while the outcome of November's elections in the United States is unclear, Europe must be prepared to step in and step up with such commitments.\n\nMembership: A Path, Well-Considered\n\nThe question of the exact path and timing for Ukraine's accession to NATO will likely remain unresolved and, therefore, expectations on both the part of Kyiv and the broader international community must be shrewdly managed ahead of and during the summit.\n\nThough NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg has said Kyiv is on an \"irreversible path\" towards membership, leaders should use the summit to better explain what that means and, crucially, answer practical questions that remain unresolved. For instance, should Ukraine be allowed to join before the war is over, how does NATO's Article V come into play?\n\nAdditionally, while calls for the introduction of military forces from NATO nations into Ukraine have grown (particularly from France's president, Emanuel Macron), that member-states are thus far reluctant to do so reflects fears of \"what comes next?\" in the event of NATO casualties or Russian escalation.\n\nNATO cannot have it both ways. It cannot be reluctant to introduce NATO forces into Ukraine and unwilling to assume the attendant risk, and at the same time push for Ukraine's membership in the defensive alliance, which carries with it Article Five obligations for mutual defense.\n\nIn Washington, members should demonstrate forward momentum in the process towards eventual accession but stop short of making any definitive commitments or deadlines for doing so. In lieu of that formal invitation, the multiplicity of bilateral defense commitments between member-states and Ukraine will provide both confidence-building measures, but also practical military support, both of which are necessary for Kyiv's defense.\n\nMessaging: We've Got Each Other's Backs\n\nEach of the previous three items carries with it import for the final one: messaging.\n\nFrom support to money to alignment on Ukraine's NATO hopes, the messaging that comes out of the NATO summit must be clear: The alliance is unified. The alliance is resilient. The alliance is focused on the long-term threat that Russia poses to continental security. The alliance will continue to support Ukraine in its defense against Moscow's predation.\n\nIn Washington, there can be none of the public and not-so-public disagreements that previously followed Ukraine's unmet expectations of a clear path towards membership.\n\nIt is also vital that the alliance does not build up unrealistic expectations about Ukraine's offensive prospects. Much of the frustration that resulted from Ukraine's \"failed\" counteroffensive was due to mismanaged expectations that flowed from Washington and European capitals, and the absence of clear, viable objectives.\n\nThe audience matters as much as the message and here there are two distinct audiences: the NATO member-states themselves and their populations, and the adversary/competitor nations of Russia and China. While in Europe -- and to a lesser degree in the United States -- the support for Ukraine remains high (if uneven e.g. Hungary), the protracted nature of the war will, inevitably, lead towards doubts and fatigue. Recognizing this reality is vital; one cannot wish it away. Convening a successful summit, communicating a message of unity and firm commitment, and consistently answering \"why\" Ukraine matters will help offset domestic calls for an early resolution to the war.\n\nInternationally, Russia and China will watch for any daylight between NATO member-states and seize upon any vacillation or doubt about the path forward. For Russia, if NATO is not seen to act on basics like standardization, interoperability, or forward deployment, it will confirm what President Vladimir Putin already believes -- he can merely wait NATO out in Ukraine. China, for its part, will watch closely, too. How resolute is the alliance and what messages will it send about the Indo-Pacific.\n\nWhile unanimity about NATO's role, if any, in the region are unlikely to be answered in Washington, the signals the summit sends will be vital for friends and foes alike.", "source": {"uri": "breakingdefense.sites.breakingmedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breaking Defense"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

While President Joe Biden is a firm believer in the value of the transatlantic alliance, Republican contender Donald Trump has for years railed against US participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, the military alliance commonly referred to as NATO.\n\nIn February 2024, for example, Trump said that if he were reelected president, he would tell Russia to do \"whatever the hell they want\" against NATO members that are \"delinquent\" in not having invested enough in their own military capabilities. Foreign policy commentators viewed that as an invitation for Russia to attack these NATO countries.\n\nIn September 2022, six months after Russia's full-scale invasion, Ukraine applied to join NATO. Now, Ukraine's potential membership is one of the top questions that representatives from NATO's 32-member countries in North America and Europe will consider when they meet in Washington in July. At the root of debates over policy toward alliances such as NATO is the assumption that NATO requires its members to step in and help with defence if another member of the alliance is attacked.\n\nAs political scientists who study the role of international organisations like NATO, we think it is important to understand that, in reality, alliance agreements are more flexible than people think. In practice, it is possible for the US and other Western countries to stay out of a conflict that involves a NATO country without having to break their alliance commitments. The NATO treaty's language contains loopholes that let member countries remain out of other members' wars in certain situations.\n\nArticle 5\n\nOne key part of the NATO treaty that countries sign when they join the alliance is called Article 5. This says that an \"armed attack\" against one NATO member in Europe or North America \"shall be considered an attack against them all.\" In the case of such an attack, NATO countries agree to assist the country that requires help, including through \"the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.\" But the treaty does not include a clear definition of what an \"armed attack\" actually is.\n\nThis mattered in February 2020, when Turkey asked for a NATO meeting and requested that NATO intervene with military force in response to Russian and Syrian forces' attacks on its territory, which had killed 33 Turkish soldiers, during the Syrian civil war. NATO allies chose not to defend Turkey with military force, arguing that the level of violence against Turkey wasn't enough to call it an \"armed attack.\"\n\nExceptions to Rule\n\nEven when NATO members decide that Article 5 should apply to a specific situation, each country can still individually decide how to act. That is, while NATO does have administrative staff based in Brussels, there is no central NATO authority that tells each country what it must do.\n\nInstead, each country tells NATO what it is - and is not - willing to do. NATO members have only formally invoked Article 5 once - following the Sept 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon outside of Washington. At that time, 13 NATO countries sent fighter aircraft to help the US patrol its skies from mid-October 2001 to mid-May 2002.\n\nWhile NATO does have administrative staff based in Brussels, there is no central NATO authority that tells each country what it must do\n\nBut most NATO allies chose not to send troops to Afghanistan to support the US in its fight against the Taliban. This lack of action on the part of some NATO allies was not seen as breaking the treaty and didn't prompt a major debate - and the countries that chose not to join the fight were not sanctioned by or ejected from the alliance.\n\nThe NATO treaty also provides some exceptions based on geography. When Argentina went to war with the United Kingdom (a NATO member) over the Falkland Islands in 1982, the US and other NATO members were able to use the fact that the alliance only applies to the North Atlantic region as a reason to stay out of the conflict.\n\nPublic's Expectations\n\nSome political scientists argue that voters will demand their leaders take the country to war to defend an ally. This implies that what really binds the members of an alliance together is not the legal text of an international treaty itself, given that no international court is empowered to enforce the treaty, but rather the public's expectations of what it means to be an ally.\n\nAs part of our research into how the American public thinks about international legal obligations, we decided to construct an experiment to see if presidents could use alliance loophole language to justify keeping the US out of a war involving an ally. In 2022 and 2023, we conducted a pair of survey-based experiments that involved asking nearly 5,000 American adults to consider a hypothetical scenario in which a US ally comes under attack from a powerful neighbour.\n\nSome of the respondents were told that the text of the alliance treaty would allow the US government to avoid having to send troops to defend the embattled ally, while others were not told that information. Though the survey did not mention a specific alliance, we described the terms of the alliance in a way that matches the language used in treaties like NATO's. We then asked the respondents to tell us their views on sending US troops to defend the ally under attack.\n\nOur results revealed a big difference between the people who were told about the flexibility in the alliance treaty and those who were not. While respondents from both groups were generally inclined to come to the defence of an ally, their willingness to do so was significantly lower when they were told that the alliance treaty did not necessarily require the US to send troops. This suggests that political leaders can, under certain circumstances, manage to convince a large segment of the public that it's OK to abandon an ally in a time of need.\n\nSo, when it comes to debates about US policy toward its alliance partners - and whether it should admit new members like Ukraine - it is important for both sides to appreciate that alliance commitments are not quite as binding, either legally or politically, as the conventional wisdom suggests.", "source": {"uri": "telanganatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Telangana Today"}, "authors": [{"uri":

At some point - and unless China changes course - allies need to impose a cost. There should be consequences,\" Mr Stoltenberg added.\n\nIn addition to the 32 members of the Nato alliance, the summit will also bring in four key partners from the Asia-Pacific: Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea.\n\nChina argues that it is not sending lethal assistance to either side - unlike the United States and other Western nations.\n\nBeijing steered clear of a weekend summit in Switzerland promoted by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that reaffirmed Kyiv's demands for Russia to leave Ukrainian territory for any peace.\n\nMr Stoltenberg said that Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit this week to North Korea, which has supplied shells to Moscow despite being under UN sanctions, further showed how Moscow was \"dependent\" on authoritarian leaders.\n\nTrump - who in the past has voiced admiration for Mr Putin - has boasted that he can quickly end the war, likely by pressing Ukraine to accept demands.\n\nTrump has long raged over what he sees as unfairness in Nato, founded to counter the Soviet Union.\n\nOn the campaign trail, he has suggested he would encourage Russia to \"do whatever the hell they want\" if Nato members do not \"pay your bills.\"\n\nIn the Oval Office, Mr Stoltenberg told Mr Biden that 23 of the 32 allies now met a pledge to spend at least two per cent of GDP on defence, as the Ukraine invasion brings new security fears to Europe.\n\nA 2014 Nato summit set the funding goal that was then met by only three countries - the United States, Britain and Greece. Mr Stoltenberg last reported that 20 countries were achieving the target.\n\n\"NATO allies are this year increasing defense spending by 18 per cent. That's the biggest increase in decades,\" Mr Stoltenberg said.\n\nIn a sharply different message than Trump, Mr Biden hailed Nato, saying that since it has successfully \"deterred further Russian

The alliance confirmed in newly released statistics that 23 nations will hit the mark.\n\nStoltenberg underscored the increased contributions of European allies as U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump suggested he would not defend NATO members that fail to meet minimum spending requirements.\n\n\"Europeans are doing far more for their collective security than just a few years ago,\" Stoltenberg said.\n\nThe increase has also been a boon for U.S. businesses, he noted. \"Much of this extra money is spent here in the United States,\" he said. Over the last two years, more than two-thirds of European defense acquisitions -- over $140 billion worth of contracts -- have been made with U.S. firms. \"NATO is good for U.S. security, good for U.S. industry, and good for U.S. jobs,\" he said.\n\nThe Financial Times reported earlier this week that U.S. and European defense companies are on a hiring spree, recruiting workers at the fastest rate since the end of the Cold War, boosted by increased defense spending in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and general global unease. U.S. behemoths Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and General Dynamics have close to 6,000 job openings.\n\nThe war in Ukraine will be top of the agenda at the NATO summit next month, which is set to start on July 9. The alliance will be taking over from Washington in coordinating military aid support and training for Ukraine to ensure continuity in Western support for Kyiv and insulate it from political headwinds in the United States and Europe.\n\nStoltenberg is also seeking an agreement on a financial pledge for Ukraine of some 40 billion euros annually, although the details are still being hashed out by allies ahead of the summit.\n\nSignaling tectonic shifts in global security, the third item on the trans-Atlantic alliance's agenda for the meeting next month will be global partnerships with a particular focus on the Indo-Pacific. \"The war in Ukraine demonstrates that our security is not regional, it is global,\" said Stoltenberg, pointing to Beijing's support for Russia during the war.\n\n\"China is fueling the largest armed conflict in Europe since World War II,\" he said.\n\nThe summit will be Stoltenberg's last as secretary-general, after leading the alliance for a decade. He is expected to step down by Oct. 1. In the race to be his successor, Klaus Iohannis withdrew his candidacy on Thursday, leaving outgoing Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte as sole contender. He is expected to be confirmed as Stoltenberg's successor in the coming days.\n\nRutte is a veteran of European politics, having served as prime minister of the Netherlands since 2010. Rutte's candidacy was favored by some of NATO's biggest member states, including the U.S., U.K., France, and Germany, although allies on the eastern flank sought a candidate from the region.\n\nRutte has been described as a \"Trump whisperer\" and will likely have his work cut out for him in the event of a second Trump presidency, said Jim Townsend, former deputy assistant secretary of defense for European and NATO policy. \"I think Rutte, being the clever politician that he is, should be able to handle Donald Trump, at least the one we saw four years ago,\" he said. \"However, a Trump 2.0 will be surrounded by loyalists and more savvy about how to get his way and who his enemies are. That may make him harder to handle.\"\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden has nominated Kristin Johnson to be assistant secretary of the Treasury for financial institutions.\n\nWhat should be high on your radar, if it isn't already.\n\nA shift in Gaza. The Israeli military is close to wrapping up its offensive in Rafah, according to the Washington Post. \"The Israel Defense Forces said it has destroyed most of Hamas's 24 battalions and has severely degraded three of the four remaining battalions in Rafah. But lone fighters and small groups are still launching rockets into Israel and targeting troops, even in areas of the Gaza Strip already largely under Israel's control,\" wrote the Post's Steve Hendrix and Hajar Harb.\n\nThis shift could mark an end to major ground and air operations, which have killed tens of thousands of Palestinians in the coastal enclave. More targeted operations are likely to continue. Meantime, tensions along Israel's northern border with Lebanon continue to escalate. The country's foreign minister, Israel Katz, said this week that a decision on a war with Hezbollah would be made soon. An all-out war between Israel and the Iran-backed militant group would likely be devastating for both Israel and Lebanon, Amy wrote this week.\n\nTop of the list. The Biden administration is redirecting Patriot missiles to Ukraine to boost the country's air defense against Russia, instead of delivering them to other countries. Separately, Romania announced today it would send a Patriot air defense battery to Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in April that the war-torn country needs at least seven Patriot systems to defend itself effectively against Russia's air assault.\n\nSlow down. Somalia's government wants to slow down the withdrawal of African Union peacekeepers from the war-torn country, Reuters reported today. Two thousand troops from a variety of African countries are expected to leave this month ahead of an overall exit by the end of the year. The Somali government sent a letter last month to the African Union Peace and Security Council calling to delay the withdrawal of half of the 4,000 peacekeepers originally expected to leave in June. Somalia has asked for the withdrawal timeline to be adapted to the \"actual readiness and capabilities\" of Somali forces, according to the letter.\n\nThursday, June 20: Stoltenberg and U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan meet in Washington, D.C.\n\nSunday, June 23: German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is set to meet Argentine President Javier Milei in Berlin.\n\nWednesday, June 26: British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and opposition leader Keir Starmer square off in a BBC debate ahead of elections on July 4.\n\nThursday, June 27: Biden and Trump square off in the first presidential debate in Georgia hosted by CNN.\n\n\"We genuinely do not know what he is talking about. We just don't.\"\n\n-- White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre pushes back on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's claims that the U.S. administration has been holding back weapons and ammunition in the past few months, hampering the Rafah offensive. U.S. officials maintain they have only held back one delivery of heavy bombs.", "source": {"uri": "foreignpolicy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Foreign Policy"}, "authors": [{"uri":

I know that it's always easier to spend money on health, education, infrastructure, and many other important tasks,\" Mr. Stoltenberg said during a speech in Ottawa on June 19.\n\nMr. Stoltenberg, who was previously prime minister of Norway, said that while he understood the Canadian government was concerned with balancing its budget and spending on social services, a failure to prevent a wider war would ultimately endanger its citizens. \"So a precondition for success in all the other areas is to preserve peace,\" he said.\n\nDuring a NATO meeting in Brussels on June 14, Defence Minister Bill Blair said the Canadian Armed Forces was increasing its budget by 27 percent in 2024, and had begun acquiring additional capabilities to meet NATO's requirements. \"I believe it brings us inevitably to over 2 percent of defence spending, but I've got some work to do in order to be able to articulate that, both to my own country and to our allies,\" he added.\n\nTreasury Board President Anita Anand, who was previously defence minister, told reporters on June 18 that Canada's failure to hit the 2 percent target has partially been due to the Department of Defence's inability to spend its entire budget. She said due to how long the government's procurement system can take, it does not make sense to \"fill the books with additional money, if that money can't get out the door.\"\n\n\"The quicker Moscow will realize it cannot wait us out, the sooner this war will end. It may seem like a paradox, but the path to peace is more weapons to Ukraine to convince President Putin that he cannot win on the battlefield,\" he said.\n\nMr. Stoltenberg also took aim at China, which he said has been providing high-end technologies like semiconductors to Russia to aid in its war effort. While Beijing has pledged not to sell lethal arms to Russia, Mr. Stoltenberg said it has exported materials used to produce missiles, tanks, and aircraft to \"inflict more death and destruction on Ukraine.\"\n\nThe general-secretary said China had attempted to \"create the impression\" that it is not involved in the Russia-Ukraine War. \"But the reality is that China's fueling the largest armed conflict in Europe since World War II, and at the same time, it wants to maintain good relations with the West,\" he said.\n\n\"Well, Beijing cannot have it both ways. At some point, unless China changes course, allies need to impose a cost.\"\n\nMr. Stoltenberg also highlighted the threats posed by North Korea and Iran, which have supplied missiles and drones to Russia. He raised concerns that Russia may provide the two countries with technology and supplies to help them advance their missile and nuclear programs.\n\nIn response to NATO delivering long-range weapons to Ukraine that could be used to strike targets inside Russia, President Vladimir Putin said he may respond by giving weapons to the opponents of Western countries. Mr. Putin also recently wrapped up a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, where they signed an agreement pledging mutual aid if either country is attacked.", "source": {"uri":

Sweden, a Nordic country, officially became NATO's newest member on 7 March 2024, upon depositing its instrument of accession to the North Atlantic Treaty. Notably, the Nordic nations -- Sweden and Finland fervently applied to join the military alliance in May 2022, yet owning to the resistance posed by Turkey and Hungary, it delayed the process. After almost 30 years of close partnership with NATO, Finland, also a Nordic country, became an official member of NATO on 4 April 2023. By the entry of these two members, NATO has now become the largest military hub of 32 member states of the North Atlantic Community. In a sane policy response, Moscow -- despite its traditional reservations over NATO's enlargement -- has shown a pragmatic calm over NATO's Nordic expansion.\n\nHistorically put, both countries -- Sweden and Finland have a long history of military nonalignment, and although they have gradually pursued closer cooperation with the United States and NATO -- and politicians in both countries have long advocated membership -- NATO accession was hardly seen as a pressing issue. Recently Hungary's Parliament approved Sweden's NATO accession, clearing the last hurdle before the historic step by the Nordic country whose neutrality lasted through two world wars and the simmering conflict of the Cold War.\n\nSo far as the procedure of NATO accession is concerned, it prompts that once all NATO members had ratified Finland's Accession Protocol and Finland had accepted its accession to NATO, Finland became a de jure NATO member on April 4, 2023. As for NATO-Finland relations and cooperation, Finland provides personnel to the NATO-led peacekeeping force in Kosovo (KFOR). Further, Finland has participated in NATO Mission Iraq (NMI), NATO's advisory and capacity-building mission in Iraq. Moreover, Finland participated in the enhanced NATO Response Force (NRF) in a supplementary role and subject to national decisions.\n\nAdditionally, Finland signed a memorandum of understanding on Host Nation Support which, subject to a national decision, allowed for logistical support to Allied forces located on, or in transit through, its territory during exercises or in a crisis. By now, as a member of NATO, Finland will be part of NATO's collective defence and decision making and, thus, be covered by the security guarantees enshrined in Article 5 of the Treaty. Historically put, ''Sweden's relations with NATO date back to 1994, when Sweden joined the Partnership for Peace. Since then, Sweden's cooperation with NATO has gradually increased. On 7 March 2024, Sweden became a full member of NATO. As for Sweden's NATO's bid, Stockholm had pragmatically abandoned its non-alignment policy, keeping in view the greater safety within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nAs for the Kremlin policy vis-\u00e0-vis NATO's Nordic expansion, Moscow has long opposed the expansion of NATO. However, President Putin has indicated he sees no threat to Russia if Sweden and Finland join the Alliance. President Putin intermittently said, \"Russia will respond if NATO begins to establish military infrastructure in either of the two nations\". Russia has an 830-mile border with Finland. Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine, in February 2022, the question of NATO membership was barely part of the political debate in Finland and Sweden.\n\nArguably, from a western point of view , the latitude-cum-pragmatic calm exercised by Kremlin over NATO's Nordic expansion is due to the political expediencies as the western analysis posits: ''Russians can see that two countries with historically strong non-aligned policies decided to overturn those policies as a direct result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. To avoid acknowledging a setback, Putin needs to tell Russians that this new expansion of NATO is not a big deal -- as long as NATO hardware stays out of Swedish and Finnish territories.'' Nevertheless, a logical argument working behind this theory of Russia's pragmatic silence suggests that it is Putin resilient response to the Russian public reckoning that the ongoing war in Ukraine is a real threat to Russia's sovereignty who might this apparent shift in Russia's stated position Russians can see that two countries with historically strong non-aligned policies decided to overturn those policies as a direct result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nYears beyond years, guarding the security of the western hemisphere remained the leitmotif of NATO-founded in 1949. On 4 April 2024, NATO celebrated its 75th anniversary. Recently, NATO has not been a club of 32 members, but it also becomes a cradle of fostering western relationship with more than 40 non-member countries and international organisations, called NATO partners. Whereas, doctrinally put, collective defence is at the heart of the NATO Alliance-the bedrock of security and harmony among its members. On the eve of this historic event, NATO's Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg remarked that \"NATO is bigger, stronger and more united than ever\".\n\nHowever, some international strategists hold that the establishment of NATO with particular reference of its article 5 -- fostering a concept of collective defence -- was mainly indoctrinated to counterpoise the Cold War geopolitical asymmetries. They logically hold that with the end of Cold War accompanied by after the dissolution of the WARSAW (in February, 1991), there arises no justification of this article. All the more, Russian objections to NATO's enlargement largely come from Russia -NATO pact in 1997 under the US President Bill Clinton's era where Russia was given an assurance that NATO will not be enlarged towards the Russian borders. Nonetheless, after its eastward and northward -- expansion, NATO has now become the biggest trans-regional military alliance, albeit motivating Russia to strengthen its land, naval and air forces in the Baltic Sea.\n\n-- The writer, an independent 'IR' researcher-cum-international law analyst based in Pakistan, is member of European Consortium for Political Research Standing Group on IR, Critical Peace & Conflict Studies, also a member of Washington Foreign Law Society and European Society of International Law.

While President Joe Biden is a firm believer in the value of the transatlantic alliance, Republican contender Donald Trump has for years railed against U.S. participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the military alliance commonly referred to as NATO.\n\nIn February 2024, for example, Trump said that if he were reelected president, he would tell Russia to do \"whatever the hell they want\" against NATO members that are \"delinquent\" in not having invested enough in their own military capabilities. Foreign policy commentators viewed that as an invitation for Russia to attack these NATO countries.\n\nIn September 2022, six months after Russia's full-scale invasion, Ukraine applied to join NATO. Now, Ukraine's potential membership is one of the top questions that representatives from NATO's 32 member countries in North America and Europe will consider when they meet in Washington in July 2024.\n\nAt the root of debates over policy toward alliances such as NATO is the assumption that NATO requires its members to step in and help with defense if another member of the alliance is attacked.\n\nAs political scientists who study the role of international organizations like NATO, we think it is important to understand that, in reality, alliance agreements are more flexible than people think.\n\nIn practice, it is possible for the U.S. and other Western countries to stay out of a conflict that involves a NATO country without having to break their alliance commitments. The NATO treaty's language contains loopholes that let member countries remain out of other members' wars in certain situations.\n\nOne key part of the NATO treaty that countries sign when they join the alliance is called Article 5. This says that an \"armed attack\" against one NATO member in Europe or North America \"shall be considered an attack against them all.\"\n\nIn the case of such an attack, NATO countries agree to assist the country that requires help, including through \"the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.\"\n\nBut the treaty does not include a clear definition of a what an \"armed attack\" actually is.\n\nThis mattered in February 2020, when Turkey asked for a NATO meeting and requested that NATO intervene with military force in response to Russian and Syrian forces' attacks on its territory, which had killed 33 Turkish soldiers, during the Syrian civil war. NATO allies chose not to defend Turkey with military force, arguing that the level of violence against Turkey wasn't enough to call it an \"armed attack.\"\n\nEven when NATO members decide that Article 5 should apply to a specific situation, each country can still individually decide how to act. That is, while NATO does have administrative staff based in Brussels, there is no central NATO authority that tells each country what it must do.\n\nInstead, each country tells NATO what it is - and is not - willing to do.\n\nNATO members have only formally invoked Article 5 once - following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon outside of Washington.\n\nAt that time, 13 NATO countries sent fighter aircraft to help the U.S. patrol its skies from mid-October 2001 to mid-May 2002.\n\nBut most NATO allies chose not to send troops to Afghanistan to support the U.S. in its fight against the Taliban. This lack of action on the part of some NATO allies was not seen as breaking the treaty and didn't prompt a major debate - and the countries that chose not to join the fight were not sanctioned by or ejected from the alliance.\n\nThe NATO treaty also provides some exceptions based on geography. When Argentina went to war with the United Kingdom (a NATO member) over the Falkland Islands in 1982, the U.S. and other NATO members were able to use the fact that the alliance only applies to the North Atlantic region as a reason to stay out of the conflict.\n\nSome political scientists argue that voters will demand their leaders take the country to war to defend an ally. This implies that what really binds the members of an alliance together is not the legal text of an international treaty itself, given that no international court is empowered to enforce the treaty, but rather the public's expectations of what it means to be an ally.\n\nAs part of our research into how the American public thinks about international legal obligations, we decided to construct an experiment to see if presidents could use alliance loophole language to justify keeping the U.S. out of a war involving an ally.\n\nIn 2022 and 2023, we conducted a pair of survey-based experiments that involved asking nearly 5,000 American adults to consider a hypothetical scenario in which a U.S. ally comes under attack from a powerful neighbor.\n\nSome of the respondents were told that the text of the alliance treaty would allow the U.S. government to avoid having to send troops to defend the embattled ally, while others were not told that information. Though the survey did not mention a specific alliance, we described the terms of the alliance in a way that matches the language used in treaties like NATO's. We then asked the respondents to tell us their views on sending U.S. troops to defend the ally under attack.\n\nOur results revealed a big difference between the people who were told about the flexibility in the alliance treaty and those who were not. While respondents from both groups were generally inclined to come to the defense of an ally, their willingness to do so was significantly lower when they were told that the alliance treaty did not necessarily require the U.S. to send troops.\n\nThis suggests that political leaders can, under certain circumstances, manage to convince a large segment of the public that it's OK to abandon an ally in a time of need.\n\nSo, when it comes to debates about U.S. policy toward its alliance partners - and whether it should admit new members like Ukraine - it is important for both sides to appreciate that alliance commitments are not quite as binding, either legally or politically, as the conventional wisdom suggests.", "source": {"uri": "canadianinquirer.net", "dataType": "news", "title":

Earlier this week, NATO released data for 2024, which showed that 23 of the 31 members are expected to hit that 2% mark.\n\nDaniel Kochis, a foreign policy analyst who focuses on NATO, attributes the increased spending to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the threat Russia could pose to the alliance if it succeeds in Ukraine.\n\n\"I think [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's decision [to invade Ukraine] was really the galvanizing force to crystallize minds in Europe to put in place the plans, and to do it quickly, to reach the 2% threshold,\" Kochis, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, told the Washington Examiner. \"I don't know that we would have gotten there with the same speed and with the same number of countries absent that threat perception from Russia.\"\n\nPoland spends the highest share of its GDP on defense among the alliance, at 4.12%. Estonia is second at 3.43%, and the U.S. is third at 3.38%, followed by Latvia at 3.15%, Greece at 3.08%, Lithuania at 2.85%, and Finland at 2.41%. Of those countries, only the U.S. and Greece do not share a border with Russia.\n\nThe NATO allies that share a border with Russia are \"realizing that 2% is probably not going to be enough to do the sort of things in terms of capability rebuild that they need to in order to deter the Russians,\" Kochis added.\n\nSweden and Finland joined NATO last year after watching Russia invade Ukraine.\n\n\"Putin's war is not the result of NATO enlargement. Putin's war is a cause of NATO enlargement, and NATO is more resolute and more capable than ever,\" U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said last week.\n\nThe allies that didn't reach the 2% marker are expected to be Croatia, Portugal, Italy, Canada, Belgium, Luxembourg, Slovenia, and Spain. Iceland is a NATO ally but does not have a military.\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg declined to say when he believed every member of the alliance would hit the 2% threshold when talking to reporters at the Wilson Center this week, though he said he was \"very encouraged by what we've seen.\"\n\nAustin, who met with NATO ministers of defense last week, added emphasis to the fact that the alliance is committed \"to spend at least 2% of GDP on defense,\" and he stressed, \"Let me underscore the words 'at least 2%.'\"\n\nThe 2% benchmark was first agreed upon by the alliance in 2006 and then was agreed to in the 2014 Defense Investment Pledge.\n\nU.K. Defense Secretary Grant Shapps announced in April that the alliance should increase the benchmark to 2.5%, which he said would make a \"real difference.\"\n\nThere's a second significant guideline, which is that at least 20% should be spent on equipment, weapons, and other capabilities.\n\nDalibor Rohac, a senior fellow with the American Enterprise Institute, told the Washington Examiner that militaries can \"act as big, bloated bureaucracies\" and that militaries can spend \"a lot of money on salaries, pensions, benefits, and veteran care.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nAll but two countries hit this marker: Canada and Belgium, which also fell short of the 2% benchmark.\n\nCanada is \"the biggest laggard within the alliance,\" Kochis explained. \"Canada should be living up to its obligations, and it isn't.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

It's an apt metaphor -- just not in the way its proponents might think.\n\nThe Biden administration sometimes refers to the need to build a \"bridge\" to NATO membership for Ukraine. It's an apt metaphor -- just not in the way its proponents might think.\n\nOne might think of a bridge as a mere symbol of hope. But, invoked in a military context, a bridge is best understood in its role as wartime infrastructure. And that metaphor works precisely because building a bridge in wartime is an incredibly difficult and complex operation -- one that military planners call a \"wet gap crossing.\" Conducting a contested wet gap crossing is perilous -- see Ukraine's evisceration of a Russian battalion attempting to cross the Siverskyi Donets River in May 2022 -- but the possible strategic rewards are high. In 1944, George S. Patton's Third Army crossed the Moselle River at Nancy, turning the German defensive line and opening a strategic position for the Battle of the Bulge.\n\nMuch like a wet gap crossing, bringing Ukraine into NATO would be risky and costly, but it could lead to strategic success. If NATO nations are truly serious about bringing Ukraine into NATO, then creating a bridge to NATO cannot just be a clever diplomatic metaphor, and it should not be attempted merely in order to get to the other side, like the Russians at Siverskyi Donets. It has to be approached like the difficult, sophisticated, multifaceted operation that it is, and it must be part of a broader strategy for postwar Euro-Atlantic security, as was the Moselle crossing in World War II.\n\nDiplomats and politicians planning for Ukraine's future role in NATO at July's NATO summit in Washington would do well to understand the U.S. military's own approach to wet gap crossings. The lessons are instructive -- and sobering.\n\nStep 1: Try to go around\n\nBecause wet gap crossings are so difficult, the preferred option, if possible, is to avoid them altogether. Some would say we should not bring Ukraine into NATO because it is too risky. But that ignores the fact that there are no good options short of NATO membership for Ukraine, and the risks of not bringing Ukraine into NATO are greater in the long run. As in military operations, crossing a river often is the fastest, most effective way to an objective.\n\nDespite the known risks and difficulties inherent in combat bridging, militaries still maintain this capability because they know that sometimes the strategic opportunity afforded by a successful wet gap crossing is worth the risks and difficulties. They also know that sometimes, going around is not an option. Russia has invaded its neighbors and rattled its nuclear saber, but one thing it has not done is attack NATO directly. That is because NATO's Article 5 remains an effective deterrent. Nothing else has worked.\n\nThose arguing against Ukrainian membership in NATO assert that perhaps we should choose an \"Israel model\" of continued materiel support to Ukraine or that a combination of countries, such as the G-7 nations, providing long-term economic support to Ukraine, would convince Russia that it cannot win. The Israel model will not work because Israel has nuclear weapons and Ukraine does not. In fact, that's the whole point. Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons in 1994 when Russia, among other nations, agreed to respect Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Similarly, Sweden's and Finland's decisions to join NATO despite already being members of the European Union demonstrate that bringing Ukraine into the EU and affording it the EU's Article 42.7 mutual assistance clause would be insufficient to deter Russian aggression.\n\nStep 2: Plan and rehearse\n\nOnce a decision has been made to conduct a deliberate wet gap crossing, planning is crucial. Simply moving your forces up to the edge of the water and trying to figure out a way across when you reach it would guarantee disaster. You must reconnoiter potential crossing sites, assess which will likely be successful given the terrain as well as your and your enemy's strengths and weaknesses, and prepare multiple crossing sites.\n\nThere are several options for bridging Ukraine into NATO, all of which should be considered but not all of which seem promising. The first -- declaring Ukraine a NATO member while hostilities are ongoing -- is theoretically possible but likely politically untenable given the need for unanimity among the 32 allies to bring in a new member. The fact that it took a year to bring the geographically blessed and militarily advanced Sweden into the alliance belies this harsh fact. If, somehow, this became politically tenable, then NATO would have to quickly deploy forces into Ukraine to make the Article 5 guarantee more than just lip service.\n\nThe second option would be to bring Ukraine into NATO as part of a guarantee during negotiations over a cease-fire or cessation of hostilities -- i.e., as soon as a cessation is in place, Ukraine will accede to NATO. This likely would not work because Russia would continue fighting rather than agree to a cessation of hostilities that triggered Ukrainian membership in NATO.\n\nThe third option would be for a critical mass of NATO nations to guarantee Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity following a cease-fire by deploying forces on Ukrainian territory. This has the benefit of offering concrete security guarantees to Ukraine while allowing time to bring onside skeptical NATO nations.\n\nWhile the future shape of Ukraine is unknowable, and the timeline for Ukrainian admission to NATO is unknown, the alliance should start working now to achieve unanimity of political support among NATO nations for Ukrainian accession and also to determine how, where, and when forces from NATO nations will be used to guarantee the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. Both measures will be unavoidable, regardless of which option is deemed most credible.\n\nStep 3: Prepare the battlespace\n\nIn combat bridging, you don't just line up all your vehicles in a convoy and drive directly to the location where you want to build your bridge and then start putting things in the water. That would be suicide. You plan, rehearse, prepare your forces, and conduct a preparatory campaign to establish favorable conditions. Similarly, simply declaring a Ukrainian bridge to NATO without doing any planning or preparation would just leave Ukraine in the same strategic limbo it faced following the 2008 Bucharest declaration and similarly would motivate Moscow to redouble its efforts to undermine Ukrainian sovereignty before it is able to join NATO.\n\nFor NATO, this means that members need to begin whipping together votes in favor of Ukrainian NATO accession now. Diplomats need to understand who in the alliance already is on board with bringing Ukraine into NATO and under what conditions. For those whose position is \"never\" or \"not until the war is over,\" more creative solutions must be proposed, discussed, and solidified -- in private. This cannot be a one-off discussion; it must be a constant campaign to prepare the battlespace for eventual Ukrainian accession.\n\nRegardless of whether the war ends with Ukraine in control of its 1991 borders or Kyiv settles for something short of that, troops from NATO nations will need to be stationed on Ukrainian soil to provide the time, space, and security necessary to complete the bridge into NATO. These forces should include a coalition of key allies -- ideally including NATO's three nuclear states (Britain, France, and the United States) to signal that despite a lack of Article 5 security guarantees, NATO's nuclear nations are committed to upholding the agreed-on borders -- just as NATO troops were stationed in West Germany to deter Soviet forces in East Germany in the years between the end of World War II and West Germany's accession to NATO.\n\nMoving these forces into Ukraine in a short timeframe following an armistice or cease-fire would be extremely difficult both logistically and politically. Therefore, NATO nations should begin to set the theater now for those moves by declaring that NATO's air defenses surrounding Ukraine will begin to shoot down Russian missiles and one-way attack drones that are on a trajectory to hit NATO territory; sending small numbers of NATO military personnel into Ukraine to provide training to Ukrainians; and negotiating with Turkey on allowing NATO naval capabilities into the Black Sea to protect civilian shipping.\n\nStep 4: Commit\n\nA wet gap crossing is a massive operation. It is viewed as a corps-level effort in the U.S. Army and is assumed that the Air Force, Space Force, and cyber assets also will provide critical support. It is difficult, risky, and costly, but if done properly, it can lead to strategic breakthrough.\n\nPrecisely because it is so risky, the commander of the operation must assess the risks involved, mitigate as much risk as possible without jeopardizing the mission, and accept that it is impossible to mitigate every risk. This is a critical step because once a combat wet gap crossing has begun, a commander must fully commit to the plan and leverage all forces available to make it a success. Half-measures in this type of operation lead to failure.\n\nIf NATO is serious about bringing Ukraine in as a member -- and it should be -- then it must be clear-eyed about the risks.

Although Russia's President Vladimir Putin has indicated an interest in negotiation, the Biden administration has escalated the fighting, most recently by permitting the use of American weapons to strike targets within Russia. Europe's vocal war party is pushing for even more.\n\nThe blame for starting the conflict falls squarely on Putin, who decided to invade his neighbor. Nevertheless, allied officials created the incendiary circumstances which led to the war. Indeed, Western leaders well understood that their aggressive policies after the Cold War made confrontation likely.\n\nFor instance, in 2008 the George W. Bush administration pressed its allies to expand NATO to Georgia and Ukraine. National intelligence officer Fiona Hill, who later served on the Trump National Security Council staff, briefed Bush, predicting \"that Mr. Putin would view steps to bring Ukraine and Georgia closer to NATO as a provocative move that would likely provoke pre-emptive Russian military action.\" William Burns, Bush's ambassador to Russia and President Joe Biden's CIA director, sent a famous cable warning the administration that \"Ukrainian entry into NATO is the brightest of all redlines for the Russian elite (not just Putin).\" Such a step would \"create fertile soil for Russian meddling in Crimea and eastern Ukraine.\"\n\nThe stakes were evident when Putin expanded military forces along Ukraine's border in late 2021. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg admitted: \"The background was that President Putin declared in the autumn of 2021, and actually sent a draft treaty that they wanted NATO to sign, to promise no more NATO enlargement. That was what he sent us. And was a pre-condition for not invade [sic] Ukraine. Of course we didn't sign that.... So he went to war to prevent NATO, more NATO, close to his borders.\"\n\nIn March 2022, even Zelensky acknowledged as much: \"Security guarantees and neutrality, the nuclear-free status of our state. We are ready to agree to it. This is the most important point. This was the first fundamental point for the Russian Federation, as far as I remember. And as far as I remember, they started a war because of this.\" Yet the U.S. helped torpedo Russo-Ukrainian negotiations.\n\nThe continuing war is an obvious disaster for the participants, most importantly Ukraine, since it provides most of the battlefield. Blustery predictions in late 2022 and early 2023 that Ukraine could liberate the Donbass, retake Crimea, push Putin from power, force regime change in Moscow, and perhaps even break up the Russian Federation are now long-discarded fantasies. Wistful hopes that the Zelensky government can rebuild for a renewed offensive next year seem unrealistic in view of Ukraine's serious manpower shortage, which has led to draconian conscription measures.\n\nContra Zelensky's grand claims, Ukraine is fighting for itself, not the West. In security terms, Ukraine never much mattered to America or Europe. The continent suffers economically from the war, but the U.S. has barely been affected. Although the conflict is a humanitarian disaster, it has caused fewer civilian casualties than Washington's illegal invasion of Iraq and murderous support for Saudi Arabia's attack on Yemen.\n\nThese days there is much bloviation about the supposed danger of a victorious Putin turning into Hitler reborn. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, Zelensky promotes the most radical vision: \"At the moment, it's us, then Kazakhstan, then Baltic states, then Poland, then Germany. At least half of Germany.\" Yet what would Moscow gain from such an attempt? A quarter century into his reign is a little late for Putin to try to amass an empire. He never said he wanted to reconstitute the Soviet Union, instead explicitly rebuffing such claims. Anyway, such a campaign is improbable if not impossible, given the cost of Russia's war with Ukraine.\n\nMost importantly, as Stoltenberg admitted, Putin went to war to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO because the alliance offered a security guarantee from the United States. To claim that he would now attack multiple members of the transatlantic alliance is bizarre on its face. Of course, Europe should not take its security for granted, but the Europeans are well able to protect themselves and finally are spending more to do so.\n\nSome analysts fear that a diminished American presence might lead to a return of intra-European conflict. The unwillingness of the continent's major powers to rearm even 80 years after the end of World War II demonstrates a lack of will for war. Only now do we see broader, albeit limited, military efforts, with Moscow having unintentionally unified the continent.\n\nFinally, a Russian victory, it is claimed, would encourage China to attack Taiwan and more. Yet aggression is determined by local interests and conditions. In Europe, the US has refused to fight. Washington's willingness to instead provide arms to Ukraine is unlikely to convince Beijing that Americans are willing to risk nuclear war over Taiwan.\n\nIn any case, waging a proxy war is not cheap for Western governments. Moscow's so far unfulfilled threats of escalation have caused some allies to dismiss the possibility. Nevertheless, numerous NATO governments are active participants in the war, openly if indirectly killing thousands of Russian soldiers and destroying enormous quantities of Russian materiel. American officials have anonymously but publicly claimed credit for killing Russian generals and sinking Russian ships. Only because the Putin government believes it is winning does it have good reason to exercise restraint, accepting the indignity of the West's indirect participation in the conflict.\n\nBut the escalatory risks are constant. The Biden administration has authorized limited Ukrainian use of U.S. weapons to attack within Russia. NATO military personnel are engaged in military operations in Ukraine. France has suggested direct involvement of European troops in combat. Apparently Paris and Kyiv are discussing the dispatch of French trainers to Ukraine, a step which Ukrainian commander Gen. Olexandr Syrskyi said he hoped \"will encourage other partners to join this ambitious project.\" This step, opined the Washington Post columnist Lee Hockstader, \"would represent a quantum escalatory leap -- not just heavy metal to buttress Ukraine's defenses but manpower and the potential for casualties among European troops.\"\n\nAdd to that the pressure on Biden to facilitate expanded Ukrainian attacks within Russia, even after Kiev struck part of Moscow's nuclear early warning system. Zelensky continues to push for much more, including direct allied air support. Although NATO membership will not be offered to Ukraine at the upcoming alliance meeting in Washington, the Biden administration has signed a security treaty making Kiev a de facto ally.\n\nMore broadly, by placing Moscow and the West at increasing odds, the war has turned Russia into an enemy of America's global interests and pushed Moscow into the arms of the West's foes. Russia is tightening its embrace of China, trading arms with Iran and North Korea, actively combating U.S. influence in Africa, and building support within the Global South. Moscow also warned that it might arm other adversaries of America, such as Yemen's Houthis.\n\nImagine if Ukraine begins winning. Moscow would then possess the incentive as well as means to escalate, potentially dramatically. The U.S. and USSR emerged from the Cold War without a direct battle, though with a near miss in the Cuban Missile Crisis and another with the Able Archer exercise. It would be utterly reckless to chance a clash today with Russia.\n\nIt is in the interests of the U.S. and Europe, as well as Ukraine and Russia, to end the war as swiftly as possible. That does not mean forcing Kyiv to accept any particular outcome. Rather, allied states should set their policy to advance their interests and allow Ukraine to respond accordingly.\n\nSober Western officials increasingly acknowledge negotiation will ultimately be necessary, so for many the Western objective has shifted to strengthen Ukrainian negotiating leverage. Indeed, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin recently admitted the same in congressional testimony. This objective, however, requires a strategy other than simply continuing the war.\n\nAllied officials insist that Putin must be forced into talking, but he was willing to do so even before invading, as Stoltenberg admitted. Ukrainian officials acknowledge that Kiev and Moscow negotiated in Istanbul shortly after Russia's invasion in a process undermined by the U.S. and allied governments. And Putin recently reiterated his interest in holding talks, though he insisted that Kiev must recognize \"new realities\" after two and a half years of war. The only way to learn if Moscow is serious is to test it.\n\nIn contrast, Kyiv has ostentatiously refused to consider negotiation, with Zelensky effectively banning such discussions, insisting on what amounts to a Russian surrender first. However, realism increasingly appears to increasingly influence some top Ukrainians, who acknowledge that Crimea and the Donbass are best recognized as lost.\n\nAnother common contention is that Putin cannot be trusted, hence any agreement would be worthless. However, combatants rarely embrace one another even when making peace. And, frankly, the allies have proved they cannot be trusted, having violated multiple pledges against expanding NATO and admitted that they never intended to comply with the Minsk accords.\n\nAnyway, such objections ignore the state of the war. Kiev is unlikely to be in a stronger position next year. Russia is calling up more troops and producing more weapons than Ukraine. Ukrainian war weariness is evident as draft resistance grows and Zelensky's popularity falls. Indeed, with his term expired and elections postponed, the government's legitimacy also is declining.\n\nThe allies should lay the groundwork for negotiations today, when Ukraine's position is strongest. It is still possible to preserve that nation's independence and sovereignty, while accepting military restrictions and territorial losses. How much would depend on talks.\n\nWashington and Brussels should discuss possible economic and security arrangements with Moscow. For example, Ukraine could be nonaligned militarily -- with Russia assured that it would not face a hostile state allied with America on its border -- but still free to form economic and political ties with Europe. If Russia makes peace, it could be free to reengage economically and politically with the West. The allies could offer the return of frozen funds and property to Moscow and individual Russians.\n\nThe ongoing war is a human catastrophe. Simply giving more aid in hopes that something good will result is not a strategy. This approach ensures continued death and destruction and risks military escalation and expansion.\n\nInstead, the U.S. and its European allies should focus on ending the Russo-Ukrainian war. That means winding down allied military assistance and creating a stable, peaceful order. Doing so won't be easy. However, it is the only course that offers hope of a positive future for Ukraine, Russia, and the rest of Europe.", "source": {"uri": "theamericanconservative.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The American Conservative"}, "authors": [{"uri": "doug_bandow@theamericanconservative.com", "name": "Doug Bandow", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_George_W._Bush", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of George W.

While President Joe Biden is a firm believer in the value of the transatlantic alliance, Republican contender Donald Trump has for years railed against U.S. participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the military alliance commonly referred to as NATO.\n\nIn February 2024, for example, Trump said that if he were reelected president, he would tell Russia to do \"whatever the hell they want\" against NATO members that are \"delinquent\" in not having invested enough in their own military capabilities. Foreign policy commentators viewed that as an invitation for Russia to attack these NATO countries.\n\nIn September 2022, six months after Russia's full-scale invasion, Ukraine applied to join NATO. Now, Ukraine's potential membership is one of the top questions that representatives from NATO's 32 member countries in North America and Europe will consider when they meet in Washington in July 2024.\n\nAt the root of debates over policy toward alliances such as NATO is the assumption that NATO requires its members to step in and help with defense if another member of the alliance is attacked.\n\nAs political scientists who study the role of international organizations like NATO, we think it is important to understand that, in reality, alliance agreements are more flexible than people think.\n\nIn practice, it is possible for the U.S. and other Western countries to stay out of a conflict that involves a NATO country without having to break their alliance commitments. The NATO treaty's language contains loopholes that let member countries remain out of other members' wars in certain situations.\n\nOne key part of the NATO treaty that countries sign when they join the alliance is called Article 5. This says that an \"armed attack\" against one NATO member in Europe or North America \"shall be considered an attack against them all.\"\n\nIn the case of such an attack, NATO countries agree to assist the country that requires help, including through \"the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.\"\n\nBut the treaty does not include a clear definition of a what an \"armed attack\" actually is.\n\nThis mattered in February 2020, when Turkey asked for a NATO meeting and requested that NATO intervene with military force in response to Russian and Syrian forces' attacks on its territory, which had killed 33 Turkish soldiers, during the Syrian civil war. NATO allies chose not to defend Turkey with military force, arguing that the level of violence against Turkey wasn't enough to call it an \"armed attack.\"\n\nEven when NATO members decide that Article 5 should apply to a specific situation, each country can still individually decide how to act. That is, while NATO does have administrative staff based in Brussels, there is no central NATO authority that tells each country what it must do.\n\nInstead, each country tells NATO what it is - and is not - willing to do.\n\nNATO members have only formally invoked Article 5 once - following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon outside of Washington.\n\nAt that time, 13 NATO countries sent fighter aircraft to help the U.S. patrol its skies from mid-October 2001 to mid-May 2002.\n\nBut most NATO allies chose not to send troops to Afghanistan to support the U.S. in its fight against the Taliban. This lack of action on the part of some NATO allies was not seen as breaking the treaty and didn't prompt a major debate - and the countries that chose not to join the fight were not sanctioned by or ejected from the alliance.\n\nThe NATO treaty also provides some exceptions based on geography. When Argentina went to war with the United Kingdom (a NATO member) over the Falkland Islands in 1982, the U.S. and other NATO members were able to use the fact that the alliance only applies to the North Atlantic region as a reason to stay out of the conflict.\n\nSome political scientists argue that voters will demand their leaders take the country to war to defend an ally. This implies that what really binds the members of an alliance together is not the legal text of an international treaty itself, given that no international court is empowered to enforce the treaty, but rather the public's expectations of what it means to be an ally.\n\nAs part of our research into how the American public thinks about international legal obligations, we decided to construct an experiment to see if presidents could use alliance loophole language to justify keeping the U.S. out of a war involving an ally.\n\nIn 2022 and 2023, we conducted a pair of survey-based experiments that involved asking nearly 5,000 American adults to consider a hypothetical scenario in which a U.S. ally comes under attack from a powerful neighbor.\n\nSome of the respondents were told that the text of the alliance treaty would allow the U.S. government to avoid having to send troops to defend the embattled ally, while others were not told that information. Though the survey did not mention a specific alliance, we described the terms of the alliance in a way that matches the language used in treaties like NATO's. We then asked the respondents to tell us their views on sending U.S. troops to defend the ally under attack.\n\nOur results revealed a big difference between the people who were told about the flexibility in the alliance treaty and those who were not. While respondents from both groups were generally inclined to come to the defense of an ally, their willingness to do so was significantly lower when they were told that the alliance treaty did not necessarily require the U.S. to send troops.\n\nThis suggests that political leaders can, under certain circumstances, manage to convince a large segment of the public that it's OK to abandon an ally in a time of need.\n\nSo, when it comes to debates about U.S. policy toward its alliance partners - and whether it should admit new members like Ukraine - it is important for both sides to appreciate that alliance commitments are not quite as binding, either legally or politically, as the conventional wisdom suggests.\n\nDan Reiter receives funding from the Charles W.

At some point -- and unless China changes course -- allies need to impose a cost. There should be consequences,\" Stoltenberg added.\n\nIn addition to the 32 members of the Nato alliance, the summit will also bring in four key partners from the Asia-Pacific: Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea.\n\nChina argues that it is not sending lethal assistance to either side -- unlike the United States and other Western nations.\n\nBeijing steered clear of a weekend summit in Switzerland promoted by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that reaffirmed Kyiv's demands for Russia to leave Ukrainian territory for any peace.\n\nRising Nato spending\n\nStoltenberg said that Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit this week to North Korea, which has supplied shells to Moscow despite being under UN sanctions, further showed how Moscow was \"dependent\" on authoritarian leaders.\n\nTrump -- who in the past has voiced admiration for Putin -- has boasted that he can quickly end the war, likely by pressing Ukraine to accept demands.\n\nTrump has long raged over what he sees as unfairness in Nato, founded to counter the Soviet Union.\n\nOn the campaign trail, he has suggested he would encourage Russia to \"do whatever the hell they want\" if Nato members do not \"pay your bills.\"\n\nIn the Oval Office, Stoltenberg told Biden that 23 of the 32 allies now met a pledge to spend at least two percent of GDP on defence, as the Ukraine invasion brings new security fears to Europe.\n\nA 2014 Nato summit set the funding goal that was then met by only three countries -- the United States, Britain and Greece. Stoltenberg last reported that 20 countries were achieving the target.\n\n\"Nato allies are this year increasing defense spending by 18 per cent. That's the biggest increase in decades,\" Stoltenberg said.\n\nIn a sharply different message than Trump, Biden hailed Nato, saying that since it has successfully \"deterred further Russian aggression in Europe\" through its promise to \"defend every inch of Nato territory.\"\n\nBracing for Trump\n\nIn an unstated bid to \"Trump-proof\" future efforts, Stoltenberg wants the Washington summit to commit the alliance to provide at least \u20ac40 billion (RM202 billion) a year in military aid to Ukraine and to put Nato in charge of coordination.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after his Wilson Center speech, Stoltenberg did not criticize Trump but pointed to the damage done on the battlefront by the delay in Congress approving a $60 billion package for Ukraine.\n\n\"Regardless of who's going to be the next president of the United States,\" Stoltenberg said, \"I believe that we should minimise the risk.\"\n\nStoltenberg, who led Nato throughout Trump's 2017-2021 presidency, said that successive US administrations had \"an absolutely valid point to say that European allies are spending too little.\"\n\n\"The good news is that's changing,\" Stoltenberg said.\n\n\"We're not saying that we are satisfied, but we are in a totally different place now than we were back in 2014,\" he said. -- AFP", "source": {"uri": "malaymail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Malay Mail"}, "authors": [],

But 20 European Nations 'Must Pay'", "body": "The dream of peace and security for all of Europe is within reach by correcting an ongoing and prevailing European NATO malady.\n\nWhile NATO was originally based on a model of shared responsibility, it has inappropriately morphed into 21 out of 32 member countries, with exceptions of non-2 % GDP contributing allies. With a Ukrainian-Russian war ongoing, this is detrimental to the NATO alliance and the rest of non-NATO Europe, particularly Ukraine.\n\nWhile NATO countries ought to have fulfilled their 2% GDP defense obligation, this was woefully never done.\n\nThe vast majority of NATO countries maneuvered not to fulfill this obligation. European countries comprise 30 of the 32 NATO members, together with the US and Canada. Of the 30 European members, only 10 (33%) fulfilled their 2023 2% GDP goal.\n\nThis leaves a sobering 20 European NATO countries (67%) that do not fulfill their minimum. The \"Honorable 10 European NATO Countries\" that do pay their dues are: Poland (3.9%), Greece 3.01%, Estonia 2.73%, Lithuania 2.54%, Finland 2.45%, Romania 2.44%, Hungary 2.43%, Latvia (2.27%), UK (2.07%), and Slovak Republic (2.03%). Outside of Europe, the US paid 3.49% of GDP and Canada 1.38%. Overall, it is the 10 Honorable European countries and the US that carry Europe's defense burden.\n\nA decade ago, the Obama Administration made it clear that NATO countries were not meeting their funding obligations: \"Everyone has to step up.\" The subsequent Trump Administration called for \"burden sharing.\" Yet no improvement has been made.\n\nEurope's welfare state, by the way, has grown exponentially as its defense spending has fallen.\n\nThe non-fulfilling NATO countries failed to grasp that today's global security threat is not just limited to Europe. Their assumption that the US would always be available in an emergency to protect them is no longer viable.\n\nThe US is overextended militarily and economically beyond Europe due to its worldwide security obligations. By necessity, America's security focus has shifted away from Europe to two other strategic regions: The Indo-Pacific and the Middle East. These increased global threats have necessarily drawn down US defense resources away from Europe. This should have been recognized by the non-contributing European countries long ago, but it hasn't. It is now time for Europe to have a reality check and to initiate new corrective actions to remedy the ongoing malaise. The sooner, the better.\n\nThe non-compliant NATO countries justifiably deserve to be nudged out of their self-imposed \"NATO Welfare Cocoon.\"\n\nEverything is to be gained by it. While Russia is rated as the world's third or fourth military power, it would pale in comparison to an honestly and fully funded European NATO superpower.\n\nEconomically, it would become a European Titan v. a Russian Pauper. Demographically, it is NATO Europe's billion inhabitants v. Russia's 144 million inhabitants. The European component of NATO alone would then have an undeniable deterrence supremacy that would cast a protective veil over all of the like-minded European countries. As such, Russia would cease to be a bona fide threat to Europe.\n\nThe most prominent measure to correct the present European security deficiency is to end the manipulation by the majority of non-paying NATO countries at the expense of the ten fully contributing European member countries.\n\nAs currently maneuvered by the majority of member countries, the position of NATO Secretary General is locked into one of their own. As such, it is important that a new Secretary General be appointed from one of the ten honorable contributing countries. This would reshape the leadership of NATO Headquarters into one that would effectively move to have all members contribute a minimum of 2% of GDP to defense.\n\nWithin NATO's 2% GDP-paying countries, there are well-qualified senior European leaders ready to lead NATO Headquarters. Such new leadership will be more capable of nudging its allies to pay up. It will result in a fully funded NATO with a viable and credible deterrence power within Europe.\n\nA new-era Secretary General leadership to also reshape NATO and redirect it toward Europe's real-world milieu with redefined core principles. These principles may well include: (1) Europe itself is now Europe's strategic responsibility, as allied with the US and Canada; (2) Realizing America's staggering global defense commitments extend beyond Europe; (3) America's army can no longer to be deemed as Europe's defensive army. (4) All European members are to contribute their minimum 2% of GDP; (5) Europe is no longer to be afraid of Russia, Russia is to be deterred by a powerful NATO Europe.\n\nThe underlying principle addressed here is that a fully funded NATO would become the dominant defensive power in Europe. The resulting nexus of such NATO supremacy interconnected with the remainder of Europe's non-NATO countries is undeniable.\n\nIn terms of Russia's own blustering terminology of \"Russia's Near Abroad\", a new reformed and fully funded \"European Centric NATO Superpower\" may tangibly view Europe's non-NATO countries as \"NATO's Near Abroad\".\n\nEurope has a responsibility to protect its people. This new strategic option is best suited to fulfill this responsibility and, at the same time, preclude Russia from labeling a preexisting NATO funding policy as a triggering \"escalation.\"\n\nThe resulting nexus of a new NATO superpower, together with its shared interests with its neighboring European countries, will strongly influence peace and security throughout Europe.", "source": {"uri":

Mr Putin has repeatedly said that the West's balance of power is shifting, and he has worked to strengthen ties with like-minded leaders.\n\n\"Russia right now is aligning more and more with authoritarian leaders,\" Mr Stoltenberg told the BBC, listing Iran, Beijing and North Korea.\n\nHe said that the North has sent artillery shells to Russia, and in return Russia had given advanced technology for North Korea's missile and nuclear programmes.\n\n\"So North Korea is helping Russia to conduct a war of aggression against Ukraine.\"\n\nSpeaking ahead of a meeting with US President Joe Biden, the Nato chief also announced that more than 20 nations are expected to meet a defence spending target of 2% this year - more than any other year since it was pledged in 2014.\n\n\"This is good for Europe and good for America, especially since much of this extra money is spent here in the United States,\" he said.\n\nMr Stoltenberg also addressed comments that he made to the Telegraph on Sunday which indicated that Nato may be considering increasing the number of deployable warheads as a deterrent against growing threats from Russia and China.\n\nThe comments were criticised as \"nothing but another escalation of tension\" by Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov.\n\nBut Mr Stoltenberg said they were a \"general message\" that Nato is a nuclear alliance, and that any attack on a Nato member will \"trigger a response from the whole alliance\".\n\n\"The purpose of Nato is not to fight the war, the purpose of that is to prevent the war,\" he said.", "source": {"uri":

This site does not give financial, investment or medical advice.\n\nOn June 20th, the Russian Government's RT News issued an English-language translation, titled \"Russia fears a NATO attack. Here's why.\", of a June 19th Russian-language article by Professor Igor Istomin, who is the acting head of the Department of Applied Analysis of International Problems, at MGIMO University, which is a part of Russia's Foreign Ministry. This article would not be so published if it did not express accurately the views and policies of Russia's Government.\n\nIt stated that there are three things which would spark a Russian response to eliminate \"the notorious 'decision centers'\" within NATO. 1: Russia's decision that in order to complete its win in Ukraine, the increase of NATO's involvement had become so large that conquering all of NATO will be needed in order to protect Russia's national security against the threat from NATO; 2: NATO's \"restricting Moscow's access to the Baltic Sea, which ignores the inevitable response to threats to Kaliningrad.\"; or 3 (in a poorly written passage): anything that would threaten Russia's most important naval base, which is in the Black Sea (at Sevastopol in Crimea).\n\nPublishing in The West this article, as coming from Professor Istomin instead of from Putin or even Lavrov (the Foreign Minister), is unofficially giving notice to all heads-of-state and legislatures in the U.S. empire, that in any of those three conditions, Russia will immediately eliminate them. However, elsewhere in the article, Istomin says that within NATO itself, the belief is instead that NATO \"still needs to work to prepare for a protracted confrontation that could lead to a clash with Russia\" rather than to prepare for that sudden \"clash with Russia.\" He is, in other words, saying that NATO is falsely assuming that in terms of the nuclear phase of WW3, NATO instead of Russia will be the first to strike. However, Istomin makes clear that \"Moscow doesn't countenance losing in any way\" the war in Ukraine. If it will need to resort to the nuclear phase in order to eliminate the threat that NATO is posing to Russia's inviolable national security -- Russia's sovereignty over its own land -- it will do so (and it will do so promptly -- without any \"protracted confrontation\").\n\nSo: in Russia's priorities, the worst possible outcome would be if Russia's central command becomes beheaded (such as by a blitz nuclear U.S. missile-strike from Ukraine only 317 miles away from The Kremlin, or by one from Finland only 507 miles away) and so Russia loses its sovereignty over its own territory. The second-worst is if Russia is forced to strike first in order to prevent that. And the best is if the U.S. and its colonies halt and permanently end their effort ever since 1945 to conquer Russia.\n\nRussia has zero interest in conquering the American empire (or any part of it) unless the rulers of America will never halt their goal of adding Russia to their empire. The imperialist nation here is America, NOT Russia -- and ALSO not China.\n\nNowhere in that article (nor clearly stated in anything else from Russia's Government) is the evidence presented that this war (the war in Ukraine) was started not by Putin in 2022 (as the U.S. empire lies to allege), but by Obama in 2024 -- so that that Obama was the aggressor (the violator of the U.N.'s Charter) and Putin is the defender, in this war; so, I shall, yet again, do that here, in order that any reader who will want to know whom the international war-criminal here is, will find the evidence on this matter to be found only a mere click away:\n\nWe are actually now in year ten of this war. The war in Ukraine started in 2014, as both NATO's Stoltenberg and Ukraine's Zelensky have said. It was started in February 2014 by a U.S. coup which replaced the democratically elected and neutralist President with a U.S. selected and rabidly anti-Russian leader, who immediately imposed an ethnic-cleansing program to get rid of the residents in the regions that had voted overwhelmingly for the overthrown President (who had been democratically elected). Russia responded militarily on 24 February 2022 in order to prevent Ukraine from allowing the U.S. to place a missile there a mere 317 miles or five minutes of missile-flying-time away from The Kremlin and thus too brief for Russia to respond before its central command would already be beheaded by America's nuclear strike. (As I headlined on 28 October 2022, \"NATO Wants To Place Nuclear Missiles On Finland's Russian Border -- Finland Says Yes\". The U.S. had demanded this, especially because it will place American nuclear missiles far nearer to The Kremlin than at present, only 507 miles away -- not as close as Ukraine, but the closest yet. That is the threat which Ukraine was posing to Russia -- the same threat that Cuba posed to America during the 1963 Cuban Missile Crisis.)\n\nUkraine was neutral between Russia and America until Obama's brilliantly executed Ukrainian coup, which his Administration started planning by no later than June 2011, culminated successfully in February 2014 and promptly appointed a rabid anti-Russian to impose in regions that rejected the new anti-Russian U.S.-controlled goverment an \"Anti-Terrorist Operation\" to kill protesters, and, ultimately, to terrorize the residents in those regions in order to kill as many of them as possible and to force the others to flee into Russia so that when elections would be held, pro-Russian voters would no longer be in the electorate.\n\nThe U.S. Government had engaged the Gallup polling organization, both before and after the coup, in order to poll Ukrainians, and especially ones who lived in its Crimean independent republic, regarding their views on U.S., Russia, NATO, and the EU; and, generally, Ukrainians were far more pro-Russia than pro-U.S., NATO, or EU, but this was especially the case in Crimea; so, America's Government knew that Crimeans would be especially resistant. However, this was not really new information. During 2003-2009, only around 20% of Ukrainians had wanted NATO membership, while around 55% opposed it. In 2010, Gallup found that whereas 17% of Ukrainians considered NATO to mean \"protection of your country,\" 40% said it's \"a threat to your country.\" Ukrainians predominantly saw NATO as an enemy, not a friend. But after Obama's February 2014 Ukrainian coup, \"Ukraine's NATO membership would get 53.4% of the votes, one third of Ukrainians (33.6%) would oppose it.\" However, afterward, the support averaged around 45% -- still over twice as high as had been the case prior to the coup.\n\nIn other words: what Obama did was generally successful, it grabbed Ukraine, or most of it, and it changed Ukrainians' minds regarding America and Russia. But only after the subsequent passage of time did the American billionaires' neoconservative heart become successfully grafted into the Ukrainian nation so as to make Ukraine a viable place to position U.S. nuclear missiles against Moscow (which is the U.S. Government's goal there). Furthermore: America's rulers also needed to do some work upon U.S. public opinion. Not until February of 2014 -- the time of Obama's coup -- did more than 15% of the American public have a \"very unfavorable\" view of Russia. (Right before Russia invaded Ukraine, that figure had already risen to 42%. America's press -- and academia or public-policy 'experts' -- have been very effective at managing public opinion, for the benefit of America's billionaires.)\n\n-- -- -- -- --\n\nInvestigative historian Eric Zuesse's latest book, AMERICA'S EMPIRE OF EVIL: Hitler's Posthumous Victory, and Why the Social Sciences Need to Change, is about how America took over the world after World War II in order to enslave it to U.S.-and-allied billionaires. Their cartels extract the world's wealth by control of not only their 'news' media but the social 'sciences' -- duping the public.\n\nfrom

'stop shifting blame' over Ukraine war - Times of India", "body": "BEIJING: China on Tuesday urged Nato to \"stop shifting blame\" over the Ukraine war after the Western military alliance's chief accused Beijing of worsening the conflict through support of Russia.\n\nNato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg on Monday called for China to face consequences for what US officials have called a major export push to rebuild Russia's defence industry.\n\nChina presents itself as a neutral party in the Ukraine war, and says it is not sending lethal assistance to either side, unlike the United States and other Western nations.\n\nOn Tuesday, Beijing said Nato \"should engage in self-reflection rather than arbitrary smears and attacks on China\".\n\nDomestically, Russian president Vladimir Putin has framed the 2022 invasion as a defensive move against an expanding Nato.\n\n\"We advise (NATO) to stop shifting blame and sowing discord, not add fuel to the fire and instigate confrontation, but rather do something practical for the political settlement of the crisis,\" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said at a regular press briefing.\n\nChina and Russia's strategic partnership has only grown closer since the invasion of Ukraine, but Beijing has rebuffed Western claims that it is aiding Moscow's war effort.\n\nIt has however offered a critical lifeline to Russia's isolated economy, with trade booming since the conflict began.\n\nAnd G7 foreign ministers on Friday expressed \"strong concern\" about transfers of dual use materials and weapons components from Chinese businesses to Russia being used by Moscow for its military expansion.\n\nChina steered clear of a weekend summit in Switzerland promoted by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy that reaffirmed Kyiv's demands for Russia to leave Ukrainian territory for any peace to be won.\n\nChinese president Xi Jinping \"has tried to create the impression that he is taking a back seat in this conflict, to avoid sanctions and keep trade flowing,\" Stoltenberg said Monday on a visit to Washington.\n\n\"But the reality is that China is fuelling the largest armed conflict in Europe since World War II,\" he said, warning that \"at some point... there should be consequences\".\n\nNato next month celebrates its 75th anniversary with a summit in Washington that aims to send a decisive long-term message of support for Ukraine ahead of President Joe Biden's re-election fight against Republican candidate Donald Trump.\n\n\"The more credible our long-term support, the quicker Moscow will realise it cannot wait us out,\" Stoltenberg said.\n\n\"It may seem like a paradox, but the path to peace is more weapons for Ukraine,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType":

Everything is intertwined and therefore we need to address these challenges together.\n\nAnd this is also one of the reasons why, at NATO and at the NATO summit here in Washington next month, we will further strengthen our partnership with our partners in Asia Pacific region, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea and Japan,\" added Stoltenberg.\n\nUkraine names commander of drone systems Net profit of Turkish banking sector up 31.8% in April Zelensky's office calls Putin's peace proposal far from reality", "source": {"uri": "en.apa.az", "dataType": "news", "title": "Azeri - Press Informasiya Agentliyi"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_General_of_NATO", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secretary General of NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jens_Stoltenberg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jens Stoltenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Authoritarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_summit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NATO summit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia-Pacific", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asia-Pacific"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Image_Galleries", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Image Galleries", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Conventions", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://en.apa.az/storage/news/2024/june/18/resize/6671dfc73c13f6671dfc73c14017187388876671dfc73c13b6671dfc73c13d.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659612", "eventUri": "eng-9659612", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

Sachs - Why Won't the US Help Negotiate a Peaceful End to the War in Ukraine? - Russia News Now", "body": "The quicker the neocon fantasy of defeating Russia and getting Ukraine in NATO is binned, the quicker negotiations with Russia can take place on the terms of peace and this awful war can be brought to an end.\n\nCross-posted from Common Dreams\n\nFor the fifth time since 2008, Russia has proposed to negotiate with the U.S. over security arrangements, this time in proposals made by President Vladimir Putin on June 14, 2024. Four previous times, the U.S. rejected the offer of negotiations in favor of a neocon strategy to weaken or dismember Russia through war and covert operations. The U.S. neocon tactics have failed disastrously, devastating Ukraine in the process, and endangering the whole world. After all the warmongering, it's time for Biden to open negotiations for peace with Russia.\n\nSince the end of the Cold War, the U.S. grand strategy has been to weaken Russia. As early as 1992, then Defense Secretary Richard Cheney opined that following the 1991 demise of the Soviet Union, Russia too should be dismembered. Zbigniew Brzezinski opined in 1997 that Russia should be divided into three loosely confederated entities in Russian Europe, Siberia, and the far east. In 1999, the U.S.-led NATO alliance bombed Russia's ally, Serbia, for 78 days in order to break Serbia apart and install a massive NATO military base in breakaway Kosovo. Leaders of the U.S. military-industrial complex vociferously supported the Chechen war against Russia in the early 2000s.\n\nTo secure these U.S. advances against Russia, Washington aggressively pushed NATO enlargement, despite promises to Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin that NATO would not move one inch eastward from Germany. Most tendentiously, the U.S. pushed NATO enlargement to Ukraine and Georgia, with the idea of surrounding Russia's naval fleet in Sevastopol, Crimea with NATO states: Ukraine, Romania (NATO member 2004), Bulgaria (NATO member 2004), Turkey (NATO member 1952), and Georgia, an idea straight from the playbook of the British Empire in the Crimean War (1853-6).\n\nBrzezinski spelled out a chronology of NATO enlargement in 1997, including NATO membership of Ukraine during 2005-2010. The U.S. in fact proposed NATO membership for Ukraine and Georgia at the 2008 NATO Bucharest Summit. By 2020, NATO had in fact enlarged by 14 countries in Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and the former Soviet Union (Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland in 1999; Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia in 2004; Albania and Croatia, 2009; Montenegro, 2017; and Northern Macedonia, 2020), while promising future membership to Ukraine and Georgia.\n\nIn short, the 30-year U.S. project, hatched originally by Cheney and the neocons, and carried forward consistently since then, has been to weaken or even dismember Russia, surround Russia with NATO forces, and depict Russia as the belligerent power.\n\nIt is against this grim backdrop that Russian leaders have repeatedly proposed to negotiate security arrangements with Europe and the U.S. that would provide security for all countries concerned, not just the NATO bloc. Guided by the neocon game plan, the U.S. has refused to negotiate on every occasion, while trying to pin the blame on Russia for the lack of negotiations.\n\nIn June 2008, as the U.S. prepared to expand NATO to Ukraine and Georgia, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev proposed a European Security Treaty, calling for collective security and an end to NATO's unilateralism. Suffice it to say, the U.S. showed no interest whatsoever in Russia's proposals, and instead proceeded with its long-held plans for NATO enlargement.\n\nThe second Russian proposal for negotiations came from Putin following the violent overthrow of Ukraine's President Viktor Yanukovych in February 2014, with the active complicity if not outright leadership of the U.S. government. I happened to see the U.S. complicity up close, as the post-coup government invited me for urgent economic discussions. When I arrived in Kiev, I was taken to the Maidan, where I was told directly about U.S. funding of the Maidan protest.\n\nThe evidence of U.S. complicity in the coup is overwhelming. Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland was caught on a phone line in January 2014 plotting the change of government in Ukraine. Meanwhile, U.S. Senators went personally to Kiev to stir up the protests (akin to Chinese or Russian political leaders coming to DC on January 6, 2020 to rile up the crowds). On February 21, 2014, the Europeans, U.S., and Russia brokered a deal with Yanukovych in which Yanukovich agreed to early elections. Yet the coup leaders reneged on the deal the same day, took over government buildings, threatened more violence, and deposed Yanukovych the next day. The U.S. supported the coup and immediately extended recognition to the new government.\n\nIn my view, this was a standard CIA-led covert regime change operation, of which there have been several dozen around the world, including sixty-four episodes between 1947 and 1989 meticulously documented by Professor Lindsey O'Rourke. Covert regime-change operations are of course not really hidden from view, but the U.S. government vociferously denies its role, keeps all documents highly confidential, and systematically gaslights the world: \"Do not believe what you see plainly with your own eyes! The U.S. had nothing to do with this.\" Details of the operations eventually emerge, however, through eyewitnesses, whistleblowers, the forced release of documents under the Freedom of Information Act, declassification of papers after years or decades, and memoirs, but all far too late for real accountability.\n\nIn any event, the violent coup induced the ethnic-Russia Donbas region of Eastern Ukraine to break from the coup leaders, many of whom were extreme Russophobic nationalists, and some in violent groups with a history of Nazi SS links in the past. Almost immediately, the coup leaders took steps to repress the use of the Russian language even in the Russian-speaking Donbas. In the following months and years, the government in Kiev launched a military campaign to retake the breakaway regions, deploying neo-Nazi paramilitary units and U.S. arms.\n\nIn the course of 2014, Putin called repeatedly for a negotiated peace, and this led to the Minsk II Agreement in February 2015 based on autonomy of the Donbas and an end to violence by both sides. Russia did not claim the Donbas as Russian territory, but instead called for autonomy and the protection of ethnic Russians within Ukraine. The UN Security Council endorsed the Minsk II agreement, but the U.S. neocons privately subverted it. Years later, Chancellor Angela Merkel blurted out the truth. The Western side treated the agreement not as a solemn treaty but as a delaying tactic to \"give Ukraine time\" to build its military strength. In the meantime, around 14,000 people died in the fighting in Donbas between 2014 and 2021.\n\nFollowing the definitive collapse of the Minsk II agreement, Putin again proposed negotiations with the U.S. in December 2021. By that point, the issues went even beyond NATO enlargement to include fundamental issues of nuclear armaments. Step by step, the U.S. neocons had abandoned nuclear arms control with Russia, with the U.S. unilaterally abandoning the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty in 2002, placing Aegis missiles in Poland and Romania in 2010 onwards, and walking out of the Intermediate Nuclear Force (INF) Treaty in 2019.\n\nIn view of these dire concerns, Putin put on the table on December 15, 2021 a draft \"Treaty between the United States of America and the Russian Federation on Security Guarantees.\" The most immediate issue on the table (Article 4 of the draft treaty) was the end of the U.S. attempt to expand NATO to Ukraine. I called U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan at the end of 2021 to try to convince the Biden White House to enter the negotiations. My main advice was to avoid a war in Ukraine by accepting Ukraine's neutrality, rather than NATO membership, which was a bright red line for Russia.\n\nThe White House flatly rejected the advice, claiming remarkably (and obtusely) that NATO's enlargement to Ukraine was none of Russia's business! Yet what would the U.S. say if some country in the Western hemisphere decided to host Chinese or Russian bases? Would the White House, State Department, or Congress say, \"That's just fine, that's a matter of concern only to Russia or China and the host country?\" No. The world nearly came to nuclear Armageddon in 1962 when the Soviet Union placed nuclear missiles in Cuba and the U.S. imposed a naval quarantine and threatened war unless the Russians removed the missiles. The U.S. military alliance does not belong in Ukraine any more than the Russian or Chinese military belongs close to the U.S. border.\n\nThe fourth offer of Putin to negotiate came in March 2022, when Russia and Ukraine nearly closed a peace deal just weeks after the start of Russia's special military operation that began on February 24, 2022. Russia, once again, was after one big thing: Ukraine's neutrality, i.e., no NATO membership and no hosting of U.S. missiles on Russia's border.\n\nUkraine's President Vladimir Zelensky quickly accepted Ukraine's neutrality, and Ukraine and Russia exchanged papers, with the skillful mediation of the Foreign Ministry of Turkey. Then suddenly, at the end of March, Ukraine abandoned the negotiations.\n\nU.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, following in the tradition of British anti-Russian war-mongering dating back to the Crimean War (1853-6), actually flew to Kiev to warn Zelensky against neutrality and the importance of Ukraine defeating Russia on the battlefield. Since that date, Ukraine has lost around 500,000 dead and is on the ropes on the battlefield.\n\nNow we have Russia's fifth offer of negotiations, explained clearly and cogently by Putin himself in his speech to diplomats at the Russian Foreign Ministry on June 14. Putin laid out Russia's proposed terms to end the war in Ukraine.\n\n\"Ukraine should adopt a neutral, non-aligned status, be nuclear- free, and undergo demilitarization and de-nazification,\" Putin said. \"These parameters were broadly agreed upon during the Istanbul negotiations in 2022, including specific details on demilitarization such as the agreed numbers of tanks and other military equipment. We reached consensus on all points.\n\n\"Certainly, the rights, freedoms, and interests of Russian-speaking citizens in Ukraine must be fully protected,\" he continued. \"The new territorial realities, including the status of Crimea, Sevastopol, Donetsk and Lugansk people's republics, Kherson, and Zaporozhye regions as parts of the Russian Federation, should be acknowledged. These foundational principles need to be formalized through fundamental international agreements in the future. Naturally, this entails the removal of all Western sanctions against Russia as well.\"\n\nLet me say a few words about negotiating.\n\nRussia's proposals should now be met at the negotiating table by proposals from the U.S. and Ukraine. The White House is dead wrong to evade negotiations just because of disagreements with Russia's proposals. It should put up its own proposals and get down to the business of negotiating an end to the war.\n\nThere are three core issues for Russia: Ukraine's neutrality (non-NATO enlargement), Crimea remaining in Russian hands, and boundary changes in Eastern and Southern Ukraine. The first two are almost surely non-negotiable. The end of NATO enlargement is the fundamental casus belli. Crimea is also core for Russia, as Crimea has been home to Russia's Black Sea fleet since 1783 and is fundamental to Russia's national security.\n\nThe third core issue, the borders of Eastern and Southern Ukraine, will be a key point of negotiations. The U.S. cannot pretend that borders are sacrosanct after NATO bombed Serbia in 1999 to relinquish Kosovo, and after the U.S. pressured Sudan to relinquish South Sudan. Yes, Ukraine's borders will be redrawn as the result of the 10 years of war, the situation on the battlefield, the choices of the local populations, and tradeoffs made at the negotiating table.\n\nBiden needs to accept that negotiations are not a sign of weakness. As Kennedy put it, \"Never negotiate out of fear, but never fear to negotiate.\" Ronald Reagan famously described his own negotiating strategy using a Russian proverb, \"Trust but verify.\"\n\nThe neocon approach to Russia, delusional and hubristic from the start, lies in ruins. NATO will never enlarge to Ukraine and Georgia. Russia will not be toppled by a CIA covert operation. Ukraine is being horribly bloodied on the battlefield, often losing 1,000 or more dead and wounded in a single day. The failed neocon game plan brings us closer to nuclear Armageddon.\n\nYet Biden still refuses to negotiate. Following Putin's speech, the U.S., NATO, and Ukraine firmly rejected negotiations once again. Biden and his team have still not relinquished the neocon fantasy of defeating Russia and expanding NATO to Ukraine.\n\nThe Ukrainian people have been lied to time and again by Zelensky and Biden and other leaders of NATO countries, who told them falsely and repeatedly that Ukraine would prevail on the battlefield and that there were no options to negotiate. Ukraine is now under martial law. The public is given no say about its own slaughter.\n\nFor the sake of Ukraine's very survival, and to avoid nuclear war, the President of the United States has one overriding responsibility today: Negotiate.\n\nDue to the Israeli war crimes in Gaza we have increased our coverage from five to six days a week.

They woke him and said to him, \"Teacher, do you not care that we are perishing?\" He woke up, rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, \"Quiet! Be still!\" The wind ceased, and there was great calm. Then he asked them, \"Why are you terrified? Do you not yet have faith?\" They were filled with great awe and said to one another, \"Who then is this whom even wind and sea obey?\"\n\n- The Gospel of Saint Mark, 4:38-41\n\nNOT a few million people across the planet must feel like the Apostles on the storm-tossed boat in the above June 23 Mass Gospel reading, especially with escalating confrontations between the West, led by the United States, and the \"East\" bloc of Eurasian mega-powers Russia and China -- now laced with nuclear war threats.\n\nWhat could escalate superpower frictions to atomic proportions are not just warnings from Russian President Vladimir Putin to the US-led North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) that entering the Ukraine conflict risks nuclear war. Russia has also staged exercises in launching and weathering battlefield nukes.\n\nAlso, America plans to deploy atomic projectiles in Britain, prompting stern Putin warnings. Ukraine drones hit three radar sites of Russia's missile early warning system -- that could facilitate surprise nuclear attacks.\n\nGet the latest news\n\ndelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\nUkraine's military intelligence agency also reportedly targeted Russia's main base for long-range nuclear bombers.\n\nAmerican F-16 jets bound for Ukraine can deliver nukes. Packing multiple warheads, Russian vessels have sailed within striking range of the US East Coast. And NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg disclosed discussions on making atomic weapons currently in storage ready for use.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRaising atomic risks further is the war situation. Russia's 800,000 troops in and around Ukraine, Europe's most powerful since World War II, are poised to overwhelm the manpower- and armaments-depleted defenders. Like past Putin proposals, NATO and Ukraine have rejected his latest call for negotiations, dismissed as legitimizing occupation. Russia may then finally crush Ukrainian forces this summer. If NATO intervenes, fighting could go nuclear.\n\nBelievers may wonder if, like Jesus in the storm, God slumbers while war winds blow. And many surely hope He would calm today's geopolitical waves as Christ did the angry Sea of Galilee.\n\nIn fact, God may have already done some calming despite devastating conflicts in Ukraine and Israel. A month after Putin's February 2022 invasion, Pope Francis and many thousands of bishops worldwide consecrated Russia, Ukraine and the world to the Immaculate Heart of Mary on the March 25 feast of the Annunciation of Christ's Incarnation -- the prayer Our Lady of Fatima asked for peace.\n\nSure enough, Putin and Ukraine President Volodymir Zelenskyy forged a peace deal then: Russian forces would withdraw if Ukraine didn't join NATO -- allaying Moscow's fear that alliance projectiles would deploy just minutes away, able to nuke without retaliation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut NATO got Zelenskyy to scrap the accord and keep fighting with alliance arms and aid, as Western media now belatedly admit. However, that apparent peace-making failure probably avoided nuclear superpower conflict.\n\nIf fighting had ended in 2022, Ukraine's 600,000-strong military would be even larger and better armed today -- Zelenskyy had pledged to double its size. NATO would have also built up armies and armaments. That could have led to a NATO-Russia war to retake the Crimean Peninsula and eastern Ukraine regions seized by Moscow in 2014.\n\nInstead, two-and-a-half years of conflict decimated Ukraine's army and depleted Western arms while Russia mobilized 300,000 reserves and put its industry on war footing. Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies said \"it is unrealistic to expect Russia to ever run out of missiles.\" America, however, would exhaust precision-guided munitions within days of Taiwan fighting, the think-tank cautioned.\n\nWith that self-inflicted NATO predicament, plus the threat of a major Middle East conflict triggered by Palestinian carnage in Gaza, Washington has turned war-shy. Even more so with presidential elections in November -- body-bagged US soldiers would drive voters away from President Joseph Biden and his Democratic Party.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Teresa of Avila said, God writes straight with crooked lines. And He's not done with America.\n\nWhither Uncle Sam's clout?\n\nRather than building unity and harmony in a multipolar world after Soviet communism imploded in 1991, Washington has sought world dominance. Today, the first global priority in its National Security Strategy, released by the Biden administration in October 2022, is \"Out-Competing China, Constraining Russia.\"\n\nDespite objections even from Western diplomats, NATO expanded closer to Russia. That prompted Putin to invade twice when Ukraine was set to enter an alliance with three nuclear-armed powers and two nations that had thrice invaded his country. The grouping waged war beyond its borders, battling in the Balkans, Afghanistan and the Middle East. And NATO members have joined Washington in challenging Beijing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Asia, America is building blocs against China, mobilizing Australia, Japan and India in the Quadrilateral Alliance, and weaponizing the Philippines with bases and probably rocket batteries -- risking attacks all over our country. Plus, the Australia-United Kingdom-US pact to provide nuclear submarines and long-range missiles to Australia's navy.\n\nBut heaven may have other plans. With NATO's failure to weaken Russia by prolonging the Ukraine war, Europe now has strong reason to doubt Washington's leadership. That dissonance will grow if Russia crushes Ukraine, as impartial analysts expect. Then repeatedly rejecting Moscow's peace-for-Ukraine neutrality proposals, including some before 2022, would prove tragically mistaken, as veteran British diplomat Alastair Crooke argues (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8UIf0p5_2c).\n\nAlso eroding trust in America are strong suspicions that it sabotaged Germany's Nord Stream pipelines for Russian gas, as reported by renowned US investigative journalist Seymour Hersch.\n\nMany Europeans must now wonder if Washington compromises allies to compete with rival mega-powers and advance its global dominance (that question applies to Asia as well). And if Donald Trump wins and curbs American military action abroad, Europe's reliance on the US and compliance with its wishes would further decline.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUncle Sam's clout is also challenged outside the West, as we shall discuss on June 30.\n\nPlainly, God never yields His throne.", "source": {"uri": "manilatimes.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Manila times"},

Four previous times, the U.S. rejected the offer of negotiations in favor of a neocon strategy to weaken or dismember Russia through war and covert operations. The U.S. neocon tactics have failed disastrously, devastating Ukraine in the process, and endangering the whole world. After all the warmongering, it's time for Biden to open negotiations for peace with Russia.\n\nSince the end of the Cold War, the U.S. grand strategy has been to weaken Russia. As early as 1992, then Defense Secretary Richard Cheney opined that following the 1991 demise of the Soviet Union, Russia too should be dismembered. Zbigniew Brzezinski opined in 1997 that Russia should be divided into three loosely confederated entities in Russian Europe, Siberia, and the far east. In 1999, the U.S.-led NATO alliance bombed Russia's ally, Serbia, for 78 days in order to break Serbia apart and install a massive NATO military base in breakaway Kosovo. Leaders of the U.S. military-industrial complex vociferously supported the Chechen war against Russia in the early 2000s.\n\nTo secure these U.S. advances against Russia, Washington aggressively pushed NATO enlargement, despite promises to Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin that NATO would not move one inch eastward from Germany. Most tendentiously, the U.S. pushed NATO enlargement to Ukraine and Georgia, with the idea of surrounding Russia's naval fleet in Sevastopol, Crimea with NATO states: Ukraine, Romania (NATO member 2004), Bulgaria (NATO member 2004), Turkey (NATO member 1952), and Georgia, an idea straight from the playbook of the British Empire in the Crimean War (1853-6).\n\nBrzezinski spelled out a chronology of NATO enlargement in 1997, including NATO membership of Ukraine during 2005-2010. The U.S. in fact proposed NATO membership for Ukraine and Georgia at the 2008 NATO Bucharest Summit. By 2020, NATO had in fact enlarged by 14 countries in Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and the former Soviet Union (Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland in 1999; Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia in 2004; Albania and Croatia, 2009; Montenegro, 2017; and Northern Macedonia, 2020), while promising future membership to Ukraine and Georgia.\n\nThe White House is dead wrong to evade negotiations just because of disagreements with Russia's proposals. It should put up its own proposals and get down to the business of negotiating an end to the war.\n\nIn short, the 30-year U.S. project, hatched originally by Cheney and the neocons, and carried forward consistently since then, has been to weaken or even dismember Russia, surround Russia with NATO forces, and depict Russia as the belligerent power.\n\nIt is against this grim backdrop that Russian leaders have repeatedly proposed to negotiate security arrangements with Europe and the U.S. that would provide security for all countries concerned, not just the NATO bloc. Guided by the neocon game plan, the U.S. has refused to negotiate on every occasion, while trying to pin the blame on Russia for the lack of negotiations.\n\nIn June 2008, as the U.S. prepared to expand NATO to Ukraine and Georgia, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev proposed a European Security Treaty, calling for collective security and an end to NATO's unilateralism. Suffice it to say, the U.S. showed no interest whatsoever in Russia's proposals, and instead proceeded with its long-held plans for NATO enlargement.\n\nThe second Russian proposal for negotiations came from Putin following the violent overthrow of Ukraine's President Viktor Yanukovych in February 2014, with the active complicity if not outright leadership of the U.S. government. I happened to see the U.S. complicity up close, as the post-coup government invited me for urgent economic discussions. When I arrived in Kiev, I was taken to the Maidan, where I was told directly about U.S. funding of the Maidan protest.\n\nThe evidence of U.S. complicity in the coup is overwhelming. Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland was caught on a phone line in January 2014 plotting the change of government in Ukraine. Meanwhile, U.S. Senators went personally to Kiev to stir up the protests (akin to Chinese or Russian political leaders coming to DC on January 6, 2020 to rile up the crowds). On February 21, 2014, the Europeans, U.S., and Russia brokered a deal with Yanukovych in which Yanukovich agreed to early elections. Yet the coup leaders reneged on the deal the same day, took over government buildings, threatened more violence, and deposed Yanukovych the next day. The U.S. supported the coup and immediately extended recognition to the new government.\n\nIn my view, this was a standard CIA-led covert regime change operation, of which there have been several dozen around the world, including sixty-four episodes between 1947 and 1989 meticulously documented by Professor Lindsey O'Rourke. Covert regime-change operations are of course not really hidden from view, but the U.S. government vociferously denies its role, keeps all documents highly confidential, and systematically gaslights the world: \"Do not believe what you see plainly with your own eyes! The U.S. had nothing to do with this.\" Details of the operations eventually emerge, however, through eyewitnesses, whistleblowers, the forced release of documents under the Freedom of Information Act, declassification of papers after years or decades, and memoirs, but all far too late for real accountability.\n\nIn any event, the violent coup induced the ethnic-Russia Donbas region of Eastern Ukraine to break from the coup leaders, many of whom were extreme Russophobic nationalists, and some in violent groups with a history of Nazi SS links in the past. Almost immediately, the coup leaders took steps to repress the use of the Russian language even in the Russian-speaking Donbas. In the following months and years, the government in Kiev launched a military campaign to retake the breakaway regions, deploying neo-Nazi paramilitary units and U.S. arms.\n\nIn the course of 2014, Putin called repeatedly for a negotiated peace, and this led to the Minsk II Agreement in February 2015 based on autonomy of the Donbas and an end to violence by both sides. Russia did not claim the Donbas as Russian territory, but instead called for autonomy and the protection of ethnic Russians within Ukraine. The UN Security Council endorsed the Minsk II agreement, but the U.S. neocons privately subverted it. Years later, Chancellor Angela Merkel blurted out the truth. The Western side treated the agreement not as a solemn treaty but as a delaying tactic to \"give Ukraine time\" to build its military strength. In the meantime, around 14,000 people died in the fighting in Donbas between 2014 and 2021.\n\nFollowing the definitive collapse of the Minsk II agreement, Putin again proposed negotiations with the U.S. in December 2021. By that point, the issues went even beyond NATO enlargement to include fundamental issues of nuclear armaments. Step by step, the U.S. neocons had abandoned nuclear arms control with Russia, with the U.S. unilaterally abandoning the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty in 2002, placing Aegis missiles in Poland and Romania in 2010 onwards, and walking out of the Intermediate Nuclear Force (INF) Treaty in 2019.\n\nIn view of these dire concerns, Putin put on the table on December 15, 2021 a draft \"Treaty between the United States of America and the Russian Federation on Security Guarantees.\" The most immediate issue on the table (Article 4 of the draft treaty) was the end of the U.S. attempt to expand NATO to Ukraine. I called U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan at the end of 2021 to try to convince the Biden White House to enter the negotiations. My main advice was to avoid a war in Ukraine by accepting Ukraine's neutrality, rather than NATO membership, which was a bright red line for Russia.\n\nThe White House flatly rejected the advice, claiming remarkably (and obtusely) that NATO's enlargement to Ukraine was none of Russia's business! Yet what would the U.S. say if some country in the Western hemisphere decided to host Chinese or Russian bases? Would the White House, State Department, or Congress say, \"That's just fine, that's a matter of concern only to Russia or China and the host country?\" No. The world nearly came to nuclear Armageddon in 1962 when the Soviet Union placed nuclear missiles in Cuba and the U.S. imposed a naval quarantine and threatened war unless the Russians removed the missiles. The U.S. military alliance does not belong in Ukraine any more than the Russian or Chinese military belongs close to the U.S. border.\n\nThe fourth offer of Putin to negotiate came in March 2022, when Russia and Ukraine nearly closed a peace deal just weeks after the start of Russia's special military operation that began on February 24, 2022. Russia, once again, was after one big thing: Ukraine's neutrality, i.e., no NATO membership and no hosting of U.S. missiles on Russia's border.\n\nUkraine's President Vladimir Zelensky quickly accepted Ukraine's neutrality, and Ukraine and Russia exchanged papers, with the skillful mediation of the Foreign Ministry of Turkey. Then suddenly, at the end of March, Ukraine abandoned the negotiations.\n\nU.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, following in the tradition of British anti-Russian war-mongering dating back to the Crimean War (1853-6), actually flew to Kiev to warn Zelensky against neutrality and the importance of Ukraine defeating Russia on the battlefield. Since that date, Ukraine has lost around 500,000 dead and is on the ropes on the battlefield.\n\nNow we have Russia's fifth offer of negotiations, explained clearly and cogently by Putin himself in his speech to diplomats at the Russian Foreign Ministry on June 14. Putin laid out Russia's proposed terms to end the war in Ukraine.\n\n\"Ukraine should adopt a neutral, non-aligned status, be nuclear- free, and undergo demilitarization and de-nazification,\" Putin said. \"These parameters were broadly agreed upon during the Istanbul negotiations in 2022, including specific details on demilitarization such as the agreed numbers of tanks and other military equipment. We reached consensus on all points.\n\n\"Certainly, the rights, freedoms, and interests of Russian-speaking citizens in Ukraine must be fully protected,\" he continued. \"The new territorial realities, including the status of Crimea, Sevastopol, Donetsk and Lugansk people's republics, Kherson, and Zaporozhye regions as parts of the Russian Federation, should be acknowledged. These foundational principles need to be formalized through fundamental international agreements in the future. Naturally, this entails the removal of all Western sanctions against Russia as well.\"\n\nLet me say a few words about negotiating.\n\nRussia's proposals should now be met at the negotiating table by proposals from the U.S. and Ukraine. The White House is dead wrong to evade negotiations just because of disagreements with Russia's proposals. It should put up its own proposals and get down to the business of negotiating an end to the war.\n\nThere are three core issues for Russia: Ukraine's neutrality (non-NATO enlargement), Crimea remaining in Russian hands, and boundary changes in Eastern and Southern Ukraine. The first two are almost surely non-negotiable. The end of NATO enlargement is the fundamental casus belli. Crimea is also core for Russia, as Crimea has been home to Russia's Black Sea fleet since 1783 and is fundamental to Russia's national security.\n\nThe third core issue, the borders of Eastern and Southern Ukraine, will be a key point of negotiations. The U.S. cannot pretend that borders are sacrosanct after NATO bombed Serbia in 1999 to relinquish Kosovo, and after the U.S. pressured Sudan to relinquish South Sudan. Yes, Ukraine's borders will be redrawn as the result of the 10 years of war, the situation on the battlefield, the choices of the local populations, and tradeoffs made at the negotiating table.\n\nBiden needs to accept that negotiations are not a sign of weakness. As Kennedy put it, \"Never negotiate out of fear, but never fear to negotiate.\" Ronald Reagan famously described his own negotiating strategy using a Russian proverb, \"Trust but verify.\"\n\nThe neocon approach to Russia, delusional and hubristic from the start, lies in ruins. NATO will never enlarge to Ukraine and Georgia. Russia will not be toppled by a CIA covert operation. Ukraine is being horribly bloodied on the battlefield, often losing 1,000 or more dead and wounded in a single day. The failed neocon game plan brings us closer to nuclear Armageddon.\n\nYet Biden still refuses to negotiate. Following Putin's speech, the U.S., NATO, and Ukraine firmly rejected negotiations once again. Biden and his team have still not relinquished the neocon fantasy of defeating Russia and expanding NATO to Ukraine.\n\nThe Ukrainian people have been lied to time and again by Zelensky and Biden and other leaders of NATO countries, who told them falsely and repeatedly that Ukraine would prevail on the battlefield and that there were no options to negotiate. Ukraine is now under martial law. The public is given no say about its own slaughter.\n\nFor the sake of Ukraine's very survival, and to avoid nuclear war, the President of the United States has one overriding responsibility today: Negotiate.", "source": {"uri": "commondreams.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Common Dreams"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donbas", "type": "wiki", "score": 5,

The German and Danish defense ministers have warned that Russia could attack NATO allies \"within five years.\" Conflict could come sooner if Russia achieves a breakthrough on the battlefield in Ukraine. And by the end of the year, former U.S. President Donald Trump, who has urged Russian leaders to \"do whatever the hell they want\" to NATO members who \"don't pay up,\" referring to the alliance's spending target, could be the president-elect. Meanwhile, whoever occupies the White House will continue to shift U.S. resources to the Indo-Pacific. The United States' force posture in Europe will recede. The only question is whether that happens gradually or suddenly.\n\nTransatlantic security is built on two pillars: U.S. power and European power. Should the United States falter in its commitment to NATO or be stretched too thinly between theaters, Europe would bear the burden of protecting the continent.

He emphasized that a consistent supply of weapons to Ukraine is the only way to end the ongoing conflict.\n\nThe upcoming July summit aims to send a strong, enduring message of support for Ukraine, particularly as President Joe Biden faces a challenging reelection campaign against Donald Trump, who has expressed skepticism about Western support for Kyiv.\n\nStoltenberg accused China of exacerbating the conflict by rebuilding Russia's defence industry through significant exports, as reported by US officials. He stated, \"Beijing cannot have it both ways. At some point -- and unless China changes course -- allies need to impose a cost. There should be consequences.\"\n\nThe Nato summit will include not only the 32 alliance members but also four key partners from the Asia-Pacific region: Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea. Stoltenberg highlighted Russian President Vladimir Putin's recent visit to North Korea, which has provided shells to Moscow despite UN sanctions, as further evidence of Russia's reliance on authoritarian leaders.\n\nIn an effort to \"Trump-proof\" future endeavors, Stoltenberg aims to position Nato at the forefront of coordination on Ukraine and establish a mechanism for long-term military funding. He emphasized, \"The more credible our long-term support, the quicker Moscow will realize it cannot wait us out.\" Despite the apparent paradox, Stoltenberg believes that providing more weapons to Ukraine is the path to peace.\n\nStoltenberg also plans to inform Biden about the increasing number of Nato members meeting the 2014 goal of allocating two percent of their GDP to defence spending. He acknowledged that successive US administrations have had a valid point in criticizing European allies for spending too little on defence.\n\nHowever, he noted that the situation is changing, and while not entirely satisfied, Nato is in a significantly different position compared to 2014. \"The good news is that's changing,\" Stoltenberg said.\n\n\"We're not saying that we are satisfied, but we are in a totally different place now than we were back in 2014.\"\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Panel discussions included Russia's war on Ukraine, NATO deterrence and defence strategy and the Euro-Atlantic industrial capacity. The seminar is designed for senior advisors to Heads of State and Government in Allied nations and was opened by NATO Deputy Secretary General Mr Mircea Geoan\u0103.\n\nIn his keynote speech Admiral Bauer highlighted that we face the most dangerous world in decades where a number of conflicts have global consequences. \"The biggest one is Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine. Our message is clear: Moscow cannot wait us out. Our support to Ukraine is unwavering,\" Admiral Bauer said, adding that in many ways NATO is now in uncharted waters. \"But essentially, this war places NATO firmly back in its roots. We are once again in an era of collective defence,\" the Chair said. Noting the importance of the NATO Summit in Washington in July he underscored how Allies have created a shield of deterrence \"that has been a foundation for peace, stability and prosperity on our soil, for 75 years.\"\n\nReflecting on the changing security landscape Admiral Bauer said that China presents a growing challenge by building up its military capabilities without any form of transparency and providing critical components for the Russian defence industry. \"China cannot have it both ways: you cannot expect to have a fruitful economic relationship with the West and at the same time fuel a war in Europe.\" he said.\n\nThe Chair underlined the need to strengthen the Euro-Atlantic Defence Industry Capacity. \"NATO and national military planning are integrated like never before. In order to be successful, these plans will have to go hand in hand with much higher stocks of ammunition and spare parts, made possible by a steep increase of production capacity in our defence industries.

When a journalist asked him to elaborate on the \"vague conditions\" and \"unclear pathway\" Kiev had been given, the official claimed that Washington's position was \"absolutely clear.\"\n\n\"First they've got to win this war,\" Kirby said.\n\n\"They gotta win the war first. So, number one: We're doing everything we can to make sure they can do that. Then when the war's over no matter what it looks like they're still going to have a long border with Russia and a legitimate security threat,\" he said. Washington will assist in building up Ukraine's military industrial base, although \"corruption is still a major concern,\" Kirby added.\n\nPut yourself in the shoes of Vladimir Putin or his General Staff. Do you dismiss Kirby's statement as the ravings of a lunatic or do you accept it at face value -- i.e., the United States is committed to fund and supply a war against Russia to ensure her defeat? If I was sitting with the Stavka in Moscow, I would be inclined to believe that Kirby is expressing the true intent and authentic policy of President Biden. They you add in the flights of B-52s and other nuclear-bomb capable aircraft flying up to the borders of Russia and NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg's remarks today:\n\nNATO is considering deploying more of its nuclear weapons in the face of threats from Russia, China and North Korea, the defense alliance's leader said.\n\nIt is important that NATO \"communicate the direct message that we, of course, are a nuclear alliance\" by taking more of its warheads out of storage, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said in an interview with the Telegraph published on Sunday.\n\n\"I won't go into operational details about how many nuclear warheads should be operational and which should be stored, but we need to consult on these issues,\" he said. \"That's exactly what we're doing,\" he added.\n\nAnd that is the problem. Delusional statements by senior Biden officials and the head of NATO are ratcheting up tensions between Russia and the West, making the situation more combustible. If you work in a gunpowder factory, you learn early on that you're not allowed to smoke while on the job. Reason? If you light one up your employment will end with a big boom and a blinding flash of light. Kirby, Sullivan Blinken and Stoltenberg are covered in black powder and contemplating lighting up a joint. At this point, it does not matter whether these Western clowns are just talking smack, with no intent on following through. Russian military and intelligence officials have no choice but to accept that the United States and NATO are hell bent on going to war with Russia and they are preparing accordingly.

Biden must work with Putin to bring peace.\n\nBy Jeffrey D. Sachs\n\nCommon Dreams\n\nFor the fifth time since 2008, Russia has proposed to negotiate with the U.S. over security arrangements, this time in proposals made by President Vladimir Putin on June 14.\n\nFour previous times, the U.S. rejected the offer of negotiations in favor of a neocon strategy to weaken or dismember Russia through war and covert operations.\n\nThe U.S. neocon tactics have failed disastrously, devastating Ukraine in the process, and endangering the whole world. After all the warmongering, it's time for Biden to open negotiations for peace with Russia.\n\nSince the end of the Cold War, the U.S. grand strategy has been to weaken Russia. As early as 1992, then Defense Secretary Richard Cheney opined that following the 1991 demise of the Soviet Union, Russia too should be dismembered.\n\nZbigniew Brzezinski [U.S. national security advisor under President Jimmy Carter] opined in 1997 that Russia should be divided into three loosely confederated entities in Russian Europe, Siberia, and the far east.\n\nIn 1999, the U.S.-led NATO alliance bombed Russia's ally, Serbia, for 78 days in order to break Serbia apart and install a massive NATO military base in breakaway Kosovo. Leaders of the U.S. military-industrial complex vociferously supported the Chechen war against Russia in the early 2000s.\n\nTo secure these U.S. advances against Russia, Washington aggressively pushed NATO enlargement, despite promises to Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin that NATO would not move one inch eastward from Germany.\n\nMost tendentiously, the U.S. pushed NATO enlargement to Ukraine and Georgia, with the idea of surrounding Russia's naval fleet in Sevastopol, Crimea, with NATO states: Ukraine, Romania (NATO member 2004), Bulgaria (NATO member 2004), Turkey (NATO member 1952), and Georgia, an idea straight from the playbook of the British Empire in the Crimean War (1853-6).\n\nBrzezinski spelled out a chronology of NATO enlargement in 1997, including NATO membership of Ukraine during 2005-2010. The U.S. in fact proposed NATO membership for Ukraine and Georgia at the 2008 NATO Bucharest Summit.\n\nBy 2020, NATO had in fact enlarged by 14 countries in Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and the former Soviet Union (Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland in 1999; Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia in 2004; Albania and Croatia, 2009; Montenegro, 2017; and Northern Macedonia, 2020), while promising future membership to Ukraine and Georgia.\n\nIn short, the 30-year U.S. project, hatched originally by Cheney and the neocons, and carried forward consistently since then, has been to weaken or even dismember Russia, surround Russia with NATO forces, and depict Russia as the belligerent power.\n\nIt is against this grim backdrop that Russian leaders have repeatedly proposed to negotiate security arrangements with Europe and the U.S. that would provide security for all countries concerned, not just the NATO bloc.\n\nGuided by the neocon game plan, the U.S. has refused to negotiate on every occasion, while trying to pin the blame on Russia for the lack of negotiations.\n\nFirst Proposal -- 2008\n\nIn June 2008, as the U.S. prepared to expand NATO to Ukraine and Georgia, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev proposed a European Security Treaty, calling for collective security and an end to NATO's unilateralism.\n\nSuffice it to say, the U.S. showed no interest whatsoever in Russia's proposals, and instead proceeded with its long-held plans for NATO enlargement.\n\nSecond Proposal -- 2014\n\nThe second Russian proposal for negotiations came from Putin following the violent overthrow of Ukraine's President Viktor Yanukovych in February 2014, with the active complicity if not outright leadership of the U.S. government.\n\nI happened to see the U.S. complicity up close, as the post-coup government invited me for urgent economic discussions. When I arrived in Kiev, I was taken to the Maidan, where I was told directly about U.S. funding of the Maidan protest.\n\nThe evidence of U.S. complicity in the coup is overwhelming.\n\nAssistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland was caught on a phone line in January 2014 plotting the change of government in Ukraine. Meanwhile, U.S. senators went personally to Kiev to stir up the protests (akin to Chinese or Russian political leaders coming to D.C. on Jan. 6, 2021 to rile up the crowds).\n\nOn Feb. 21, 2014, the Europeans, U.S. and Russia brokered a deal with Yanukovych in which Yanukovych agreed to early elections. Yet the coup leaders reneged on the deal the same day, took over government buildings, threatened more violence, and deposed Yanukovych the next day.\n\nThe U.S. supported the coup and immediately extended recognition to the new government.\n\nIn my view, this was a standard C.I.A.-led covert regime-change operation, of which there have been several dozen around the world, including 64 episodes between 1947 and 1989 meticulously documented by Professor Lindsey O'Rourke.\n\nCovert regime-change operations are of course not really hidden from view, but the U.S. government vociferously denies its role, keeps all documents highly confidential, and systematically gaslights the world: \"Do not believe what you see plainly with your own eyes! The U.S. had nothing to do with this.\"\n\nDetails of the operations eventually emerge, however, through eyewitnesses, whistleblowers, the forced release of documents under the Freedom of Information Act, declassification of papers after years or decades, and memoirs, but all far too late for real accountability.\n\nIn any event, the violent coup induced the ethnic-Russian Donbass region of Eastern Ukraine to break from the coup leaders, many of whom were extreme Russophobic nationalists, and some in violent groups with a history of Nazi SS links in the past.\n\nAlmost immediately, the coup leaders took steps to repress the use of the Russian language even in the Russian-speaking Donbass. In the following months and years, the government in Kiev launched a military campaign to retake the breakaway regions, deploying neo-Nazi paramilitary units and U.S. arms.\n\nIn the course of 2014, Putin called repeatedly for a negotiated peace, and this led to the Minsk II Agreement in February 2015 based on autonomy of the Donbass and an end to violence by both sides.\n\nRussia did not claim the Donbass as Russian territory, but instead called for autonomy and the protection of ethnic Russians within Ukraine. The U.N. Security Council endorsed the Minsk II agreement, but the U.S. neocons privately subverted it.\n\nYears later, Chancellor Angela Merkel blurted out the truth. The Western side treated the agreement not as a solemn treaty but as a delaying tactic to \"give Ukraine time\" to build its military strength. In the meantime, around 14,000 people died in the fighting in Donbass between 2014 and 2021.\n\nThird Proposal -- 2021\n\nFollowing the definitive collapse of the Minsk II agreement, Putin again proposed negotiations with the U.S. in December 2021. By that point, the issues went even beyond NATO enlargement to include fundamental issues of nuclear armaments.\n\nStep by step, the U.S. neocons had abandoned nuclear arms control with Russia, with the U.S. unilaterally abandoning the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty in 2002, placing Aegis missiles in Poland and Romania in 2010 onwards, and walking out of the Intermediate Nuclear Force (INF) Treaty in 2019.\n\nIn view of these dire concerns, Putin put on the table on Dec. 15, 2021 a draft \"Treaty between the United States of America and the Russian Federation on Security Guarantees.\" The most immediate issue on the table (Article 4 of the draft treaty) was the end of the U.S. attempt to expand NATO to Ukraine.\n\nI called U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan at the end of 2021 to try to convince the Biden White House to enter the negotiations. My main advice was to avoid a war in Ukraine by accepting Ukraine's neutrality, rather than NATO membership, which was a bright red line for Russia.\n\nThe White House flatly rejected the advice, claiming remarkably (and obtusely) that NATO's enlargement to Ukraine was none of Russia's business!\n\nYet what would the U.S. say if some country in the Western hemisphere decided to host Chinese or Russian bases? Would the White House, State Department, or Congress say, \"That's just fine, that's a matter of concern only to Russia or China and the host country?\" No.\n\nThe world nearly came to nuclear Armageddon in 1962 when the Soviet Union placed nuclear missiles in Cuba and the U.S. imposed a naval quarantine and threatened war unless the Russians removed the missiles. The U.S. military alliance does not belong in Ukraine any more than the Russian or Chinese military belongs close to the U.S. border.\n\nFourth Proposal -- 2022\n\nThe fourth offer of Putin to negotiate came in March 2022, when Russia and Ukraine nearly closed a peace deal just weeks after the start of Russia's special military operation that began on Feb. 24, 2022. Russia, once again, was after one big thing: Ukraine's neutrality, i.e., no NATO membership and no hosting of U.S. missiles on Russia's border.\n\nUkraine's President Vladimir Zelensky quickly accepted Ukraine's neutrality, and Ukraine and Russia exchanged papers, with the skillful mediation of the Foreign Ministry of Turkey. Then suddenly, at the end of March, Ukraine abandoned the negotiations.\n\nU.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, following in the tradition of British anti-Russian war-mongering dating back to the Crimean War (1853-6), actually flew to Kiev to warn Zelensky against neutrality and the importance of Ukraine defeating Russia on the battlefield.\n\nSince that date, Ukraine has lost around 500,000 dead and is on the ropes on the battlefield.\n\nFifth Proposal -- Now\n\nNow we have Russia's fifth offer of negotiations, explained clearly and cogently by Putin himself in his speech to diplomats at the Russian Foreign Ministry on June 14. Putin laid out Russia's proposed terms to end the war in Ukraine.\n\n\"Ukraine should adopt a neutral, non-aligned status, be nuclear- free, and undergo demilitarization and de-nazification,\" Putin said. \"These parameters were broadly agreed upon during the Istanbul negotiations in 2022, including specific details on demilitarization such as the agreed numbers of tanks and other military equipment. We reached consensus on all points.\n\n\"Certainly, the rights, freedoms, and interests of Russian-speaking citizens in Ukraine must be fully protected,\" he continued.\n\n\"The new territorial realities, including the status of Crimea, Sevastopol, Donetsk and Lugansk people's republics, Kherson, and Zaporozhye regions as parts of the Russian Federation, should be acknowledged. These foundational principles need to be formalized through fundamental international agreements in the future. Naturally, this entails the removal of all Western sanctions against Russia as well.\"\n\nLet me say a few words about negotiating.\n\nRussia's proposals should now be met at the negotiating table by proposals from the U.S. and Ukraine. The White House is dead wrong to evade negotiations just because of disagreements with Russia's proposals. It should put up its own proposals and get down to the business of negotiating an end to the war.\n\nThere are three core issues for Russia: Ukraine's neutrality (non-NATO enlargement), Crimea remaining in Russian hands, and boundary changes in Eastern and Southern Ukraine. The first two are almost surely non-negotiable. The end of NATO enlargement is the fundamental casus belli. Crimea is also core for Russia, as Crimea has been home to Russia's Black Sea fleet since 1783 and is fundamental to Russia's national security.\n\nThe third core issue, the borders of Eastern and Southern Ukraine, will be a key point of negotiations. The U.S. cannot pretend that borders are sacrosanct after NATO bombed Serbia in 1999 to relinquish Kosovo, and after the U.S. pressured Sudan to relinquish South Sudan.\n\nYes, Ukraine's borders will be redrawn as the result of the 10 years of war, the situation on the battlefield, the choices of the local populations, and tradeoffs made at the negotiating table.\n\nBiden needs to accept that negotiations are not a sign of weakness. As Kennedy put it, \"Never negotiate out of fear, but never fear to negotiate.\" Ronald Reagan famously described his own negotiating strategy using a Russian proverb, \"Trust but verify.\"\n\nThe neocon approach to Russia, delusional and hubristic from the start, lies in ruins. NATO will never enlarge to Ukraine and Georgia. Russia will not be toppled by a C.I.A. covert operation.\n\nUkraine is being horribly bloodied on the battlefield, often losing 1,000 or more dead and wounded in a single day. The failed neocon game plan brings us closer to nuclear Armageddon.\n\nYet Biden still refuses to negotiate. Following Putin's speech, the U.S., NATO, and Ukraine firmly rejected negotiations once again. Biden and his team have still not relinquished the neocon fantasy of defeating Russia and expanding NATO to Ukraine.\n\nThe Ukrainian people have been lied to time and again by Zelensky and Biden and other leaders of NATO countries, who told them falsely and repeatedly that Ukraine would prevail on the battlefield and that there were no options to negotiate. Ukraine is now under martial law. The public is given no say about its own slaughter.\n\nFor the sake of Ukraine's very survival, and to avoid nuclear war, the President of the United States has one overriding responsibility today: Negotiate.\n\nJeffrey D.

He emphasized the G7's unified stance against Russian President Vladimir Putin: \"You cannot wait us out. You cannot divide us.\" The G7 also agreed to provide a $50 billion loan to Ukraine, backed by profits from frozen Russian assets.\n\nThe U.S.-Ukraine security deal serves as a framework to modernize Ukraine's armed forces and is seen as a step towards NATO membership. The agreement includes commitments to develop Ukraine's defense industry, expand its military and align with NATO standards. (Related: Zelensky demanding 10 MORE YEARS of U.S. taxpayer funding for his \"forever war.\")\n\nZelensky hailed the agreement as historic, viewing it as a crucial step towards NATO membership. \"This is an agreement on security and thus on the protection of human life,\" he remarked.\n\nWhile Ukraine has long sought NATO membership, the alliance has stopped short of this commitment. NATO's Article Five clause, which treats an attack on one member as an attack on all, remains a critical point of contention.\n\nWe are building the infrastructure of human freedom and empowering people to be informed, healthy and aware.

The agreement also facilitates intelligence sharing, joint training, military education programs and combined military exercises between the two nations.\n\nWith Trump currently leading Biden in many election polls, the future of the agreement could be uncertain. Trump has expressed skepticism about Ukraine's ongoing conflict, suggesting he would end the war quickly and has urged Europe to take on more responsibility in supporting Kyiv.\n\nZelensky addressed concerns about potential changes in U.S. leadership, emphasizing the global support for Ukraine based on shared values and empathy for the Ukrainian people. \"If the people are with us, any leader will be with us in this struggle for freedom,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine, the U.S. and NATO rejected Russian President Vladimir Putin's ceasefire conditions, which demand Ukraine withdraw from territories claimed by Moscow and abandon its NATO bid.\n\n\"Putin has illegally occupied sovereign Ukrainian territory and is in no position to dictate terms for peace,\" said U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin at a NATO meeting in Brussels. \"He could end this today by withdrawing from Ukrainian territory.\"\n\nAhead of a Ukraine peace conference in Switzerland, Putin stated that Moscow would stop its offensive if Kyiv withdrew its troops from the east and south, dropped its NATO ambitions and recognized Russia's annexation of Crimea.\n\nZelensky dismissed Putin's offer as an untrustworthy ultimatum, comparing it to Hitler's expansionist policies. \"These are ultimatum messages, no different from the past,\" Zelensky told Italy's SkyTG24 news channel.\n\nUkrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak called Putin's conditions \"absurd,\" saying they amounted to asking Ukraine to surrender its sovereignty.\n\nNATO defense ministers approved a new long-term security aid and military training plan for Ukraine, addressing delays in Western deliveries and responding to Russian advances. This plan complements the U.S.-led Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG), which coordinates military aid for Kyiv.\n\nU.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. C.Q. Brown noted that Ukrainian forces have managed to \"hold the defensive lines\" despite significant losses.\n\nWatch this video mocking Zelensky's repeated sniffing during a press conference.\n\nZelensky blames the world for Russian offensive in Kharkiv, but Ukrainian troops beg to differ.\n\nZelensky's presidential term has EXPIRED, but he still remains as Ukraine's de facto

Furthermore, it is now looking into Chinese actions that go against the rules-based order in the West Philippine Sea and Taiwan Strait. These regional events have prompted NATO to elevate its strategic partnerships with its Indo-Pacific four (or IP4) -- Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand -- to address these issues. However, in its pivot to the Indo-Pacific, NATO preferably sees developing strategic ties with its Northeast Asian partners, Japan and South Korea, as the first important step in its long-term plans for the region.\n\nNATO's relations with South Korea and Japan have advanced fast in the last few years, even though they have moved along different trajectories. The relations have progressed with Japan since the 1990s; however, the ties with South Korea developed only in the late 2010s. Japan's relations with NATO have developed incrementally, however, with Russia's invasion, this partnership has achieved a new pace of momentum, driven by Tokyo's indivisible security outlook, which sees the geopolitical developments interlinked in the Eurasian and Indo-Pacific region. This was evident in the Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's speech at the G7 Hiroshima Summit when he stated, \"Ukraine may be the East Asia of tomorrow.\" Similarly, during the 2023 NATO Summit, Kishida said that \"[S]ecurity of the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific are inseparable\" and added that he \"welcome[s] the further increase in interest and engagement in the Indo-Pacific among our like-minded countries of the Euro-Atlantic area.\" Although this strategic thinking is not new and can be traced back to the early 1980s when attempts were made to create institutional linkages, it is clear that Tokyo is attempting to diversify and deepen its security relations with NATO to deal with emerging security threats in the region.\n\nUnder President Yoon Suk-yeol's Global Pivotal State (GPS) vision, South Korea started pivoting towards the European Union (EU) to develop strategic, economic, and security partnerships with actors beyond its immediate periphery. This pivot has led to Seoul's increasing interest in developing stronger relations with NATO and its members. In 2023, during the NATO summit at Vilnius, Yoon expressed his agreement with the indivisible security outlook: \"In this hyper-connected era, the security of Europe and Asia cannot be separated.\" Although much credit is attributed only to situational factors like the Russian invasion, scholars like Bence Nemeth and Saeme Kim have identified structural and situational factors contributing to fastening relations with NATO. However, unlike Japan, Seoul's strategic outlook is narrow, focused on Northeast Asia and the challenges posed by North Korea. Although concerns regarding China exist, it remains cautious, avoiding the possibility of strategic association and Beijing's undue attention.\n\nIn the last few years, Seoul and Tokyo have identified new areas like climate change, information operations, and military intelligence sharing with NATO as critical areas of cooperation, adding to the earlier list of cyber, space, emerging, and critical technologies. This expansion has been possible due to an upgrade in their strategic partnership framework, which was elevated from the Individual Partnership and Cooperation Programme (IPCP) to the Individually Tailored Partnership Programme(ITPP). The latter is a more 'strategic and goal-oriented framework' -- comprehensive, detailed and long-term (four-year period) as compared to the former, which is general and short (two-year period). This upgraded partnership framework attempts to establish greater strategic alignment between NATO and its Northeast Asian partners. Besides, this signals a clear political will to expand and deepen their security partnership with NATO and its members.\n\nUnder the ITTP framework, the IP4 partnership is now institutionalised and is expected to grow further with the upcoming NATO summit in Washington, D.C.\n\nUnder the ITTP framework, the IP4 partnership is now institutionalised and is expected to grow further with the upcoming NATO summit in Washington, D.C.\n\nNATO's strengthening relations with Japan and South Korea must be viewed through strategic lens based on changing global alignments and the polarised security environment in Eurasia and the Indo-Pacific, which poses a significant threat to NATO and its members' security. This increasing threat perception was clearly stated in NATO's 2022 strategic posture, which noted the linkages between the security of the two regions. NATO understands that with increasing coordination between Beijing, Moscow, and its other like-minded partners across the region, it needs a strategy that is comprehensive and efficient in addressing these threats. For instance, NATO sees increasing cooperation between Moscow and its friends -- North Korea and Iran, both of whom have supplied critical weaponry as detrimental to its plans. Thus, it sees the benefits of forming closer cooperation with like-minded partners in the Indo-Pacific, like South Korea and Japan, who have given Ukraine substantial military and economic assistance, demonstrating the vital importance of partners, even based in other regions. Sharing his support for the ties with Japan and South Korea, the NATO secretary general said, \"Our growing ties send a powerful signal at a critical time: when countries like Russia try to rip up the global rules and laws, we stand united and strong to protect our way of life and prosperity.\"\n\nNATO's strengthening relations with Japan and South Korea must be viewed through strategic lens based on changing global alignments and the polarised security environment in Eurasia and the Indo-Pacific, which poses a significant threat to NATO and its members' security.\n\nOn the other hand, for Seoul and Tokyo, developing comprehensive relations with NATO is critical to ensure that developments in Ukraine are not repeated in the Indo-Pacific. This partnership aims to create linkages across sectors, economy, technology, and military, and it seeks to develop effective deterrence against regional threats. While attributing, Russia is often cited as the sole factor. However, that is not the case. Scholars like Yu Koizumi have argued that Russia-Japan ties are not inherently adversarial, and the same could be said for South Korea. Even though the Ukraine situation is concerning for both states as liberal democracies, it does not present an existential threat to either. However, this cannot be said about Chinese action in the Taiwan Strait, which for Japan is an existential threat and for South Korea, it raises profound national security implications. In this context, the only significant concern for Japan and South Korea militarily in the region is China, not Russia. Therefore, NATO relations with Japan and South Korea are driven by a systemic factor: China's rise, which is not a situational event. Thus, this partnership is an attempt to strengthen deterrence in the region and counter any likely belligerent actions by Beijing.\n\nIn addition to counterterrorism, space, and arms reduction, South Korea and Japan will strengthen security and defence partnerships in areas such as military intelligence-sharing and cybersecurity. With continuous strategic partnerships getting institutionalised under a more robust ITPP framework, it would be more accessible for partners to collaborate and cooperate on issue-specific regional and global challenges across domains. Strengthening Seoul and Tokyo's defence relations will further increase this partnership's success, establishing strategic linkages between the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific regions. In this partnership, Seoul is particularly interested in working on cybersecurity with NATO's Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDOE) and Japan seeks to foster closer cooperation in countering hybrid threats such as information warfare and economic security. Conversely, NATO is also looking at building strategic ties, devoid of any military deployment, instead focusing on military-technological innovation, capacity building, and developing mechanisms for sharing situational awareness.\n\nIn addition to counterterrorism, space, and arms reduction, South Korea and Japan will strengthen security and defence partnerships in areas such as military intelligence-sharing and cybersecurity.\n\nWith the attack on Ukraine, the threat to Taiwan now looms over NATO and its members when it comes to the Indo-Pacific. However, like in the case of Russia, where a broad consensus was reached in NATO, there is currently no explicit agreement between NATO and its Indo-Pacific partners regarding China. Similar inter-disagreements exist within the IP4 partners, particularly Japan and South Korea, regarding China. In addition, ASEAN members remain suspicious of external interference, making this more complicated. These uncertainties emerge as an obstacle to further strengthening relations between the two partners when sharing common perceptions of strategic challenges in the Indo-Pacific and acting on them. Thus, as we advance, even if we may not see NATO's role expanding in the region militarily, we will likely see closer and deeper strategic partnerships between NATO members with Japan and South Korea to strengthen deterrence and uphold rules-based international order in the Indo-Pacific.\n\nAbhishek Sharma is a Research Assistant at the Observer Research Foundation.\n\nThe views expressed above belong to the author(s).

He emphasized the G7's unified stance against Russian President Vladimir Putin: \"You cannot wait us out. You cannot divide us.\" The G7 also agreed to provide a $50 billion loan to Ukraine, backed by profits from frozen Russian assets.\n\nThe U.S.-Ukraine security deal serves as a framework to modernize Ukraine's armed forces and is seen as a step towards NATO membership. The agreement includes commitments to develop Ukraine's defense industry, expand its military and align with NATO standards. (Related: Zelensky demanding 10 MORE YEARS of U.S. taxpayer funding for his \"forever war.\")\n\nZelensky hailed the agreement as historic, viewing it as a crucial step towards NATO membership. \"This is an agreement on security and thus on the protection of human life,\" he remarked.\n\nWhile Ukraine has long sought NATO membership, the alliance has stopped short of this commitment. NATO's Article Five clause, which treats an attack on one member as an attack on all, remains a critical point of contention.\n\nWe are building the infrastructure of human freedom and empowering people to be informed, healthy and aware.

The agreement also facilitates intelligence sharing, joint training, military education programs and combined military exercises between the two nations.\n\nWith Trump currently leading Biden in many election polls, the future of the agreement could be uncertain. Trump has expressed skepticism about Ukraine's ongoing conflict, suggesting he would end the war quickly and has urged Europe to take on more responsibility in supporting Kyiv.\n\nZelensky addressed concerns about potential changes in U.S. leadership, emphasizing the global support for Ukraine based on shared values and empathy for the Ukrainian people. \"If the people are with us, any leader will be with us in this struggle for freedom,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine, the U.S. and NATO rejected Russian President Vladimir Putin's ceasefire conditions, which demand Ukraine withdraw from territories claimed by Moscow and abandon its NATO bid.\n\n\"Putin has illegally occupied sovereign Ukrainian territory and is in no position to dictate terms for peace,\" said U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin at a NATO meeting in Brussels. \"He could end this today by withdrawing from Ukrainian territory.\"\n\nAhead of a Ukraine peace conference in Switzerland, Putin stated that Moscow would stop its offensive if Kyiv withdrew its troops from the east and south, dropped its NATO ambitions and recognized Russia's annexation of Crimea.\n\nZelensky dismissed Putin's offer as an untrustworthy ultimatum, comparing it to Hitler's expansionist policies. \"These are ultimatum messages, no different from the past,\" Zelensky told Italy's SkyTG24 news channel.\n\nUkrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak called Putin's conditions \"absurd,\" saying they amounted to asking Ukraine to surrender its sovereignty.\n\nNATO defense ministers approved a new long-term security aid and military training plan for Ukraine, addressing delays in Western deliveries and responding to Russian advances. This plan complements the U.S.-led Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG), which coordinates military aid for Kyiv.\n\nU.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. C.Q. Brown noted that Ukrainian forces have managed to \"hold the defensive lines\" despite significant losses.\n\nVisit WWIII.news for more stories like this.\n\nWatch this video mocking Zelensky's

Some NATO members are also reluctant to use the word because Ukraine has yet to implement all of the necessary democratic and anti-corruption reforms necessary for membership, a separate U.S. official said.\n\n\"Most Central European countries are disappointed by the Biden administration's ambiguity and procrastination\" when it comes to outlining a concrete pathway forward for Ukraine, a Central European diplomat told CNN.

Yet some Estonians wish harm upon their country", "body": "Russia would still have demands on the political organization of even a neutral Estonia.Claims of NATO expansion having caused the war only contain a fraction of truth.Immediately after Estonia regained its independence, Russia tried to put pressure on our politics.\n\nSome people want peace in a way that would actually harm Estonia. One such advocate is Varro Vooglaid, who supports neutrality for Estonia, Ilmar Raag from The Right party writes.\n\nAdditionally, I have met people who believe that there are some secret diplomatic tricks to avoid wars. In reality, there are no such tricks. Peace does not depend solely on the skill of diplomats.\n\nWhy is neutrality impossible for Estonia?\n\nThere are only two arguments.\n\nGeography makes it impossible\n\nIf the Russian general staff believes that NATO or any foreign power wants to attack Russia, they will conduct an exercise familiar to all military schools. They will look at the access routes to the target. Looking at the map, it is clear that to conquer St. Petersburg and Northwestern Russia, an opponent would use the territory of the Baltic states. This was the case in World War I and again in World War II. The same applies to conventional war scenarios now.\n\nLeaving all ideology aside, the Russian general staff's conclusion is correct - to reduce military threat, they would need to control the Baltic states' \"bridgeheads\" and not let the \"opponent\" do so.\n\nIt seems that to ensure peace, all troops should be removed from the Baltic states, and all problems would resolve themselves. Unfortunately, this conclusion is wrong because it assumes Russia is always reasonable and good. Before World War II, Estonia was neutral, but the Soviet Union still occupied the Baltic states. Preemptively. As Soviet historians explained, it was necessary, among other reasons, to preempt the Germans. There is technical logic in this from the Russian military perspective. Unfortunately, this neutrality exposed the weak point in Estonia's defense logic. We decided to be neutral, considering Russia's legitimate security concerns. But did anyone consider the security of the Baltic states at that moment? Of course not.\n\nThis one-sidedness is the most disturbing aspect of certain Western \"realist\" scholars, analysts, and politicians (Jeffrey Sachs, John Maersheimer, and so on). When discussing the Ukraine war, they always point out that Russia has the right to be concerned about its security, but they never acknowledge that Ukraine or Estonia has the same right. From the \"realist\" perspective, the security concerns of Estonia or Ukraine do not matter because we cannot change anything anyway, but it is apparently acceptable for Russia's concern to drag the whole world into a major war. Consequently, the disappearance of Estonia or Ukraine is just a small price for maintaining greater peace.\n\nI admit there is some logic to this, but it is unfair. This theory implies that you, I, and Ukrainians do not have the right to live.\n\nRusskiy mir makes neutrality impossible for Estonia\n\nAnother mistake made by \"realists,\" imperialists, and Varro is reducing everything to Russia's security interests, as if NATO bases are the only reason for Russia's irritation. They completely forget the Russian policy of spheres of influence, centered on Russia's 1999 law concerning compatriots abroad.\n\nLet us recall how immediately after Estonia's re-independence, Russia tried to put pressure on Estonia's internal politics, with the primary issue being the protection of interests of the Russian minority. This soon included a fight over historical memory, with Russia trying to prohibit Estonia from presenting its version of World War II events. This was criticism against the so-called rewriting of history, with Bronze Night being the most vivid symbol. Thus, there is a precedent for a Russian revolt that has no relation to the expansion of NATO.\n\nLet us also recall the Russian protests in Latvia against abolishing Russian-language schools. This movement also had no connection to NATO expansion. The same issues were topical in Ukraine.\n\nEstonia was a minor concern in Russian foreign policy, with the interests of local Russians considered only as far as it was tactically necessary for the Kremlin. When a decision was made to tactically warm relations with the West, the Russian Foreign Ministry was ordered not to provoke the Baltic states. When circumstances changed, so did Russia's rhetoric and influence activities. Former Russian diplomat Mikhail Demurin has some very interesting things to say about it in the podcast \"How to Bring the Baltic Republics Back to the Home Harbor.\" (\u041a\u0430\u043a \u0432\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0443\u0442\u044c \u0431\u0430\u043b\u0442\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0440\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0432 \u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0433\u0430\u0432\u0430\u043d\u044c - Youtube)\n\nThus, even if Estonia were neutral in terms of security, Russia would still have demands on our internal political organization. An Estonian nation state is definitely unacceptable to Russia. Therefore, greater peace might require not just military neutrality but a vassal state status, where the prioritization of the Estonian language and culture has been ended. As we remember, this state ended with the Singing Revolution.\n\nThe same applies to Ukraine\n\nMany claim that NATO expansion is what caused the war in Ukraine, but there is only a small grain of truth in that. In 2008, Ukraine was indeed given a general perspective of joining NATO, but from that time until the start of the war in 2022, no concrete steps were taken towards NATO expansion into Ukraine. No NATO summit discussed a membership action plan for Ukraine, and no head of state demanded it. Everyone understood that Ukraine's actual NATO membership was postponed indefinitely, meaning \"it is not something we will see in our lifetime.\"\n\nEven though military cooperation between Ukraine and NATO increased, its actual impact was minimal. This was evident at the beginning of the war when Ukraine fought predominantly with Soviet-era weapons. The claim that NATO armed Ukraine before the war turned out to be a myth. NATO countries did provide some training, intelligence cooperation, and a small amount of infantry equipment just before the war, but in the grand scheme, this was very little.\n\nSo what was it that really motivated Russia? Remember the end of Mikhail Bulgakov's play \"The Days of the Turbins.\" In it, the Red Army invades Kyiv during the civil war, and White Guard Russian officers conclude that the Reds are better than Ukrainian independence fighters: \"Because they won't let the empire fall.\"\n\nOr recall Nobel Prize-winning author Joseph Brodsky, who also ridiculed Ukrainian independence. This explains why Ukraine's policies of establishing its cultural self-awareness did not sit well with the great Russian soul. This means that even if the NATO aspect is removed, the actual essence of the current war is a struggle of national identities. The nature of this war is cultural Darwinism, where neutrality does not exist. You can either be part of the \"Russian world\" or not.\n\nThis also challenges those who desire abstract peace. If you want to give up being Estonian for yourself and your loved ones, then indeed, there is a possibility of a greater peace. But even that possibility is not absolute, as, just like in the time of Catherine II when Estonian peasants were sent to war against Turkey, under certain conditions, all Russian vassals can find themselves in a war.\n\nI want peace, but even more, I want the right to remain myself. I know my friends feel the same.\n\nCommentsCopy", "source": {"uri": "news.postimees.ee", "dataType": "news", "title": "Estonian news - news.postimees.ee"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

We are obliged to respond to this and will do it,\" Putin said.\n\nAlarmed by China's growing military power, the United States has pushed for NATO to share expertise and build ties with countries such as Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. At odds with NATO over his war in Ukraine, Putin sees the military alliance as an adversary and accuses it of deceiving Russia by granting membership to east European countries following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dissolution of the Soviet Union"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Educational_and_Academic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Educational and Academic", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Conventions", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/20_06_2024_08_17_29_5263102.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659612", "eventUri": "eng-9659612", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

The declaration itself was banal bureaucratese: invitations to initiate diplomatic contacts, plans to prepare a force structure that would move away from \"forward defense\" towards \"flexible response.\" It was, as always, the backchannel talks that were far more interesting.\n\nMargaret Thatcher, of all people, was the first national leader to realize the profound changes happening around her and to grasp that these might not all be good in the long term. Fresh out of her speech in Bruges in 1988, which warned that the unification of Germany would recreate the same historic problem of a destabilizing military power in the heart of Europe, she proceeded to assure Mikhail Gorbachev that the West \"must find ways to give the Soviet Union confidence that its security would be assured.\" The sentiment was echoed by Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, who said that the west needed to take into account the interests of the Warsaw Pact countries and the Soviet Union.\n\nThe American delegation was even more conciliatory. Secretary of State James Baker had personally assured Gorbachev in February that NATO would move \"not one inch\" eastward. This pledge was repeated in some form or other by NATO Secretary-General Manfred W\u00f6rner, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Margaret Thatcher, Francois Mitterrand, and President George H. W. Bush. British Prime Minister John Major, when asked by Soviet Marshal Dmitri Yazov about East European leaders' interest in NATO membership, reassured him that \"nothing of the sort will happen.\"\n\nAll of this is well documented, including in documents recently de-archived and declassified. But the debate over NATO expansion and the Russian reaction is still a contested domain.\n\nOne side argues that there was a tacit Western pledge of no territorial expansion of NATO that might alter the strategic balance of the continent. The counterargument is that there were no pledges, much less a formal agreement, and whatever understanding was achieved became irrelevant when one of the parties to the agreement disappeared with the dissolution of the USSR.\n\nA theory is as valid as its explanatory power. Events from Russian outrage over the intervention in Kosovo to the Russian fury at the Munich Security Conference in 2007, to the Russian interventions in Georgia, Crimea, Syria, and the current invasion of Ukraine, have been attributed to a revanchist Russia furious at Western betrayal and at the expansion of NATO. On the other hand, the pro-expansionist crowd has repeatedly asserted that Russian aggression is predicated on domestic regime stability, Christian conservatism, imperialism, neo-Sovietism, fascism, and everything in between.\n\nSo which is it? \"Process tracing\" the Kremlin is of course impossible, but a careful study of Russian reactions to various phases of NATO enlargement gives the impression of a rational power originally determined to be a friend if not an ally of the West. It also simultaneously demonstrates that NATO expansion, once dubbed by George Kennan the \"most fateful error of American policy in the entire post-Cold War era,\" has been the single pivotal act of recent Western grand strategy, one whose repercussions we are still feeling today.\n\nThe history of NATO expansion has been more or less uniformly charted by various scholars and policymakers in the West. What has been relatively understudied is the varied Russian reactions to the different phases of the enlargement process. By November 1990, the Soviet push for a central european security pact had failed, demonstrating the complete collapse of Russian coercive power. By April 1991, Izvestia was proposing that Moscow might join NATO itself. Secretary of State James Baker suggested that Russia would be a part of any future European security architecture.\n\nThe first hint of NATO expansion came from Secretary General Manfred W\u00f6rner's declaration in March 1992 that NATO's doors were open. A further push came from German Defense Minister Volker R\u00fche, who claimed that German stability would forever be threatened if its new eastern frontiers were not moved further east. The Central and Eastern European states were kept at a distance by the Clinton administration initially as debate raged in Washington over the advisability of expansion. The muscle memory of Cold War realism opposed any such move, as evident from opposition from academia, policy, and the Pentagon, but the democratic peace theorists led by Madeline Albright and Jeremy Rosner slowly won over President Bill Clinton. By 1995, even as American troops were drawn down from Europe, NATO expansion seemed unstoppable.\n\nRussian opposition to NATO expansion was never uniform and reflected the decline and rise of the relative power of Moscow. Initially, both Gorbachev and Yeltsin were under the impression that NATO might provide some stability in central Europe. The consensus in Russian strategic circles was that Russian military doctrine should be geared towards an era of \"partnership and cooperation.\" The Russian foreign intelligence services referred to NATO as the \"biggest military grouping in the world, which possesses an enormous offensive potential,\" but were satisfied until 1994 that the talks of expansion were just empty rhetoric from the West. At the end of 1993, Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev told Russian lawmakers that the greatest achievement of post-Soviet diplomacy was to \"prevent NATO's expansion eastward.\"\n\nThe surprise in Moscow was therefore palpable when the NATO enlargement study was launched in 1995, leading Boris Yeltsin to declare that the Cold War was slowly being replaced with a \"Cold Peace.\" The pro-Western democrats in Russia naturally felt betrayed, rightly recognizing NATO expansion as a threat to their domestic influence. However, structural forces were opposed to any serious Russian resistance. Russia was a shadow of its Soviet power, dependent on Western aid, incapable of challenging the forces of time. Sentiments of betrayal were conveyed to the West by Russian diplomats. Yevgeny Primakov, then the director of foreign intelligence, commented that Russia would eventually be compelled to redeploy troops to the West.\n\nAlarm bells started ringing among those whose memories of the Cold War were still raw. Concessions were immediately offered in the form of Russian participation in the Partnership for Peace. NATO's new security doctrine resulted in a visible massive reduction of conventional as well as nuclear weapons. American forward presence went down from around 330,000 troops to around a hundred total; the European combined cuts amounted to another 500,000. The inclusion of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic was followed simultaneously by a reduction of around 40 percent of land, sea, and air units. Theater-level nuclear weapons were reduced by almost 80 percent.\n\nThe Russian foreign ministry's core conditions were that Moscow might agree to enlargement as long as there were \"no deployments of nuclear weapons or allied combat forces on the territory of new member states.\" Both conditions were immediately agreed upon by NATO and the U.S. Additionally, European politics favored a NATO-Russia detente. NATO's acceptance of Russian conditions happened around the time when Russia was invited to join the Implementation Force (IFOR) in Bosnia, effectively endorsing the Dayton accords. The \"NATO Russia Founding Act\" was signed in 1997, with a permanent Russian mission to NATO, and Russia agreed to the NATO expansion with a new \"red line\" of no NATO troops in former Soviet countries, including the Baltics.\n\nThe late 1990s was a strange time in Russia. Democratic and Atlanticist illusions were shattered after Kosovo, a war that reshaped international relations as we know it and ushered in the era of supranational interventions and humanitarian wars. It also changed the character of NATO from a purely defensive alliance to an ideological one. The period saw the strategic calculus of Moscow shift, alongside her leadership. Russian military doctrines started to reflect the changing dynamic. The brief idea that Russia's future was to be a satiated power within American hegemony was dead. For the first time since the end of the Cold war, Russian strategic planners had to deal with a nightmare scenario of NATO unilaterally projecting power in the name of human rights.\n\nRussian military doctrine also changed. Moscow abandoned its \"no first use\" policy of nuclear weapons, and the new doctrine initiated a posture where Russia might be compelled to use nuclear weapons when the state's existence was threatened. The NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council broke down due to the intervention in Kosovo, demonstrating that the new American strategic community was not serious about Russian \"consultations.\" Another significant change happened: NATO started to consider moving one of its headquarters from Germany to Poland, a stated red line for Russia. Defense Minister Igor Sergeev lashed out that such a move might renew military confrontation. By the end of 1999, a short, skinny, somewhat socially awkward former intelligence officer, ironically with the same surname as the Zampolit in The Hunt for Red October, was the new president of Russia.\n\nVladimir Putin accepted the NATO enlargement agreed to under Yeltsin as a fait accompli. In his meeting with NATO Secretary-General George Robertson, he stated that there was a need to resume Russia-NATO contacts and compare military doctrines. In 2001, he hinted that Moscow was willing to coordinate with Washington about a Europe-wide missile defense network. The attack on September 11 changed the strategic scenario even further. Russia, undergoing her own staggering insurgency in Chechnya, offered the U.S. help with bases in Central Asia and intelligence against Islamist terrorism. Putin said, \"If NATO takes on a different shade and is becoming a political organization ... we would reconsider our position with regard to such expansion, if we are to feel involved in such processes.\" In December 2001, when the United States unilaterally pulled out of the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty, Russia called it a mistake and the issue was put to rest.\n\nMeanwhile, NATO itself was undergoing a portentous change. The terrorist attacks changed NATO's reasoning from democratic peace theory to the more revolutionary idea that promoting democracy is needed to counter international terror in a global battle of ideas. This was a fateful alteration. At the 2002 Prague summit, this new thinking was elaborated by President George W. Bush: \"Expansion of NATO also brings many advantages to the alliance itself. Every new member contributes military capabilities that add to our common security. We see this already in Afghanistan -- for forces from Romania, Bulgaria, Estonia, Lithuania, Slovakia and others have joined with sixteen NATO allies to help defeat global terror.\" In short, promoting democracy was to be NATO's primary mission, not just defending a small group of nations in the northwestern corner of the Atlantic.\n\nThis reframing made it palatable for Russian policymakers for the time being. Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said, \"Russia no longer considers NATO enlargement to be a menace because the alliance has undergone a radical transformation from a Cold War instrument to a defense against global terrorism and other 21st-century threats.\" While the Russian elite were chafed after the Iraq War -- General Yuri Baluyevsky said that the world, if not multipolar, breeds instability -- the political leadership remained flexible to alignments. NATO's reframing as a network to fight political Islam led to a temporary alignment of interest. While Russian military doctrine remained unchanged, political speeches highlighted that Russia did not consider NATO a threat, but rather a partner against Islamic terrorism.\n\nContrary to conventional wisdom, it was not the Iraq war that caused the total breakdown of NATO-Russia relations. It was the color revolutions in Ukraine and Georgia. Until then, Russian military doctrines and political statements lacked uniformity of purpose. That changed as Russian political statements and military doctrines reflected the change of perception. As calls to join NATO intensified in Ukraine and Georgia, Putin was the first one to warn that Russia would not accept it. This was a return to a Yeltsin-era red line, in a tone that was instantly unmistakable in diplomatic circles. Russia kept maintaining that the only way for Russia to find NATO expansion acceptable was if NATO transformed into a political organization, an analytical flaw from Moscow as NATO by that time was already transformed into a political organization with a massive expansion of bureaucracy and a crusading mission towards democracy promotion.\n\nNATO was by then already supporting Poland with communications and logistics and, at the request of Turkey, was installing missile defense in Turkish territory. Alongside the open calls for membership, NATO F-16 patrols started over the Baltic Sea around 2004, a significant new development that infuriated Moscow. Moscow's calls for a new Conventional Forces Treaty went unheeded as massive protests started across Georgia and Ukraine, aided by American funding and NGOs.\n\nThe battle lines were drawn. \"We firmly raise questions about the transformation of NATO, the Alliance's plans for enlargement, the reconfiguration of the U.S. military presence in Europe, the deployment of elements of the American missile defense system here, and NATO's refusal to ratify the CFE treaty,\" Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in 2006. \"The future of our relations largely depends on what direction the transformation in NATO will proceed in after the Riga Summit, and the extent to which the security interests of Russia are going to be considered.\" Lavrov further warned that any move from Ukraine or Georgia towards NATO would mark a \"colossal geopolitical shift.\"\n\nAround the same time, a Russian military journal stated that it would be short-sighted for Russia to ignore the fact that NATO extension might be central to the ambition of the United States striving to achieve unipolarity. The pitch continued to rise until, in 2007 at the Munich Security Conference, Putin exploded: \"I think it is obvious that NATO expansion does not have any relation with the modernization of the Alliance itself or with ensuring security in Europe. On the contrary, it represents a serious provocation that reduces the level of mutual trust.\" Accusing the United States of being a hyperpower with no respect for treaties or norms, Putin asked, \"[W\u00f6rner] said at the time that 'the fact that we are ready not to place a NATO army outside of German territory gives the Soviet Union a firm security guarantee.' Where are these guarantees?\"\n\nIn response to the U.S. plan to place missile defenses in Poland and the Czech Republic -- a significant permanent weapons system -- Russia declared that it considered this development to be a clear threat. After NATO's Bucharest summit in 2008, Putin warned, \"We view the appearance of a powerful military bloc on our borders ... as a direct threat to the security of our country.\" Russian military generals simultaneously, for the first time since the collapse of the USSR, started threatening war with Ukraine if NATO expanded eastward. In 2008, after months of saber-rattling, Georgians attacked the rebel provinces of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The world saw, for the first time in decades, Russia's 58th Army rolling into a neighboring sovereign country. The rhetorical justification, at least nominally, was that Russia was determined to conduct a humanitarian intervention, similar to the NATO intervention in Kosovo. A Georgian soldier described the experience of the push to retake Tskhinvali in the face of Russian tanks as \"something like hell.\"\n\nNATO's foreign ministers declared that the Russian military action in Georgia had been disproportionate. Around the same time, NATO conducted exercises in Georgia, viewed by Russia as a clear design on the Russian border. A 2009 essay from a Russian military journal stated, \"As previously, the Americans will continue actively to foist their values on the rest of the world relying on all the force and assets available to them.\" The charge was repeated after 2011 and the Arab Spring: \"The armed conflicts of the late 20th and early 21st centuries have been a graphic demonstration of the United States' desire for a unipolar world and its determination to solve any problems by force, ignoring the opinion of the world community.\" The use of Facebook in fomenting protests during the Arab Spring was seen by Russia as another attempt of American greyzone warfare. After the 2008 war, every Russian military doctrinal paper cited NATO expansion as the biggest threat to the integrity of Russia.\n\nMany have tried to portray the attempted \"reset\" under President Obama as a separate phase of U.S.-Russian relations. The reality is that Obama had one of the most ideological and activist administrations, from the American ambassador in Moscow lending rhetorical support to protests against the Russian government to American politicians appearing in person during the Maidan protests in Ukraine. Topping leaders in the Middle East, intervening in Libya, the proxy war in Syria, American NGOs and the State Department pouring tax dollars into \"civil society\" in Eastern Europe -- all of this strained the trust between Russia and NATO, already irreparably damaged since 2007. To the Russian political and strategic elite, with arguably a longer sense of history than the contemporary diplomatic class in the greater Anglosphere, the post-Cold War America was no different than Jacobin France, or indeed the USSR, fomenting revolution and anarchy across the globe, whereas Russia was fulfilling her historical role as a guarantor of Westphalian order and stabilnost (stability).\n\nHistory is rarely monocausal, but for the sake of policy formulation, a few linear conclusions could be drawn.\n\nOne, Russia is a reactive, not a revanchist power. Consider that, in history, the exceptions are always more interesting than the rule. Why did Russia go to war in Georgia and Ukraine and not Macedonia, Montenegro, Finland, or the Baltics during various other phases of NATO expansion? The answer partly lies in the combination of the shift in Russian aggregate power, the geographic proximity of the theaters, the offensive capability and intention of the rival alliance in question, the perceived threat and betrayal felt in Moscow, and the failed alignments after September 11.\n\nThe history of NATO-Russia relations was not etched in stone, and it could have been altered several times by a grand bargain with Moscow, the glimpses of which were visible throughout. NATO's slow and steady shift of force posture, patrols over the Baltics, exercises with new member states, its invitations to Ukraine and Georgia, were all considered by Moscow as significant provocations by a hyperpower in a unipolar world, a sign of both increased offensive capability and intention to encroach upon Russian spheres of influence. The Russian elite, after a brief Atlanticist interlude, were convinced that Russian red lines would never be respected unless enforced by military force. The Russian military literature reflects this altered perception.\n\nBut evidence also suggests that, while the Russian military and political elite always harbored suspicion towards NATO and were opposed to territorial expansion, they were not complete lunatics and they were eager to align with the U.S. and NATO when opportunities arose. If a country is an inherently reactive power, then realism dictates that there are ways to achieve a grand bargain with that country. A Russia satiated and relatively neutral in the European balance, similar to her post-Napoleonic posture, would be a net benefit for an America seeking to shift its gaze to the east as a peer rival emerges.\n\nTwo, this is obviously not your grandfather's NATO, a defensive alliance with shared values protecting Euro-Atlantic Christendom from the Soviets. In 2017, the NATO secretary general said, \"LGBT people everywhere deserve dignity, inclusion and freedom from fear. Diversity makes our open societies stronger and safer.\" In 2021, NATO headquarters hosted its first ever conference on LGBTQ+ perspectives in the workplace. NATO bureaucrats argue over how the alliance should act if member states curb LGBTQ+ rights and write policy papers on tackling work-related gendered violence in conflict zones. One gets the idea.\n\nNATO member states comment on everything from abortion to human rights in Libya to climate change. Regardless of the feasibility or morality of such policies in international statecraft, NATO demonstrates a quintessential problem of all radical political organizations: revolutionary bureaucracies have a momentum of their own and either grow or die. It is unsustainable and by all commonsensical accounts destructive to American influence and goodwill across the globe. It needs to be, for lack of better word, de-Sovietized, with a rapid defunding and reduction of the ideological brass, moving it back to a narrow defensive alliance.\n\nThree, the only sane path forward for the U.S. is one where NATO stops expanding. Expansion's biggest drawback was not just a permanent rift between Russia and the US. It was the creation of a supranational organization fundamentally opposed to narrow U.S. national interests and even nationalism in member states per se. It created bloat, wherein the rich Western powers happily buckpass their security burden to the U.S. while lecturing Americans sanctimoniously about lofty liberal internationalist values. Europe's strategy makes sense. The bigger the club, the more egalitarian it is, which means greater influence for the small states relative to the big ones; also, the more the club members, the more chances of friction between Russia and the U.S., as local problems become America's.\n\nNATO expansion's biggest long term result was the destruction of traditional American detachment. As late as 1993, American statesmen and scholars, and even a section of the Pentagon, were unanimous on cutting down American costs in Europe. They thought the expansion of the club would result in more European powers taking control of their own finances and their own destiny. Trillions of dollars of debt and a bloated overstretch in Europe later, it was found out to be the exact opposite. Fenrir, voluntarily, got tied up in knots.\n\nIn 1979, America had just had a humiliating retreat from the Middle East, street crime and racial animosity were off the charts, the Soviets were all across Africa pushing European influence out, the American mass memory was one of failed counterinsurgency and wars, and domestically the country faced a collapsing economy and inflation. The Soviets, meanwhile, thought that there were no feudal lands on this planet not ready for flying the red banner and invaded Afghanistan. If there are concrete lessons from history, one is that nothing is permanent in international relations. Imperial overstretch is as much a reason for great power implosion as all-out war. Both need to be avoided.\n\nBy any plausible metrics, NATO in its current form is an ever pressing burden on American shoulders. It need not be. If a grand bargain between Russia and a dormant defensive NATO helps Washington focus more on the rising dark clouds in the east, then that's a good compromise. To reach that stage, drastic and original measures might be necessary. At the risk of mixing metaphors, Fenrir might have to cut the knot instead of trying to untie it. That starts with a reckoning with history.", "source": {"uri": "theamericanconservative.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The American Conservative"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Under this storyline, it is highly unlikely that Hitler's utopian plans for world domination would have gotten very far. The Third Reich's attacks on its neighbors would have been stymied at the attempted Anschluss with Austria in early 1938 or, at the very latest, in the Czechoslovak crisis (infamous Munich conference) in September of that fateful year.\n\nWithout an opposing 1930s version of today's North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Hitler's insatiable thirst for conquest went unchecked until Germany's invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939, setting in motion the most destructive war in human history.\n\nFast forward 80 years to our current era and consider what might be happening in Eastern Europe if there was no NATO. While some may not consider Russia a peer competitor of the United States and like-minded democracies across the globe, that represents an uninformed na\u00efvet\u00e9 reminiscent of British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain at the aforementioned Munich Conference that shamefully sealed the Czechs' fate in 1938.\n\nMake no mistake, without countervailing NATO forces to check his revanchist ambitions, Tsar Vladimir (I want to be) the Great would not hesitate to continue rolling westward, gobbling up lesser-known countries (the Baltic States, Romania, Poland, etc.) caught in the geographic no-man's land between Germany and Russia. In the immortal words of George Kennan, arguably America's most renowned, 20th Century expert on Russia, \"the jealous and intolerant eye of the Kremlin can distinguish, in the end, only vassals and enemies, and the neighbors of Russia, if they do not wish to be one, must reconcile themselves to being the other.\"\n\nWhich brings us back to the efficacy of NATO. While it is understandable that many in America have complained vociferously about the lack of financial commitment for common defense by numerous pact members, that is a poor reason for Washington to turn its back on probably the most successful military alliance in history. Furthermore, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has awakened most of NATO from its post-Cold War lethargy. In 2022 only seven NATO countries reached the desired 2 percent of GDP defense spending, in 2023 that number rose to 11 members, with 18 projected to meet the mark this year. Thus, real world events, not schoolyard bloviating from US politicians, is motivating the alliance's rearmament.\n\nAmerica faces myriad security challenges in the world, from China's designs on Taiwan to instability in the Middle East to a renewal of historic Russian territorial aggrandizement in Eastern Europe to maintaining critical sea lines of communication for international trade. NATO provides America with like-minded allies in a proven alliance to frustrate Putin's expansionist goals in Europe, in the process freeing up US assets for countering other threats. The current age of globalism includes opportunities and responsibilities, which are better addressed collectively with allies that share America's values. In short, America is more secure as part of NATO.\n\nTo those who claim America's relationship with NATO is a one-way street devoid of benefits to Washington, the alliance's response to the 9/11 attacks on the U.S. disproved that line of reasoning. In fact, within 24 hours of the al Qaeda strikes, NATO invoked Article 5 (the only time it has been put into effect) of the alliance charter, pledging full support to Washington. That invocation translated into tangible force contributions - boots on the ground - from multiple member states (Germany, France, the Czech Republic, Turkey, to name a few) to the US war in Afghanistan.\n\nDitching NATO and retreating to a \"fortress America,\" while popular in some quarters in this country, is a tried and true recipe for disaster. One need only turn the clock back 80 years to see the inherent danger of the siren song of isolationism. Lest we forget, \"those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\"", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adolf Hitler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_Agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Munich Agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_history", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human history"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_Poland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Invasion of Poland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Great power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hegemony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hegemony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czechoslovakia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Czechoslovakia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Czechoslovakia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia and montenegro"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anschluss", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anschluss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Europe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Austria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revanchism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Revanchism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_F._Kennan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George F.

Gen. Pat Ryder Holds a Press Briefing", "body": "MAJOR GENERAL PAT RYDER: All right, good afternoon, everyone. Good to be back in the briefing room after several weeks of travel. Just a few things at the top, and then we'll get right to your questions.\n\nOn Friday, Secretary Austin concluded a productive trip to Brussels, where he hosted the 23rd session of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group on June 13, followed by his participation in the NATO Defense Ministerial on June 14.\n\nThe UDCG once again brought together representatives from over 50 countries to discuss and coordinate security assistance for Ukraine as they continue to defend against Russian aggression. The meeting underscored the continued commitment, unity and resolve of allies and partners to help bolster Ukraine's defense infrastructure and support its sovereignty both in the near and long term.\n\nThe subsequent NATO Defense Ministerial afforded NATO allies the opportunity to discuss several critical issues, including enhanced support for Ukraine, strengthening NATO's deterrence and defense capabilities and preparation for the upcoming NATO Summit in Washington. During the ministerial, NATO defense ministers reaffirmed their commitment to providing sustained military assistance to Ukraine.\n\nThe ministerial was the last major milestone prior to the upcoming NATO 75th Anniversary Summit, which is scheduled for here in Washington, D.C. from July 9-11. Notably, the summit will bring together leaders and defense ministers from all 32 NATO member countries to commemorate our enduring alliance and address critical global security challenges.\n\nThe summit will also underscore our unwavering mutual commitment to collective defense, transatlantic unity and ongoing support for Ukraine. We'll have much more to provide about the summit in the near future.\n\nShifting gears, on June 9, Marines with the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit deployed AV-8B Harrier jets, MV-22B Osprey tiltrotor aircraft and personnel to Ronneby Airport in Kallinge, Sweden, for Exercise Baltops '24.\n\nThe detachment, part of Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron 365, demonstrates the ability to project force over 900 nautical miles and establish a forward operating base, enhancing combined response capability and interoperability in the Baltic Sea region. For more information on Exercise Baltops '24, please contact U.S. Marine Corps Public Affairs.\n\nAnd finally, the department announced today at Fort Liberty, North Carolina, a first-of-its-kind partnership with Duke Energy to power five major military installations in North and South Carolina with solar electricity.\n\nThrough this procurement, Duke Energy will provide carbon-free electricity to five major military installations in North and South Carolina, including U.S. Army Fort Liberty, Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point and Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in North Carolina and Shaw Air Force Base in South Carolina.\n\nThe contract, valued at $248 million, will provide an estimated 4.8 million MWh of carbon-free energy over a 15-year delivery period from two newly-constructed off-site solar facilities in South Carolina. By supporting the construction of new clean renewable energy, we're enhancing our resilience in support of the warfighter and DOD mission. For additional information about this unique initiative, I'd refer you to Fort Liberty Public Affairs.\n\nWith that, be happy to take your questions. I see AP is out of the room today, so we'll go ahead and start with Liz here. Put you on the spot.\n\nQ: Great. I guess just to follow up on the continued Houthi attacks, a mariner was killed. A different mariner was critically injured. You know, what is the Pentagon, what is CENTCOM going to do differently to prevent these from happening?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Yeah, thanks. So again, you know, we're very focused on ensuring that these kinds of attacks are degraded, that the Houthis will continue to understand that there's going to be a price to be paid for essentially preventing freedom of navigation in this vital international waterway, and it's just completely unacceptable.\n\nSo again, we continue to work very closely with partners in the region to provide capabilities to safeguard maritime travel through the Red Sea and elsewhere, and we'll continue to stay very focused on that.\n\nQ: On a separate topic, last week in Brussels, Secretary Austin called on more NATO countries to up their defense spending. What specifically is the U.S. doing to, you know, get that to happen, to have these other countries just spend more on their defenses?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Well, I think you've seen, you know, not only Secretary Austin, but the secretary-general of NATO has talked about this. You know, it's very important that we, as NATO allies, all contribute to our collective defense.\n\nAnd I won't speak for individual nations and I think the secretary's words on this speak for itself -- other than to say that we all have a vested interest in making sure a strong, secure NATO, and I think what you continue to see our NATO allies stepping up to do that. So I'm confident that will continue to be a topic of discussion, to include at the upcoming summit.\n\nCarla?\n\nQ: Thanks. Who does the Pentagon assess to be the current global leader of the Islamic State? There's been some confusion about that recently.\n\nGEN. RYDER: Yeah, I mean, you know, I'm sure you're tracking that ISIS declared last year that Abu Hafs al-Hashimi al-Qurashi is its fifth leader. You know they run a succession of leaders. Doesn't seem to be a long life expectancy these days.\n\nSo, you know, not a lot of information out there publicly available, but again, you know, I'm sure you could reach out to DNI and they could help you deep dive on that.\n\nQ: Also, to follow up on Ukraine and F-16s, how many pilots does the U.S. and its allies in the UDCG expect to be ready to fly F-16s this summer?\n\nGEN. RYDER: So that's really a question that's best addressed by Ukraine. You know, they should be the ones to talk about pilot management in terms of the overall size of their fleet, their overall size of their pilot cadre, and what their expectations are in terms of how they're going to implement that program.\n\nOur focus is on working with the air capability coalition to identify what their requirements are and then meeting those requirements. And as you know, training being conducted both in Arizona and in Denmark. There's the capacity to conduct additional training at other locations, you know, that are being prepared in Europe, because again, this will be a long-term proposition in terms of supporting them through the air capability coalition. Thanks.\n\nTom?\n\nQ: Pat, any update on the Gaza pier, when it'll be up and running again? And also, with the airdrops, when do you expect them to resume?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Yeah, in terms of the JLOTS, we expect it will go operational again this week, and I don't have a specific date to give you right now but of course we'll keep you posted on that.\n\nAs far as airdrops go, we do have the capability and do intend to continue conducting airdrops. So again, as those happen, CENTCOM will post them.\n\nQ: ... airdrops?\n\nGEN. RYDER: There is no holdup, per se. There's always going to be a variety of factors to take into account, to include the conditions on the ground, the weather. And so, you know, very similar to the pier, you've got to take a variety of factors into account when making those decisions.\n\nBut again, you know, kind of -- you didn't ask this -- but to your point, this is a multifaceted effort to get aid into Gaza. Whether it be via land, air, or sea, we're going to continue to do what we need to do to make that happen. Thank you.\n\nLara? And then I'll go to this side of the room, I promise.\n\nQ: Thank you. So the New York Times just reported, based on aid groups, saying that the pier could be dismantled as early as this coming month, in July. Is that accurate?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Look, we've said all along, first of all, that the pier is a temporary measure. I don't have any dates to announce, in terms of when it will cease operations. Of course, as I just mentioned, we're looking forward to getting it operational again soon and to delivering aid. And, you know, we're going to capitalize on the conditions, you know, in terms of weather, to get as much aid across that pier as we can.\n\nQ: Is there a delay in getting the pier back operational now, or is it not repaired?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Well, as you know, it went to Ashdod to get repaired, and I just said again it's going to get -- we expect that it will go operational again this week.\n\nQ: And then I just wanted to ask you to see if you confirmed the reports last week that the U.S. is sending an additional Patriot to Ukraine from Poland?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Again, I don't have anything to announce in terms of additional Patriots for Ukraine. As you saw Secretary Austin say at the Contact Group and during the NATO defense ministerials, air defense continues to be a high priority for Ukraine, and we're going to continue to work closely with allies and partners to ensure they have what they need to defend their people.\n\nOK, yes, sir?\n\nQ: Yeah, thank you, General. My question on Iraq and HMC meeting with the Iraqi government of HMC meetings, High Military Commission meetings, to discuss about the future of U.S.-led global coalition in Iraq.\n\nIt's been six months passed, and do you have any updates for me -- well, where are you in these meetings? Have you gotten any decision about the future of the U.S.-led global coalition in Iraq and the U.S. military presence?\n\nGEN. RYDER: As I understand it, so far, the working groups continue to meet. Within the coming weeks, my understanding is that participants intend to have another principals meeting, where coalition leaders will receive a progress update, but as of right now, I don't have anything additional to pass along.\n\nQ: ... any deadline for these meetings?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Not that I'm aware of, but again, I mean, obviously the groups are coming together to talk about very important things, to include, you know, one, what is the current threat that ISIS poses, what is the operating environment, and looking at Iraqi Security Forces' capabilities.\n\nAnd so again, I think understanding that this is a very important discussion and a very important set of meetings, they're going to continue to stay focused on making progress in that regard, but I just don't want to get ahead of it and speculate on when specifically they will be ready to make any type of announcements.\n\nYes, sir?\n\nQ: Thank you, General. Several official sources report that it is important the U.S. continue to corroborate with international coalition forces, the Peshmerga and the Iraqi Army to prevent the reorganization of ISIS. What is your comment on this?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Well, you know, look, the Iraqi Security Forces, to include Peshmerga, have had significant impact on ISIS's ability to conduct the kind of terror operations that we saw, you know, a decade ago. And so that's a real testament to the capabilities and the effectiveness of these forces working together in the region.\n\nSo, you know, kind of related to your colleague's question there, we're going to continue to work closely with the Iraqi government and other partners in the region, to include the Peshmerga, when it comes to what is the ISIS threat, what do we need to do to ensure that it can't resurge in the way that we had seen it do earlier, and make sure that, at the same time, that our partners have the capabilities that they need to be able to ensure that ISIS doesn't come back, the enduring defeat of ISIS. Thank you.\n\nLet me go to the phone here real quick. Dan Lamothe, Washington Post?\n\nQ: Thanks, General, appreciate your time. On these Houthis attacks, we've had a number of discussions this year about interdiction. Clearly, weapons are still getting in, clearly that remains a challenge. Is there anything more that the Pentagon, the U.S. military can do there to get after that problem?\n\nAnd then relatedly, earlier this year, we saw a number of kind of large wave attacks by the U.S. military and allies on the Houthis. In light of these attacks over the last several days, at least one of which was deadly, is there reason we haven't seen something similar of late? Thanks.\n\nGEN. RYDER: Yeah, thanks, Dan. So a few things. You know, so first of all, again, keeping in mind what we're focused on here, which is safety and freedom of navigation when it comes to this vital waterway, the Red Sea, through which 10 to 15 percent of international commerce traverses -- and so that is something that we're going to continue to stay focused on.\n\nAnd in terms of Houthi strikes, I think, yes, you know, it is incredibly unfortunate that some of these strikes have struck vessels as recently as this week, as you saw, or over this weekend.\n\nAnd it's also important to highlight the impact that U.S. and international forces have had in terms of thwarting many of these attacks and safeguarding shipping and the lives of mariners. And so, we're going to continue to stay focused on that.\n\nAs you highlight, this is a whole of government effort in terms of looking at other levers by which we can compel the Houthis to stop. But our primary focus is on degrading and disrupting their ability to conduct these kinds of attacks.\n\nAnd in terms of other things that can be done, you know, I think that continuing to put the spotlight from various groups to include the media into the impacts that Yemen's attacks are having on its own citizens in terms of their economic, environmental and health, as well as those, their neighbors in the region, you know, would shed some additional context and perspective in terms of the fact that these strikes are not in any way contributing to supporting the Palestinian people, that are in fact acts of terrorism, that are, if anything, making life worse for the average Yemeni and the people that live in the region.\n\nIf you want to talk about people doing things to help the Palestinians, look at the amount of aid that's going into Gaza and all we see the Houthis doing are launching missiles and trying to kill innocent mariners.\n\nAll right, let me go to Phil Stewart, Reuters.\n\nQ: Thanks. I'd like to get your reaction to Russian President Putin's visit to North Korea where he pledged invariable support for Pyongyang. Victor Cha said this deepening Russia-North Korea relationship poses the greatest threat to U.S. national security since the Korean War. Is he right?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Yeah, thanks, Phil. Again, you know, we're aware of the upcoming visit both to Pyongyang and Hanoi. And you've heard others say this too. The deepening cooperation between Russia and the DPRK is something that should be of concern, especially to anyone that's interested in maintaining peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, but also supporting the people of Ukraine as they continue to fight against Russian aggression.\n\nAnd so, of course, you know, you're well aware of DPRK providing ammunition and weapons to Russia that's been able to help them perpetuate their illegal and unprovoked war against the Ukrainian people.\n\nSo, it's something that we're going to continue to keep an eye on. I would say though, taking a step back, our focus when it comes to the Indo-Pacific region and the Korean Peninsula is on working with allies and partners to promote peace, stability, and security in the region, and that will continue to be our focus.\n\nThank you.\n\nQ: I just want to add that issue of Putin visit to North Korea. He already in Pyongyang right now. At the meeting between President Putin and Kim Jong-un, the comprehensive strategic partnership agreement was signed between North Korea and Russia. In particular, it is known that a strengthening military cooperation, including automatic military intervention in case of emergency, will be discussed.\n\nWhat impact do you think this will have on security and the peace on the Korean Peninsula as well as in Ukraine?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Yeah, well, I'm not going to comment on specific agreements between Russia and the DPRK other than to say our focus continues to be on promoting regional security and stability in the region as well as our extended deterrence efforts as it comes to supporting our ROK and Japanese allies. And so, I'll just leave it at that.\n\nQ: One more thing. (Inaudible) comment of the U.S. and ROK combined the forces command, put the (inaudible) on the South Korean government loud speaker test against the North Korea. And South Korean government stated that resumption of loud speaker broadcasting was self-defense responses to North Korea garbage balloon provocations.\n\nWhat is the Pentagon's assessment from these provocations?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Yeah, so I'd -- I'd have to refer you to USFJ to respond to that. I just don't have any insight to provide on that.\n\nQ: Yeah, that's (inaudible) North Korea can provocative to South Korea, but South Korea cannot (be) provocative?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Again, you're asking me a question about an order that or a request that General LaCamera made. I'd refer you back to (USFK) for any details on that. Again, I think it's very clear that the United States and ROK are working very closely together when it comes to addressing security concerns and threats on the Korean peninsula.\n\nWe obviously have a longstanding alliance and we continue to deepen that alliance, all focused on making sure that the people of South Korea as well as the broader Indo-Pacific region can be assured of peace and security in the region.\n\nSo again, I'd refer you to USFJ or USFK for additional details. Let me go to Luis here.\n\nQ: There are claims, well there's a statement today by Prime Minister Netanyahu that the United States has not been providing weapons and munitions to Israel recently and he called the United States to resume that.\n\nIs that the case, I think publicly the administration has acknowledged the 2,000-pound bombs with regards to Rafah, but has there been a slowdown? Has there been a delay? Is there a production issue? What exactly is Prime Minister talking about?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Yeah, thanks, Luis. So, I won't comment on the Prime Minister's remarks themselves. As you've heard us say, we're absolutely committed to continuing to support Israel's inherent right to defend itself since Hamas's vicious attack on October 7th, we've rushed billions of dollars of security assistance to Israel to enable them to defend themselves and we're going to continue to provide them with the security assistance they need again for defense.\n\nNow we've paused one shipment of high payload unguided munitions. There's not been a final determination at this time on how to proceed with that shipment. As you've heard us say previously, there are concerns about the use of these munitions in a dense urban setting like Rafah and we've been very clear with the Israelis about the steps that they must take to be effective in this fight. So, I'm just going to leave it at that.\n\nQ: So, in other words, when you talked about rushing aid to Israel, that rushing aid continues?\n\nGEN. RYDER: We continue to support Israel with security assistance and their ability to defend themselves. As I mentioned, we paused one shipment of 2,000-pound bombs, unguided bombs.\n\nQ: I have a question about the New York Times report about the pier.\n\nGEN. RYDER: Sure.\n\nQ: Can you confirm that military officials have told aid organizations that potentially the pier, the JLOT's Trident Pier, may be dismantled next month?\n\nGEN. RYDER: I'm not tracking any established timeline at this point, in terms of when the pier will stop operating, again with the caveat that this was always intended to be a temporary pier. I'm not aware at this point of any established date of this is when we're going to stop.\n\nAnd again, taking a step back here, the big picture, whether it be by land, sea, or air, employing all avenues to get assistance into Gaza -- I mean, when you just think for a second, you know, since the pier was put in place about a month ago, we've been able to shuttle over 3,500 metric tons, or 7.7 million pounds, of aid onto the shore in Gaza via this temporary pier.\n\nAnd we're going to continue to work very closely with aid groups, with the UN, with the Israelis and other regional partners to look at ways to get additional aid in to the Palestinians, to include via this maritime corridor.\n\nSo again, when we have anything new to announce, we certainly will, but as of right now, that's where we're at.\n\nDavid?\n\nQ: You mentioned the shipment of 2,000-pound bombs. Included in that shipment were also an even larger number, I think, of 500-pound bombs. Have the 500-pound bombs in that suspended shipment been released to go to Israel?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Not to my knowledge. It's all part of one shipment that has been suspended, again, pending further discussion.\n\nOK, Fadi?\n\nQ: Thank you, General. On the Rafah, have your Israeli counterparts notified you that the invasion of Rafah is ending soon?\n\nGEN. RYDER: I'm not -- so first of all, what I'm tracking right now in Rafah is we still continue to see Israel along the Philadelphi line. They continue to conduct some limited operations into Rafah to go after Hamas units and leaders.\n\nWe have not seen a large-scale -- you used the word \"invasion\" -- we've not seen a large-scale ground operation at this point. We're continuing to monitor that. Again, we've been very clear about what our expectations are in terms of safeguarding civilians.\n\nI do know that a significant number of civilians have relocated to elsewhere in Gaza. That said, this continues to be a topic of discussion between our leadership and Israeli leaders when it comes to conducting operations, both within Rafah but also throughout Gaza.\n\nQ: And last week, I asked you about the civilian toll from the Nuseirat operation that Israel conducted to rescue four hostages. This happened with U.S. support, intelligence, and logistics, as Sullivan acknowledged.\n\nHave you looked into the number of civilians that were killed during the operation, while noting that the Secretary, yourself, and the department have expressed many times concern about the human toll because of the Israeli operations?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Yeah, I don't have any updates to provide in terms of estimated civilian casualties, other than, again, we do know that there were civilian casualties as a part of that operation. I think the last time we spoke and this hasn't changed -- we continue to see two different numbers being put out by the Israelis versus Hamas. I don't know what the facts are, other than there's an acknowledgment that there were civilian casualties as part of that operation.\n\nBut again, in all of our discussions, we continue to expect and encourage the Israelis to take civilian casualties into account, again recognizing also what we talked about last time, was the fact that this was a hostage rescue, that you have civilians -- or you have hostages being held among the civilian population by an armed terrorist group, Hamas, certainly exacerbating the tensions and the challenging situation here.\n\nSo we're going to continue to expect civilian casualties to be taken into account, civilian harm mitigation to be taken into account going forward. No one wants to see any innocent civilians killed in this crossfire, whether they be Palestinians or Israelis.\n\nQ: ...But this is an operation that the U.S. supported with logistics and intelligence, and it led to high civilian casualties, according to local authorities in Gaza, more than 280. And as a matter of fact, you've been expressing concern about civilian casualties.\n\nDoesn't this require a look from the department into what actually happened, since you will -- as well vowing -- to keep supporting Israel in its efforts to rescue the captives or hostages?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Yeah -- and just to clarify here, again, the U.S. was not a part of this military operation. We were not militarily involved, we did not have forces that participated. And again, broadly speaking, when it comes to Israel's hostage recovery efforts, we've said that we are supportive in terms of providing intelligence information, but when it comes to this specific operation, again, we were not involved in conducting or executing or planning this particular operation.\n\nQ: ... supported the operation.\n\nGEN. RYDER: Well, we support Israel's inherent right to defend itself against Hamas. And again, we've recognized and acknowledged that way too many civilians have died in this conflict, and we're going to continue to encourage and expect our Israeli partners to take civilian harm into account as they're conducting the operations. I'll just leave it at that.\n\nLet me get to some other folks here. Yep?\n\nQ: Hi. About the Fort Liberty and other Carolina forts getting the solar factories -- or solar farms, as part of the Biden administration executive order that's planning for 100 percent clean energy to power up the federal government by 2030, what percent of the way to 100 percent is the Defense Department?\n\nAnd in terms of the costs of this solar -- these solar farms that power the bases, is it better financially for the department to use the solar power rather than, you know, go the traditional forms of energy?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Yeah, let me take that question and we'll come back to you.\n\nOK, yes?\n\nQ: On the collision between a Chinese vessel and the Philippines supply ship near the Second Thomas Shoal on Monday, there's some reports that at least eight of the Filipino sailors were injured and one of them was severely injured. So what's the Pentagon's assessment on this collision on Monday? And how much are you worried about the escalation of tensions between Philippines and China?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Yeah, so obviously very concerning reports. You know, in terms of the specifics as it relates to the Filipino sailors, I'd refer you to the Philippine government for additional details, but -- and you've heard others within the U.S. government say this -- this kind of behavior is provocative, it's reckless, it's unnecessary, and as you highlight, it could lead to something bigger and more violent.\n\nAnd so we are going to continue to stand with our Philippine allies. We condemn the escalatory and irresponsible actions by the PRC to deny the Philippines from executing a lawful maritime operation in the South China Sea. And as you've heard Secretary Austin and others say, the Philippines' rightful, legal maritime claims must be protected.\n\nTime for a few more. Yes, sir?\n\nQ: Thank you, General. Regarding to the escalation in the south of Lebanon. So do you still have concerns that this war could be, expand between Hezbollah and Israel. Even if there is no deal for a ceasefire deal, do you believe that deescalate could happen very soon? And do you still believe that Hezbollah will not jump in this war?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Yeah, we do remain concerned about tensions along the border on. And of course, we continue to encourage a diplomatic solution. Preventing a wider regional conflict has been a primary focus for this department and the U.S. government writ large since Hamas's attack on October 7th.\n\nAnd as you've heard, Secretary Austin say, we're going to continue to work toward that end. So, just leave it there.\n\nQ: I'm sorry, another one. Today, Hezbollah published a video of what it says, it was a footage gathered from its monitoring the drone, including the city of Haifa's sea and airport. Some sensitive locations inside Israel.\n\nHave you seen that video and do you have any comment about that?\n\nGEN. RYDER: I have not seen that video, so I'm just not able to comment.\n\nLet me do a couple more from the phone here. I'm going to go to Mike from Washington Times.\n\nQ: Hi, thanks Pat. I was wondering if the Pentagon has a definition of strategic success for Operation Prosperity Guardian and the other mission there in the Red Sea area. I know you're shooting down a lot of drones and striking a few targets occasionally inside Yemen, but commercial ship traffic through the region has not increased appreciably since it began. You know, playing Houthi whack-a-mole isn't the objective here.\n\nSo, what actually is the objective where you say we have succeeded?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Yeah, thanks, Mike. So, you know, let me just kind of turn this around a little bit here because, you know, there's a, this discussion about, you know, has deterrence failed? What is it that you're trying to achieve here? And it's what I talked about earlier, right? It's about preserving freedom of navigation in this vital waterway.\n\nAnd I would say that really, it's the Houthis that have failed to deter the United States and the international community from continuing to operate in the Red Sea. You know, they've conducted over 190 attacks, the vast majority of which have been knocked down, thanks to U. S. and international efforts to help safeguard shipping and the lives of Mariners through operations like Operation Prosperity Guardian.\n\nAnd additionally, as I mentioned before, the Houthis have been all over the map in terms of their purported rationale for conducting these strikes versus the reality of their actual operations and the impact. Whereas we've been, again, very clear why we're there, which is safety and freedom of navigation in this vitally important waterway.\n\nSo strategic success looks like the ability of the international community to continue to transit the Red Sea. And we're going to keep after it. Thanks.\n\nAll right. Let me go to JJ Green, WTOP.\n\nQ: Thanks, General. Reuters is reporting right now that Israeli defense forces have approved operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon. And this is one of the things, the three things that the U. S. military was trying to prevent when it was sent there, the expanded forces were sent there. Any thoughts about that?\n\nAnd then secondly, the Russian flotilla has moved away from Cuba and moved on to someplace else. Can you share about what you learned about what they were doing there and keeping tabs on them now, where they may be going, where may they be going?\n\nThank you.\n\nGEN. RYDER: Yeah, thanks, JJ. Again, when it comes to the situation along the Israel-Lebanon border again, our focus is on working with partners in the region to include Israel, obviously, to encourage a diplomatic resolution. So, I'm not going to get into hypotheticals or speculate on what might happen other than to say no one wants to see a wider regional war. And again, we'll stay focused on that.\n\nAs it relates to any Russian naval activity, you know, near Cuba. Look, I'll refer you to the Russian MOD or Navy to talk about their current operations. As you know, and as you've heard us say we obviously closely monitored, don't see any threat to the homeland and, and these types of exercises are not new. We've seen them take place, you know, over the years.\n\nSo again, nothing concerning from our standpoint, but we'll, again, continue to monitor.\n\nOK, I can do a couple more. Yes, ma'am.\n\nQ: So earlier today, Taiwan's Defense Minister Koo said that they should expect the delivery of the 2B anti-tank missiles and 100 launch purchase missiles by the end of this year. Number one, why is it taking this long? Why is it there a two-year delay?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Look, I don't have any specifics to provide in terms of aid deliveries to Taiwan other than to say, again, in accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act we will continue to work with Taiwan to ensure they have the capabilities that they need to defend themselves.\n\nAnd let me go ahead and go to Carla here.\n\nQ: Follow-up to Luis' question. You know, the U.S. paused one shipment of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel. Since then, how many security packages has the U.S. military provided Israel?\n\nGEN. RYDER: I don't have any statistics to pass along, Carla, other than to say again, you know, from the outset of Hamas attack on Israel we have worked closely to ensure that they have security assistance they need to defend themselves.\n\nQ: There have been additional packages since then.\n\nQ: And then to follow up what you said to me, you said that the liberal leader of ISIS, he doesn't seem to have a long-life expectancy. Can you confirm that the U.S. military targeted the global leader of ISIS on a strike on May 31st?\n\nGEN. RYDER: You know, there was -- I would just point you back to AFRICOM's statement. I don't have anything additional to provide at this point. Of course, if there's updates, we'll be sure to let you know.", "source": {"uri": "defense.gov", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. Department of Defense"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The 2% guideline built on a prior 2006 commitment made by NATO defense ministers.\n\nAt the time of the 2014 commitment, just three alliance members - the U.S., United Kingdom and Greece - were spending at least 2% of their economic output on defense. By 2020, nine NATO member states had met the commitment, though that fell to six the following year before rebounding to seven in 2022 after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and it rose further to 10 last year based on estimated figures.\n\nThe 2024 data showed that 23 of the 32 member countries, including the two newest members, Finland and Sweden, met the 2% defense spending commitment.

The Ministry of State Security reported the incident on social media, commending the retired man, identified only as Mr. Zhang, for promptly reporting his find via a hotline. The ministry highlighted the potential dangers had these documents fallen into the hands of someone with malicious intent.\n\nMr. Zhang, upon realizing he had inadvertently acquired the country's military secrets, took them home before deciding to report the incident. The Ministry of State Security emphasized the potential catastrophic consequences if the documents had been obtained by individuals with ulterior motives, news agency Associated Press reported.\n\nThis incident was part of a broader effort by the Ministry of State Security to raise public awareness about national security. Recently, the ministry has been sharing dramatic stories to engage a wider audience. This campaign appears to be particularly relevant as tensions between the U.S. and China escalate, with both nations increasingly concerned about the theft or transfer of confidential information.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. State Department condemned China's actions in the South China Sea, labeling them as \"escalatory and irresponsible.\" This statement followed an incident where China's coast guard accused a Philippine supply ship of dangerously approaching a Chinese vessel, leading to a minor collision. The Philippines rejected these claims. The two nations have been engaged in a war of words over dangerous maneuvers at the Second Thomas Shoal, a contested area within Manila's exclusive economic zone, which China also claims.\n\nIn a related geopolitical context, China urged NATO to stop \"shifting blame\" over the Ukraine war. This statement came after NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg accused China of exacerbating the conflict by supporting Russia. Stoltenberg called for China to face consequences for its alleged efforts to bolster Russia's defense industry. In response, China's foreign ministry spokesperson, Lin Jian, criticized NATO, advising it to focus on self-reflection rather than attacking China.\n\nChina has consistently portrayed itself as a neutral party in the Ukraine conflict, denying allegations of providing lethal assistance to either side.

Gen. Pat Ryder Holds a Press Briefing", "body": "Pentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder Holds a Press Briefing\n\nMajor General Pat Ryder, Pentagon Press Secretary\n\nMAJOR GENERAL PAT RYDER: All right, good afternoon, everyone. Good to be back in the briefing room after several weeks of travel. Just a few things at the top, and then we'll get right to your questions.\n\nOn Friday, Secretary Austin concluded a productive trip to Brussels, where he hosted the 23rd session of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group on June 13, followed by his participation in the NATO Defense Ministerial on June 14.\n\nThe UDCG once again brought together representatives from over 50 countries to discuss and coordinate security assistance for Ukraine as they continue to defend against Russian aggression. The meeting underscored the continued commitment, unity and resolve of allies and partners to help bolster Ukraine's defense infrastructure and support its sovereignty both in the near and long term.\n\nThe subsequent NATO Defense Ministerial afforded NATO allies the opportunity to discuss several critical issues, including enhanced support for Ukraine, strengthening NATO's deterrence and defense capabilities and preparation for the upcoming NATO Summit in Washington. During the ministerial, NATO defense ministers reaffirmed their commitment to providing sustained military assistance to Ukraine.\n\nThe ministerial was the last major milestone prior to the upcoming NATO 75th Anniversary Summit, which is scheduled for here in Washington, D.C. from July 9-11. Notably, the summit will bring together leaders and defense ministers from all 32 NATO member countries to commemorate our enduring alliance and address critical global security challenges.\n\nThe summit will also underscore our unwavering mutual commitment to collective defense, transatlantic unity and ongoing support for Ukraine. We'll have much more to provide about the summit in the near future.\n\nShifting gears, on June 9, Marines with the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit deployed AV-8B Harrier jets, MV-22B Osprey tiltrotor aircraft and personnel to Ronneby Airport in Kallinge, Sweden, for Exercise Baltops '24.\n\nThe detachment, part of Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron 365, demonstrates the ability to project force over 900 nautical miles and establish a forward operating base, enhancing combined response capability and interoperability in the Baltic Sea region. For more information on Exercise Baltops '24, please contact U.S. Marine Corps Public Affairs.\n\nAnd finally, the department announced today at Fort Liberty, North Carolina, a first-of-its-kind partnership with Duke Energy to power five major military installations in North and South Carolina with solar electricity.\n\nThrough this procurement, Duke Energy will provide carbon-free electricity to five major military installations in North and South Carolina, including U.S. Army Fort Liberty, Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point and Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in North Carolina and Shaw Air Force Base in South Carolina.\n\nThe contract, valued at $248 million, will provide an estimated 4.8 million MWh of carbon-free energy over a 15-year delivery period from two newly-constructed off-site solar facilities in South Carolina. By supporting the construction of new clean renewable energy, we're enhancing our resilience in support of the warfighter and DOD mission. For additional information about this unique initiative, I'd refer you to Fort Liberty Public Affairs.\n\nWith that, be happy to take your questions. I see AP is out of the room today, so we'll go ahead and start with Liz here. Put you on the spot.\n\nQ: Great. I guess just to follow up on the continued Houthi attacks, a mariner was killed. A different mariner was critically injured. You know, what is the Pentagon, what is CENTCOM going to do differently to prevent these from happening?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Yeah, thanks. So again, you know, we're very focused on ensuring that these kinds of attacks are degraded, that the Houthis will continue to understand that there's going to be a price to be paid for essentially preventing freedom of navigation in this vital international waterway, and it's just completely unacceptable.\n\nSo again, we continue to work very closely with partners in the region to provide capabilities to safeguard maritime travel through the Red Sea and elsewhere, and we'll continue to stay very focused on that.\n\nQ: On a separate topic, last week in Brussels, Secretary Austin called on more NATO countries to up their defense spending. What specifically is the U.S. doing to, you know, get that to happen, to have these other countries just spend more on their defenses?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Well, I think you've seen, you know, not only Secretary Austin, but the secretary-general of NATO has talked about this. You know, it's very important that we, as NATO allies, all contribute to our collective defense.\n\nAnd I won't speak for individual nations and I think the secretary's words on this speak for itself -- other than to say that we all have a vested interest in making sure a strong, secure NATO, and I think what you continue to see our NATO allies stepping up to do that. So I'm confident that will continue to be a topic of discussion, to include at the upcoming summit.\n\nCarla?\n\nQ: Thanks. Who does the Pentagon assess to be the current global leader of the Islamic State? There's been some confusion about that recently.\n\nGEN. RYDER: Yeah, I mean, you know, I'm sure you're tracking that ISIS declared last year that Abu Hafs al-Hashimi al-Qurashi is its fifth leader. You know they run a succession of leaders. Doesn't seem to be a long life expectancy these days.\n\nSo, you know, not a lot of information out there publicly available, but again, you know, I'm sure you could reach out to DNI and they could help you deep dive on that.\n\nQ: Also, to follow up on Ukraine and F-16s, how many pilots does the U.S. and its allies in the UDCG expect to be ready to fly F-16s this summer?\n\nGEN. RYDER: So that's really a question that's best addressed by Ukraine. You know, they should be the ones to talk about pilot management in terms of the overall size of their fleet, their overall size of their pilot cadre, and what their expectations are in terms of how they're going to implement that program.\n\nOur focus is on working with the air capability coalition to identify what their requirements are and then meeting those requirements. And as you know, training being conducted both in Arizona and in Denmark. There's the capacity to conduct additional training at other locations, you know, that are being prepared in Europe, because again, this will be a long-term proposition in terms of supporting them through the air capability coalition. Thanks.\n\nTom?\n\nQ: Pat, any update on the Gaza pier, when it'll be up and running again? And also, with the airdrops, when do you expect them to resume?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Yeah, in terms of the JLOTS, we expect it will go operational again this week, and I don't have a specific date to give you right now but of course we'll keep you posted on that.\n\nAs far as airdrops go, we do have the capability and do intend to continue conducting airdrops. So again, as those happen, CENTCOM will post them.\n\nQ: ... airdrops?\n\nGEN. RYDER: There is no holdup, per se. There's always going to be a variety of factors to take into account, to include the conditions on the ground, the weather. And so, you know, very similar to the pier, you've got to take a variety of factors into account when making those decisions.\n\nBut again, you know, kind of -- you didn't ask this -- but to your point, this is a multifaceted effort to get aid into Gaza. Whether it be via land, air, or sea, we're going to continue to do what we need to do to make that happen. Thank you.\n\nLara? And then I'll go to this side of the room, I promise.\n\nQ: Thank you. So the New York Times just reported, based on aid groups, saying that the pier could be dismantled as early as this coming month, in July. Is that accurate?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Look, we've said all along, first of all, that the pier is a temporary measure. I don't have any dates to announce, in terms of when it will cease operations. Of course, as I just mentioned, we're looking forward to getting it operational again soon and to delivering aid. And, you know, we're going to capitalize on the conditions, you know, in terms of weather, to get as much aid across that pier as we can.\n\nQ: Is there a delay in getting the pier back operational now, or is it not repaired?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Well, as you know, it went to Ashdod to get repaired, and I just said again it's going to get -- we expect that it will go operational again this week.\n\nQ: And then I just wanted to ask you to see if you confirmed the reports last week that the U.S. is sending an additional Patriot to Ukraine from Poland?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Again, I don't have anything to announce in terms of additional Patriots for Ukraine. As you saw Secretary Austin say at the Contact Group and during the NATO defense ministerials, air defense continues to be a high priority for Ukraine, and we're going to continue to work closely with allies and partners to ensure they have what they need to defend their people.\n\nOK, yes, sir?\n\nQ: Yeah, thank you, General. My question on Iraq and HMC meeting with the Iraqi government of HMC meetings, High Military Commission meetings, to discuss about the future of U.S.-led global coalition in Iraq.\n\nIt's been six months passed, and do you have any updates for me -- well, where are you in these meetings? Have you gotten any decision about the future of the U.S.-led global coalition in Iraq and the U.S. military presence?\n\nGEN. RYDER: As I understand it, so far, the working groups continue to meet. Within the coming weeks, my understanding is that participants intend to have another principals meeting, where coalition leaders will receive a progress update, but as of right now, I don't have anything additional to pass along.\n\nQ: ... any deadline for these meetings?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Not that I'm aware of, but again, I mean, obviously the groups are coming together to talk about very important things, to include, you know, one, what is the current threat that ISIS poses, what is the operating environment, and looking at Iraqi Security Forces' capabilities.\n\nAnd so again, I think understanding that this is a very important discussion and a very important set of meetings, they're going to continue to stay focused on making progress in that regard, but I just don't want to get ahead of it and speculate on when specifically they will be ready to make any type of announcements.\n\nYes, sir?\n\nQ: Thank you, General. Several official sources report that it is important the U.S. continue to corroborate with international coalition forces, the Peshmerga and the Iraqi Army to prevent the reorganization of ISIS. What is your comment on this?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Well, you know, look, the Iraqi Security Forces, to include Peshmerga, have had significant impact on ISIS's ability to conduct the kind of terror operations that we saw, you know, a decade ago. And so that's a real testament to the capabilities and the effectiveness of these forces working together in the region.\n\nSo, you know, kind of related to your colleague's question there, we're going to continue to work closely with the Iraqi government and other partners in the region, to include the Peshmerga, when it comes to what is the ISIS threat, what do we need to do to ensure that it can't resurge in the way that we had seen it do earlier, and make sure that, at the same time, that our partners have the capabilities that they need to be able to ensure that ISIS doesn't come back, the enduring defeat of ISIS. Thank you.\n\nLet me go to the phone here real quick. Dan Lamothe, Washington Post?\n\nQ: Thanks, General, appreciate your time. On these Houthis attacks, we've had a number of discussions this year about interdiction. Clearly, weapons are still getting in, clearly that remains a challenge. Is there anything more that the Pentagon, the U.S. military can do there to get after that problem?\n\nAnd then relatedly, earlier this year, we saw a number of kind of large wave attacks by the U.S. military and allies on the Houthis. In light of these attacks over the last several days, at least one of which was deadly, is there reason we haven't seen something similar of late? Thanks.\n\nGEN. RYDER: Yeah, thanks, Dan. So a few things. You know, so first of all, again, keeping in mind what we're focused on here, which is safety and freedom of navigation when it comes to this vital waterway, the Red Sea, through which 10 to 15 percent of international commerce traverses -- and so that is something that we're going to continue to stay focused on.\n\nAnd in terms of Houthi strikes, I think, yes, you know, it is incredibly unfortunate that some of these strikes have struck vessels as recently as this week, as you saw, or over this weekend.\n\nAnd it's also important to highlight the impact that U.S. and international forces have had in terms of thwarting many of these attacks and safeguarding shipping and the lives of mariners. And so, we're going to continue to stay focused on that.\n\nAs you highlight, this is a whole of government effort in terms of looking at other levers by which we can compel the Houthis to stop. But our primary focus is on degrading and disrupting their ability to conduct these kinds of attacks.\n\nAnd in terms of other things that can be done, you know, I think that continuing to put the spotlight from various groups to include the media into the impacts that Yemen's attacks are having on its own citizens in terms of their economic, environmental and health, as well as those, their neighbors in the region, you know, would shed some additional context and perspective in terms of the fact that these strikes are not in any way contributing to supporting the Palestinian people, that are in fact acts of terrorism, that are, if anything, making life worse for the average Yemeni and the people that live in the region.\n\nIf you want to talk about people doing things to help the Palestinians, look at the amount of aid that's going into Gaza and all we see the Houthis doing are launching missiles and trying to kill innocent mariners.\n\nAll right, let me go to Phil Stewart, Reuters.\n\nQ: Thanks. I'd like to get your reaction to Russian President Putin's visit to North Korea where he pledged invariable support for Pyongyang. Victor Cha said this deepening Russia-North Korea relationship poses the greatest threat to U.S. national security since the Korean War. Is he right?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Yeah, thanks, Phil. Again, you know, we're aware of the upcoming visit both to Pyongyang and Hanoi. And you've heard others say this too. The deepening cooperation between Russia and the DPRK is something that should be of concern, especially to anyone that's interested in maintaining peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, but also supporting the people of Ukraine as they continue to fight against Russian aggression.\n\nAnd so, of course, you know, you're well aware of DPRK providing ammunition and weapons to Russia that's been able to help them perpetuate their illegal and unprovoked war against the Ukrainian people.\n\nSo, it's something that we're going to continue to keep an eye on. I would say though, taking a step back, our focus when it comes to the Indo-Pacific region and the Korean Peninsula is on working with allies and partners to promote peace, stability, and security in the region, and that will continue to be our focus.\n\nThank you.\n\nQ: I just want to add that issue of Putin visit to North Korea. He already in Pyongyang right now. At the meeting between President Putin and Kim Jong-un, the comprehensive strategic partnership agreement was signed between North Korea and Russia. In particular, it is known that a strengthening military cooperation, including automatic military intervention in case of emergency, will be discussed.\n\nWhat impact do you think this will have on security and the peace on the Korean Peninsula as well as in Ukraine?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Yeah, well, I'm not going to comment on specific agreements between Russia and the DPRK other than to say our focus continues to be on promoting regional security and stability in the region as well as our extended deterrence efforts as it comes to supporting our ROK and Japanese allies. And so, I'll just leave it at that.\n\nQ: One more thing. (Inaudible) comment of the U.S. and ROK combined the forces command, put the (inaudible) on the South Korean government loud speaker test against the North Korea. And South Korean government stated that resumption of loud speaker broadcasting was self-defense responses to North Korea garbage balloon provocations.\n\nWhat is the Pentagon's assessment from these provocations?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Yeah, so I'd -- I'd have to refer you to USFJ to respond to that. I just don't have any insight to provide on that.\n\nQ: Yeah, that's (inaudible) North Korea can provocative to South Korea, but South Korea cannot (be) provocative?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Again, you're asking me a question about an order that or a request that General LaCamera made. I'd refer you back to (USFK) for any details on that. Again, I think it's very clear that the United States and ROK are working very closely together when it comes to addressing security concerns and threats on the Korean peninsula.\n\nWe obviously have a longstanding alliance and we continue to deepen that alliance, all focused on making sure that the people of South Korea as well as the broader Indo-Pacific region can be assured of peace and security in the region.\n\nSo again, I'd refer you to USFJ or USFK for additional details. Let me go to Luis here.\n\nQ: There are claims, well there's a statement today by Prime Minister Netanyahu that the United States has not been providing weapons and munitions to Israel recently and he called the United States to resume that.\n\nIs that the case, I think publicly the administration has acknowledged the 2,000-pound bombs with regards to Rafah, but has there been a slowdown? Has there been a delay? Is there a production issue? What exactly is Prime Minister talking about?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Yeah, thanks, Luis. So, I won't comment on the Prime Minister's remarks themselves. As you've heard us say, we're absolutely committed to continuing to support Israel's inherent right to defend itself since Hamas's vicious attack on October 7th, we've rushed billions of dollars of security assistance to Israel to enable them to defend themselves and we're going to continue to provide them with the security assistance they need again for defense.\n\nNow we've paused one shipment of high payload unguided munitions. There's not been a final determination at this time on how to proceed with that shipment. As you've heard us say previously, there are concerns about the use of these munitions in a dense urban setting like Rafah and we've been very clear with the Israelis about the steps that they must take to be effective in this fight. So, I'm just going to leave it at that.\n\nQ: So, in other words, when you talked about rushing aid to Israel, that rushing aid continues?\n\nGEN. RYDER: We continue to support Israel with security assistance and their ability to defend themselves. As I mentioned, we paused one shipment of 2,000-pound bombs, unguided bombs.\n\nQ: I have a question about the New York Times report about the pier.\n\nGEN. RYDER: Sure.\n\nQ: Can you confirm that military officials have told aid organizations that potentially the pier, the JLOT's Trident Pier, may be dismantled next month?\n\nGEN. RYDER: I'm not tracking any established timeline at this point, in terms of when the pier will stop operating, again with the caveat that this was always intended to be a temporary pier. I'm not aware at this point of any established date of this is when we're going to stop.\n\nAnd again, taking a step back here, the big picture, whether it be by land, sea, or air, employing all avenues to get assistance into Gaza -- I mean, when you just think for a second, you know, since the pier was put in place about a month ago, we've been able to shuttle over 3,500 metric tons, or 7.7 million pounds, of aid onto the shore in Gaza via this temporary pier.\n\nAnd we're going to continue to work very closely with aid groups, with the UN, with the Israelis and other regional partners to look at ways to get additional aid in to the Palestinians, to include via this maritime corridor.\n\nSo again, when we have anything new to announce, we certainly will, but as of right now, that's where we're at.\n\nDavid?\n\nQ: You mentioned the shipment of 2,000-pound bombs. Included in that shipment were also an even larger number, I think, of 500-pound bombs. Have the 500-pound bombs in that suspended shipment been released to go to Israel?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Not to my knowledge. It's all part of one shipment that has been suspended, again, pending further discussion.\n\nOK, Fadi?\n\nQ: Thank you, General. On the Rafah, have your Israeli counterparts notified you that the invasion of Rafah is ending soon?\n\nGEN. RYDER: I'm not -- so first of all, what I'm tracking right now in Rafah is we still continue to see Israel along the Philadelphi line. They continue to conduct some limited operations into Rafah to go after Hamas units and leaders.\n\nWe have not seen a large-scale -- you used the word \"invasion\" -- we've not seen a large-scale ground operation at this point. We're continuing to monitor that. Again, we've been very clear about what our expectations are in terms of safeguarding civilians.\n\nI do know that a significant number of civilians have relocated to elsewhere in Gaza. That said, this continues to be a topic of discussion between our leadership and Israeli leaders when it comes to conducting operations, both within Rafah but also throughout Gaza.\n\nQ: And last week, I asked you about the civilian toll from the Nuseirat operation that Israel conducted to rescue four hostages. This happened with U.S. support, intelligence, and logistics, as Sullivan acknowledged.\n\nHave you looked into the number of civilians that were killed during the operation, while noting that the Secretary, yourself, and the department have expressed many times concern about the human toll because of the Israeli operations?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Yeah, I don't have any updates to provide in terms of estimated civilian casualties, other than, again, we do know that there were civilian casualties as a part of that operation. I think the last time we spoke and this hasn't changed -- we continue to see two different numbers being put out by the Israelis versus Hamas. I don't know what the facts are, other than there's an acknowledgment that there were civilian casualties as part of that operation.\n\nBut again, in all of our discussions, we continue to expect and encourage the Israelis to take civilian casualties into account, again recognizing also what we talked about last time, was the fact that this was a hostage rescue, that you have civilians -- or you have hostages being held among the civilian population by an armed terrorist group, Hamas, certainly exacerbating the tensions and the challenging situation here.\n\nSo we're going to continue to expect civilian casualties to be taken into account, civilian harm mitigation to be taken into account going forward. No one wants to see any innocent civilians killed in this crossfire, whether they be Palestinians or Israelis.\n\nQ: ...But this is an operation that the U.S. supported with logistics and intelligence, and it led to high civilian casualties, according to local authorities in Gaza, more than 280. And as a matter of fact, you've been expressing concern about civilian casualties.\n\nDoesn't this require a look from the department into what actually happened, since you will -- as well vowing -- to keep supporting Israel in its efforts to rescue the captives or hostages?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Yeah -- and just to clarify here, again, the U.S. was not a part of this military operation. We were not militarily involved, we did not have forces that participated. And again, broadly speaking, when it comes to Israel's hostage recovery efforts, we've said that we are supportive in terms of providing intelligence information, but when it comes to this specific operation, again, we were not involved in conducting or executing or planning this particular operation.\n\nQ: ... supported the operation.\n\nGEN. RYDER: Well, we support Israel's inherent right to defend itself against Hamas. And again, we've recognized and acknowledged that way too many civilians have died in this conflict, and we're going to continue to encourage and expect our Israeli partners to take civilian harm into account as they're conducting the operations. I'll just leave it at that.\n\nLet me get to some other folks here. Yep?\n\nQ: Hi. About the Fort Liberty and other Carolina forts getting the solar factories -- or solar farms, as part of the Biden administration executive order that's planning for 100 percent clean energy to power up the federal government by 2030, what percent of the way to 100 percent is the Defense Department?\n\nAnd in terms of the costs of this solar -- these solar farms that power the bases, is it better financially for the department to use the solar power rather than, you know, go the traditional forms of energy?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Yeah, let me take that question and we'll come back to you.\n\nOK, yes?\n\nQ: On the collision between a Chinese vessel and the Philippines supply ship near the Second Thomas Shoal on Monday, there's some reports that at least eight of the Filipino sailors were injured and one of them was severely injured. So what's the Pentagon's assessment on this collision on Monday? And how much are you worried about the escalation of tensions between Philippines and China?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Yeah, so obviously very concerning reports. You know, in terms of the specifics as it relates to the Filipino sailors, I'd refer you to the Philippine government for additional details, but -- and you've heard others within the U.S. government say this -- this kind of behavior is provocative, it's reckless, it's unnecessary, and as you highlight, it could lead to something bigger and more violent.\n\nAnd so we are going to continue to stand with our Philippine allies. We condemn the escalatory and irresponsible actions by the PRC to deny the Philippines from executing a lawful maritime operation in the South China Sea. And as you've heard Secretary Austin and others say, the Philippines' rightful, legal maritime claims must be protected.\n\nTime for a few more. Yes, sir?\n\nQ: Thank you, General. Regarding to the escalation in the south of Lebanon. So do you still have concerns that this war could be, expand between Hezbollah and Israel. Even if there is no deal for a ceasefire deal, do you believe that deescalate could happen very soon? And do you still believe that Hezbollah will not jump in this war?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Yeah, we do remain concerned about tensions along the border on. And of course, we continue to encourage a diplomatic solution. Preventing a wider regional conflict has been a primary focus for this department and the U.S. government writ large since Hamas's attack on October 7th.\n\nAnd as you've heard, Secretary Austin say, we're going to continue to work toward that end. So, just leave it there.\n\nQ: I'm sorry, another one. Today, Hezbollah published a video of what it says, it was a footage gathered from its monitoring the drone, including the city of Haifa's sea and airport. Some sensitive locations inside Israel.\n\nHave you seen that video and do you have any comment about that?\n\nGEN. RYDER: I have not seen that video, so I'm just not able to comment.\n\nLet me do a couple more from the phone here. I'm going to go to Mike from Washington Times.\n\nQ: Hi, thanks Pat. I was wondering if the Pentagon has a definition of strategic success for Operation Prosperity Guardian and the other mission there in the Red Sea area. I know you're shooting down a lot of drones and striking a few targets occasionally inside Yemen, but commercial ship traffic through the region has not increased appreciably since it began. You know, playing Houthi whack-a-mole isn't the objective here.\n\nSo, what actually is the objective where you say we have succeeded?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Yeah, thanks, Mike. So, you know, let me just kind of turn this around a little bit here because, you know, there's a, this discussion about, you know, has deterrence failed? What is it that you're trying to achieve here? And it's what I talked about earlier, right? It's about preserving freedom of navigation in this vital waterway.\n\nAnd I would say that really, it's the Houthis that have failed to deter the United States and the international community from continuing to operate in the Red Sea. You know, they've conducted over 190 attacks, the vast majority of which have been knocked down, thanks to U. S. and international efforts to help safeguard shipping and the lives of Mariners through operations like Operation Prosperity Guardian.\n\nAnd additionally, as I mentioned before, the Houthis have been all over the map in terms of their purported rationale for conducting these strikes versus the reality of their actual operations and the impact. Whereas we've been, again, very clear why we're there, which is safety and freedom of navigation in this vitally important waterway.\n\nSo strategic success looks like the ability of the international community to continue to transit the Red Sea. And we're going to keep after it. Thanks.\n\nAll right. Let me go to JJ Green, WTOP.\n\nQ: Thanks, General. Reuters is reporting right now that Israeli defense forces have approved operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon. And this is one of the things, the three things that the U. S. military was trying to prevent when it was sent there, the expanded forces were sent there. Any thoughts about that?\n\nAnd then secondly, the Russian flotilla has moved away from Cuba and moved on to someplace else. Can you share about what you learned about what they were doing there and keeping tabs on them now, where they may be going, where may they be going?\n\nThank you.\n\nGEN. RYDER: Yeah, thanks, JJ. Again, when it comes to the situation along the Israel-Lebanon border again, our focus is on working with partners in the region to include Israel, obviously, to encourage a diplomatic resolution. So, I'm not going to get into hypotheticals or speculate on what might happen other than to say no one wants to see a wider regional war. And again, we'll stay focused on that.\n\nAs it relates to any Russian naval activity, you know, near Cuba. Look, I'll refer you to the Russian MOD or Navy to talk about their current operations. As you know, and as you've heard us say we obviously closely monitored, don't see any threat to the homeland and, and these types of exercises are not new. We've seen them take place, you know, over the years.\n\nSo again, nothing concerning from our standpoint, but we'll, again, continue to monitor.\n\nOK, I can do a couple more. Yes, ma'am.\n\nQ: So earlier today, Taiwan's Defense Minister Koo said that they should expect the delivery of the 2B anti-tank missiles and 100 launch purchase missiles by the end of this year. Number one, why is it taking this long? Why is it there a two-year delay?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Look, I don't have any specifics to provide in terms of aid deliveries to Taiwan other than to say, again, in accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act we will continue to work with Taiwan to ensure they have the capabilities that they need to defend themselves.\n\nAnd let me go ahead and go to Carla here.\n\nQ: Follow-up to Luis' question. You know, the U.S. paused one shipment of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel. Since then, how many security packages has the U.S. military provided Israel?\n\nGEN. RYDER: I don't have any statistics to pass along, Carla, other than to say again, you know, from the outset of Hamas attack on Israel we have worked closely to ensure that they have security assistance they need to defend themselves.\n\nQ: There have been additional packages since then.\n\nQ: And then to follow up what you said to me, you said that the liberal leader of ISIS, he doesn't seem to have a long-life expectancy. Can you confirm that the U.S. military targeted the global leader of ISIS on a strike on May 31st?\n\nGEN. RYDER: You know, there was -- I would just point you back to AFRICOM's statement. I don't have anything additional to provide at this point. Of course, if there's updates, we'll be sure to let you know.\n\nhttps://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/3811490/", "source": {"uri": "globalsecurity.org", "dataType": "news",

The 2% guideline built on a prior 2006 commitment made by NATO defense ministers.\n\nAt the time of the 2014 commitment, just three alliance members - the U.S., United Kingdom and Greece - were spending at least 2% of their economic output on defense. By 2020, nine NATO member states had met the commitment, though that fell to six the following year before rebounding to seven in 2022 after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and it rose further to 10 last year based on estimated figures.\n\nThe 2024 data showed that 23 of the 32 member countries, including the two newest members, Finland and Sweden, met the 2% defense spending commitment.

Another source said that not all NATO members were ready for such a wording, as Ukraine has not implemented all the democratic and anti-corruption reforms necessary for membership.\n\nAn official from a European country that is in favour of Ukraine's NATO membership stated that the European allies were lobbying the White House so that the wording in the decision of the Washington summit was as precise as possible.\n\n\"We instinctively feel a new path should be laid out. Fast tracking [Ukraine's membership] should be looked at,\" he said.\n\nCNN noted that there is a general recognition that NATO's position out of the summit needs to have advanced from last year's meeting in the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius, when the allies declared that \"Ukraine's future is in NATO\" but didn't offer a timeline.\n\nEarlier, Julian Smith, US ambassador to NATO, stated that important changes in the wording regarding Ukraine's membership prospects would be made at an upcoming meeting of NATO leaders in Washington.\n\nThe Ukrainian government hopes that the decision of the summit will contain a specific position regarding the irreversibility of Ukraine's membership.", "source": {"uri": "pravda.com.ua", "dataType": "news", "title": "\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_states_of_NATO", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Member states of NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_summit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NATO summit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pravda", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pravda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_General_of_NATO", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secretary General of NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(meeting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Summit (meeting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jens_Stoltenberg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jens Stoltenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_and_Eastern_Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central and Eastern Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Ukraine", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lithuania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lithuania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lobbying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilnius", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vilnius"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vilnius"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lithuania"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Wordplay", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Wordplay", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Writers_Resources/Style_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Writers Resources/Style Guides", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Word_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Word Games", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word_Processors", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word Processors", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Puzzles/Word_Search", "label": "dmoz/Games/Puzzles/Word Search", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://img.pravda.com/images/doc/7/4/7461631_fb_image_eng_2024_06_19_22_46_36.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659612", "eventUri": "eng-9659612", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 107, "relevance": 1}

In just a few weeks' time, we'll gather here in Washington for NATO's 75th summit, celebrating 75 years of strength, of unity, of growth, of innovation in our Alliance, but also, critically, looking forward to make sure that NATO is fit for purpose for the challenges of today and the challenges tomorrow, making sure that this Alliance continues to do what it's done so effectively for the last 75 years, and that's protect our people.\n\nAnd I think it's an opportunity as well to remind all of our citizens about the power of collective defense - the power of collective defense as the best way to prevent conflict, to deter aggression, to avoid war. Because at the heart of NATO is a commitment from each Ally to come to the defense of any other Ally that may be the victim of aggression. And that means that a would-be aggressor, considering taking action, knows that if they pick a fight with one, they pick a fight with all. And that is the most effective, powerful way to do what we all want to do, which is to prevent war from occurring in the first place. So these investments that we're making in our defensive Alliance are the best possible investments we can make in preventing conflict, avoiding conflict, deterring aggression.\n\nThe Secretary General and I were together in Prague with all of our allies just a couple of weeks ago, working through the key decisions ahead of the July summit. And, of course, critically the Secretary General was here with President Biden yesterday working to help finalize these details and very important ones. We continue that conversation today.\n\nWe have very ambitious commitments that we're making as an Alliance going forward. We're demonstrating our enduring support for Ukraine and providing a strong bridge to Ukraine's membership in the Alliance. We're establishing a NATO command in Wiesbaden, coordinating training, security assistance, equipment - its transfer, its repair, its maintenance. We're strengthening our collective deterrence and defense. We're implementing the robust plans that Allies agreed to, the most robust plans for defense and deterrence since the end of the Cold War, meeting the long-term challenge that Russia poses to the transatlantic Alliance and to security. We're growing our defense industrial bases to make sure that all of our countries can effectively produce what's needed for our defense.\n\nAnd critically - and you heard President Biden and the Secretary General address this yesterday - we are boosting our burden sharing, making sure that every Ally is standing up and carrying the weight of our collective defense. As the Secretary General announced yesterday, 23 allies - 23 allies out of the 32 - now meet the 2 percent target, the target of spending 2 percent of GDP on defense, a target established in 2014 at the Wales summit. When President Biden took office in 2021, nine allies were meeting that mark. Now, it is 23. And we've also seen, as the Secretary General said yesterday, an 18 percent increase in defense spending across the Alliance. That's the largest in a decade, and it is necessary to meet the challenges of this time.\n\nWe're also making sure that our Alliance is strengthening partnerships with other countries, including countries out of the transatlantic area, particularly deepening coordination, deepening cooperation with partners in the Indo-Pacific, who will be present at the summit, as well as within the transatlantic community with the European Union, a critical partner for all of us. The Alliance recognizes that security challenges in one part of the world impact another and vice versa. So what's happening in the transatlantic space has real consequences and implications for the Indo-Pacific and other areas, just as what's happening in the Indo-Pacific space has real implications for our own Alliance. And there's a recognition of that, and that recognition is turning into concrete and strong partnerships. Prime Minister Kishida may have said this best in the context of Ukraine when he said what's happening in Ukraine today may well be happening in East Asia tomorrow.\n\nWe're also adapting and building resilience to emerging threats - and this is also something that you'll see underscored at the summit - cyber, hybrid attacks and threats, as well as other challenges to security that we've seen manifest themselves in different ways in recent years, including things like pandemics. NATO has to be fit for purpose to deal with all of these.\n\nTwo other points I want to make quickly before turning it over to the Secretary General. I mentioned already that the summit will focus on bolstering Ukraine's long-term success. From day one, as the battlefield has evolved, so too has our support for Ukraine. Partners, the Alliance, the United States have all adapted and helped Ukraine deal with what it had to deal with in terms of warding off this Russian aggression.\n\nNow, thanks to the supplemental, which passed Congress after many months - but it did pass, and it passed with overwhelming bipartisan support - we've now been working these recent weeks to speed all of that assistance to the front lines, to make sure that Ukrainians have what they needed in hand to deal with the ongoing Russian aggression. And we've seen, I think, that be very effective in terms of stabilizing the front lines and making sure that the Russians could be stopped in their offensive. It's making a big difference. Of course, as we've said all along, what makes the biggest difference is the extraordinary courage and resilience of the Ukrainians themselves, both in dealing with the challenges in Kharkiv and in the east, but also taking the fight as necessary to Russia and Crimea, as well as in the Black Sea.\n\nThe bilateral assistance agreement that the United States signed just a few days ago - President Biden and President Zelenskyy - that marks now the, I think, 17th bilateral security agreement that's been signed since President Biden announced this initiative on the margins of the G7 a year ago. And by the time of the summit, we expect that - the NATO summit, we expect that some 20 countries and maybe more will have concluded their bilateral security agreements with Ukraine. This is proof, clear proof, that all of our countries are with Ukraine for the long haul and that if Mr. Putin is counting on outlasting Ukraine or outlasting any of us, he is misguided; he's wrong. And again, I think you'll see at the summit further emphasis on that.\n\nWe're also, as necessary, imposing new sanctions on Russia to keep the pressure up, so that the aggression ultimately ends. And, among other things, we're looking at countries that are supporting Russia's defense industrial base, which is allowing Russia to continue the war, including China. As President Biden has made clear, we have a real concern not with the - not with weapons being supplied by China to Russia. That's not what they're doing. What they are doing, as you've heard me discuss many times, is providing critical support to Russia's defense industrial base. Some 70 percent of the machine tools that Russia is importing are coming from China; 90 percent of the microelectronics coming from China. And that has enabled Russia to keep that defense industrial base going, to keep the war machine going, to keep the war going. So that has to stop.\n\nWe, as well, are doing everything we can to provide the necessary support to Ukraine beyond the supplemental. You saw partners come together across the G7 and beyond to be able to use effectively some of the Russian sovereign assets that are primarily in Europe and that now are being leveraged to provide some $50 billion to Ukraine in additional assistance, and we'll continue to look at that. We had a very effective recovery conference just a few days ago as well, looking at other forms of enduring support for Ukraine, including in the energy sector.\n\nThe bottom line is this: The Ukraine strategy that we've had and that we've been acting on individually and collectively now for nearly two and a half years is showing effective results - effective results in making sure that Ukraine can ward off Russian aggression, and it's done that remarkably. Keep in mind Putin's objective from day one was to erase Ukraine from the map, to ends its existence as an independent country, to subsume it into Russia. That has failed.\n\nBut going forward, we want to make sure that Ukraine is a success, that it stands strongly on its own feet militarily, economically, democratically, and that's exactly what we're enabling Ukraine to do. And that is the mark of success going forward. Again, decisions that will be made at the summit will further that effort, and more to be said in a few weeks' time.\n\nFinally, heading into the 75th summit, we have an Alliance that is stronger, that is bigger, that is more fit for purpose than at any time in recent years. That's thanks to the effort that every Ally has made, the commitments that every Ally has made, but it's also fundamentally thanks to the leadership of one individual, and that is the person standing beside me, the secretary general of NATO for this past decade, Jens Stoltenberg. Jens, you have led the Alliance at a time of historic change, historic challenge, and the results are there for everyone to see. This would not have happened without your leadership, and it's truly been extraordinary.\n\nNow, some of you know that the secretary general is particularly fond of numbers, likes to recite them. I understand that you even told one interviewer that you could bring just one book to a desert island, it would be a book on statistics. (Laughter.) I have things I could say about that that I won't, but let's just remind a few numbers, a few statistics, because they do show what's happened over this remarkable decade of the secretary general's leadership: four new Allies in our Alliance - North Macedonia, Montenegro, Finland, Sweden - multinational battle groups in eight countries, enhancing NATO's forward defense posture; 75 percent of the citizens in Allied nations say that NATO is important to their security.\n\nThese numbers speak powerfully for themselves. At every step, the secretary general has set the tone. He's built consensus among the 32 countries. His vision, his achievements will pay dividends for this Alliance far into the future. So Jens's contributions ultimately can't be fully quantified, but neither can the gratitude of the United States and all of our Allies to you, Mr. Secretary General. Thank you.\n\nSECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG: Secretary Blinken, dear Tony, thank you for your kind words and thank you for your support throughout these years in different ways. Thank you also for your very strong commitment to NATO, to our transatlantic Alliance, and let me also thank you for your tireless efforts to end the suffering in the Middle East.\n\nNATO was founded in Washington 75 years ago. Since then, the Alliance has been the ultimate security guarantee for all our members. Standing together, we prevent war and preserve peace. In NATO, the U.S. has 31 friends and Allies. Together, Allies represent half of the world's economic and half of the world's military might, advancing U.S. interests and multiplying America's power. NATO makes America stronger.\n\nYesterday, as you mentioned, Secretary Blinken, with President Biden I announced that NATO Allies are making major increases in defense spending. This year, defense spending across Europe and Canada is up 18 percent, the biggest increase in decades. Twenty-three Allies will meet the target of spending at least 2 percent of GDP on defense. This is more than twice as many as just four years ago. Since 2014, Europe and Canada have added over 640 billion extra in defense spending. This demonstrates a historic improvement in burden sharing within NATO. It shows that United States does not need to shoulder the burden alone and that the U.S. has a strong Alliance in which Allies are stepping up year after year.\n\nAnd much of this increased defense spending is spent right here in the United States. Over the past two years, European Allies have signed contracts with American companies worth 150 - sorry, $140 billion U.S. Since 2014, NATO has undergone the most significant transformation in our collective defense in a generation. We are putting in place the most comprehensive defense plans since the Cold War. We have 500,000 troops at high readiness, and we are double the number of battle groups in eastern part of the Alliance. And with Sweden and Finland as members, we are stronger than ever.\n\nRussia's war in Ukraine is a brutal assault on a peaceful democratic nation. This war is propped up by China, North Korea, and Iran. They want to see the United States fail. They want to see NATO fail. If they succeed in Ukraine, it will make us more vulnerable and the world more dangerous. So our support to Ukraine is not charity; it is in our own security interest. We all want this war to end, but the Russian occupation of Ukraine offers no peace, and capitulation to Putin offers no security. The stronger our support, the sooner the war will end, which is why I welcome the 10-year bilateral security agreement between the United States and Ukraine.\n\nEurope is also doing its part, matching U.S. efforts in Ukraine, and at the NATO Summit this July here in Washington, I expect European Allies and Canada to come forward with more financial and military support, and that leaders will agree that NATO takes the lead in coordinating the security assistance and training for Ukraine. All of this will reduce the burden on the United States.\n\nSecretary Blinken, I thank you and the U.S. for hosting the summit, which we all are looking forward to attend. At the summit, we will celebrate the 75th anniversary of the most successful alliance in history, but also make important decisions for the future. Thank you.\n\nMR MILLER: The first question goes to Humeyra Pamuk with Reuters.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Matt. Mr. Secretary, Mr. Secretary General, I'm very glad you like numbers. I have a number of questions, in true Washington fashion - (laughter) - multi-part questions that Secretary Blinken is particularly fond of.\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: The number one is a very good number. (Laughter.)\n\nQUESTION: Let me start with Gaza, then I'll turn to NATO. Mr. Secretary, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hosted - about an hour ago, conveniently timed for this press conference - a video talking about U.S. pause on some weapons to Israel, and said you assured him, last week that U.S. is working to remove those bottlenecks. Is this an accurate characterization of what you told him? If not, what did you tell him? Will the U.S. remove its hold on these bombs? And finally, have the ceasefire negotiators - excuse me - made any progress since last week? Are you more, or less, optimistic today about the prospects of a deal?\n\nLet me turn to both of you. Russian President Vladimir Putin is going to North Korea, a first in 24 years, and the partnership of Russia, China, and North Korea seems to be solidifying and emerging as a front against West's rules-based order. How concerned are you about this partnership?\n\nMr. Secretary General, particularly for you, do you see a collective NATO role to contain this emerging front?\n\nAnd back to both of you again. What specifics do you have on how much North Korea is contributing to Russia's war machine? And what is your understanding that what Moscow is giving Pyongyang in return? Thank you.\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Thanks, Humeyra. So on the questions regarding Israel and Gaza, first, it's very important to remember that our security relationship with Israel goes well beyond Gaza. Israel is facing a multiplicity of threats and challenges, including in the north from Hizballah, from Iran, from the Houthis in the Red Sea, from various groups that are aligned against Israel and in many cases beholden to Iran. So the President's been very clear from day one that he will do everything he can to make sure that Israel has what it needs to effectively defend itself against these threats. And a big part of that as well is making sure that in providing that assistance to Israel, it has a strong deterrent, which is the best way to avoid more conflict, to avoid more war, to avoid what we're already seeing in Gaza spreading other areas, to other fronts. That's been one of our objectives from day one.\n\nSo we're committed to that. We, as you know, are continuing to review one shipment that President Biden has talked about with regard to 2,000-pound bombs because of our concerns about their use in a densely populated area like Rafah. That remains under review. But everything else is moving as it normally would move, and again, with the perspective of making sure that Israel has what it needs to defend itself against this multiplicity of challenges.\n\nWith regard to the ceasefire negotiations, and you heard me talk about this at length during our trip, I'll just remind everyone once again that the entire world came together behind the proposal that President Biden laid out a few weeks ago - the entire world with one exception, and that was Hamas. Hamas came back with - after everyone else had said yes, including Israel, reconfirmed to me by Prime Minister Netanyahu when I was in Israel - Hamas came back with new conditions, new demands, including demands and conditions that actually went beyond what it had already previously accepted.\n\nSo we're working to see if we can bridge the gaps that Hamas has now created by not saying yes to the proposal that everyone else had agreed to, that was endorsed by the United Nations Security Council, countries around the world. And we have the negotiators, the mediators - Egypt, Qatar in particularly - working on this to see if we can bridge the gap.\n\nAs I've said before and I'll repeat again based on what we've seen in the - in recent days, I believe that the gaps are bridgeable, but that doesn't mean they will be bridged because ultimately Hamas has to decide. And it could decide again to continue to move the goalpost, to move the line out. If it continues to do that, the net result will be that people will continue to suffer horrifically every single day.\n\nAnd you have to question whether one individual - living, we believe, hundreds of feet underground, relatively safe - is putting his own interests and his own views ahead of the interests, the needs, of the people that he purports to represent. There could be a ceasefire right now if they had said yes a week ago. So we'll continue to work this with urgency, with determination, to see if we can bridge the gap. But I can't tell you with conviction that we will because, again, you have Hamas that continues to move the line.\n\nWith regard to Mr. Putin and his travels to North Korea, look. We've seen, as you've said, Russia try, in desperation, to develop and to strengthen relations with countries that can provide it with what it needs to continue the war of aggression that it started against Ukraine. And you heard the secretary general just reference this. North Korea is providing significant munitions to Russia, and other - and other weapons for use in Ukraine. Iran has been providing weaponry, including drones, that have been used against civilians and civilian infrastructure. And as I've mentioned a moment ago, the deep concerns we have about China, not in terms of providing weapons but in providing what Russia needs to keep its defense industrial base going and to produce itself more tanks, more munitions, more missiles - yes, these are the countries of concern.\n\nAnd with regard to China in particular, as I said before, it can't, on the one hand, say that it wants better relations with countries in Europe while at the same time fueling the biggest security threat to Europe as a whole since the end of the Cold War. And the President heard that himself - President Biden heard that himself from our European partners who are part of the G7 just last week.\n\nSo we are very much concerned about this because this is what's keeping the war going. And the fastest way to end the war is for Putin to be disabused of the notion that he can outlast Ukraine and outlast all of Ukraine's supporters, but also, if he knows that the fuel he needs for his war machine won't be there any more. So if China in particular, which professes to have a strong interest in ending the war - if it really means it, it will stop fueling the war machine, and we'll continue to do everything we can to cut off the support that countries like Iran and North Korea are providing.\n\nSECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG: I very much agree with what Secretary Blinken just stated. Putin's visits to North Korea demonstrates and confirms the very close alignment between Russia and authoritarian states like North Korea, but also China and Iran. And this also demonstrates that our security is not regional. It's global. What happens in Europe matters for Asia, and what happens in Asia matters for us. And this is clearly demonstrated in Ukraine, where Iran, North Korea, China are propping up, fueling Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine.\n\nSo this idea that we can divide security into regional theaters doesn't work anymore. We are - everything is intertwined and therefore we need to address these challenges together. We are, of course, also concerned about the potential support that Russia provides to North Korea when it comes to supporting their missile and nuclear programs. We see how much military support Russia gets from North Korea but also from Iran, and how China is propping up their war economy.\n\nAnd this is also one of the reasons why at NATO and at the NATO Summit here in Washington next month, we will further strengthen our partnership with our partners in the Asia-Pacific region - Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, and Japan - also to address the fact that the challenges they see, we see in Asia, in Asia-Pacific are directly linked to the challenges we face in Europe. And let me also say that I also fully agree that China cannot have it both ways. They cannot continue to have normal trade relationships with countries in Europe and at the same time fuel the biggest war we have seen in Europe since the Second World War. So at some stage this has to have consequences for China.\n\nMR MILLER: Helle Svendsen with Nettavisen.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you. My question also goes to both of you. Norway today still has a continued fishing cooperation with Russia. I am wondering how we should approach this moving forward, and if there are - or if you are concerned or we should be concerned about them taking advantage of this cooperationship in light of Russian intelligence.\n\nSECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG: So which country?\n\nQUESTION: Norway.\n\nSECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG: Norway.\n\nQUESTION: Fishing cooperation.\n\nSECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG: Sorry, yeah, I know Norway.\n\nQUESTION: Yes. (Laughter.)\n\nSECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG: No, so first of all --\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: (Inaudible.)\n\nSECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG: Yeah. (Laughter.) So I'm not speaking on behalf of Norway. What I can say is that I expect all Allies to fully implement the sanctions we have agreed within the also EU framework and also individual Allies have imposed. Then beyond that (inaudible), I leave it to Norway to comment on how they implement the sanctions.\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Yeah, and I agree with the secretary general. Thank you.\n\nMR MILLER: Tom Bateman with BBC.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you very much to both of you. If I could start with Mr. Secretary General. We heard the Secretary of State talk about hybrid attacks against NATO frontline countries, an issue he's talked about before particularly in Prague, and a view that NATO would respond collectively as is appropriate. What does that response look like? Perhaps you can elaborate on whether there is a response already, or is this something that you think should take place in the future? Do you retaliate or try and create deterrence? I'm just interested in how that happens. And is there evidence that such action can create deterrence?\n\nAnd Mr. Secretary of State, Amos Hochstein has been in the region over the last few days in the Middle East. Can you report any progress on de-escalating tensions between Israel and Hizballah?\n\nAnd on Gaza, an investigation by the Associated Press this week identified 60 Palestinian families in which at least 25 members have been killed, some of them involving four generations of the same family, many with more than 50 family members killed, and in one, 173 family members were killed. And I'm interested to understand that for Palestinians who hear what you say about a continuing conflict for just cause, but to them this feels like a war that seeks to destroy Palestinian society. What do you say to those people? How do you reconcile those views and those positions?\n\nThank you.\n\nSECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG: On the Russian hybrid actions against NATO Allies in Europe, let me say that what we have seen over the last weeks and months is a surge in hostile actions by Russia against NATO Allies, and that includes sabotage, arson attempts, cyber attacks, and also trying to use migration as a tool to coerce NATO Allies. And we need to react to this in a calm and measured way, but at the same time to take it very seriously. And that's also why NATO Allies have agreed response options that Allies can take both individually and collectively.\n\nOn the NATO level, this is about increasing awareness, sharing intelligence, making Allies aware that this is not individual, not linked incidents, but this is actually a pattern of Russian behavior over some time. And I welcome also the U.S. sharing a lot of intelligence on these actions with other NATO Allies. Then it is about protecting our critical infrastructure, including undersea and cyber infrastructure. We're taking several steps to increase the protection of critical infrastructure.\n\nAnd then, of course, many of these actions are met by individual actions in the individual member-states. So there have been several arrests across the Alliance. In the United Kingdom, in Poland, in Germany, in the Baltic countries, we have seen those behind these sabotage actions being arrested, and there are legal processes going on. So there is a mix of collective action by NATO and individual Allies taking the necessary legal steps to protect us against this Russian behavior.\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: On Lebanon, so as I mentioned earlier, one of our objectives from day one, since October 7th, has been to prevent this conflict from spreading, including in the north. And as you mentioned, Amos Hochstein is in Lebanon, in the region working on this. We've all collectively been working on this for many months and intensely again in recent weeks. No one wants escalation. No one wants to see the conflict spread. And one of the paradoxes I think we have in this moment is I don't think any of the potential belligerents actually want to see a war or conflict spread. I don't believe Israel does. I don't believe Hizballah does. Lebanon certainly doesn't because it would suffer the most. I don't believe that Iran does. And yet you have momentum potentially in that direction because with the back and forth that goes on every day, there is always the possibility of miscalculation, of one side not fully seeing what the other is doing, and it's very important to do everything we can to arrest that and to find a diplomatic resolution to the challenge that exists for Israel as well as for Lebanon.\n\nIn Israel, there are something like 60 or 70,000 Israelis who have been forced from their homes. They've basically depopulated a big part of northern Israel because of the threat from Hizballah, because of Hizballah launching rockets into Israel and making life impossible. There are many Lebanese in southern Lebanon who are also not able to live in their homes and live in their towns. So we're working diplomatically to find a resolution to this so that people on both sides of the line have the confidence to be able to live in their homes and go back to their - where they live.\n\nNow here again, so much of this comes back to the ceasefire. The most immediate way to empower our diplomacy and to be able to reach an agreement that allows people to return to their homes and live in security would be through a ceasefire in Gaza, because Hizballah has tied the actions that it's committing against Israel to Gaza. So if we get that ceasefire, I think that will make it more likely that we can find a diplomatic resolution to the crisis in the north.\n\nWith regard to the Palestinian families that you've discussed - on a human level, the suffering of little children, men, women, is horrific, and we see it every single day. People who are caught in a crossfire of Hamas's making as a result of a war that Hamas started are suffering every single day. And for all of us, this is a profoundly human tragedy. I've met with Palestinian Americans who've lost multiple members of their own families in Gaza, who shared with me the pictures of a little niece, a little nephew, a brother, a sister, a parent, a grandparent who's been killed in the months since October 7th.\n\nAnd it's profoundly motivating in the wake of this suffering to want to do everything we possibly can to bring this to an end. The fastest way to do that - and this has been the case now for weeks, for months - is through the ceasefire that we've been working to achieve. And the biggest obstacle to achieving that ceasefire, again, remains Hamas and remains the decisions of perhaps one man, who is we believe hundreds of feet underground in relative safety, while the people he proports to represent are suffering every single day.\n\nSo we have to - all of us - put the interests of these many, many innocent families and people first and foremost. And that means that Israel has to do more - continue to do much more - to protect civilians, to make sure that they get the assistance they need. But it first and foremost means that Hamas has to make a decision. Is it actually looking out for the interests of Palestinian people? Is it looking out for its own interests at the expense of the interests of Palestinians who are suffering every single minute in Gaza?\n\nThe fastest way to bring this to a conclusion - tomorrow - is through this ceasefire. That's what we're looking to achieve.\n\nQUESTION: Can I just follow up, just on the point about crossfire? Because many of these deaths were in airstrikes, and by definition - I mean, they're on a (inaudible) so this is not crossfire. And I've heard you use that description before, so I just wanted to clarify.\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Yeah, look, on that - again, we've been on this as well, from day one, in trying to press Israel to do everything it can to avoid civilian causalities, to put a greater premium on civilian protection. And yes, we see that - we see this, too. It's - without justifying any particular airstrike - and certainly we've, ourselves, reported as a government, as the State Department, on numerous incidents where civilians have been killed or grievously injured, including through airstrikes. But as we've also said, this terrain is extraordinarily difficult, maybe uniquely difficult.\n\nBecause again, you have Hamas that not only is hiding deep underground in tunnels while the people it proports to represent are not, it's also hiding in apartment buildings, hospitals, schools, using those as places to plot, to plan, protect itself. But that means also that it's endangering thousands - tens of thousands - of children, women, and men. It launched this war on November[1] 7th. It conducts it in a way be retreating to places where it's hiding behind civilians that further endanger civilians. And it has not made the decisions necessary to stop it, which it could do right now.\n\nMR MILLER: And the final question goes to Anders Tvegard with NRT.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Matt. Mr. Secretary, how do you do? How can Ukraine trust your words of support when the recent bilateral agreement can be canceled with a six months' notice? And how confident are you that you will not need to ask Mr. Stoltenberg to extend his term as secretary general? And I didn't quite hear your answer to my colleague's question here on Israel. Is Netanyahu's - Prime Minister Netanyahu's characterization - is it true what he said about - that you - what you assured him last week?\n\nMr. Secretary General, China can't have it both ways. What kind of consequences should China - should be on China? And you want to secure the long-term help to Ukraine. You have been talking about a fund. If I understand it correctly, the Alliance has been lukewarm to an aid fund. What's your next step there? And if you soon get to read some more statistical books, what can you say about your possible successor? Thank you.\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Thank you. With regard to the bilateral security agreements, first it's important to note that the United States signed our agreement last week. President Biden and President Zelenskyy signed it together. But we are not alone. Dozens of countries have either concluded or will conclude bilateral security agreements with Ukraine, each of which basically says the same thing, that we're committed individually, as well as through the work that will be formalized at the NATO summit, to supporting Ukraine in building a deterrent force for the future that can ward off aggression and, as necessary, deal with it. And each of these agreements is projected over a decade to, again, send a very strong message that each of us is in this for the long haul. And that is the determination and commitment of the United States.\n\nI think the fact that ultimately the supplemental funding bill passed with overwhelming bipartisan support, both houses of Congress, again is indicative of the depth and strength of that support in the United States. And polling continues to show strong support in the United States for helping Ukraine, for making sure that it can stand on its own feet effectively, because that's what this is about. Any international agreement of one kind or another always has a mechanism in it for one of the parties to pull out of that agreement. That's standard operating fare in any of these agreements. But I think everything that we've seen, not just from the United States but from so many other countries, is an enduring commitment to Ukraine and making sure that it can stand strongly on its own feet. And I do not expect that to change.\n\nWith regard to the secretary general, look, I think many of us wish on one - on one level that this was a lifetime appointment because of - (laughter) - but I don't think the secretary general feels that way. And I'm confident, very confident, that the Alliance will come strongly together behind a new secretary general, and that when the current - when current secretary general - Secretary General Stoltenberg's term ends this fall, there will be a very strong secretary general in place to pick up the baton and carry the extraordinary work that this secretary general has done forward into the future for the Alliance.\n\nAnd finally, with regard to the last question on Israel, I stand by exactly what I said a few minutes ago. Thank you.\n\nQUESTION: Well, is Mr. Netanyahu telling the truth or not, Mr. Secretary?\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Again, I've been very --\n\nQUESTION: Is his characterization correct or not?\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: I've been as clear as I can possibly be.\n\nQUESTION: You assured him that (inaudible)?\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: I'm not going to talk about what we said in diplomatic conversations.\n\nQUESTION: But he is talking about it.\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: I can just say - I can just say, again, that we have a commitment to make sure that Israel has what it needs to defend itself against a whole variety of threats. Gaza is part of it, but it far surpasses Gaza in terms of the threats they face. The President's committed to that. We continue to move these different cases through our system on regular order. We have one case that the President's talked about publicly, about the 2,000-pound bombs and concerns that we have about them being used in densely populated areas. That remains. We continue to work through that.\n\nBut there's been no change in our posture, which our posture is, again, to make sure that Israel has what it needs to defend itself across these many threats. Many of the systems that are moving through our system are ones that have been on order for, in some cases, years. It takes a long time to move these things. And a number of the things that are going to Israel won't get there for years. That is the nature of the way this works.\n\nBut it's regular order, with the exception of that one system that we've talked about many times in public. Thank you.\n\nSECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG: First, briefly, on the question about China, well, it's too early to say exactly what kind of consequences. But I think just in itself that more and more Allies recognize this, that it cannot continue the way it is like it is today, where China really tries to have a normal relationship with European NATO Allies and, at the same time, are enabling Russia to be - conduct - to conduct a war of aggression against a European country, the biggest security challenge we have faced in Europe since the end of the Second World War. And of course, this is then about how - unless China changes its behavior, what kind of consequences should then this have for, for instance, our trade relations? Too early to say, but it has to be an issue that we need to address, because to continue as we do today is not viable.\n\nThen on support for Ukraine, as we are discussing and we are addressing many deliverables on Ukraine before the upcoming NATO summit. We have already a plan for NATO training and security assistance for Ukraine. We have seen new announcements, and I expect those are more announcement of more military support to Ukraine. I'm certain that we will also have language expressing that Ukraine will become a member of the Alliance.\n\nAnd then you are right that I have also put forward proposals on a more long-term commitment because I strongly believe that the stronger our support is, the more credible our long-term commitment to Ukraine is, the sooner this war can end. The exact language, exact - what we will agree, is what Allies - or - are now discussed among Allies, and - but I'm confident we will have a good solution agreement by the summit.\n\nThen, normally, I don't say anything about my successor because it's not for me to select my successor. But with the announcement by president - or, no, sorry, Prime Minister Orb\u00e1n today, I think it's obvious that we are very close to a conclusion in the Alliance for Allies to select the next secretary general. And I think that's good news. I think Mark Rutte is a very strong candidate. He has a lot of experience as prime minister, he's a close friend and colleague, and I therefore strongly believe that very soon the Alliance will have decided on my successor and that will be good for all of us, for NATO, and also for me. (Laughter.)\n\nMR MILLER: Thank you.\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Thanks, everyone.\n\nSECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG: Yeah, thank you.\n\n/Public Release.

But the hardships of that victory taught the World War II allies one important fact, that fighting as one force does not come together effortlessly, and that fighting as one requires long-term organization and a long-term commitment. The allies agreed, and -- pushed by the instability of European post-war reconstruction and the growing threat of Soviet Communism across parts of Europe and Asia -- the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was born. It remains intact and growing to this day, the largest peacetime military alliance in the world.\n\nBut a rising cabal of Republicans, including Wyoming Congresswoman Harriet Hageman, are determined to weaken, if not obliterate, America's critical membership in this powerful alliance. Hageman and others like her operate under the misguided, or perhaps coldly calculated, notion that America cannot or should not defend itself and its allies beyond its borders. And by juxtapositioning America's current border problems against our historic NATO commitments, they have created the perfect toxic muddle to throw at voters. This muddle, led by those who espouse isolationist sentiments and fortified by a small number of outright Russian sympathizers, has succeeded at bringing attempts to defund NATO onto the floor of Congress. But the problem with playing politics with something as important as our national security is too obvious to overstate.\n\nCase in point, Hageman recently voted, along with 45 other Republicans, in favor of an amendment to remove $433 million of NATO funding. The sponsor, Rep. Margarie Taylor-Greene, (R-Georgia), said this about her amendment, which ultimately failed, \"The American people are tired of their money being sent overseas to defend the world while receiving nothing in return.\"\n\nNothing in return? The statement is laughable.\n\nThat vote targeted a program that provides critical infrastructure support to American troops on the ground in allied countries. And while Greene's stated goal was to \"defund\" NATO, she and Hageman didn't vote to defund NATO. They voted to decrease funds needed to support American soldiers, which is a little like burning your own home down because your neighbors aren't paying their HOA dues. Harmful and highly ineffective. There are better ways to discuss a decrease in military spending than this.\n\nEvery congressional vote matters. Just think, if Article 5 of NATO was invoked in the next six months, those 45 Republican representatives appeared to be fine with undercutting infrastructure support for American soldiers who would be called to fight alongside our allies. And while some may say this was a small amount of money or just a symbolic act by Greene and Hageman, there are no symbolic votes in our Congress. Every vote is scrutinized. Not just by the voters, but by our allies and our enemies. This sloppy attempt to harm NATO does harm to our country.\n\nHageman's press release at the time of the bill passing made no mention of her \"yes\" vote on the Greene amendment, but she later echoed Greene's sentiments, telling Cowboy State Daily, \"NATO is failing. The USA has been shouldering more than our share for decades.\"\n\nThose are two very different statements incongruously put together. Let's start with the first. Is NATO failing? By all objective measures and standards, it is not. From the desires of its founding charter to the addition of two new members in the past five years, NATO continues to thrive and stand as an immovable barrier against madmen and evildoers.\n\nNATO remains the strongest deterrent against a global war that the world has ever seen. So much so that it has been duplicated (of sorts) in the Pacific to stand against the rising threat of Communist China. If this is solely the result of American overpayment, it was well worth it. And the correction would be to ask other nations to step up, not to withdraw and watch the global order implode into World War III.\n\nThe ideals that first created NATO are still valid and important, despite Hageman's statements to the contrary. But her comments, despite their wrongheadedness, are less concerning than her vote. Compromising American fighting forces on the ground while a war rages on the continent is beyond reckless, it is downright dangerous. Hageman seems unserious about properly governing the matters of American soldiers' safety abroad and gives the appearance she is willing to score political points at the cost of our long-term military objectives.\n\nNATO's survival is a deadly serious matter. Standing against those actors who would plunge the free world into chaos is a deadly serious matter. Votes like these highlight the smallness of the failing policy of isolationism or \"America First.\" Hageman should know that lesson from history.\n\nD-Day will forever remain a reminder of the enduring strength of allies like NATO, coming together against a common enemy.\n\nNATO was born from that reminder, and its mission is as relevant today as it was in 1949. For members of Congress like Hageman, their votes will be seen as a small attempt to resurrect the failures of isolationism in our history. Let us hope they continue to fail.\n\nFormer President Ronald Reagan understood the need for allies and all those who fought and won the Cold War on the strength of NATO and American ingenuity. Addressing those who paved the way for NATO on what was the 40th anniversary of D-Day in 1984 he said, \"One's country is worth dying for, and democracy is worth dying for, because it's the most deeply honorable form of government ever devised by man. All of you loved liberty. All of you were willing to fight tyranny, and you knew the people of your countries were behind you.\"", "source": {"uri": "wyofile.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WyoFile"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amy_edmonds@wyofile.com", "name": "Amy Edmonds", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wyoming"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wyoming"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harriet_Hageman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harriet Hageman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_landings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Normandy landings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Winston Churchill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Communism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soviet Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolationism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Isolationism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_III", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World War III"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cold War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Harriet_Hageman_52588112121.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659612", "eventUri": "eng-9659612", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 100, "relevance": 1}

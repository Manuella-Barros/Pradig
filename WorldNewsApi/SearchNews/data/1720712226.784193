I have a Finnish friend, so I can now recognise people when they are speaking Finnish \u2013 they sound like birds twittering. Japanese women talking sounds like a waterfall splashing down. nina1414 Japanese. Lovely undulating intonation. Also a lovely language to learn to speak as a foreigner. Eatmyhandbag All languages are beautiful until you can understand what\u2019s being said. Woolfardisworthy Tok Pisin. Just listen to it without trying to understand. It is pidgin derived to a great extent from English, but takes in enough of the many Indonesian languages, especially its rhythm and tonality. It means \u201cbird talk\u201d. \u201cThank you very much\u201d is \u201cTenk yu tru\u201d \u2013 far more beautiful than the English. brianmilne There is an Indigenous language in the Canary Islands called Silbo Gomero. All of the sounds in the language are whistles. Listening to it is like listening to a choir of birds. It\u2019s one of the most fascinating languages. fernlinhealy Brazilian Portuguese. It has all the best parts of the other Romance languages without any of the bad parts. Whereas the Portuguese version is no better or worse than Spanish (Castilian), the Brazilian version just sings and swings. And those Js! I could listen to someone reading the phone book or the entire collection of EU regulations in this language and would probably be head over heels in love with them by the time they were done. (PS I don\u2019t speak Portuguese or Spanish.) PaulDavisTheFirst We visited Iceland recently on our honeymoon and Icelandic is a gorgeous language. Sounds like water flowing over rocks. BananaMcFanana To get visual for a minute, some of the most beautiful languages are Caucasian (eg Georgian and Armenian), Mon/Burmese and ancient Chinese pictograms. But these are trumped by the tablets found in Iraq (Uruk) with proto-cuneiform writing and pictograms from about 3,300BC. Breathtaking. This is where writing and history and the ability to share experience across time and space began. kaml11 Beauty is in the ear of the listener. It\u2019s not a competition, but English doesn\u2019t sound lovely to me. rerab2 Have you ever heard this spoken, though? Whan that Aprille with his shoures soote, The droghte of March hath perced to the roote, And bathed every veyne in swich lic\u00f3ur Of which vert\u00fa engendred is the flour; Whan Zephirus eek with his swete breeth Inspired hath in every holt and heeth The tendre croppes, and the yonge sonne Hath in the Ram his halfe cours y-ronne, And smale foweles maken melodye, That slepen al the nyght with open ye, So priketh hem Nat\u00fare in hir corages, Thanne longen folk to goon on pilgrimages, And palmeres for to seken straunge strondes, To ferne halwes, kowthe in sondry londes; And specially, from every shires ende Of Engelond, to Caunterbury they wende, The hooly blisful martir for to seke, That hem hath holpen whan that they were seeke. Bookseeker \u201cYou have not experienced Shakespeare until you have read him in the original Klingon.\u201d Chancellor Gorkon, Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country. Sagarmatha1953 English when spoken as a second language, with an accent. It makes me hear old, familiar words with a new ear. I listen to the speaker more closely out of respect for the effort they\u2019ve made to communicate with me. RunningWater Python has many admirers, I underssstand. MalleusSacerdotum Italian. kulkulan But Italian spoken by whom? A northern accent and a southern one sound so very different that they are almost different tongues. Probably most people\u2019s idea of what Italian is supposed to sound like is based on a northern accent, but not too far north: the farther north you go, the more sing-songy it becomes. To my ear, a Brescian accent is just a joke. Farther south, a case could be made for the Neapolitan accent, which has an extraordinary sensuousness, but I think the most Italian-sounding Italian accent would be that of Emilia-Romagna \u2013 warm, melodious and clear. MrBloom I\u2019d put in a vote for click languages in southern and a patch of west-central Africa. Since I cannot understand a word, when I hear a conversation, I can concentrate on the music of it all. And I can feel I\u2019m listening to something analogous to the music of an amazing post-bop or south Indian drummer. I think if I understood a conversation, that sense would only deepen \u2013 even if the speakers were discussing root vegetables or tax returns.

I could listen to the sound of talking in dozens of languages and some would surely sound more pleasant than others. But without the meaning, that is all they are. Few of us have facility with more than a tiny number of languages. (Me \u2013 English monoglot with some very slight understanding of French, German and Welsh.) Which makes the question very difficult to answer. I just listened to Sukiyaki (Ue o Muite Arukou) sung by Kyu Sakamoto. A certain special sound in Japanese. But without the subtitles, I\u2019d be completely lost. MyOtherNameIsReal I think it is not the language, but the mood and soul of who is talking. German is amazingly sweet if spoken by a sweet German person. On the other hand, Italian \u2013 such a lovely musical language, one of my favourites \u2013 sounds to me horrible if spoken by people who are rude to each other. So it is not the language; it is the person behind it. BarcelonaCity I\u2019d say Cornish. It\u2019s a language that has survived despite over a century of extinction. It\u2019s also a language that is almost entirely intended to be spoken rather than written and is designed around community-use. Beautiful. Maymaymay Since my grandson was born profoundly deaf seven years ago, the most beautiful language for me has been learning British Sign Language. Sign language is so expressive, using facial expressions as well as your hands and body. I love to see my five-year-old hearing granddaughter conversing in BSL with her older brother, laughing and giggling together over grandma\u2019s frequent mistakes. They are my best teachers. Their baby sister, hearing, is also being brought up to be oral and signing. 7sisters I think they\u2019re all wonderful.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)President Joe Biden will hold a news conference Thursday, the key event in a monumental week during which the Democratic incumbent is fending off calls for him to step aside as the party's presumptive nominee following a shaky debate performance. It's just the type of event that many political watchers have said Biden needs to pull off successfully to turn back demands - including from within his own party - that he withdraw from his reelection battle against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. Biden has argued that he had a singularly bad night in Atlanta and that it wasn't representative of his mental acuity. A strong performance Thursday could convince members of his party that he still has the ability both to win in November and to serve a second term. A weak effort - or stumbles similar to his debate performances - could make the calls for him to withdraw grow much louder. Here are the details on what White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre has referenced as Biden's \"big boy\"\u009d news conference: When is the news conference? Biden is scheduled to take questions from the White House press corps at 6:30 p.m. Thursday. It had initially been slated for 5:30 p.m., but the White House moved the time to an hour later. Where is Biden speaking? Biden will be speaking from the Walter E. Washington Convention Center, a short distance from the White House, where many events of the ongoing NATO summit are being held. What channel is carrying it? The White House streams much of its live content. Given the attention on this event, television networks could also break away from programming to carry Biden's remarks live once he starts speaking. The Associated Press will offer a livestream at apnews.com. Who will be watching? Probably a lot of people. CNN reported that 51 million people watched the Atlanta debate, which was in primetime, while more than 8 million people tuned in to watch Biden's ABC interview live. If networks break into their daily coverage or cable channels carry it live, that will guarantee a significant number of eyes on Biden. Will Biden know the questions ahead of time? Aside from some apparent exceptions - like incidents in which two Black radio hosts said Biden's campaign sent them planned questions ahead of time - it's not standard practice for the president to know precisely what will come up during interviews or news conferences. His aides prepare him for a host of possibilities based off the headlines of the day, so they're prepping him for the likelihood that journalists will want to ask about his fitness for office, the NATO summit or other topics. How many questions will he take? That's not set in stone, and there's not a ton of precedent. Biden hasn't held very many news conferences that aren't tied to a foreign leader's visit or trips abroad. Typically, those are what's known in the business as a \"2+2,\"\u009d meaning two reporters from the U.S. and two foreign reporters ask questions. What's up next?

It tackled the most recent debate face-off between Biden and presumptive GOP nominee and former President Donald Trump, where the former's performance was widely panned as confused and mumbling.\n\n\"The June 27 face-off alarmed Democrats and his financial backers, in part, because Biden seemed so much worse than during the almost routine moments when he's less sharp. And that has raised questions about whether he's up for a campaign that's only going to get nastier and whether he can effectively govern for another four years if he wins,\" AP reported.\n\n\"We understand the concerns. We get it,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said this week. As some Democratic leaders called on him to drop out of the presidential race, Jean-Pierre insisted Biden had no intention of stepping away from the campaign. \"The president is clear-eyed and he is staying in the race.\" She also claimed that \"jet lag\" was the cause of his poor debate performance.\n\n(Related: Biden will not withdraw from presidential race despite calls for a replacement candidate from the Democratic Party.)\n\n\"He is often sharp and focused,\" the AP article indicated of Biden. \"But he also has moments, particularly later in the evening, when his thoughts seem jumbled and he trails off mid-sentence or seems confused. Sometimes he doesn't grasp the finer points of policy details. He occasionally forgets people's names, stares blankly and moves slowly around the room.\"\n\nOn X, the Libs of TikTok account commented: \"Nobody is falling for this BS anymore.\"\n\nAnother user posted: \"When news orgs try and push this 'sharp' nonsense, it no longer feels like just normal partisan bias, but insulting arrogance.\"\n\n\"AP in 2024: accurate and fair but sometimes partisan and shoddy,\" another commenter posted.\n\nPublic concern about Biden's fitness for another four years of presidency never subsided. According to an August 2023 poll from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, 77 percent of adults in the United States believe that Biden was too old to be effective for four more years. Not only did 89 percent of Republicans say that, but so did 69 percent of Democrats.\n\nWhite House press corps denies covering up Biden's mental state\n\nAfter Biden's lackluster performance during the CNN debate, concerns were raised about whether the White House press corps dropped the ball on fully covering the POTUS' limitations.\n\nThe debate laid bare many of the concerns on the president's mental state such as his having good days and bad days but sometimes seeming to slip up. A New York Times report raised similar concerns by those who have recently been in the room with Biden. The news outlet reported Biden has more frequent \"lapses,\" although at other times he appears sharp.\n\nNearly every media outlet has reported on growing concerns about Biden's age well before the debate. The White House has always complained that the coverage is disproportionate and that the media is spending more time covering Biden's age than his accomplishments as president.\n\nBut there are also claims that the media has not covered Biden's mental fitness more aggressively because it wants to prop up the campaign in some way, an accusation the White House reporters denied.\n\nSeveral White House reporters told CNN that the coverage of Biden's age and his mental stamina should have pushed harder. They cited several difficulties in doing so before the debate, from the obvious political motivations of sources who either wanted to protect Biden's image or project a certain image, to the blowback from pursuing such reports, especially from the White House and Democrats.\n\nThe administration has also insisted that concerns over Biden's age was just a \"right-wing talking point.\"\n\n\"The right-wing media was calling him senile from day one and that wasn't true,\" the reporter said. \"Then whenever you report on the age you were in some ways solidifying, giving credence to some people that were actually of bad faith.\"\n\nAll the White House reporters who were sources for this story spoke on the condition of staying anonymous so they could speak more freely about their relationship with the White House.\n\nVisit JoeBiden.news for stories related to the president's recent controversial blunders.\n\nWatch the video below where Biden admits to mistakes committed during the first

And yet, they did.\n\nThe White House, administration officials, the Democratic Party, and the president's family are complicit in hiding the truth about Biden's difficulties. It defies logic to think those closest to the president were somehow shocked by his performance in last month's debate.\n\nWhen Biden was taking on former President Donald Trump in the debate, it felt at times like the United States of America had a barely functioning head of state.\n\nWhat Biden's family and his administration have done in covering up the president's frailty was duplicity with potentially global ramifications. Yet no one is asking the right questions here. The media's obsession with whether President Biden is fit to run for reelection ignores the fact he is not fit to serve at all now.\n\nLast week's damage-control interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos did nothing to change that truth.\n\nOf course, Stephanopoulos kept the focus on whether Biden could defeat Donald Trump -- not on what he is going to do if China invades Taiwan or if there is a terrorist attack on American soil. What if that happens after President Biden's 8 p.m. bedtime and he's tired again?\n\nWhat was really learned from the Stephanopoulos interview other than Biden is obstinate and still infirm?\n\nAt least President Biden admitted during the interview that he \"wasn't in control.\" No, he's not. So who is? And why isn't the media more worried about who is currently running the country than whether the man supposed to be president can or cannot be elected in November?\n\nThe legacy media has too often appeared to be comrades in arms with the Democratic machine -- willing to obfuscate the truth by covering up for our aging president and keeping the ever-radicalizing Democrats in power.\n\nThis year's reluctance to cover Biden's health is just a repeat of the media's refusal to truthfully cover the story behind Hunter Biden's laptop in 2020. That year, when former New York Post deputy politics editor -- the heroic Emma-Jo Morris -- broke the \"laptop from hell\" story, Twitter punished her employer.\n\nThe pre-Elon Musk social media giant locked the Post out of its accounts for a week and barred users from sharing Morris' story. The New York Times, the Washington Post, CNN, fell all over themselves to claim the stories around Joe Biden's son's laptop were all just a plot by the Kremlin -- \"Russian disinformation\" to throw the election to Trump.\n\nThey all had to backpedal -- except Morris, of course. She said at the time, the media's willingness to lie about Hunter Biden was \"almost beyond parody,\" adding: \"The entire political establishment, intelligence community, media establishment, big tech, everyone just made up a story that I knew wasn't true.\"\n\nThe same could be said of the media and political establishment today. Spare a thought for WURD radio host Andrea Lawful-Sanders who lost her job for telling the truth -- that the Biden administration tells the media what questions to ask the president -- and Lawful-Sanders agreed to use them.\n\nAnd, no, despite White House protestations, it is not common for a presidential campaign to give questions to reporters. If Donald Trump's campaign did that, it would be considered an affront to the First Amendment -- and the media would just pile on that it was another Trumpian assault on democracy.\n\nAt least a few in the media are showing some shame. CNN ran a piece showing several White House reporters admitting they could have better covered Biden's mental fitness. But that's not possible; those White House reporters couldn't do a better job at something they failed to do at all.\n\nNow some unnamed White House reporters are telling CNN they struggled to cover questions about Biden's health because the White House and Democratic Party said any conjecture stemmed from Republican operatives trying to undermine the president. Sure. But these journalists could have challenged that and also reported what they were witnessing with their own eyes.\n\nPerhaps the media failed to do its job because they were too busy attacking members of the media who reported on Joe Biden's decline.\n\nPerhaps members of the media failed to do their job because they were too busy attacking their colleagues who reported on Joe Biden's decline.\n\nWhen the Wall Street Journal ran an in-depth piece on Joe Biden's mental acuity on June 4, they were attacked -- not just by the White House -- but by other media outlets.\n\nIt shouldn't have taken the Wall Street Journal -- or any other media outlet -- until June to get aggressive about Biden's ability to serve. In February, special counsel Robert Hur released a 338-page report saying our president was a \"well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\"\n\nHur advised the Department of Justice not to pursue criminal charges against Biden because \"it would be difficult to convince a jury that they should convict him -- by then a former president well into his eighties -- of a serious felony that requires a mental state of willfulness.\"\n\nAmerica deserves better. It would help if the media did its job and started asking these tough questions -- that's why the Lord Almighty gave us a free press after all.", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Philadelphia Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jennifer_stefano@inquirer.com", "name": "Jennifer Stefano", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephanopoulos", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Stephanopoulos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head of state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden_laptop_controversy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden laptop controversy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Intelligence_Community", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Intelligence Community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_machine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political machine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moscow Kremlin"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_K._Hur", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert K.

Washington Convention Center, a short distance from the White House, where many events of the ongoing NATO summit are being held.\n\nWhat channel is carrying it?\n\nThe White House streams much of its live content. Given the attention on this event, television networks also could break away from programming to carry Biden's remarks live once he starts speaking.\n\nThe Associated Press will offer a livestream at apnews.com.\n\nWho will be watching?\n\nProbably a lot of people.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nCNN reported that 51 million people watched the Atlanta debate, which was in primetime, while more than 8 million people tuned in to watch Biden's ABC interview live.\n\nIf networks break into their daily coverage or cable channels carry it live, that will guarantee a significant number of eyes on Biden.\n\nWill Biden know the questions ahead of time?\n\nAside from some apparent exceptions -- like incidents in which two Black radio hosts said Biden's campaign sent them planned questions ahead of time -- it's not standard practice for the president to know precisely what will come up during interviews or news conferences.\n\nHis aides prepare him for a host of possibilities based off the headlines of the day, so they're prepping him for the likelihood that journalists will want to ask about his fitness for office, the NATO summit or other topics.\n\nHow many questions will he take?\n\nThat's not set in stone, and there's not a ton of precedent.\n\nBiden hasn't held very many news conferences that aren't tied to a foreign leader's visit or trips abroad. Typically, those are what's known in the business as a \"2+2,\" meaning two reporters from the U.S. and two foreign reporters ask questions.\n\nWhat's up next?\n\nBiden returns to the campaign trail Friday with a trip to Michigan. He will also do an interview with NBC on Monday.\n\nMore coverage: National Biden's candidacy faces new peril, including first Senate Democrat saying he should exit race By LISA MASCARO - AP Congressional Correspondent Cnn Democrats go public with fears of GOP 'landslide' that could jeopardize US democracy Analysis by Zachary B.

And if they weren't duped, then how can they be trusted for anything?\n\nThat's the no-win situation these liars and propagandists have created for themselves, and it's one of the prevailing stories after Joe Biden's near-apocalyptic debate implosion 10 days ago.\n\nDemocrats are in full-blown panic, privately and publicly pushing the president to bow out of the race, grasping for any way to replace him on the ballot. Joe and Jill Biden are stubbornly insisting he ain't going anywhere. (And that the real problem, they insist, is that Donald Trump wouldn't leave the White House.) All the while, Leftmedia talkingheads and scribes are feigning shock and dismay that the real evidence of Biden's cognitive decline has been exposed so much that they can no longer hide it.\n\nA contender for funniest headline comes from CNN's Hadas Gold: \"Biden's mental fitness could have been better covered leading up to the debate, some White House reporters acknowledge.\"\n\nYa think?\n\nWhy didn't they? State media reporters are on Team Biden, and Gold admits as much:\n\nSeveral White House reporters told CNN that the coverage of Biden's age and his mental stamina should have pushed harder. They cited several difficulties in doing so before the debate -- from the obvious political motivations of sources who either want to protect Biden's image or project a certain image, to the blowback from pursuing such reports, especially from the White House and Democrats.\n\nThat's right -- reporters didn't want to make Democrats angry or lose any elections.\n\nAnother example: \"When did members of Biden's inner circle know about the president's steep decline?\" a clearly dismayed Nicole Russell asks for USA Today, as if this is some great secret hidden from diligently searching reporters. \"It's clear, based on his debate performance and other gaffes we've seen in public, that Biden's decline must have been obvious to those closest to him.\"\n\nNews flash: It was obvious to those of us who aren't close to him, too. Our Douglas Andrews wrote in November 2020, \"Joe Biden Is Unfit for the Presidency.\" Our Mark Alexander wrote in March 2021, \"Clearing the Path for Harris to Bump Biden.\" Just days before the debate, I reported on the media's dismissal of videos of Biden's decline as \"cheap fakes.\" Those are just three of dozens of examples from our pages, never mind the massive pile from other conservative media.\n\nYet Gold says the reports from \"right-wing media\" were precisely why the Leftmedia didn't report it, lest they be found \"giving credence to some people that were actually of bad faith.\" Gold and her ilk are the ones acting in bad faith.\n\nAnother fantastic example of the panic amidst the president's Leftmedia supporters is Olivia Nuzzi's scoop for New York Magazine. \"The Conspiracy of Silence to Protect Joe Biden,\" reads the headline followed by the hilariously obtuse subtext, \"The president's mental decline was like a dark family secret for many elite supporters.\"\n\nAs Joe would say, Give me a break! That's a bunch of malarkey!\n\nHer entire piece is about the hush-hush nature of Biden's decline, which she admits she saw -- and reported, she'll have you know! -- in 2020. Yet she was horrified by experiences with the president in recent days and felt she finally had to really say how bad it is. She and others didn't more vigorously sound the alarm for many reasons, but one is the great lie that Biden is a decent man. \"I always thought -- and I wrote -- that he was a decent man,\" Nuzzi gushed. \"If ambition was his only sin, and it seemed to be, he had committed no sin at all by the standards of most politicians I had covered.\"\n\nMore malarkey.\n\nNuzzi's article was published on July 4, ahead of Biden's not-so-reassuring interview with Curious George Stephanopoulos. In his analysis of that interview, our Douglas Andrews lays bare the real story here: \"They didn't cover the story back then because they were thoroughly invested in defeating Donald Trump, and they knew that any talk of Biden's cognitive state would hurt their team. And now they're covering the story because reality has interceded to tell them that, try as they might, they won't be able to once again drag their guy's carcass across the finish line against Trump.\"\n\nMeanwhile, we learned over the weekend -- from The New York Times, no less -- that Team Biden provided approved questions to two radio interviewers of the president. Both radio hosts are black, and one of them lost her job (or resigned) after the report. What was the White House message? If you don't ask these questions, you ain't black?\n\nThe president still has loyal followers in the press, of course. For example, the \"fact-checkers\" at USA Today and Snopes are each out with stories defending his saying \"end of quote\" while reading from a teleprompter. He meant to do it, they'll have you know.\n\nThat's funny until you make a social media post mocking Biden for saying it, and then your post or your account is suppressed.\n\nThen there's this new gem unearthed by -- who else? -- the same New York Post that exposed Hunter Biden's laptop and Joe's corruption. Biden's physician met with a Parkinson's disease specialist in the White House in January. Why? The White House naturally doesn't want that news out there and \"refused to answer questions\" from the Post. Leftmedia reporters aren't even half-heartedly trying to find out.\n\nThey say if I vote for Donald Trump, he'll never leave the White House. They say if I don't vote for Joe Biden, \"democracy\" will perish. Well, Trump already left once, albeit rather reluctantly.

Many worry that he is headed for a loss in November.\n\nBut Biden's people are reportedly tired of the constant coverage on the issue, telling CNN they just want to get on with their lives.\n\nThe outlet reported on Wednesday, \"Aides to the president told CNN that not only are they no longer interested in discussing Biden's on-stage fiasco last month, and there are simply no outstanding questions about the president's political future to debate. Biden is staying in the race, they say, and there is nothing that could change that.\"\n\nAn unnamed senior administration official told the outlet, \"I'm moving on to my day job.\"\n\nDespite it being nearly two weeks after the debate, questions about Biden's performance and competence still inundate White House press briefings and are the subject of Biden's media appearances.\n\nThe outlet noted that even \"Diplomats in Washington for the NATO summit this week are nervous about whether Biden will be able to defeat Trump a second time,\" and predicted that Biden's upcoming Thursday press conference at the event will see him face numerous questions about the debate and his fitness for office.\n\nTRUMP EYES EXPANDING THE MAP AMID BIDEN POST-DEBATE DEMOCRATIC TURMOIL\n\nStill, his team has insisted that Biden is not backing down from beating Trump in November. When asked what the chances are that the president could withdraw from the race, a \"longtime\" Biden adviser replied, \"Zero. He truly believes he is the only person who can defeat Donald Trump. It's not an act.\"\n\nThe adviser also mentioned that even if Biden's support in Washington, D.C. fails, only his close family can persuade him to step down. \"Jill and Valerie won't let him go down in flames,\" the anonymous official said, referring to the first lady and the president's sister.\n\nBiden has dismissed talk about him stepping down on multiple occasions since the debate, telling a crowd at the White House July 4th celebrations, \"I'm not going anywhere.\" He also sent a letter to Democratic lawmakers this week urging them to come together amid the debate fallout and support his re-election bid.\n\nHis letter stated, \"The question of how to move forward has been well-aired for over a week now. And it's time for it to end. We have one job. And that is to beat Donald Trump.\"\n\nHe added, \"We have 42 days to the Democratic Convention and 119 days to the general election.

Washington Convention Center, a short distance from the White House, where many events of the ongoing NATO summit are being held.\n\nWhat channel is carrying it?\n\nThe White House streams much of its live content. Given the attention on this event, television networks also could break away from programming to carry Biden's remarks live once he starts speaking.\n\nThe Associated Press will offer a livestream at apnews.com.\n\nWho will be watching?\n\nProbably a lot of people.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nCNN reported that 51 million people watched the Atlanta debate, which was in primetime, while more than 8 million people tuned in to watch Biden's ABC interview live.\n\nIf networks break into their daily coverage or cable channels carry it live, that will guarantee a significant number of eyes on Biden.\n\nWill Biden know the questions ahead of time?\n\nAside from some apparent exceptions -- like incidents in which two Black radio hosts said Biden's campaign sent them planned questions ahead of time -- it's not standard practice for the president to know precisely what will come up during interviews or news conferences.\n\nHis aides prepare him for a host of possibilities based off the headlines of the day, so they're prepping him for the likelihood that journalists will want to ask about his fitness for office, the NATO summit or other topics.\n\nHow many questions will he take?\n\nThat's not set in stone, and there's not a ton of precedent.\n\nBiden hasn't held very many news conferences that aren't tied to a foreign leader's visit or trips abroad. Typically, those are what's known in the business as a \"2+2,\" meaning two reporters from the U.S. and two foreign reporters ask questions.\n\nWhat's up next?\n\nBiden returns to the campaign trail Friday with a trip to Michigan. He will also do an interview with NBC on Monday.\n\nMore coverage: Politics Biden's candidacy faces new peril, including first Senate Democrat saying he should exit race By LISA MASCARO - AP Congressional Correspondent Politics Democrats go public with fears of GOP 'landslide' that could jeopardize US democracy Analysis by Zachary B.

He has held press conferences with leaders from Ukraine, Kenya and Japan in 2024.\n\nBiden, 81, will take an unspecified number of questions from reporters, in an event expected to last about as long as November's, which ran 21 minutes.\n\nAhead of that event scheduled for 5:30 p.m. (2130 GMT), the White House was busily helping prepare the president for it by trying to game out the questions reporters would ask, a knowledgeable source said.\n\nIn the two weeks since the June 27 debate, Biden had another disappointing performance in an ABC News interview, reinforcing some Democrats' concerns over his ability to beat Republican rival Donald Trump in the Nov. 5 election or serve another four years.\n\nBut Biden has also participated in a wide array of public events without a slip-up, including campaign stops in North Carolina, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Virginia.\n\nA well-orchestrated, forceful NATO summit speech on Tuesday closed with Biden carefully placing the Presidential Medal of Freedom around Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg's neck, to the relief of fellow Democrats and White House staff.\n\nEvery Biden appearance will be scrutinized, in perpetuity, analysts said.\n\nLarry Sabato, head of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics, said Biden is in \"highly unusual\" territory for an American president.\n\n\"If it's a little mistake, slurring a word or something, I think people would just let it pass. But if there is anything approaching what we saw at the debate, the Democratic Party would be thrown into turmoil,\" Sabato said.\n\nEven if Biden never repeats his debate behavior, he faces a risk that momentum to push him aside could still grow.\n\nMore interviews, press conference\n\nSome Democrats have suggested that putting Biden into the public eye more often would help ease concerns.\n\nOver the course of his three-and-a-half years in office, Biden has held fewer press conferences and interviews combined than presidents dating to Ronald Reagan in the 1980s at the same point in their presidency, data by presidential scholar Martha Joynt Kumar showed.\n\nHe has held an average of 10.5 press conferences per year, compared to 22 per year for Trump and 35.5 for George H.W. Bush, according to an analysis by the University of California at Santa Barbara. Reagan had fewer with 5.8 per year.\n\nBiden answered more questions than either Bill Clinton or Barack Obama, but fewer than either George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, and far fewer than Trump.\n\nAfter Thursday's news conference, Biden's next big interview will be with NBC anchor Lester Holt on Monday.\n\n\"There will be a lot of eyes on every move Biden makes,\" said a Democratic strategist with close ties to the White House. \"There'll be closer scrutiny - everything he says and does.\"\n\nBiden's top aides are thinking about performance hurdles and his day-to-day appearances in three phases: Get through a big speech on civil rights in Austin, Texas on Monday, then the Democratic convention in Chicago where Biden is to be formally nominated in mid-August and from there the final push to Election Day on Nov. 5, a source with direct knowledge said.\n\nHis Texas speech at the presidential library of 1960s President Lyndon Johnson may draw parallels with Johnson, who withdrew from the Democratic race in 1968 over his handling of the Vietnam War.\n\nBiden, a career politician, had a history of saying the wrong thing as a much younger man.\n\nAs president, he has taken fire for saying the United States would defend Taiwan militarily if the Asian country was invaded by China, a policy that had been ambiguous, and for calling Chinese leader Xi Jinping a \"dictator.\"\n\nRecently, the White House and Biden have limited informal interactions with reporters that yield impromptu answers to shouted questions as he's traveling or leaving an event. In 2021, Biden had 158 \"exchanges with reporters,\" the UC Santa Barbara project found. He has had just 38 this year through June 9.\n\nThere's a still long way to go for the incumbent president before the election.

A strong performance Thursday could convince members of his party that he still has the ability to win in November and serve a second term.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Washington Convention Center, a short distance from the White House, where many events of the ongoing NATO summit are being held.\n\nWhat channel is carrying it?\n\nThe White House streams much of its live content. Given the attention on this event, television networks also could break away from programming to carry Biden's remarks live once he starts speaking.\n\nThe Associated Press will offer a livestream at apnews.com.\n\nWho will be watching?\n\nProbably a lot of people.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nCNN reported that 51 million people watched the Atlanta debate, which was in primetime, while more than 8 million people tuned in to watch Biden's ABC interview live.\n\nIf networks break into their daily coverage or cable channels carry it live, that will guarantee a significant number of eyes on Biden.\n\nWill Biden know the questions ahead of time?\n\nAside from some apparent exceptions -- like incidents in which two Black radio hosts said Biden's campaign sent them planned questions ahead of time -- it's not standard practice for the president to know precisely what will come up during interviews or news conferences.\n\nHis aides prepare him for a host of possibilities based off the headlines of the day, so they're prepping him for the likelihood that journalists will want to ask about his fitness for office, the NATO summit or other topics.\n\nHow many questions will he take?\n\nThat's not set in stone, and there's not a ton of precedent.\n\nBiden hasn't held very many news conferences that aren't tied to a foreign leader's visit or trips abroad. Typically, those are what's known in the business as a \"2+2,\" meaning two reporters from the U.S. and two foreign reporters ask questions.\n\nWhat's up next?\n\nBiden returns to the campaign trail Friday with a trip to Michigan. He will also do an interview with NBC on Monday.\n\nMore coverage: Government-politics Biden's candidacy faces new peril, including first Senate Democrat saying he should exit race By LISA MASCARO - AP Congressional Correspondent Government-politics Democrats go public with fears of GOP 'landslide' that could jeopardize US democracy Analysis by Zachary B.

But when Biden did his first television interview on ABC about his debate performance, his answers did little to calm concerns about his mental acuity and verbal skills.\n\nCompanies that wait that long to respond to a crisis run the risk of making the crisis worse and allowing unanswered charges and allegations to become conventional wisdom.\n\nAccurate and consistent information about all aspects of a crisis can help buttress an organization's credibility about what it is saying and doing about a crisis.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Biden had not been seen by his doctor since his physical, but the president later told campaign workers on a private call that he had been seen by his doctor after he felt sick returning from grueling back-to-back foreign trips,\" the Associated Press reported.\n\nBiden's claims that he had a bad night at the debate was called into question a few days later when he made new gaffes during a radio interview.\n\n\"President Biden sought to steady his re-election campaign by talking with two Black radio hosts for interviews [that were] broadcast on Thursday, but he spoke haltingly at points during one interview and struggled to find the right phrase in the other, saying that he was proud to have been 'the first Black woman to serve with a Black president,\" according to the New York Times.\n\n\"He also stumbled over his words during a four-minute Fourth of July speech to military families at the White House, beginning a story about former President Donald J. Trump, calling him \"one of our colleagues, the former president' and then adding, 'probably shouldn't say, at any rate\" before abruptly ending the story and moving on,\" the newspaper wrote.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bennet", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Bennet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Joe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Morning Joe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karine_Jean-Pierre", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karine Jean-Pierre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Press_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House Press Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/668eb229cb096be4c3f84d98/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722299", "eventUri": "eng-9722299", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

He has held media conferences with leaders from Ukraine, Kenya and Japan in 2024.\n\nEighty-one year old Biden will take an unspecified number of questions from reporters, in an event expected to last about as long as November's, which ran for 21 minutes.\n\nAhead of that event scheduled for 9.30pm GMT, the White House was busily helping prepare the president for it by trying to game out the questions reporters would ask, a knowledgeable source said.\n\nIn the two weeks since the June 27 debate, Biden had another disappointing performance in an ABC News interview, reinforcing some Democrats' concerns about his ability to beat Republican rival Donald Trump in the November\n\n5 election or serve another four years.\n\nBut Biden has also participated in a wide array of public events without a slip-up, including campaign stops in North Carolina, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Virginia.\n\nA well-orchestrated, forceful Nato summit speech on Tuesday closed with Biden carefully placing the Presidential Medal of Freedom around Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg's neck, to the relief of fellow Democrats and White House staff.\n\nEvery Biden appearance will be scrutinised, in perpetuity, analysts said.\n\nLarry Sabato, head of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics, said Biden is in \"highly unusual\" territory for a US president.\n\n\"If it's a little mistake, slurring a word or something, I think people would just let it pass. But if there is anything approaching what we saw at the debate, the Democratic Party would be thrown into turmoil,\" Sabato said.\n\nEven if Biden never repeats his debate behaviour, he faces a risk that momentum to push him aside could still grow.\n\nMore interviews and media conferences\n\nSome Democrats have suggested that putting Biden into the public eye more often would help ease concerns.\n\nOver the course of his three-and-a-half years in office, Biden has held fewer media conferences and interviews combined than presidents dating to Ronald Reagan in the 1980s at the same point in their presidency, data by presidential scholar Martha Joynt Kumar showed.\n\nHe has held an average of 10.5 media conferences per year, compared to 22 per year for Trump and 35.5 for George HW Bush, according to an analysis by the University of California at Santa Barbara. Reagan had fewer with 5.8 per year.\n\nBiden answered more questions than either Bill Clinton or Barack Obama, but fewer than both George HW Bush and George W Bush, and far fewer than Trump.\n\nAfter Thursday's news conference, Biden's next big interview will be with NBC anchor Lester Holt on Monday.\n\n\"There will be a lot of eyes on every move Biden makes,\" said a Democratic strategist with close ties to the White House. \"There'll be closer scrutiny - everything he says and does.\"\n\nBiden's top aides are thinking about performance hurdles and his day-to-day appearances in three phases: get through a big speech on civil rights in Austin, Texas on Monday; then the Democratic convention in Chicago where Biden is to be formally nominated in mid-August; and from there the final push to Election Day on November 5, a source with direct knowledge said.\n\nHis Texas speech at the presidential library of 1960s President Lyndon Johnson may draw parallels with Johnson, who withdrew from the Democratic race in 1968 over his handling of the Vietnam War.\n\nBiden, a career politician, had a history of saying the wrong thing as a much younger man.\n\nAs president, he has taken fire for saying the US would defend Taiwan militarily if the Asian country was invaded by China, a policy that had been ambiguous, and for calling Chinese leader Xi Jinping a \"dictator\".\n\nRecently, the White House and Biden have limited informal interactions with reporters that yield impromptu answers to shouted questions as he is travelling or leaving an event. In 2021, Biden had 158 \"exchanges with reporters\", the UC Santa Barbara project found. He has had just 38 in 2024 to June 9.\n\nThere's a still long way to go for the incumbent president before the election.

Instead, it has been overshadowed by doubts that he is up for a bruising campaign and another four years in office -- doubts expressed by elected Democrats, donors and voters.\n\nThe questions have been swirling since Biden badly fumbled his June 27 debate against former President Donald Trump. Biden struggled to answer questions in that debate, and has since blamed it on a cold, latent jet-lag, overpreparation and interruptions from Trump. He said it was just one bad night, but many in his party aren't convinced.\n\nWatch Biden's press conference, slated for 5:30 p.m. Thursday, here:\n\nSince then, Biden and his team have worked to prove he does have the stamina and mental acuity to run this race, adding campaign stops in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and later this week in Michigan.

His last one was in November 2023, in California, after he met there with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nMartha Joynt Kumar, political science professor emeritus from Towson University, has studied the interactions between the press corps and presidents for many years. She calls solo press conferences -- especially ones that occur in the White House -- the \"'crown jewel' of presidential interchanges\" because they typically involve aggressive questions and test a president's command of policy and politics.\n\nBy her detailed accounting, which goes back to the Reagan White House, Biden has done fewer press conferences at this point in the presidency than other presidents.\n\n\"I think it's something that has not benefited [Biden],\" Kumar said, noting that more press conferences would have allowed the public to take \"the measure of the president\" long

Bush, according to an analysis by the University of California at Santa Barbara. Reagan had fewer with 5.8 per year.\n\nBiden answered more questions than either Bill Clinton or Barack Obama, but fewer than either George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, and far fewer than Trump.\n\nAfter Thursday's news conference, Biden's next big interview will be with NBC anchor Lester Holt on Monday.\n\n\"There will be a lot of eyes on every move Biden makes,\" said a Democratic strategist with close ties to the White House. \"There'll be closer scrutiny - everything he says and does.\"\n\nBiden's top aides are thinking about performance hurdles and his day-to-day appearances in three phases: Get through a big speech on civil rights in Austin, Texas on Monday, then the Democratic convention in Chicago where Biden is to be formally nominated in mid-August and from there the final push to Election Day on Nov. 5, a source with direct knowledge said.\n\nHis Texas speech at the presidential library of 1960s President Lyndon Johnson may draw parallels with Johnson, who withdrew from the Democratic race in 1968 over his handling of the Vietnam War.\n\nBiden, a career politician, had a history of saying the wrong thing as a much younger man.\n\nAs president, he has taken fire for saying the United States would defend Taiwan militarily if the Asian country was invaded by China, a policy that had been ambiguous, and for calling Chinese leader Xi Jinping a \"dictator.\"\n\nRecently, the White House and Biden have limited informal interactions with reporters that yield impromptu answers to shouted questions as he's traveling or leaving an event. In 2021, Biden had 158 \"exchanges with reporters,\" the UC Santa Barbara project found. He has had just 38 this year through June 9.\n\nThere's a still long way to go for the incumbent president before the election.

He has held press conferences with leaders from Ukraine, Kenya and Japan in 2024.\n\nBiden, 81, will take an unspecified number of questions from reporters, in an event expected to last about as long as November's, which ran 21 minutes.\n\nAhead of that event scheduled for 5:30 p.m. (2130 GMT), the White House was busily helping prepare the president for it by trying to game out the questions reporters would ask, a knowledgeable source said.\n\nIn the two weeks since the June 27 debate, Biden had another disappointing performance in an ABC News interview, reinforcing some Democrats' concerns over his ability to beat Republican rival Donald Trump in the Nov. 5 election or serve another four years.\n\nBut Biden has also participated in a wide array of public events without a slip-up, including campaign stops in North Carolina, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Virginia.\n\nA well-orchestrated, forceful NATO summit speech on Tuesday closed with Biden carefully placing the Presidential Medal of Freedom around Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg's neck, to the relief of fellow Democrats and White House staff.\n\nEvery Biden appearance will be scrutinized, in perpetuity, analysts said.\n\nLarry Sabato, head of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics, said Biden is in \"highly unusual\" territory for an American president.\n\n\"If it's a little mistake, slurring a word or something, I think people would just let it pass. But if there is anything approaching what we saw at the debate, the Democratic Party would be thrown into turmoil,\" Sabato said.\n\nEven if Biden never repeats his debate behavior, he faces a risk that momentum to push him aside could still grow.\n\nMORE INTERVIEWS, PRESS CONFERENCES\n\nSome Democrats have suggested that putting Biden into the public eye more often would help ease concerns.\n\nOver the course of his three-and-a-half years in office, Biden has held fewer press conferences and interviews combined than presidents dating to Ronald Reagan in the 1980s at the same point in their presidency, data by presidential scholar Martha Joynt Kumar showed.\n\nHe has held an average of 10.5 press conferences per year, compared to 22 per year for Trump and 35.5 for George H.W. Bush, according to an analysisNew Tab, opens new tab by the University of California at Santa Barbara. Reagan had fewer with 5.8 per year.\n\nBiden answered more questions than either Bill Clinton or Barack Obama, but fewer than either George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, and far fewer than Trump.\n\nAfter Thursday's news conference, Biden's next big interview will be with NBC anchor Lester Holt on Monday.\n\n\"There will be a lot of eyes on every move Biden makes,\" said a Democratic strategist with close ties to the White House. \"There'll be closer scrutiny - everything he says and does.\"\n\nBiden's top aides are thinking about performance hurdles and his day-to-day appearances in three phases: Get through a big speech on civil rights in Austin, Texas on Monday, then the Democratic convention in Chicago where Biden is to be formally nominated in mid-August and from there the final push to Election Day on Nov. 5, a source with direct knowledge said.\n\nHis Texas speech at the presidential library of 1960s President Lyndon Johnson may draw parallels with Johnson, who withdrew from the Democratic race in 1968 over his handling of the Vietnam War.\n\nBiden, a career politician, had a history of saying the wrong thing as a much younger man.\n\nAs president, he has taken fire for saying the United States would defend Taiwan militarily if the Asian country was invaded by China, a policy that had been ambiguous, and for calling Chinese leader Xi Jinping a \"dictator.\"\n\nRecently, the White House and Biden have limited informal interactions with reporters that yield impromptu answers to shouted questions as he's traveling or leaving an event. In 2021, Biden had 158 \"exchanges with reporters,\" the UC Santa Barbara project foundNew Tab, opens new tab. He has had just 38 this year through June 9.\n\nThere's a still long way to go for the incumbent president before the election. Looming ahead: Another debate against Trump scheduled for Sept. 10.\n\nReporting by Steve Holland and Nandita Bose; Additional reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt and Jeff Mason; Editing by Heather Timmons and Cynthia Osterman", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steve_holland@reuters.com", "name": "Steve Holland", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "nandita_bose@reuters.com", "name": "Nandita Bose", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Sabato", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Larry Sabato"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_Medal_of_Freedom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidential Medal of Freedom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jens_Stoltenberg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jens Stoltenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Office_of_the_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Executive Office of the President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Virginia_Center_for_Politics", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Virginia Center for Politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H._W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George H.

The Biden news conference is just the type of event that many political watchers have said he needs to pull off successfully to turn back demands -- including from fellow Democrats -- that he withdraw.\n\nFOX28 Spokane\u00a9", "source": {"uri": "fox28spokane.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 28 Spokane"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@fox28spokane.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "meg_kinnard@fox28spokane.com", "name": "Meg Kinnard", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spokane,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spokane, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Spokane, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.fox28spokane.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Featured-Image-Fallback-National-News-28.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722299", "eventUri": "eng-9722299", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

Biden has tried to soothe his detractors and whip them into line. He's sent strongly worded letters and appealed to TV hosts. He's talked with radio hosts and rubbed shoulders with voters -- who he insists are the voice of the party and who are telling him they don't want him to go anywhere.\n\nThe problem, as White House Reporter Naomi Lim writes this morning, is that no matter how successful the president's \"big boy\" press conference this evening at the close of the NATO summit in Washington, D.C., the effects will be fleeting. Or they could be damning if it comes anywhere near as bad as his abysmal debate performance with former President Donald Trump last month that set off the Democratic firestorm calling for his head.\n\n\"Even if Biden performs well during Thursday evening's press conference at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center, it is 'unlikely' to counter completely 'the underlying issue of 'is he too old?'\" per another Democratic strategist, Stefan Hankin,\" Naomi writes this morning.\n\n\"If he does poorly, then it is likely the end of his campaign,\" Hankin told the Washington Examiner. \"It is hard to imagine that there will be one event that will erase all of the issues that the debate created, but Biden needs to start gaining the trust back and quickly.\"\n\nBiden finds himself in a near impossible position of having to prove a negative -- convincing the most powerful people in the most powerful city in the world that he isn't going to succumb to the forces of age that prevail against everyone eventually. The 81-year-old president has one avenue available to him. But if he trips and falls, literally or figuratively, when he's walking down it then it will be difficult to get back up.\n\nThe president has made few media appearances compared to his predecessors. Thursday evening's press conference, which White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said is going to be more than a \"two-plus-two\" will be a rare moment.\n\nIn what appeared to be unscripted moments with radio hosts last weekend, Biden had awkward moments -- referring to himself as the first black female vice president. The gaffe appeared worse when the hosts admitted they had used questions fed to them by Biden's campaign team. If the president was fumbling appearances when he, ostensibly, knew which questions were coming, how will he perform in his first head-to-head moment with reporters who are frustrated at feeling like they've been boxed out by his handlers?\n\nA forceful showing this evening could tamp down criticism for the time being. But, like Middlebury College politics professor Bert Johnson told Naomi, there are few things Biden is going to be able to do to convince the growing list of doubters that he is primed for another four years in the White House.\n\n\"Short of beating Gary Kasparov at chess or Caitlin Clark at basketball,\" Johnson said, \"there's not a whole lot he can do to dispel the questions people have about his mental and physical fitness.\"\n\nClick here to read more about what's at stake for Biden this evening.\n\nWhen it comes to public appearances, Biden is often on his own. He can't pass questions to others when he's trying to convince the world he's fit for another term. He has to be the one to show up at events and make the case for his future.\n\nBut he's not alone. And the famously familial Biden is relying heavily on the first lady to help him make his case -- and help him decide what he should do next, White House Reporter Christian Datoc writes.\n\n\"Jill Biden is helping the president shoulder the burden of reviving his floundering presidential campaign following a disastrous debate performance that has sparked calls for him to drop out,\" he writes. \"This week alone, the first lady has traveled to three states, launched a new military outreach program, and phoned into a press call to defend the president's viability against former President Donald Trump.\"\n\nThe first lady has been a fiery campaigner for her husband in the last week, swinging through several battleground states on a frenzied tour to launch the Veterans and Military Families for Biden-Harris outreach program.\n\n\"For all the talk out there about this race, Joe has made it clear that he's all in. That's the decision he's made. And just as he has always supported my career, I am all in too. I know you are too or you wouldn't be here today,\" the first lady said onstage in Wilmington, North Carolina. \"I want you to remember what it felt like on the morning after the 2016 election when we fell short. Remember that feeling, how you woke up and you said to yourself, 'Oh my God, what just happened?' We can't let that happen again. I don't want to wake up with that feeling.\"\n\nJill Biden's time on the trail hasn't been all positive. She has frustrated reporters by dodging questions or simply not sticking around for the Q & A portions to even hear them.\n\nBut, Christian writes, her steady hand on the tiller has provided the Biden camp a useful opportunity to paint the Bidens in contrast to the Trumps.\n\n\"Asked for comment on this story, the Biden campaign simply referenced the first lady's remarks from earlier this week, while Democratic operatives inside Joe Biden's orbit previously told the Washington Examiner that Jill Biden's presence and counsel on the campaign trail are an asset to the president, especially when compared with former first lady Melania Trump's relative absence from Donald Trump's 2024 campaign stops.\"\n\n\"Where's Melania? Not out supporting her husband, who she clearly hates,\" a veteran Democratic strategist said. \"Jill Biden's presence is an asset to the campaign but also a rock on which President Biden can rely for both personal and political advice. She's the exact type of partner this nation needs in the White House.\"\n\nTrump appears to be taking the infamous Frenchman's advice to heart, White House Reporter Haisten Willis writes this morning.\n\n\"Trump has largely avoided the spotlight since the now-infamous June 27 presidential debate, letting his opponent soak up most of the media attention and criticism in Washington,\" Haisten writes. \"The question now is how long he can, and should, try to keep it up.\"\n\nThe bombastic former president started showing how disciplined he could be during the debate with Biden. He was partially constrained by the rules of the contest -- his microphone was muted while Biden was speaking -- but he generally refrained from trying to interject when his opponent was stumbling through his talking points.\n\nWhen Trump did have a moment to twist the knife, he took advantage, but then stepped back to let Biden deal with the wound on his own rather than presenting an opportunity to counterpunch.\n\nBiden's team has been frustrated with the increased focus on the president rather than his opponent, who, they are trying to remind everyone, has plenty of baggage himself.\n\n\"Donald Trump hasn't been seen in public for 12 days, now he's inviting fictional serial killers to dinner, teasing lil' Marco Rubio, praising Project 2025 architect Tom Homan, and challenging the President of the United States to golf,\" Biden campaign spokesman James Singer said.\n\n\"We'd challenge Donald Trump to create jobs, but he lost 3 million,\" Singer continued. \"We'd challenge Donald Trump to stand up to Putin, but he bent the knee to him. We'd challenge Donald Trump to follow the law, but he breaks it. We'd challenge Donald Trump to not destroy our country, but that's all his Project 2025 aims to do.\"\n\nBut as on message as Trump has been, Haisten points out, the tide is going to turn eventually.\n\nTrump hosted a rally on Tuesday in Florida and called into Fox News's Hannity to take jabs at Biden.\n\nHe'll have another rally this weekend in Pennsylvania and next week all eyes will be on him and his party when the Republican National Convention rolls into town in Milwaukee.\n\nDepending on how events unfold this weekend, the spotlight illuminating Trump might not be a problem and could provide a stage for him to hammer home what is looking like a historic run to retake the presidency after losing it four years ago.\n\nDemocrats escalate against Biden but hand GOP ammunition\n\nWhite House doubles down on electric vehicles as Trump derides them\n\nGOP looks to quash Democrats' advantage on abortion in new party platform\n\nBiden defections have jumped across the Capitol into the Senate\n\nDemocrats are adopting a positively Trumpian mode of communication\n\nBiden will participate in a working session at the NATO Summit - 10 a.m.\n\nBiden holds a bilateral meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky -- 1:30 p.m.\n\nBiden will participate in a working session at the NATO Summit - 2 p.m.\n\nBiden holds a press conference -- 5:30 p.m.\n\nHarris will attend a campaign event in North Carolina -- 2:30 p.m.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "max_thornberry@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Max Thornberry", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jill Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karine_Jean-Pierre", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karine Jean-Pierre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Examiner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Examiner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_E._Washington_Convention_Center", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Walter E.

Andrew Harnik/Getty Images hide caption\n\nPresident Biden faces yet another high-profile public test of whether he's sharp enough to campaign for a second term when he takes questions from reporters on Thursday.\n\nIt comes as Biden wraps up a summit of NATO leaders in Washington, an event his campaign had hoped would showcase his leadership on the world stage. Instead, it has been overshadowed by doubts that he is up for a bruising campaign and another four years in office -- doubts expressed by elected Democrats, donors and voters.\n\nThe questions have been swirling since Biden badly fumbled his June 27 debate against former President Donald Trump. Biden struggled to answer questions in that debate, and has since blamed it on a cold, latent jet-lag, overpreparation and interruptions from Trump. He said it was just one bad night, but many in his party aren't convinced.\n\nWatch Biden's press conference, slated for 5:30 p.m. Thursday, here:\n\nSince then, Biden and his team have worked to prove he does have the stamina and mental acuity to run this race, adding campaign stops in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and later this week in Michigan. He did a television interview that aired in full on ABC News and has another one scheduled on Monday with NBC, and he called in to MSNBC's Morning Joe this week, too.\n\nBiden has turned defiant, telling his party that he's staying in the race and it was time to stop talking about whether he should quit. He has received wholehearted support from some important figures in the party -- but others have since come out and said they think he will lose to Trump.\n\nMost recently, actor George Clooney, who just hosted a blockbuster fundraiser for Biden in Los Angeles, wrote an op-ed in the New York Times saying Democrats need to pick a different candidate.\n\nBiden rarely does formal solo press conferences. His last one was in November 2023, in California, after he met there with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nMartha Joynt Kumar, political science professor emeritus from Towson University, has studied the interactions between the press corps and presidents for many years. She calls solo press conferences -- especially ones that occur in the White House -- the \"'crown jewel' of presidential interchanges\" because they typically involve aggressive questions and test a president's command of policy and politics.\n\nBy her detailed accounting, which goes back to the Reagan White House, Biden has done fewer press conferences at this point in the presidency than other presidents.\n\n\"I think it's something that has not benefited [Biden],\" Kumar said, noting that more press conferences would have allowed the public to take \"the measure of the president\" long before the June debate.", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NPR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tamara_keith@npr.org", "name": "Tamara Keith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false},

Shear and Katie Rogers cover the White House and reported from Washington. Michael M. Grynbaum covers the news media and reported from New York.\n\nPresident Biden will face a moment of high stakes in his campaign for a second term on Thursday evening when he engages with reporters in an unscripted news conference at the end of a three-day NATO summit.\n\nThe president's allies, doubters and enemies will be watching as he fields questions, looking for any evidence that he loses his train of thought, stumbles over his words or lapses into the blank stare that millions of people saw during a debate with former President Donald J. Trump on June 27. Mr. Biden's performance could either quiet critics or invite a wave of new calls for him to step aside.\n\nHow long Mr. Biden remains at the lectern -- and how many questions he is willing to field from the press -- is another key benchmark of how his performance will be judged. A hasty exit, with journalists calling out after him, could fuel more concerns about Mr. Biden's stamina and capacity to handle tough questioning.\n\nJust the fact that Mr. Biden agreed to hold the event speaks to the pressure he is facing to prove his contention that the shaky debate was an anomaly. At this point in his term, Mr. Biden has held fewer news conferences than any president since Ronald Reagan. His last solo news conference was eight months ago.\n\nIn recent days, he has tried to assure shaken allies that he wants to do more unscripted appearances and interviews, but, beyond an interview with ABC on Friday, he has done little of those in the 14 crucial days since the debate.\n\nThe White House is not sharing much about how the president is preparing himself for Thursday's news conference, which will follow a long day of meetings be carried live on all the major networks.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_summit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NATO summit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Reagan"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/07/11/multimedia/11dc-biden-jmlb/11dc-biden-jmlb-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722299", "eventUri": "eng-9722299", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 652, "textEnd": 659}], "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

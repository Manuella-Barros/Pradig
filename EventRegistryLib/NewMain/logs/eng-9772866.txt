He spoke only to confirm his name, address and date of birth.\n\nWhen asked if he wished to indicate a plea to the three charges, which relate to three different categories of indecent images, Edwards replied: \"Guilty\".\n\nWhat did Huw Edwards do?\n\nProsecutor Ian Hope said the 41 still or moving images were sent to Edwards on WhatsApp by an adult male between December 2020 and August 2021.\n\nThe prosecutor further said that seven of the 41 images were of the most serious kind and that two of that seven were pornographic videos of a child possibly aged seven and nine years old.\n\nCharges against Huw Edwards?\n\nEdwards is accused of having six category A images, the most serious classification in English law of indecent images, on a phone.\n\nHe was also accused of having 12 category B pictures and 19 category C photographs. He could be jailed for up to 10 years.\n\nEdwards, who was BBC's most high-profile and best-paid news anchor, left the BBC in April. He was one of the main presenters on BBC One's Ten O'Clock News, and was often chosen to front coverage of major national events.\n\nPolice charged Edwards last month. He was arrested in November last year, a statement by London's Metropolitan Police said.\n\n\"Edwards was arrested on November 8 2023.

I had no idea until he was charged', the friend from the BBC said.\n\nAnother former colleague of the star said: 'It's a mess - and tragic for all concerned'.\n\nFormer BBC host Huw Edwards has been charged with making indecent images of children. Friends said they had no idea he had even been arrested\n\nHuw Edwards and his wife Vicky, pictured in South London in 2018. They have five children\n\nThe BBC was also blindsided by the criminal charges against former its former star presenter Huw Edwards, with bosses only told of the allegations a few hours before they were made public, an insider has claimed.\n\nIn April, Edwards resigned from the BBC on medical grounds and left without a payout. He then moved in with his mother in Wales.\n\nBut it has emerged that Edwards was arrested on November 8 last year and charged just over a month ago on June 26 following authorisation from the Crown Prosecution Service.\n\nA BBC insider reportedly said the corporation only found out Edwards was facing criminal charges hours before it was made public, according to The Times.\n\nMembers of staff were rocked by the news, which they said senior management must have been unaware of.\n\nA senior source told The Times: 'The BBC was informed by the Met Police when a call came through [on Monday].'\n\nEdwards - who helmed royal and political events at the BBC before resigning in April - has been bailed and will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court this Wednesday.\n\nAccording to the charge sheet, Edwards is accused of having six category A images, 12 category B pictures and 19 category C photographs on WhatsApp.\n\nThe offences are contrary to sections 1(1)(a) and 6 of the Protection of Children Act 1978, and if convicted he could face a maximum of up to 10 years in prison.\n\nCategory A involves images involving penetrative sexual activity, sexual activity with an animal or sadism; Category B covers images which show non-penetrative sexual activity; while Category C is for indecent images not within categories B or C.\n\nA Metropolitan Police spokesman told MailOnline yesterday: 'Huw Edwards, 62, of Southwark, London has been charged with three counts of making indecent images of children following a Met Police investigation.\n\n'The offences, which are alleged to have taken place between December 2020 and April 2022, relate to images shared on a WhatsApp chat.\n\nHuw Edwards is seen walking through London's Marylebone on June 17 last year with his ID tag\n\n'Edwards was arrested on November 8, 2023. He was charged on Wednesday, 26 June following authorisation from the Crown Prosecution Service. He has been bailed to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Wednesday, July 31.'\n\nThe resignation from the BBC by married father-of-five Edwards in April followed allegations that he paid someone for sexually explicit pictures.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police and South Wales Police both said in July last year that no criminal offence had been committed by Edwards.\n\nEdwards was absent from screens from when the story first broke in July 2023 until his exit in April 2024.\n\nHe remained on the payroll while suspended, which is normal BBC policy, and was suffering from serious mental health issues and received in-patient hospital care.\n\nThe BBC confirmed at the time of his departure that he had not received a pay-off and was leaving 'on the basis of medical advice from his doctors'.\n\nHe had long been a fixture in the coverage of major political and royal events, announcing Queen Elizabeth II's death on the BBC and presenting coverage of her funeral.\n\nHe also anchored the BBC's broadcast of the King's coronation last year.\n\nLast week the BBC confirmed Edwards was paid more than \u00a3475,000 in 2023/24 before he resigned and left.\n\nHuw Edwards will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Wednesday (file picture)\n\nThe veteran newsreader was paid between \u00a3475,000 and \u00a3479,999 for the year 2023/24 for 160 presenting days, BBC One news specials, election specials and other television programming, according to the BBC's annual report.\n\nThis marked an increase from 2022/23, when he was paid between \u00a3435,000 and 439,999 for 180 days presenting on BBC One, as well as news specials.\n\nThroughout the years, Edwards presented the Queen's Diamond Jubilee in 2012 and Platinum Jubilee in 2022, the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge (now the Prince and Princess of Wales) in 2011, the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in 2018, and the funeral of Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, in 2021.\n\nThe BBC News At

Category B covers images which show non-penetrative sexual activity. Category C is for indecent images not within categories B or C.

This is the first time disgraced Huw has been seen in public since July 5, 2023.\n\nThe court heard that Huw had been involved in an online chat with an adult man on WhatsApp between December 2020 and August 2021. The adult man sent him 377 sexual images. 41 of those images were indecent images of children.\n\n36 of the indecent images of kids were sent during a two-month period. On February 2, 2021, the male asked whether what he was sending was too young, in response to which Mr Edwards had a chilling remark in response and told him not to send any underage images, the court heard.\n\nThe indecent images that were sent included seven category A, the worst, 12 category B, and 22 category C. Of the category A images, the estimated age of most of the children was between 13 and 15, but one was age between seven and nine, the court was told.\n\nWestminster Magistrates' Court was told Edwards' offending had a starting point of 12 months in prison. However, his barrister, Philip Evans KC, said there were mitigating factors and the sentence should be suspended. He told the court: \"There are serious issues in relation to Mr Edwards health, both physical and mental, at the time of the offending and now.\"\n\nOn Monday, it was announced that the BBC newsreader had been charged with making indecent images of children. A Metropolitan Police spokesperson said at the time: \"Huw Edwards, 62, of Southwark, London has been charged with three counts of making indecent images of children following a Met Police investigation. The offences, which are alleged to have taken place between December 2020 and April 2022, relate to images shared on a WhatsApp chat\n\n\"Edwards was arrested on November 8 2023.

Flind, 60, has worked on shows including ITV's Peston and BBC One's This Week.\n\nEdwards quit his high-profile job at the BBC after 40 years in April, and now faces three charges over alleged activity between December 2020 and April 2022.\n\nThe offences are claimed to be linked to images shared on WhatsApp, police said.\n\nEdwards is set to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Wednesday morning.\n\nAccording to the charge sheet, Edwards is accused of having six category A images, 12 category B pictures and 19 category C photographs on WhatsApp.\n\nIf found guilty, he could receive a maximum penalty of six months in prison and an unlimited fine.\n\nPolice said Edwards was arrested on 8 November last year and charged just over a month ago on 26 June following authorisation from the Crown Prosecution Service.\n\nA Metropolitan Police spokesman said: \"Huw Edwards, 62, of Southwark, London has been charged with three counts of making indecent images of children following a Met Police investigation.\n\n\"The offences, which are alleged to have taken place between December 2020 and April 2022, relate to images shared on a WhatsApp chat.\n\n\"Edwards was arrested on 8 November 2023. He was charged on Wednesday, 26 June following authorisation from the Crown Prosecution Service.\n\n\"He has been bailed to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Wednesday, 31 July.\n\n\"Media and the public are strongly reminded that this is an active case. Nothing should be published, including on social media, which could prejudice future court proceedings.\"\n\nIt comes less than a week after it was revealed that Edwards received a \u00a340,000 pay rise from the BBC in the last year, despite being suspended for most of that time.\n\nIn the corporation's annual report, it was revealed that Edwards earned between \u00a3475,000-\u00a3479,999, up from \u00a3435,000-\u00a3439,999 in the previous report.\n\nThe BBC's director general Tim Davie said the pay rise was due to the BBC trying to act \"proportionally\".\n\n\"I think that's what we did and it ended up in the conclusion, we all know, but I think we wouldn't have wasted money if we weren't doing the right thing,\" he said.\n\n\"In terms of the increase in pay prior to any breaking of the story ... You know, people do get, as you'll have seen, overall, our pay progress is pretty good ... But people on the list would be getting pay rises for extended responsibility, and actually, if they're doing more ... So that is fairly normal business, and that's what would result in the change.\"\n\nDuring his career, Edwards fronted BBC's News At Ten for 20 years and anchored coverage of major national events including announcing Queen Elizabeth II's death on the BBC and presenting coverage of her funeral.\n\nHe also helmed the BBC's broadcast of the King's coronation last year.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [{"uri": "g_perry@independent.co.uk", "name": "G Perry", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huw_Edwards", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Huw Edwards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Week_(2003_TV_programme)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "This Week (2003 TV programme)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_Magistrates'_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Westminster Magistrates' Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wandsworth", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wandsworth"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_One", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Crown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_(TV_network)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ITV (TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dulwich", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dulwich"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dulwich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Westminster"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Westminster"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwark", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southwark"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southwark"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Davie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tim Davie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director-General_of_the_BBC", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Director-General of the BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/05/16/16/PA-42838864.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772866", "eventUri": "eng-9772866", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-08", "textStart": 1172, "textEnd": 1182}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-26", "textStart": 1230, "textEnd": 1237, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 1842, "textEnd": 1849}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-12-", "textStart": 691, "textEnd": 704, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

But he was suspended from his job at the BBC.\n\nHe remained absent from screens until his exit in April 2024.\n\nBut the news anchor remained on the payroll while suspended, which is normal BBC policy, and was suffering from serious mental health issues and received in-patient hospital care.\n\nHowever, friends say they had no idea about the alleged offences Edwards was facing, with one telling MailOnline Edwards' arrest had been kept a 'secret'.\n\n'It turns out he was arrested four months later and nobody knew. I had no idea until he was charged', the friend from the BBC said.\n\nAnother former colleague of the star said: 'It's a mess - and tragic for all concerned.'\n\nThe BBC was also blindsided by the criminal charges against its former star presenter, with bosses only told of the allegations a few hours before they were made public, an insider has claimed.\n\nA senior source told The Times: 'The BBC was informed by the Met Police when a call came through [on Monday].'\n\nEdwards has since left the family home and has reportedly split with his TV producer wife, Vicky Flind (the pair are pictured together in 2018 in London)\n\nIf Edwards is convicted, the former BBC star could face a maximum jail term of 10 years (he is pictured being escorted into Westminster Magistrates' Court on Wednesday morning)\n\nEdwards was surrounded by photographers as he made his way into the magistrates' court\n\nThe last picture of the former BBC News star captures him crossing the threshold into the court building this morning\n\nRevealing his arrest earlier this week, a Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'Huw Edwards, 62, of Southwark, London has been charged with three counts of making indecent images of children following a Met Police investigation.\n\n'The offences, which are alleged to have taken place between December 2020 and April 2022, relate to images shared on a WhatsApp chat.\n\n'Edwards was arrested on 8 November 2023.

The couple share three sons and two daughters.\n\nPictured are members of the press waiting outside Westminster Magistrates' Court today ahead of the former BBC star's arrival\n\nOne female police officer appeared to shout at the crowd as Edwards made his way into the court on Wednesday\n\nEdwards had long been a fixture in the coverage of major political and royal events, announcing Queen Elizabeth II's death on the BBC and presenting coverage of her funeral.\n\nHe also anchored the BBC's broadcast of the King's coronation last year.\n\nLast week the BBC confirmed Edwards was paid more than \u00a3475,000 in 2023/24 before he resigned and left.\n\nThe veteran newsreader was paid between \u00a3475,000 and \u00a3479,999 for the year 2023/24 for 160 presenting days, BBC One news specials, election specials and other television programming, according to the BBC's annual report.\n\nThis marked an increase from 2022/23, when he was paid between \u00a3435,000 and 439,999 for 180 days presenting on BBC One, as well as news specials.\n\nThroughout the years, Edwards presented the Queen's Diamond Jubilee in 2012 and Platinum Jubilee in 2022, the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge (now the Prince and Princess of Wales) in 2011, the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in 2018, and the funeral of Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, in 2021.\n\nThe BBC News At Ten presenter was also the broadcaster's voice at Trooping the Colour and the Festival of Remembrance, and took over election coverage from the long-serving David Dimbleby in 2019.", "source": {"uri":

This news follows reports that Edwards has been charged with creating indecent images of children.\n\nThe ex-BBC star was arrested on 8th November 2023 and subsequently charged on Wednesday, June 26, after authorisation from the Crown Prosecution Service, reports the Mirror.\n\nThe charge sheet alleges that Edwards had six category A images, 12 category B pictures, and 19 category C photographs on WhatsApp. These offences are in violation of sections 1(1)(a) and 6 of the Protection of Children Act 1978.\n\nJoin us on WhatsApp to get the latest news straight to your phone\n\nIf convicted, he could face a maximum penalty of six months imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine. Reports suggest that Edwards has now left his family home in Dulwich, south London, which he shared with Vicky. He is believed to have relocated to another property in London and has been dividing his time between there and his native Wales.\n\nEdwards is due to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Wednesday. It's understood that he has yet to finalise his divorce from Flind, with whom he shares five children. An insider revealed to The Sun: \"They separated quite a long time ago but have not announced it publicly. Huw has been living elsewhere for a while.\"\n\nEdwards and Ms Flind became engaged in 1993 after meeting when he was a BBC correspondent in Westminster at the age of 30. Ms Flind, two years his junior, has worked on shows such as ITV's Peston and BBC One's This Week.\n\nOn Monday, the Metropolitan Police confirmed that Edwards has been charged with three counts of making indecent images of children. The alleged offences are said to have occurred between 2020 and 2022.\n\nA spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police stated: \"Huw Edwards, 62, of Southwark, London has been charged with three counts of making indecent images of children following a Met Police investigation. The offences, which are alleged to have taken place between December 2020 and April 2022, relate to images shared on a WhatsApp chat.\"\n\n\"Edwards was arrested on 8 November 2023. He was charged on Wednesday, 26 June following authorisation from the Crown Prosecution Service. He has been bailed to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Wednesday, 31 July. Media and the public are strongly reminded that this is an active case. Nothing should be published, including on social media, which could prejudice future court proceedings.\"\n\nThe Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) explains on its website that \"making indecent images can have a wide definition in the law and can include opening an email attachment containing such an image, downloading one from a website, or receiving one via social media, even if unsolicited and even if part of a group.\"\n\nFollowing recent events, the National Churches Trust has announced on Tuesday that Huw Edwards has been removed from his position as Vice President. The charity, dedicated to the preservation of the UK's historic church buildings and ensuring they remain accessible, released a statement saying: \"In light of the news yesterday, the National Churches Trust has confirmed that Huw Edwards is no longer a Vice President for the charity. We are shocked and saddened by the recent developments.\"\n\nEdwards, renowned for his role as one of BBC One's Ten O'Clock News anchors, notably announced the passing of Queen Elizabeth II in September 2022. He subsequently led the broadcast of the late monarch's funeral, earning him and his team a TRIC award for their efforts.\n\nRepresentatives for Huw Edwards have been contacted by The Mirror for a statement.\n\nWe send out the biggest stories in an email every day.

He faces three counts of making indecent images of children\n\nFormer BBC host Huw Edwards has been charged with making indecent images of children. Friends said they had no idea he had even been arrested\n\nPictured are members of the press waiting outside Westminster Magistrates' Court today ahead of the former BBC star's arrival\n\nAccording to the charge sheet, Edwards is accused of having six category A images - the most serious child pornography images - 12 category B pictures and 19 category C photographs on WhatsApp.\n\nThe offences are contrary to sections 1(1)(a) and 6 of the Protection of Children Act 1978, and if convicted he could face a maximum of up to 10 years in prison.\n\nCategory A involves images involving penetrative sexual activity, sexual activity with an animal or sadism; Category B covers images which show non-penetrative sexual activity; while Category C is for indecent images not within categories B or C.\n\nThe bombshell news of the veteran broadcaster's child porn charges are said to have rocked Edwards' former colleagues.\n\nAnd it prompted questions about why it took prosecutors so long to reveal the charges Edwards is now facing.\n\nOne former colleague and friend told MailOnline: 'Huw kept his arrest completely secret'.\n\nEdwards was not charged by the Met Police with any crime when the scandal first broke in July 2023. But he was suspended from his job at the BBC.\n\nHe remained absent from screens until his exit in April 2024.\n\nEdwards has since left the family home and has reportedly split with his TV producer wife, Vicky Flind (the pair are pictured together in 2018 in London)\n\nBut the news anchor remained on the payroll while suspended, which is normal BBC policy, and was suffering from serious mental health issues and received in-patient hospital care.\n\nHowever, friends say they had no idea about the alleged offences Edwards was facing, with one telling MailOnline Edwards' arrest had been kept a 'secret'.\n\n'It turns out he was arrested four months later and nobody knew. I had no idea until he was charged', the friend from the BBC said.\n\nAnother former colleague of the star said: 'It's a mess - and tragic for all concerned.'\n\nThe BBC was also blindsided by the criminal charges against its former star presenter, with bosses only told of the allegations a few hours before they were made public, an insider has claimed.\n\nA senior source told The Times: 'The BBC was informed by the Met Police when a call came through [on Monday].'\n\nLast night a former attorney general said it was 'very puzzling' that the Crown Prosecution Service did not publish the details of the charges brought against Edwards around the time he was charged.\n\nHe added that the CPS's actions did not seem 'in accordance with' the principles of open justice, The Telegraph first reported.\n\nFollowing the allegations, Edwards moved back in with his mother in Wales.\n\nHe has reportedly since split with his TV producer wife Vicky Flind, who he got engaged to in 1993. The couple share three sons and two daughters.\n\nEdwards had long been a fixture in the coverage of major political and royal events, announcing Queen Elizabeth II's death on the BBC and presenting coverage of her funeral.\n\nHuw Edwards will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Wednesday (file picture)\n\nHe also anchored the BBC's broadcast of the King's coronation last year.\n\nLast week the BBC confirmed Edwards was paid more than \u00a3475,000 in 2023/24 before he resigned and left.\n\nThe veteran newsreader was paid between \u00a3475,000 and \u00a3479,999 for the year 2023/24 for 160 presenting days, BBC One news specials, election specials and other television programming, according to the BBC's annual report.\n\nThis marked an increase from 2022/23, when he was paid between \u00a3435,000 and 439,999 for 180 days presenting on BBC One, as well as news specials.\n\nThroughout the years, Edwards presented the Queen's Diamond Jubilee in 2012 and Platinum Jubilee in 2022, the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge (now the Prince and Princess of Wales) in 2011, the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in 2018, and the funeral of Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, in 2021.\n\nThe BBC News At Ten presenter was also the broadcaster's voice at Trooping the Colour and the Festival of Remembrance, and took over election coverage from the long-serving

He is also accused of making 12 category B pictures and 19 category C photographs. If found guilty, he faces up to 10 years in jail.\n\nA Metropolitan Police spokesperson said: \"Huw Edwards, 62, of Southwark, London has been charged with three counts of making indecent images of children following a Met Police investigation. The offenses, which are alleged to have taken place between December 2020 and April 2022, relate to images shared on a WhatsApp chat. Edwards was arrested on November 8 2023.\n\n\"He was charged on Wednesday, 26 June following authorization from the Crown Prosecution Service. He has been bailed to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Wednesday, 31 July. Media and the public are strongly reminded that this is an active case. Nothing should be published, including on social media, which could prejudice future court proceedings.\"\n\nBBC Star Embroiled in Alleged Sex Pics Scandal Resigns\n\nEdwards, 62, who hosted the main 10 p.m. news bulletin and led the BBC's coverage of major events such as the funerals of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, was one of the BBC's highest-paid presenters.\n\nHe has not appeared on TV since last July, when allegations first surfaced that he'd paid a teenager for sexually explicit images. His name was eventually revealed after a period of frenzied speculation about the identity of the \"BBC presenter\" concerned. At that time, London's Metropolitan Police and South Wales Police said that no criminal offense had been committed by the star.\n\nEdwards was the BBC third-highest paid star from April 2023 to March 2024, earning between \u00a3475,000 ($610,000) and \u00a3479,999 ($616,000) in the period.\n\nLast July, in naming her husband as the star behind the claims, Edwards' wife, Vicky Flind, said: \"In light of the recent reporting regarding the 'BBC Presenter' I am making this statement on behalf of my husband Huw Edwards, after what have been five extremely difficult days for our family. I am doing this primarily out of concern for his mental well-being and to protect our children.\n\n\"Huw is suffering from serious mental health issues. As is well documented, he has been treated for severe depression in recent years. The events of the last few days have greatly worsened matters, he has suffered another serious episode and is now receiving in-patient hospital care where he'll stay for the foreseeable future.\n\n\"Once well enough to do so, he intends to respond to the stories that have been published. To be clear Huw was first told that there were allegations being made against him last Thursday. In the circumstances and given Huw's condition I would like to ask that the privacy of my family and everyone else caught up in these upsetting events is respected. I know that Huw is deeply sorry that so many colleagues have been impacted by the recent media speculation. We hope this statement will bring that to an end.\"\n\nIn April 2024, Edwards resigned. \"Huw Edwards has today resigned and left the BBC,\" a BBC spokesman said at the time. \"After 40 years of service, Huw has explained that his decision was made on the basis of medical advice from his doctors.\" The spokesperson said Edwards' resignation \"will allow all parties to move forward.\"\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox.

"body": "Ex-BBC presenter Huw Edwards admits having indecent images of children\n\nJosh Payne, Luke O'Reilly and Margaret Davis, PA\n\n31 July 2024 at 0:17 pm\n\nFormer BBC presenter Huw Edwards has pleaded guilty to making indecent images of children.\n\nThe veteran broadcaster admitted having 41 on WhatsApp, including seven of the most serious type.\n\nWestminster Magistrates' Court heard the offences were committed between December 2020 and August 2021.\n\nWearing a dark suit, blue tie and sunglasses, the 62-year-old spoke to confirm his name, date of birth, address and his guilty pleas at the start of the hearing on Wednesday.\n\nAfter entering his pleas, Edwards sat staring into the distance, with his head tilted slightly upwards, and adjusted his tie as Ian Hope, prosecuting, laid out the case against him.\n\nThe court heard that Edwards had been involved in online chat with an adult man on WhatsApp between December 2020 and August 2021, who sent him 377 sexual images, of which 41 were indecent images of children.\n\nThe bulk of these, 36, were sent during a two-month period.\n\nOn February 2 2021 the male asked whether what he was sending was too young, in response to which Edwards told him not to send any under-age images, the court heard.\n\nThe indecent images that were sent included seven category A, the worst, 12 category B, and 22 category C.\n\nOf the category A images, the estimated age of most of the children was between 13 and 15, but one was aged between seven and nine, the court was told.\n\nThe final indecent image was sent in August 2021, a category A film featuring a young boy.\n\nThe man told Edwards that the boy was quite young-looking, and that he had more images which were illegal.\n\nEdwards told him not to send any illegal images, the court was told.\n\nNo more were sent, and the pair continued to exchange legal pornographic images until April 2022.\n\nSpeaking in Edwards' defence, his barrister, Philip Evans KC, said: \"There's no suggestion in this case that Mr Edwards has... in the traditional sense of the word, created any image of any sort.\n\n\"It is important also to remember for context that devices, Mr Edwards' devices, have been seized, have been searched, and there's nothing in those devices.\n\n\"It is only the images that are the subject of the charges that came via a WhatsApp chat.\n\n\"Mr Edwards did not keep any images, did not send any to anyone else and did not and has not sought similar images from anywhere else.\"\n\nEdwards was bailed and will next appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on September 16.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "press_association@aol.co.uk", "name": "Press Association", "type": "author", "isAgency":

The former BBC broadcaster appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court today.\n\nThe court heard that Edwards had been involved in online chat with an adult man on WhatsApp between December 2020 and August 2021, who sent him 377 sexual images, of which 41 were indecent images of children. The bulk of these, 36, were sent during a two-month period.\n\nOn February 2 2021 the male asked whether what he was sending was too young, in response to which Edwards told him not to send any underage images, the court heard. The indecent images that were sent included seven category A, the worst, 12 category B, and 22 category C.\n\nOf the category A images, the estimated age of most of the children was between 13 and 15, but one was aged between seven and nine, the court was told. The final indecent image was sent in August 2021, a category A film featuring a young boy.\n\nThe man told Edwards that the boy was quite young looking, and that he had more images which were illegal. Edwards told him not to send any illegal images, the court was told.\n\nNo more were sent, and the pair continued to exchange legal pornographic images until April 2022. Edwards will be sentenced at Westminster Magistrates' Court on September 16.\n\nWestminster Magistrates' Court was told Edwards' offending had a starting point of 12 months in prison. However his barrister, Philip Evans KC, said there were mitigating factors and the sentence should be suspended. He said: \"There's no suggestion in this case that Mr Edwards has... in the traditional sense of the word, created any image of any sort.\n\n\"It is important also to remember for context that devices, Mr Edwards' devices, have been seized, have been searched, and there's nothing in those devices.

He responded, \"I'm not going to get into who has spoken to who.....we are always trying to be very judicious with the spending money and no one wants to waste a pound but you are trying to act proportionally and act appropriately and I think that is what we did.\"\n\nDavie added, \"We wouldn't have wasted money if we weren't doing the right thing. I wouldn't go into specifics but in terms of the increase of pay, prior to any breaking of any story, our pay progress is under inflation but people on the list would be getting pay rises and that is fairly normally business.\"\n\nOn 22 April, the BBC announced that Huw Edwards had stepped down from his role following medical advice. \"Huw Edwards has today resigned and left the BBC,\" the broadcaster's brief statement read: \"After 40 years of service, Huw has explained that his decision was made on the basis of medical advice from his doctors.

After entering his pleas, Edwards sat staring into the distance, with his head tilted slightly upwards, and adjusted his tie as Ian Hope, prosecuting, laid out the case against him.\n\nSpeaking in Edwards' defence, his barrister Philip Evans KC said: \"There's no suggestion in this case that Mr Edwards has... in the traditional sense of the word, created any image of any sort. It is important also to remember for context that devices, Mr Edwards' devices, have been seized, have been searched, and there's nothing in those devices.\n\n\"It is only the images that are the subject of the charges that came via a WhatsApp chat. Mr Edwards did not keep any images, did not send any to anyone else and did not and has not sought similar images from anywhere else.\"\n\nEdwards was bailed. He will be sentenced at Westminster Magistrates' Court on September 16.\n\nRead more of today's top stories here", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ashlie_blakey@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Ashlie Blakey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huw_Edwards", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Huw Edwards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_pornography", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Child pornography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_Magistrates'_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Westminster Magistrates' Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pornography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King's_Counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "King's Counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrister", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barrister"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Techniques_and_Styles", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Techniques and Styles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/Historians", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/Historians", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Criminals", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Criminals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29648402.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Huw-Edwards-court-case.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772866", "eventUri": "eng-9772866", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 237, "textEnd": 244}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-16", "textStart": 2410, "textEnd": 2422}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-12-", "textStart": 939, "textEnd": 952}], "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

The story was based on an interview with the person's mother and stepfather, who said the contact began when the young person was 17.\n\nHowever, a lawyer for the young person told the BBC that \"nothing inappropriate\" had happened after The Sun's report and allegations came out. The Metropolitan Police also ruled out taking any action against Edwards and said \"there was no evidence that a criminal offense had been committed.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huw_Edwards", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Huw Edwards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Crown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_pornography", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Child pornography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwark", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southwark"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southwark"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_United_Kingdom_general_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2015 United Kingdom general election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_Magistrates'_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Westminster Magistrates' Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listed_building", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Listed building"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgend", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bridgend"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bridgend"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Sun (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/tvKWaQnJHtwI6uoSi91WWw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/c35e78d263c4e9060072ee025d3624b5", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772866", "eventUri": "eng-9772866", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-26", "textStart": 472, "textEnd": 479}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 1004, "textEnd": 1011}, {"amb": false, "date": "-04-22", "textStart": 2082, "textEnd": 2090}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-12-", "textStart": 120, "textEnd": 133, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

Edwards admits having images of children as...", "body": "Former BBC presenter Huw Edwards has admitted accessing indecent photographs of children as young as seven after a man he met online sent him hundreds of sexual images on WhatsApp.\n\nWestminster Magistrates' Court was told seven of the 41 indecent images sent to the veteran broadcaster by the unnamed male were of the most serious type.\n\nThe final indecent image was sent in August 2021, a category A film featuring a young boy, with the man telling the newsreader the child was \"quite young looking\" and that he had more images which were illegal.\n\nFormer BBC broadcaster Huw Edwards arriving at Westminster Magistrates\u00b4 Court on Wednesday (Jonathan Brady/PA)\n\nEdwards told him not to send any illegal images, the court was told in a 26-minute hearing.\n\nHe appeared nervous, fidgeting with his hands as Chief Magistrate Paul Goldspring told him he would not be sentencing him on Wednesday.\n\nThe court heard that Edwards had been involved in online chat with an adult man on WhatsApp between December 2020 and August 2021, who sent him 377 sexual images, of which 41 were indecent images of children.\n\nThe bulk of these, 36, were sent during a two-month period.\n\nOn February 2 2021, the male asked whether what he was sending was too young, to which Edwards told him not to send any underage images, the court heard.\n\nThe indecent images that were sent included seven category A, the worst, 12 category B, and 22 category C.\n\nOf the category A images, the estimated age of most of the children was between 13 and 15, but one was aged between seven and nine, the court was told.\n\nNo more indecent images more were sent after August 2021, but the pair continued to exchange legal pornographic images until April 2022.\n\nSpeaking in Edwards' defence, his barrister Philip Evans KC said: \"There's no suggestion in this case that Mr Edwards has... in the traditional sense of the word, created any image of any sort.\n\n\"It is important also to remember for context that devices, Mr Edwards' devices, have been seized, have been searched, and there's nothing in those devices.\n\n\"It is only the images that are the subject of the charges that came via a WhatsApp chat.\n\n\"Mr Edwards did not keep any images, did not send any to anyone else and did not and has not sought similar images from anywhere else.\"\n\nMr Evans said the defendant had \"both mental and physical\" health issues.\n\nHe told the court: \"It is obvious to the court, I'm sure, that Mr Edwards was not just of good character, but of exceptional character.\"\n\nThe broadcaster was emotionless as he pleaded guilty to three counts of making indecent images of children.\n\nAfter admitting the charges, he sat staring into the distance, with his head tilted slightly upwards.\n\nHe adjusted his tie as Ian Hope, prosecuting, laid out the case against him.\n\nVeteran broadcaster Huw Edwards appeared at Westminster Magistrates\u00b4 Court on Wednesday (Aaron Chown/PA)\n\nMr Hope told the court that a suspended sentence might be considered for Edwards.\n\nSetting out the potential penalties under the law, he said that where there is the prospect of rehabilitation a community order and sexual offender treatment programme could be considered as alternatives to a custodial sentence.\n\nSentencing guidelines set the starting point for any jail term for possession of a Category A image at 12 months, with a range of 26 weeks to three years.\n\nThe starting point is 26 weeks for a category B image, and a community order for category C, he said.\n\nAggravating features to be taken into account for Edwards include that the images included moving images, and the young age of the child thought to be seven to nine years old in two of the category A images.\n\nMitigating factors are Edwards' early guilty plea, his previous good character, his mental health issues and what Mr Hope said is \"genuine remorse\".\n\nHe faced a barrage of cameras and photographers as he left court, but made no comment as he departed in a black Mercedes with tinted windows.\n\nClaire Brinton, from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), said: \"Accessing indecent images of underage people perpetuates the sexual exploitation of children, which has deep, long-lasting trauma on these victims.\n\n\"The CPS and the Metropolitan Police were able to prove that Edwards was receiving illegal material involving children via WhatsApp.\n\n\"This prosecution sends a clear message that the CPS, working alongside with the police, will work to bring to justice those who seek to exploit children, wherever that abuse takes place.\"\n\nEdwards will be appear at the same court again on September 16.", "source": {"uri":

sunglasses, the 62-year-old spoke to confirm his name, date of birth, address and his guilty pleas at the start of the hearing on Wednesday.\n\nAfter entering his pleas, Edwards sat staring into the

Magistrates\u00b4 Court on Wednesday (Aaron Chown/PA)\n\nThe court heard that Edwards had been involved in online chat with an adult man on WhatsApp between December 2020 and August 2021, who sent him 377 sexual images, of which 41 were indecent images of children.\n\nThe bulk of these, 36, were sent during a two-month period.\n\nOn February 2 2021 the male asked whether what he was sending was too young, in response to which Mr Edwards told him not to send any underage images, the court heard.\n\nThe indecent images that were sent included seven category A, the worst, 12 category B, and 22 category C.\n\nOf the category A images, the estimated age of most of the children was between 13 and 15, but one was aged between seven and nine, the court was told.\n\nThe final indecent image was sent in August 2021, a category A film featuring a young boy.\n\nThe man told Edwards that the boy was quite young looking, and that he had more images which were illegal.\n\nEdwards leaves Westminster Magistrates\u00b4 Court after the hearing (Aaron Chown/PA)\n\nEdwards told him not to send any illegal images, the court was told.\n\nNo more were sent, and the pair continued to exchange

the word, created any image of any sort.\n\n\"It is important also to remember for context that devices, Mr Edwards' devices, have been seized, have been searched, and there's nothing in those

Edwards, 62, who was the BBC's highest paid journalist and top news anchor until he quit in April, had arrived at London's Westminster Magistrates' Court wearing sunglasses through a throng of photographers and camera crews.\n\nAfter confirming his identity, he was asked if he wished to indicate a plea to the three charges, which relate to three different categories of indecent images. Edwards said: 'Guilty'. Judge Paul Goldspring said Edwards would be sentenced on Sept. 16.\n\nDuring the 25-minute hearing, prosecutor Ian Hope said the 41 still or moving images had been sent to Edwards by an adult male on WhatsApp between December 2020 and August 2021. Hope added that seven of the 41 images were of the most serious kind and that two of that seven were pornographic videos of a child possibly aged seven and nine years old.\n\nEdwards' lawyer Philip Evans emphasised that the charges to which his client had indicated guilty pleas related only to images that were sent to him via WhatsApp. 'There is no suggestion in this case that Mr Edwards has in any way made, in the traditional sense of the word, any images in any physical way or created any images of any sort,' Evans said.\n\nEdwards, who announced the death of Queen Elizabeth to the nation in 2022 and led coverage of elections, royal weddings and the 2012 Olympics, has not been on TV screens for a year and the court appearance was his first in public since then.

The charge can carry a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.\n\nUp until April 2024, the broadcaster worked for the BBC as the most high-profile news anchor and fronted multiple major events including the King's Coronation and Queen Elizabeth II's funeral.

during a two-month period.\n\nOn Feb 2 2021 the male asked whether what he was sending was too young, in response to which Edwards told him not to send any underage images, the court heard.\n\nThe indecent images that were sent included seven category A, the worst, 12 category B, and 22 category C.\n\nOf the category A images, the estimated age of most of the children was between 13 and 15, but

The story was based on an interview with the person's mother and stepfather, who said the contact began when the young person was 17.\n\nHowever, a lawyer for the young person told the BBC that \"nothing inappropriate\" had happened after The Sun's report and allegations came out. The Metropolitan Police also ruled out taking any action against Edwards and said \"there was no evidence that a criminal offense had been committed.\"", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "becca_longmire@people.com", "name": "Becca Longmire", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huw_Edwards", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Huw Edwards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Crown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_Magistrates'_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Westminster Magistrates' Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_pornography", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Child pornography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwark", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southwark"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southwark"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_United_Kingdom_general_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2015 United Kingdom general election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listed_building", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Listed building"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgend", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bridgend"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bridgend"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Sun (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 16}], "image": "https://people.com/thmb/ptOZmj99BAHXeCYXMiKcfbX3chM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(719x264:721x266)/huw-edwards-london-051423_4265-84528e71e04b4a4ba87542a5186f1260.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772866", "eventUri": "eng-9772866", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-26", "textStart": 175, "textEnd": 182}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 707, "textEnd": 714}, {"amb": false, "date": "-04-22", "textStart": 1785, "textEnd": 1793}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-12-", "textStart": 549, "textEnd": 562}], "sentiment": -0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

The offences, which are alleged to have taken place between December 2020 and April 2022, relate to images shared on a WhatsApp chat.\n\nHe is accused of having six category A images, 12 category B images and 19 category C images on his WhatsApp. Category A is defined as \"images involving penetrative sexual activity, sexual activity with an animal or sadism.\"\n\nEdwards' appearance today is a first hearing. He is in court having not been seen in public for a year. He stopped appearing on the BBC when allegations surfaced in The Sun last summer and exited the corporation in April 2024 on \"medical advice\" after \"40 years of service,\" the corporation said, coming just prior to him taking home his biggest pay packet in five years.\n\nHe was arrested five months before he left the BBC and charged just two months later.

The court heard he was sent 41 indecent images of children by an adult male on WhatsApp between December 2020 and April 2022.\n\nSix were Category A, the most serious classification, of which the estimated age of the children was between 13 and 15, but one was aged between seven and nine. Edwards told the man not to send any illegal images, the court heard.\n\nToday marked the first time the former BBC presenter was seen publicly since July 2023. He was arrested in November 2023 and officially resigned from the BBC in April 2024.\n\nEdwards is best known for presenting the Six O'Clock News and was a key reporter at Prince William and Kate Middleton's wedding. He also announced Queen Elizabeth's death in 2022 and led the BBC's coverage of her funeral.\n\nEdwards is said to have moved out of his family home in Dulwich, south London, after splitting from his wife Vicky Flind, 62. It is believed he has had to move to another property in the capital and has been splitting his time between there and his native Wales. The former couple have reportedly not yet divorced. They share five grown-up children - three sons and two daughters.\n\nA source told The Sun: \"They separated quite a long time ago but have not announced it publicly. Huw has been living elsewhere for a while.\" Vicky also works in television and was previously the editor of the BBC's This Week before she moved to ITV's rival politics show Peston, while she also worked on Britain's Next Prime Minister.\n\nEdwards has not appeared on any TV shows since his last BBC News appearance on July 5, 2023. He was suspended by the broadcaster following separate allegations made against him. In January of this year, it was reported that Edwards was 'too unwell' to discuss his future at the BBC and was still recovering from a 'serious episode'. He has a history of mental health and depression.\n\nHe is a religious man and has always gone to church weekly to practise his Christian faith. He was previously the Vice President of the National Churches Trust and told Sorted Magazine last year that churches \"have a vital role to play in moments of national importance; bringing people together, providing quiet spaces for reflection and prayer, and places for communities to gather and share\".\n\nBut on Tuesday, Edwards was stripped of his role at the trust. The charity, which supports the UK's churches to maintain their historic sites and buildings, said in a statement: \"In light of the news yesterday, the National Churches Trust has confirmed that Huw Edwards is no longer a Vice President for the charity. We are shocked and saddened by the recent developments.\"\n\nAccording to the charge sheet, Edwards is accused of having six Category A images, 12 Category B pictures and 19 Category C photographs on WhatsApp - offences contrary to sections 1(1)(a) and 6 of the Protection of Children Act 1978. The bulk of these, 36, were sent during a two-month period. The final indecent image was sent in August 2021, a Category A film featuring a young boy.\n\nWestminster Magistrates' Court was told Edwards' offending had a starting point of 12 months in prison. However his barrister, Philip Evans KC, said there were mitigating factors and the sentence should be suspended.\n\nHe said: \"There are serious issues in relation to Mr Edwards health, both physical and mental, at the time of the offending and now.\" Edwards has now been bailed for pre-sentence reports.\n\nProsecutor Ian Hope told the court that a suspended sentence might be considered for the newsreader. Setting out the potential penalties under the law, he said that where there is the prospect of rehabilitation, a community order and sexual offender treatment programme could be considered as alternatives to a custodial sentence.\n\nSentencing guidelines set the starting point for any jail term for possession of a Category A image at 12 months, with a range of 26 weeks to three years. The starting point is 26 weeks for a category B image, and a community order for category C, he said.\n\nAggravating features to be taken into account for Edwards include that the images included moving images, and the young age of the child thought to be seven to nine years old in two of the category A images.\n\nMitigating factors are Edwards' early guilty plea, his previous good character, his mental health issues and what Mr Hope said is \"genuine remorse\".\n\nThe Metropolitan Police has today said the allegations are separate from other claims that were widely reported and investigated last year. Edwards was previously named by his then-wife Vicky as the BBC News reporter at the centre of a scandal accused of exchanging sexually explicit images with a younger person.", "source": {"uri":

Edwards was the BBC's highest paid journalist and top news anchor until he quit in April, following allegations he had paid a young person thousands of pounds for sexually explicit photos, something which is unconnected to the criminal charges.\n\nThe 62-year-old was a household name in Britain for more than two decades, announcing the death of Queen Elizabeth to the nation in 2022 and leading coverage of elections, royal weddings and the 2012 Olympics. But he has not been on TV screens for a year and Wednesday's court appearance, which caps a dramatic fall from grace, was his first in public since then.\n\nEdwards made his way through a throng of photographers and camera crews into London's Westminster Magistrates' Court, where he admitted having been sent several indecent images of children between December 2020 and August 2021. Asked if he wished to indicate a plea to the three charges, which related to three different categories of indecent images, Edwards said: \"Guilty\".\n\nJudge Paul Goldspring said Edwards would be sentenced on Sept. 16 and that \"all options\", including an immediate prison sentence, would be considered. During the 25-minute hearing, prosecutor Ian Hope said Edwards had been sent a total of 377 sexually explicit images by an adult male on WhatsApp, 41 of which were indecent, illegal images of children.\n\nPORNOGRAPHIC VIDEOS Hope said seven of the 41 images were of the most serious kind and that two of those seven were pornographic videos of a child possibly aged between seven and nine years old.\n\nThe last indecent image was sent to Edwards in August 2021, when the man who sent it said \"the male in the film was quite young-looking and that he has more images which are illegal\", Hope said. He added that Edwards told the male \"not to send him illegal images and no more are sent from this point\", though the chat continues and further legal pornographic images were sent.\n\nEdwards' lawyer Philip Evans emphasised that the charges to which his client had indicated guilty pleas related only to images that were sent to him via WhatsApp. \"There is no suggestion in this case that Mr Edwards has in any way made, in the traditional sense of the word, any images in any physical way or created any images of any sort,\" Evans said.\n\nEdwards made no comment as he left the court building. Claire Brinton of Britain's Crown Prosecution Service said in a statement: \"Accessing indecent images of underage people perpetuates the sexual exploitation of children, which has deep, long-lasting trauma on these victims.\"", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huw_Edwards", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Huw Edwards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_presenter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Television presenter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_presenter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "News presenter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_Magistrates'_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Westminster Magistrates' Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilt_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guilt (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_pornography", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Child pornography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Prosecution_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crown Prosecution Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pornography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/27_05_2019_11_52_07_9391333.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772866", "eventUri": "eng-9772866", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-16", "textStart": 1228, "textEnd": 1236}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-12-", "textStart": 991, "textEnd": 1004}], "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

They have five children\n\nThe CPS denied it had purposely suppressed details about the presenter being charged or given him preferential treatment.\n\nA CPS spokesperson said: 'Decisions on charging announcements are based on operational factors and no defendant receives preferential treatment.\n\n'Our handling of this case followed our normal procedures working in partnership with police colleagues.'\n\nIt comes amid the news that Edwards has split from his TV producer wife and moved out of the family home ahead of his court hearing, according to reports last night.\n\nEdwards is understood to have left the couple's home in Dulwich, south London, which he shared with Vicky Flind.\n\nThe former presenter has been dividing his time between a home in Wandsworth, south-west London, and his native Wales.\n\nHe got engaged to Vicky in 1993, and the couple share three sons and two daughters.\n\nEdwards got engaged to Vicky in 1993, and the couple share three sons and two daughters\n\nSpeaking of their split, a source told The Sun: 'They separated quite a long time ago but have not announced it publicly.' The source added: 'Huw has been living elsewhere for a while.'\n\nEdwards faces three counts of making indecent images of children relating to offences said to have taken place between December 2020 and April 2022, Scotland Yard revealed yesterday.\n\nRead MoreEXCLUSIVE Huw Edwards kept his arrest 'completely secret' from friends who had 'no idea' of child porn charges\n\nOne former colleague and friend told MailOnline: 'Huw kept his arrest completely secret.'\n\nThey said that like everyone else they had seen the statement from the Met Police in July 2023 that said detectives had not found any evidence of criminal activity when the scandal broke and he was suspended from his job.\n\n'It turns out he was arrested four months later and nobody knew. I had no idea until he was charged', the friend from the BBC said.\n\nAnother former colleague of the star said: 'It's a mess - and tragic for all concerned'.\n\nThe BBC was also blindsided by the criminal charges against its former star presenter Huw Edwards, with bosses only told of the allegations a few hours before they were made public, an insider has claimed.\n\nIn April, Edwards resigned from the BBC on medical grounds and left without a payout. He then moved in with his mother in Wales.\n\nEdwards is due in court in central London tomorrow, having been accused of child pornography offences after 37 indecent images were allegedly shared on a WhatsApp chat\n\nBut it has emerged that Edwards was arrested on November 8 last year and charged just over a month ago on June 26 following authorisation from the Crown Prosecution Service.\n\nA BBC insider reportedly said the corporation only found out Edwards was facing criminal charges hours before it was made public, according to The Times.\n\nMembers of staff were rocked by the news, which they said senior management must have been unaware of.\n\nA senior source told The Times: 'The BBC was informed by the Met Police when a call came through [on Monday].'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huw_Edwards", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Huw Edwards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Prosecution_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crown Prosecution Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_pornography", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Child pornography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marylebone_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marylebone station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Telegraph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Crown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attorney general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central London"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South London"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magistrates'_court_(England_and_Wales)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Magistrates' court (England and Wales)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Westminster"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Westminster"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wandsworth", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wandsworth"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Sun (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dulwich", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dulwich"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dulwich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland_Yard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotland Yard"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/07/30/23/87904937-0-image-m-109_1722379969141.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772866", "eventUri": "eng-9772866", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-17", "textStart": 903, "textEnd": 910}, {"amb": false, "date": "-11-08", "textStart": 3565, "textEnd": 3575}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-26", "textStart": 3623, "textEnd": 3630}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-12-", "textStart": 2288, "textEnd": 2301}], "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Huw Edwards admits having images of children as young as seven", "body": "Westminster Magistrates' Court heard Edwards was sent hundreds of sexual images on WhatsApp.\n\nFormer BBC presenter Huw Edwards has admitted accessing indecent photographs of children as young as seven after a man he met online sent him hundreds of sexual images on WhatsApp.\n\nWestminster Magistrates' Court was told seven of the 41 indecent images sent to the veteran broadcaster by the unnamed male were of the most serious type.\n\nThe final indecent image was sent in August 2021, a category A film featuring a young boy, with the man telling the newsreader the child was \"quite young looking\" and that he had more images which were illegal.\n\nEdwards told him not to send any illegal images, the court was told in a 26-minute hearing.\n\nHe appeared nervous, fidgeting with his hands as Chief Magistrate Paul Goldspring told him he would not be sentencing him on Wednesday.\n\nThe court heard that Edwards had been involved in online chat with an adult man on WhatsApp between December 2020 and August 2021, who sent him 377 sexual images, of which 41 were indecent images of children.\n\nThe bulk of these, 36, were sent during a two-month period.\n\nOn February 2 2021, the male asked whether what he was sending was too young, to which Edwards told him not to send any underage images, the court heard.\n\nThe indecent images that were sent included seven category A, the worst, 12 category B, and 22 category C.\n\nOf the category A images, the estimated age of most of the children was between 13 and 15, but one was aged between seven and nine, the court was told.\n\nNo more indecent images more were sent after August 2021, but the pair continued to exchange legal pornographic images until April 2022.\n\nSpeaking in Edwards' defence, his barrister Philip Evans KC said: \"There's no suggestion in this case that Mr Edwards has... in the traditional sense of the word, created any image of any sort.\n\n\"It is important also to remember for context that devices, Mr Edwards' devices, have been seized, have been searched, and there's nothing in those devices.\n\n\"It is only the images that are the subject of the charges that came via a WhatsApp chat.\n\n\"Mr Edwards did not keep any images, did not send any to anyone else and did not and has not sought similar images from anywhere else.\"\n\nMr Evans said the defendant had \"both mental and physical\" health issues.\n\nHe told the court: \"It is obvious to the court, I'm sure, that Mr Edwards was not just of good character, but of exceptional character.\"\n\nThe broadcaster was emotionless as he pleaded guilty to three counts of making indecent images of children.\n\nAfter admitting the charges, he sat staring into the distance, with his head tilted slightly upwards.\n\nHe adjusted his tie as Ian Hope, prosecuting, laid out the case against him.\n\nMr Hope told the court that a suspended sentence might be considered for Edwards.\n\nSetting out the potential penalties under the law, he said that where there is the prospect of rehabilitation a community order and sexual offender treatment programme could be considered as alternatives to a custodial sentence.\n\nSentencing guidelines set the starting point for any jail term for possession of a Category A image at 12 months, with a range of 26 weeks to three years.\n\nThe starting point is 26 weeks for a category B image, and a community order for category C, he said.\n\nAggravating features to be taken into account for Edwards include that the images included moving images, and the young age of the child thought to be seven to nine years old in two of the category A images.\n\nMitigating factors are Edwards' early guilty plea, his previous good character, his mental health issues and what Mr Hope said is \"genuine remorse\".\n\nHe faced a barrage of cameras and photographers as he left court, but made no comment as he departed in a black Mercedes with tinted windows.\n\nClaire Brinton, from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), said: \"Accessing indecent images of underage people perpetuates the sexual exploitation of children, which has deep, long-lasting trauma on these victims.\n\n\"The CPS and the Metropolitan Police were able to prove that Edwards was receiving illegal material involving children via WhatsApp.\n\n\"This prosecution sends a clear message that the CPS, working alongside with the police, will work to bring to justice those who seek to exploit children, wherever that abuse takes place.\"\n\nEdwards will be appear at the same court again on September 16.", "source": {"uri": "shropshirestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Shropshire Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He pleaded guilty to three counts of making indecent images of children.\n\nEdwards, 62, had been involved in an online chat with another adult male on WhatsApp between December 2020 and August 2021, with the man sending him 377 sexual images - 41 of which, were images of children. The court heard how the children in the Category A images were estimated to be between the ages of 13 and 15, but one was of age between seven and nine.\n\nThe bulk of the images sent via WhatsApp were sent during a two-month period. On February 2, 2021, the male who was engaging in conversation with Edwards asked whether what he was sending was too young. The court heard how Edwards informed him not to send underage images.\n\nHowever, they went on to continue to send legal pornographic images to one another until April 2022. The final indecent image which was sent in August 2021 was a Category A film, featuring a young male. Edwards appeared emotionless as he pleaded guilty in court. After admitting the charges, the anchor who became famous for covering historic events sat gazing into the distance as he tilted his head slightly upwards.\n\nIn a statement, released on Monday the Metropolitan Police said Edwards was arrested in November last year and charged on June 26. According to the charge sheet, Edwards is accused of having six Category A images, 12 Category B pictures and 19 Category C photographs on WhatsApp - offences contrary to sections 1(1)(a) and 6 of the Protection of Children Act 1978.\n\nThe offences with which Mr Edwards was charged with carry a maximum sentence of ten years. His now estranged wife, Vicky Flint, previously revealed that Edwards was the BBC News anchor who faced allegations of sending inappropriate messages to a young man under the age of 18 following days of speculation.\n\nShe said: \"In light of the recent reporting regarding the 'BBC Presenter' I am making this statement on behalf of my husband Huw Edwards, after what have been five extremely difficult days for our family. I am doing this primarily out of concern for his mental well-being and to protect our children.\n\n\"Huw is suffering from serious mental health issues. As is well documented, he has been treated for severe depression in recent years. The events of the last few days have greatly worsened matters, he has suffered another serious episode and is now receiving in-patient hospital care where he'll stay for the foreseeable future.\n\n\"Once well enough to do so, he intends to respond to the stories that have been published. To be clear Huw was first told that there were allegations being made against him last Thursday. In the circumstances and given Huw's condition I would like to ask that the privacy of my family and everyone else caught up in these upsetting events is respected. I know that Huw is deeply sorry that so many colleagues have been impacted by the recent media speculation. We hope this statement will bring that to an end.\"\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs onTikTok,Snapchat,Instagram,Twitter,Facebook,YouTubeandThreads.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_bird@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Daniel Bird", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huw_Edwards", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Huw Edwards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_presenter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "News presenter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_pornography", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Child pornography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_Magistrates'_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Westminster Magistrates' Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protection_of_Children_Act_1978", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Protection of Children Act 1978"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pornography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quality of life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major depressive disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article33365203.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Huw-Edwards-court-case.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772866", "eventUri": "eng-9772866", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 236, "textEnd": 243}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-26", "textStart": 1622, "textEnd": 1629}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-12-", "textStart": 538, "textEnd": 551}], "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

He engaged in an online conversation with an adult man between December 2020 and August 2021.\n\nThe man sent Huw 377 sexual images, of which 41 were indecent images of children. The indecent images that were sent included seven category A, the worst, 12 category B, and 22 category C, the court heard during his first public appearance in over a year.\n\nA category A film featuring a young boy was amongst content sent to Huw. The man told Edwards that the boy was quite young looking, and that he had more images which were illegal. Edwards told him not to send any illegal images, the court was told.\n\nNo more were sent, and the pair continued to exchange legal pornographic images until April 2022. But before that, 41 indecent images of children were sent. The bulk of these, 36, were sent during a two-month period between December 2020 and August 2021.\n\nOn February 2 2021 the male asked whether what he was sending was too young, in response to which Mr Edwards told him not to send any underage images, the court heard. Of the category A images, the estimated age of most of the children was between 13 and 15, but one was age between seven and nine, the magistrates' court was told.\n\nToday, Edwards was emotionless as he pleaded guilty to three counts of making indecent images of children. After admitting charges, he sat staring into the distance, with his head tilted slightly upwards. He adjusted his tie as Ian Hope, prosecuting, laid out the case.\n\nWestminster Magistrates' was told Edwards' offending had a starting point of 12 months in prison. However his barrister, Philip Evans KC, told the court that there were mitigating factors and the sentence should be suspended. He said: \"There are serious issues in relation to Mr Edwards health, both physical and mental, at the time of the offending and now.\"\n\nSpeaking after the hearing, Claire Brinton, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: \"Accessing indecent images of underage people perpetuates the sexual exploitation of children, which has deep, long-lasting trauma on these victims.\n\n\"The CPS and the Metropolitan Police were able to prove that Edwards was receiving illegal material involving children via WhatsApp. This prosecution sends a clear message that the CPS, working alongside with the police, will work to bring to justice those who seek to exploit children, wherever that abuse takes place.\"\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Threads.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "harry_rutter@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Harry Rutter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huw_Edwards", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Huw Edwards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_pornography", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Child pornography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_Magistrates'_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Westminster Magistrates' Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pornography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magistrates'_court_(England_and_Wales)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Magistrates' court (England and Wales)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King's_Counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "King's Counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Prosecution_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crown Prosecution Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Crown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrister", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barrister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Westminster"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Westminster"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33365450.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Huw-Edwards-Appears-In-Court-Charged-With-Making-Indecent-Pictures-Of-Children.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772866", "eventUri": "eng-9772866", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-12-", "textStart": 434, "textEnd": 447, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

said.\n\nEdwards -- a father of five who remained the national broadcaster's top-earning news anchor even after he quit in disgrace -- is charged over nearly 40 photographs he allegedly had on WhatsApp.\n\nHe potentially faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted.\n\nThe veteran journalist, 62, who quit the BBC after 40 years in April 2023, will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court in London on Wednesday morning.\n\nIf found guilty, the married father of five could receive a maximum penalty of six months in prison and an unlimited fine.\n\nEdwards was arrested on Nov. 8, 2023 and charged on June 26, 2024.\n\n\"Huw Edwards, 62, of Southwark, London has been charged with three counts of making indecent images of children following a Met Police investigation,\" a Metropolitan Police spokesman told The Post in a statement.\n\n\"The offenses, which are alleged to have taken place between December 2020 and April 2022, relate to images shared on a WhatsApp chat.\"\n\nIt comes less than a week after the BBC published their annual report, in which salaries and earnings of the network's top employees were revealed.\n\nEdwards, who topped the list for newsreaders at the corporation with a staggering $616,000 annual salary, earned a massive $51,000 pay rise last year -- despite being suspended for most of that time.\n\nThe Welsh newsreader was last year unmasked by his wife Vicky Flind as the mystery broadcaster who allegedly paid more than $45,000 to a teenager for sexually explicit photos.\n\nIn a statement issued on Edwards' behalf to the UK Press Association, Flind said, \"In light of the recent reporting regarding the 'BBC Presenter' I am making this statement on behalf of my husband Huw Edwards, after what have been five extremely difficult days for our family.\"\n\n\"I am doing this primarily out of concern for his mental well-being and to protect our children,\" she said in July 2023.\n\nEdwards, who joined the BBC in 1984, has been the face of its news broadcasts for several years.\n\nDuring his time fronting the network's \"News At Ten\" for 20 years, Edwards' high-profile coverage included a slew of landmark royal events such as the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, the funeral of Prince Philip, the death and state funeral of Elizabeth II and the coronation of Charles III and Camilla.", "source": {"uri":

Edwards admits having images of children as young as seven", "body": "Westminster Magistrates' Court heard Edwards was sent hundreds of sexual images on WhatsApp.\n\nFormer BBC presenter Huw Edwards has admitted accessing indecent photographs of children as young as seven after a man he met online sent him hundreds of sexual images on WhatsApp.\n\nWestminster Magistrates' Court was told seven of the 41 indecent images sent to the veteran broadcaster by the unnamed male were of the most serious type.\n\nThe final indecent image was sent in August 2021, a category A film featuring a young boy, with the man telling the newsreader the child was \"quite young looking\" and that he had more images which were illegal.\n\nHe appeared nervous, fidgeting with his hands as Chief Magistrate Paul Goldspring told him he would not be sentencing him on Wednesday.\n\nThe court heard that Edwards had been involved in online chat with an adult man on WhatsApp between December 2020 and August 2021, who sent him 377 sexual images, of which 41 were indecent images of children.\n\nThe bulk of these, 36, were sent during a two-month period.\n\nOn February 2 2021, the male asked whether what he was sending was too young, to which Edwards told him not to send any underage images, the court heard.\n\nThe indecent images that were sent included seven category A, the worst, 12 category B, and 22 category C.\n\nOf the category A images, the estimated age of most of the children was between 13 and 15, but one was aged between seven and nine, the court was told.\n\nNo more indecent images more were sent after August 2021, but the pair continued to exchange legal pornographic images until April 2022.\n\n\"It is important also to remember for context that devices, Mr Edwards' devices, have been seized, have been searched, and there's nothing in those devices.\n\n\"It is only the images that are the subject of the charges that came via a WhatsApp chat.\n\n\"Mr Edwards did not keep any images, did not send any to anyone else and did not and has not sought similar images from anywhere else.\"\n\nMr Evans said the defendant had \"both mental and physical\" health issues.\n\nHe told the court: \"It is obvious to the court, I'm sure, that Mr Edwards was not just of good character, but of exceptional character.\"\n\nThe broadcaster was emotionless as he pleaded guilty to three counts of making indecent images of children.\n\nAfter admitting the charges, he sat staring into the distance, with his head tilted slightly upwards.\n\nHe adjusted his tie as Ian Hope, prosecuting, laid out the case against him.\n\nSetting out the potential penalties under the law, he said that where there is the prospect of rehabilitation a community order and sexual offender treatment programme could be considered as alternatives to a custodial sentence.\n\nSentencing guidelines set the starting point for any jail term for possession of a Category A image at 12 months, with a range of 26 weeks to three years.\n\nThe starting point is 26 weeks for a category B image, and a community order for category C, he said.\n\nAggravating features to be taken into account for Edwards include that the images included moving images, and the young age of the child thought to be seven to nine years old in two of the category A images.\n\nMitigating factors are Edwards' early guilty plea, his previous good character, his mental health issues and what Mr Hope said is \"genuine remorse\".\n\nHe faced a barrage of cameras and photographers as he left court, but made no comment as he departed in a black Mercedes with tinted windows.\n\nClaire Brinton, from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), said: \"Accessing indecent images of underage people perpetuates the sexual exploitation of children, which has deep, long-lasting trauma on these victims.\n\n\"The CPS and the Metropolitan Police were able to prove that Edwards was receiving illegal material involving children via WhatsApp.\n\n\"This prosecution sends a clear message that the CPS, working alongside with the police, will work to bring to justice those who seek to exploit children, wherever that abuse takes place.\"\n\nEdwards will be appear at the same court again on September 16.", "source": {"uri": "guernseypress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Guernsey Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

aged between seven and 14, Westminster Magistrates' Court heard this morning.\n\nThe veteran news broadcaster, who announced the death of Queen Elizabeth II and presented coverage of her funeral had a

The veteran broadcaster admitted having 41 on WhatsApp, including seven of the most serious type.\n\nWestminster Magistrates' Court heard the offences were committed between December 2020 and August 2021. Wearing a dark suit, blue tie and sunglasses, the 62-year-old spoke to confirm his name, date of birth, address and his guilty pleas at the start of the hearing on Wednesday.\n\nHe was emotionless as he pleaded guilty. After admitting the charges, he sat staring into the distance, with his head tilted slightly upwards. He adjusted his tie as Ian Hope, prosecuting, laid out the case against him.\n\nThe court heard that Edwards had been involved in online chat with an adult man on WhatsApp between December 2020 and August 2021, who sent him 377 sexual images, of which 41 were indecent images of children. The bulk of these, 36, were sent during a two-month period.\n\nOn February 2, 2021, the male asked whether what he was sending was too young, in response to which Mr Edwards told him not to send any underage images, the court heard. The indecent images that were sent included seven category A, the worst, 12 category B, and 22 category C.\n\nOf the category A images, the estimated age of most of the children was between 13 and 15, but one was age between seven and nine, the court was told. The final indecent image was sent in August 2021, a category A film featuring a young boy.\n\nThe man told Edwards that the boy was quite young-looking and that he had more images which were illegal. Mr Edwards told him not to send any illegal images, the court was told. No more were sent, and the pair continued to exchange legal pornographic images until April 2022.\n\nSpeaking in Edwards' defence, his barrister Philip Evans KC said: \"There's no suggestion in this case that Mr Edwards has... in the traditional sense of the word, created any image of any sort. It is important also to remember for context that devices, Mr Edwards' devices, have been seized, have been searched, and there's nothing in those devices.\n\n\"It is only the images that are the subject of the charges that came via a WhatsApp chat. Mr Edwards did not keep any images, did not send any to anyone else and did not and has not sought similar images from anywhere else.\"\n\nEdwards will be sentenced at Westminster Magistrates' Court on September 16. Edwards stood in the dock as Chief Magistrate Paul Goldspring addressed him on his bail conditions.\n\nEdwards appeared nervous, fidgeting with his hands, before confirming that he understood the conditions. He then left the courtroom. The hearing lasted 26 minutes in total.", "source": {"uri": "gloucestershirelive.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gloucestershire Live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steven_smith@gloucestershirelive.co.uk", "name": "Steven Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huw_Edwards", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Huw Edwards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_pornography", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Child pornography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_Magistrates'_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Westminster Magistrates' Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King's_Counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "King's Counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrister", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barrister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pornography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magistrate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Magistrate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.bristolpost.co.uk/incoming/article9448966.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS340879836.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772866", "eventUri": "eng-9772866", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-16", "textStart": 2399, "textEnd": 2411}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-12-", "textStart": 263, "textEnd": 276, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

It was reported by the BBC that in April 2023, the parents of a young person contacted South Wales Police and \"the force said their information related to 'the welfare of an adult' and that 'no criminality was identified'.\"\n\nThis was followed by a family member launching a complaint against a BBC presenter and a 29-minute phone call to the broadcaster. Director general Tim Davie has said that it \"was very serious\".\n\nOn 7 July 2023, The Sun first published the story about a mother claiming that an unnamed BBC presenter had sent her child \"tens of thousands of pounds\" in exchange for explicit pictures over the course of a three year period. This reportedly began when the child was 17-years-old.\n\nOn 9 July 2023, the BBC announced that they had \"suspended a male staff member\" and on 12 July, Huw's wife Vicky Flind publicly named him as the presenter in question. According to her, she did so \"primarily out of concern for his mental well-being\" and in an attempt to \"protect\" the couple's five children.\n\nVicky's statement in full was: \"In light of the recent reporting regarding the 'BBC Presenter' I am making this statement on behalf of my husband Huw Edwards, after what have been five extremely difficult days for our family.\n\nI am doing this primarily out of concern for his mental well-being and to protect our children.\n\nHuw is suffering from serious mental health issues. As is well documented, he has been treated for severe depression in recent years.\n\nThe events of the last few days have greatly worsened matters, he has suffered another serious episode and is now receiving in-patient hospital care where he'll stay for the foreseeable future.\n\nOnce well enough to do so, he intends to respond to the stories that have been published.\n\nTo be clear Huw was first told that there were allegations being made against him last Thursday.\n\nIn the circumstances and given Huw's condition I would like to ask that the privacy of my family and everyone else caught up in these upsetting events is respected.\n\nI know that Huw is deeply sorry that so many colleagues have been impacted by the recent media speculation.\n\nWe hope this statement will bring that to an end.\"\n\nIt didn't it. On 22 April 2024, Huw resigned from his role at the BBC after 40 years on \"medical advice\". He appeared in court on 31 July 2024, where he \"pleaded guilty to three counts of making indecent images of children\".\n\nDaily Star has reported that out of the 377 sexual images he was sent over WhatsApp, 41 were indecent images of children with 36 of them being sent within a two month period. \"On February 2021, the man asked whether the images of children he was sending Edwards were too young. Edwards replied telling him not to send any underage images, the court heard.\"\n\n\"The indecent images that were sent included category A, the worst, 12 category B, and 22 category C. For the category A images, the estimated age of most of the children is between 13 and 15, with one aged between seven and nine, the court heard.\"\n\nAccording to reports, the final indecent image, which was sent to Huw in August 2021, was \"was a category A film featuring a young boy\".\n\nHave you joined Threads?

Nothing should be published, including on social media, which could prejudice future court proceedings.\"\n\nThe scandal around Edwards erupted last year in June, when British media reports suggested that the presenter spent around $45,000 on soliciting sexually explicit images from a minor before sharing them in a private WhatsApp chat.\n\nThe case against the presenter reportedly involves at least 37 images of varying degrees of indecency, including six category A images -the most extreme variant- recovered from his phone.

The veteran broadcaster admitted having 41 on WhatsApp, including seven of the most serious type.\n\nWestminster Magistrates' Court heard the offences were committed between December 2020 and August 2021. Wearing a dark suit, blue tie and sunglasses, the 62-year-old spoke to confirm his name, date of birth, address and his guilty pleas at the start of the hearing on Wednesday.\n\nHe was emotionless as he pleaded guilty. After admitting the charges, he sat staring into the distance, with his head tilted slightly upwards. He adjusted his tie as Ian Hope, prosecuting, laid out the case against him.\n\nThe court heard that Edwards had been involved in online chat with an adult man on WhatsApp between December 2020 and August 2021, who sent him 377 sexual images, of which 41 were indecent images of children. The bulk of these, 36, were sent during a two-month period.\n\nOn February 2, 2021, the male asked whether what he was sending was too young, in response to which Mr Edwards told him not to send any underage images, the court heard. The indecent images that were sent included seven category A, the worst, 12 category B, and 22 category C.\n\nOf the category A images, the estimated age of most of the children was between 13 and 15, but one was age between seven and nine, the court was told. The final indecent image was sent in August 2021, a category A film featuring a young boy.\n\nThe man told Edwards that the boy was quite young-looking and that he had more images which were illegal. Mr Edwards told him not to send any illegal images, the court was told. No more were sent, and the pair continued to exchange legal pornographic images until April 2022.\n\nSpeaking in Edwards' defence, his barrister Philip Evans KC said: \"There's no suggestion in this case that Mr Edwards has... in the traditional sense of the word, created any image of any sort. It is important also to remember for context that devices, Mr Edwards' devices, have been seized, have been searched, and there's nothing in those devices.\n\n\"It is only the images that are the subject of the charges that came via a WhatsApp chat. Mr Edwards did not keep any images, did not send any to anyone else and did not and has not sought similar images from anywhere else.\"\n\nMr Evans said the broadcaster had \"both mental and physical\" health issues.\n\nHe told the court: \"It is obvious to the court, I'm sure, that Mr Edwards was not just of good character, but of exceptional character.\"\n\nMr Evans said the court was aware of issues with Edwards' health - \"both mental and physical\".\n\nProsecutor Mr Hope told the court that a suspended sentence might be considered for Edwards. Setting out the potential penalties under the law, he said that where there is the prospect of rehabilitation a community order and sexual offender treatment programme could be considered as alternatives to a custodial sentence.\n\nSentencing guidelines set the starting point for any jail term for possession of a Category A image at 12 months, with a range of 26 weeks to three years. The starting point is 26 weeks for a category B image, and a community order for category C, he said.\n\nAggravating features to be taken into account for Edwards include that the images included moving images and the young age of the child thought to be seven to nine years old in two of the category A images. Mitigating factors are Edwards' early guilty plea, his previous good character, his mental health issues and what Mr Hope said is \"genuine remorse\".\n\nEdwards was bailed and will be sentenced at Westminster Magistrates' Court on September 16. He stood in the dock as Chief Magistrate Paul Goldspring addressed him on his bail conditions.\n\nEdwards appeared nervous, fidgeting with his hands, before confirming that he understood the conditions. He then left the courtroom. The hearing lasted 26 minutes in total.\n\nEdwards faced a barrage of cameras and photographers as he left court. He departed in a black Mercedes with tinted windows without making any comment.", "source": {"uri": "plymouthherald.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Plymouth Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steven_smith@plymouthherald.co.uk", "name": "Steven Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huw_Edwards", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Huw Edwards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_pornography", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Child pornography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_Magistrates'_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Westminster Magistrates' Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King's_Counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "King's Counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrister", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barrister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listed_building", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Listed building"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pornography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitigating_factor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mitigating factor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehabilitation_(penology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rehabilitation (penology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_offender", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sex offender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspended_sentence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suspended sentence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Community service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magistrate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Magistrate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://i2-prod.bristolpost.co.uk/incoming/article9448966.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS340879836.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772866", "eventUri": "eng-9772866", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-16", "textStart": 3663, "textEnd": 3675}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-12-", "textStart": 263, "textEnd": 276, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Speaking after this morning's hearing Claire Brinton from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said: \"Accessing indecent images of underage people perpetuates the sexual exploitation of children, which has deep, long-lasting trauma on these victims.\n\n\"The CPS and the Metropolitan Police were able to prove that Edwards was receiving illegal material involving children via WhatsApp. This prosecution sends a clear message that the CPS, working alongside with the police, will work to bring to justice those who seek to exploit children, wherever that abuse takes place.\"\n\nInternet Watch Foundation deputy CEO Heidi Kempster said: \"There can be no excuse. This is criminal material, including images depicting the most extreme category of sexual abuse, which have real and lasting effects on victims.\n\n\"A child's journey to recovery can be dealt a devastating blow when they know images of their abuse continue to be circulated online for others to view. We urge any children or young people worried imagery of themselves may get out of control to use the confidential Report Remove tool run by the IWF and Childline so we can help take down and block this material from being shared on the wider internet.\"\n\nWant more court and crime news?

Coronation in 2023.\n\nEdwards spent almost four decades at the BBC, originally spending 12 years as a parliamentary correspondent for BBC Wales before he was elevated to the host of the Six O'Clock

Edwards admits having indecent images of kids...", "body": "Disgraced BBC News anchor Huw Edwards has pleaded guilty to possessing child pornography, including one image of a child believed to be as young as 7 years old.\n\nThe former host of the BBC's flagship \"News at Ten\" program -- and one of the most recognizable faces on British TV -- hid his face behind a pair of blacked-out shades as he arrived at Westminster Magistrates Court in London on Wednesday.\n\nThe veteran journalist, 62, who quit the BBC after 40 years in April 2023, admitted to possessing 41 indecent images, seven of which are Category A -- the most serious offense.\n\nThe category A images were mostly of children aged 13 to 15, the court heard.\n\nThe married father-of-five, who wore a dark blue suit, light blue shirt and white shirt, also pleaded guilty to possessing 12 Category B images and 22 Category C images.\n\nHowever, there were two moving images of a young child believed to be between 7 and 9 years old, prosecutors said.\n\nEdwards -- who remained the national broadcaster's top-earning news anchor even after he quit in disgrace -- confirmed his name, address, and date of birth in a loud clear voice ahead of the 26-minute hearing.\n\nThe court heard that Edwards and another adult man -- who was not identified -- had been messaging via WhatsApp between Dec. 2020 and Aug. 2021.\n\nDuring that time, Edwards received a total of 377 sexual images, 41 of which were indecent images of minors -- the bulk of which was sent in a two-month period.\n\nIn Feb. 2021, the man asked Edwards whether the minors in the images he was sending were too young, to which the disgraced anchor responded by telling him not to send anything illegal.\n\nThe two men continued to exchange pornographic material until April 2022, the court heard.\n\nEdwards' defense lawyer, Philip Evans KC, said there was no suggestion that the ex-BBC presenter had made or created any of the images.\n\nEvans added that Edwards did not keep or send the images on his device.\n\n\"There's no suggestion in this case that Mr Edwards has... in the traditional sense of the word, created any image of any sort,\" he told the court Wednesday.\n\n\"It is important also to remember for context that devices, Mr Edwards' devices, have been seized, have been searched, and there's nothing in those devices.\"\n\n\"It is only the images that are the subject of the charges that came via a WhatsApp chat,\" he continued.\n\n\"Mr Edwards did not keep any images, did not send any to anyone else, and did not and has not sought similar images from anywhere else.\"\n\nAccording to the UK's Crown Prosecution Service, the term \"making\" can include opening, accessing, downloading and storing the content on a device.\n\nIt comes less than a week after the BBC published their annual report, in which salaries and earnings of the network's top employees were revealed.\n\nEdwards, who topped the list for newsreaders at the corporation with a staggering $616,000 annual salary, earned a massive $51,000 pay raise last year -- despite being suspended for most of that time.\n\nThe Welsh anchor was unmasked by his wife Vicky Flind last year as the mystery broadcaster who allegedly paid more than $45,000 to a teenager for sexually explicit photos.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"},

had more images which were illegal.\n\nEdwards told him not to send any illegal images, the court was told in a 26-minute hearing.\n\nHe appeared nervous, fidgeting with his hands as Chief Magistrate Paul Goldspring told him he would not be sentencing him on Wednesday.\n\nThe court heard that Edwards had been involved in online chat with an adult man on WhatsApp between December 2020 and August 2021, who sent him 377 sexual images, of which 41 were indecent images of children.\n\nThe bulk of these, 36, were sent during a two-month period.\n\nOn February 2 2021, the male asked whether what he was sending was too young, to which Edwards told him not to send any underage images, the court heard.\n\nThe indecent images that were sent included seven category A, the worst, 12 category B, and 22 category C.\n\nOf the category A images, the estimated age of most of the children was between 13 and 15, but one was aged between seven and nine, the court was told.\n\nNo more indecent images more were sent after August 2021, but the pair continued to exchange legal pornographic images until April 2022.\n\nSpeaking in Edwards' defence, his barrister Philip Evans KC said: \"There's no suggestion in this case that Mr Edwards has... in the traditional sense of the word, created any image of any sort.\n\n\"It is important also to remember for context that devices, Mr Edwards' devices, have been seized, have been searched, and there's nothing in those devices.\n\n\"It is only the images that are the subject of the charges that came via a WhatsApp chat.\n\n\"Mr Edwards did not keep any images, did not send any to anyone else and did not and has not sought similar images from anywhere else.\"\n\nMr Evans said the defendant had \"both mental and physical\" health issues.\n\nHe told the court: \"It is obvious to the court, I'm sure, that Mr Edwards was not just of good character, but of exceptional character.\"\n\nThe broadcaster was emotionless as he pleaded guilty to three counts of making indecent images of children.\n\nAfter admitting the charges, he sat staring into the distance, with his head tilted slightly upwards.\n\nHe adjusted his tie as Ian Hope, prosecuting, laid out the case against him.\n\nMr Hope told the court that a suspended sentence might be considered for Edwards.\n\nSetting out the potential penalties under the law, he said that where there is the prospect of rehabilitation a community order and sexual offender treatment programme could be considered as alternatives to a custodial sentence.\n\nSentencing guidelines set the starting point for any jail term for possession of a Category A image at 12 months, with a range of 26 weeks to three years.\n\nThe starting point is 26 weeks for a category B image, and a community order for category C, he said.\n\nAggravating features to be taken into account for Edwards include that the images included moving images, and the young age of the child thought to be seven to nine years old in two of the category A images.\n\nMitigating factors are Edwards' early guilty plea, his previous good character, his mental health issues and what Mr Hope said is \"genuine remorse\".\n\nHe faced a barrage of cameras and photographers as he left court, but made no comment as he departed in a black Mercedes with tinted windows.\n\nClaire Brinton, from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), said: \"Accessing indecent images of underage people perpetuates the sexual exploitation of children, which has deep, long-lasting trauma on these victims.\n\n\"The CPS and the Metropolitan Police were able to prove that Edwards was receiving illegal material involving children via WhatsApp.\n\n\"This prosecution sends a clear message that the CPS, working alongside with the police, will work to bring to justice those who seek to exploit children, wherever that abuse takes place.\"\n\nEdwards will be appear at the same court again on September 16.", "source": {"uri": "bridportnews.co.uk", "dataType":

Huw Edwards, one of the most recognisable faces on UK television, pleaded guilty Wednesday to three counts of making indecent images of children.\n\nThe 62-year-old -- who resigned from the BBC in April on \"medical advice\", six months after he was arrested -- faces a maximum prison sentence of 10 years and a minimum of 12 months.\n\nWearing a dark suit and blue tie, Edwards sat impassively during the 25-minute court hearing as he admitted receiving 41 indecent images of children on WhatsApp, including seven of the most serious type.\n\nUnder English law, electronic communications involving indecent imagery of children -- including receiving and downloading pictures and videos -- can constitute the offence of making indecent images of children.\n\nThe crimes involving Edwards occurred between December 2020 and August 2021, amended from the initial chargesheet which ran to April 2022.\n\nWestminster Magistrates' Court in London heard that the former TV anchor had received 377 sexual images from a man he met online, of which 41 were indecent images of children.\n\n\"These images appear to have been received with approval,\" prosecutor Ian Hope told the court.\n\nOf the gravest, the estimated age of most of the children was 13 to 15, but one was aged between seven and nine, he noted.\n\nEdwards had been told that the male in the \"moving film\" was \"quite young looking\" and that he could be sent more that were \"illegal\".\n\nAlthough the ex-presenter received that film, he told the man not to send any illegal images, the court heard.\n\n- 'Serious issues' -\n\nEdwards's lawyer, Philip Evans, said that his client's devices had been seized and that it was clear he had not made or shared the images.\n\n\"There's no suggestion in this case that Mr Edwards has... in the traditional sense of the word, created any image of any sort,\" Evans told the court.\n\nHe added that the defendant was of \"good character\" and that \"there are serious issues in relation to Mr Edwards's health both mental and physical\".\n\nChief magistrate Paul Goldspring released Edwards on conditional bail until his next hearing on September 16, when he could be sentenced.\n\nGoldspring ordered probation services to draw up a report, telling Edwards he needed \"to read more about you\" before sentencing.\n\n\"I'm asking the probation service to look at this case, with genuinely all options open,\" the magistrate said.\n\nHope had earlier told the court that a suspended sentence might be appropriate, if paired with a community order and a sexual offender treatment programme.\n\nEdwards, the BBC's lead presenter on key events such as the death and funeral of Queen Elizabeth II, was suspended in July 2023 when allegations first emerged.\n\nHe had also been the anchor of the BBC's flagship 10:00 pm news programme since 2003.\n\nHe quit on April 22 after 40 years with the broadcaster.\n\nAs the accusations became front-page news last July, Edwards's wife Vicky Flind said the father of five was \"suffering from serious mental health issues\" and had been admitted to hospital.\n\nEdwards himself has not publicly commented on the allegations.\n\nThe BBC's brand has been built on public trust but the broadcaster has been rocked in recent years by scandals which saw some big names revealed as serial sex offenders.", "source": {"uri":

The veteran broadcaster admitted having 41 on WhatsApp, including seven of the most serious type.\n\nWestminster Magistrates' Court heard the offences were committed between December 2020 and August 2021. Wearing a dark suit, blue tie and sunglasses, the 62-year-old spoke to confirm his name, date of birth, address and his guilty pleas at the start of the hearing on Wednesday.\n\nHe was emotionless as he pleaded guilty. After admitting the charges, he sat staring into the distance, with his head tilted slightly upwards. He adjusted his tie as Ian Hope, prosecuting, laid out the case against him.\n\nThe court heard that Edwards had been involved in online chat with an adult man on WhatsApp between December 2020 and August 2021, who sent him 377 sexual images, of which 41 were indecent images of children. The bulk of these, 36, were sent during a two-month period.\n\nOn February 2, 2021, the male asked whether what he was sending was too young, in response to which Mr Edwards told him not to send any underage images, the court heard. The indecent images that were sent included seven category A, the worst, 12 category B, and 22 category C.\n\nOf the category A images, the estimated age of most of the children was between 13 and 15, but one was age between seven and nine, the court was told.

Vicky Flind to another part of the capital.\n\nThe ex-News at Ten anchor has been splitting his time between a home in Wandsworth, south-west London, and his native Wales.\n\nHis new London home was revealed on Tuesday afternoon when his new address appeared on court documents.\n\nEdwards is due at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Wednesday on charges of possessing indecent images and was listed at the Wandsworth address on the official court documents.\n\nThe veteran TV host is not yet thought to have divorced from Ms Flind, a TV producer two years his junior who has worked on shows including ITV's Peston and BBC One's This Week.\n\nThe couple, who got engaged in 1993, have three sons and two daughters.\n\nA source said: \"They separated quite a long time ago but have not announced it publicly.\n\n\"Huw has been living elsewhere for a while.\"\n\nEdwards and Ms Flind are said to have met when he was 30 - and working as a BBC correspondent in Westminster - and she was 28.\n\nBut they started dating later, when Edwards invited Ms Flind on a skiing trip after a friend pulled out.\n\nEdwards - who resigned from the BBC in April after a career spanning almost 40 years - is due to face charges he made 37 indecent images of children.\n\nHe has been hit with three charges, covering the period from December 2020 to April 2022, over images allegedly shared on WhatsApp.\n\nSix of the indecent images Edwards is accused of making are Category A - the worst type - while 12 are Category B and 19 are allegedly Category C.\n\nEdwards - who could face a jail term

Sun contacted the Met and CPS on Monday.\n\nMeanwhile, it was claimed that BBC bosses were \"blindsided\" by news of the criminal charges.\n\nInsiders said senior management were unaware of the charges - and members of staff were rocked by the revelations.\n\nEdwards joined the BBC as a news trainee in 1984 before becoming a parliamentary correspondent two years later.\n\nHis big break came in 1994 when he became presenter of the BBC Six O'Clock News.\n\nHe moved to News at Ten in 2003 and later hosted elections and state occasions including the funerals of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince

We are shocked and saddened by the recent developments.\"\n\nEdwards also made documentaries for the BBC including Wales: Who Do We Think We Are? and talked about his depression on S4C's Huw Edwards Is 60.\n\nIn a documentary in 2021, Edwards revealed he has had bouts of depression over the last two decades which have left him \"bedridden\".\n\n\"Like everyone that suffers with depression, you don't get one bout of it. It comes and goes,\" he said.\n\n\"For me, it started around 2002 I think. I went down fairly quickly and I couldn't understand it.\"\n\nSpeaking on a podcast hosted by Jane Garvey and Fi Glover, Fortunately... With Fi And Jane, Edwards said he decided to share publicly that he has depression as he felt it was \"complete hypocrisy\" to support organisations such as the Shawmind Foundation or Mind without explaining why.\n\n\"I also felt that it might be someway helpful to people if I opened up about it and say 'You can do a job and you can be successful', whether it's just reading a bit of autocue or doing whatever it is... while also dealing with issues like that,\" he told the podcast.", "source": {"uri": "irvinetimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irvine Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

He is often referred to as the \"face of historic events\" due to his role as a newsreader and presenter for major events and significant moments in British history.\n\nBorn on August 18, 1961, in Bridgend, Wales, Huw Edwards joined the BBC in 1984 as a news trainee and quickly rose through the ranks. He became a regular presenter on BBC News and has since become one of the most recognisable and respected newsreaders in the United Kingdom.\n\nAlso Read | Alarming warning from WHO: Bird flu poses increased risk of adapting to humans\n\nHuw Edwards is also known for his calm and authoritative delivery style, which has made him a trusted figure in broadcasting. He has covered numerous important events, including elections, royal weddings, state funerals, and major national and international news stories.\n\nIn addition to news reading, Huw Edwards has presented several BBC programmes, including the documentary series \"The Story of Wales.\" He has also been involved in the coverage of significant events such as the Olympic Games and the Proms, a renowned classical music festival in the UK.\n\nAlso Read | India backs Pakistan's resolution at UN condemning Quran burning protests\n\nMost recently before the sex scandal row, Huw Edwards was a prominent figure on the BBC, serving as the main presenter of the BBC News at Ten, the network's flagship evening news programme.

In 2017, when the BBC was required by the parliament to disclose the salaries of its top presenters, it was revealed that Edwards earned \u00a3550,000 ($716,023). Due to public scrutiny over the BBC's expenditure on talent and the gender pay gap among its stars, Edwards decided to take a pay cut.\n\nDuring an interview with BBC Radio Cymru in 2021, Edwards hinted that his tenure as the BBC's chief news anchor may be coming to an end due to the demands of the role.\n\n\"The nightly news business, after 20 years, that can be taxing, even though I still enjoy the job,\" he said. \"But I don't think I'll be doing that for long...

It comes and goes,\" he said.\n\n\"For me, it started around 2002 I think. I went down fairly quickly and I couldn't understand it.\"\n\nSpeaking on a podcast hosted by Jane Garvey and Fi Glover, Fortunately... With Fi And Jane, Edwards said he decided to share publicly that he has depression as he felt it was \"complete hypocrisy\" to support organisations such as the Shawmind Foundation or Mind without explaining why.\n\n\"I also felt that it might be someway helpful to people if I opened up about it and say, 'You can do a job and you can be successful', whether it's just reading a bit of autocue or doing whatever it is... while also dealing with issues like that,\" he told the podcast.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

It is the first time the Welsh journalist has been seen publicly since July 2023. He was arrested in November 2023 and officially resigned from the BBC in April 2024.\n\nThe offences, which are alleged to have taken place between December 2020 and April 2022, relate to images shared on a WhatsApp chat. Edwards is accused of having six category A images, 12 category B images and 19 category C images. If found guilty, he could receive a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine.\n\nREAD MORE: Huw Edwards pleads guilty to all child sex offence charges against him\n\nREAD MORE: Prince William and Prince Harry suffer heart-breaking loss as uncle dies\n\nEdwards is best known for presenting the Six O'Clock News and was a key reporter at Prince William and Kate Middleton's wedding. He also announced Queen Elizabeth's death in 2022 and led the BBC's coverage of her funeral.\n\nEdwards is now said to have moved out of his family home in Dulwich, south London, after reportedly separating from his wife Vicky, 62. It is believed he has moved to another property in the capital and has been splitting his time between there and his native Wales. The former couple have reportedly not yet divorced. They share five grown-up children - three sons and two daughters.\n\nA source told The Sun: \"They separated quite a long time ago but have not announced it publicly. Huw has been living elsewhere for a while.\" Vicky also works in television and was previously the editor of the BBC's This Week before she moved to ITV's rival politics show, Peston, while she also worked on Britain's Next Prime Minister.\n\nThe pair are said to have met when Huw was working as a BBC correspondent in Westminster and got engaged in 1993. It was Vicky who named Huw as the man at the centre of the allegations last year in a statement issued on his behalf. She detailed his \"serious mental health issues\" and said: \"I am doing this primarily out of concern for his mental well-being and to protect our children.\"\n\nEdwards once spoke about his relationship with his kids and how he 'cracked the code' of parenting with his fifth. He told The Guardian : \"There's a principle that your youngest child gets a far better crack of the whip than your eldest.\n\n\"All your anxieties and inexperience and cluelessness as a parent are taken out on your eldest child. By the time you get to your youngest, in my case number five, you're a brilliant parent. So if you could give a parent all the patience and knowledge that they would have with their second or third child or whatever to the first, that's the one piece of advice I'd give.\"\n\nHe was passionate about teaching his children how to speak Welsh, despite his wife not speaking the language. He previously told Wales Online : \"I was able to concentrate a lot of time on my eldest two children who have got a good level of understanding in Welsh but the others less so. Three of my sons are linguists actually and I've got a daughter who is a linguist.\n\n\"Their facility to speak, pronounce and understand, it's quite good but what you won't get is a fluent conversation... They talk frequently to my mum who is back in Llanelli and they are very aware of the heritage of my dad and the fact he was such a big figure in Welsh language culture and are very proud of that.\"\n\nEdwards' father was a prominent Welsh nationalist and historian who passed away in 2010. Speaking about his turbulent relationship in a S4C documentary, Edwards said: \"We weren't that close, to be honest - not like me and mam, because dad wasn't that present when I was growing up. He could be quite sharp.\n\n\"I laugh when people tell me that Dad was full of humour and that he always had a smile on his face. I often think - what, do you live on the same planet as me? Yes, he could be very witty and he could laugh. He could be very sharp-tongued at times and if you were on the receiving end of that, it wasn't very fun.\"\n\nHuw is a religious man and devoted Christian and has always gone to church weekly to practise his faith. He was previously the Vice President of the National Churches Trust and told Sorted Magazine last year that churches \"have a vital role to play in moments of national importance; bringing people together, providing quiet spaces for reflection and prayer, and places for communities to gather and share\".\n\nBut on Tuesday, Edwards was stripped of his role at the trust. The charity, which supports the UK's churches to maintain their historic sites and buildings, said in a statement: \"In light of the news yesterday, the National Churches Trust has confirmed that Huw Edwards is no longer a Vice President for the charity. We are shocked and saddened by the recent developments.\"\n\nJoin the Irish Mirror's breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

It is the first time the Welsh journalist has been seen publicly since July 2023. He was arrested in November 2023 and officially resigned from the BBC in April 2024.\n\nThe offences, which are alleged to have taken place between December 2020 and April 2022, relate to images shared on a WhatsApp chat. Edwards is accused of having six category A images, 12 category B images and 19 category C images. If found guilty, he could receive a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine.\n\nEdwards is best known for presenting the Six O'Clock News and was a key reporter at Prince William and Kate Middleton's wedding. He also announced Queen Elizabeth's death in 2022 and led the BBC's coverage of her funeral.\n\nEdwards is now said to have moved out of his family home in Dulwich, south London, after reportedly separating from his wife Vicky, 62. It is believed he has moved to another property in the capital and has been splitting his time between there and his native Wales. The former couple have reportedly not yet divorced. They share five grown-up children - three sons and two daughters.\n\nA source told The Sun: \"They separated quite a long time ago but have not announced it publicly. Huw has been living elsewhere for a while.\" Vicky also works in television and was previously the editor of the BBC's This Week before she moved to ITV's rival politics show Peston, while she also worked on Britain's Next Prime Minister.\n\nThe pair are said to have met when Huw was working as a BBC correspondent in Westminster and got engaged in 1993. It was Vicky who named Huw as the man at the centre of the allegations last year in a statement issued on his behalf. She detailed his \"serious mental health issues\" and said: \"I am doing this primarily out of concern for his mental well-being and to protect our children.\"\n\nEdwards once spoke about his relationship with his kids and how he 'cracked the code' of parenting with his fifth. He told The Guardian: \"There's a principle that your youngest child gets a far better crack of the whip than your eldest.\n\n\"All your anxieties and inexperience and cluelessness as a parent are taken out on your eldest child. By the time you get to your youngest, in my case number five, you're a brilliant parent. So if you could give a parent all the patience and knowledge that they would have with their second or third child or whatever to the first, that's the one piece of advice I'd give.\"\n\nHe was passionate about teaching his children how to speak Welsh, despite his wife not speaking the language. He previously told Wales Online: \"I was able to concentrate a lot of time on my eldest two children who have got a good level of understanding in Welsh but the others less so. Three of my sons are linguists actually and I've got a daughter who is a linguist.\n\n\"Their facility to speak, pronounce and understand, it's quite good but what you won't get is a fluent conversation... They talk frequently to my mum who is back in Llanelli and they are very aware of the heritage of my dad and the fact he was such a big figure in Welsh language culture and are very proud of that.\"\n\nEdwards' father was a prominent Welsh nationalist and historian who passed away in 2010. Speaking about his turbulent relationship in a S4C documentary, Edwards said: \"We weren't that close, to be honest - not like me and mam, because dad wasn't that present when I was growing up. He could be quite sharp.\n\n\"I laugh when people tell me that Dad was full of humour and that he always had a smile on his face. I often think - what, do you live on the same planet as me? Yes, he could be very witty and he could laugh. He could be very sharp-tongued at times and if you were on the receiving end of that, it wasn't very fun.\"\n\nHuw is a religious man and devoted Christian and has always gone to church weekly to practise his faith. He was previously the Vice President of the National Churches Trust and told Sorted Magazine last year that churches \"have a vital role to play in moments of national importance; bringing people together, providing quiet spaces for reflection and prayer, and places for communities to gather and share\".\n\nBut on Tuesday, Edwards was stripped of his role at the trust. The charity, which supports the UK's churches to maintain their historic sites and buildings, said in a statement: \"In light of the news yesterday, the National Churches Trust has confirmed that Huw Edwards is no longer a Vice President for the charity. We are shocked and saddened by the recent developments.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nia_dalton@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Nia

It comes and goes,\" he said.\n\n\"For me, it started around 2002 I think. I went down fairly quickly and I couldn't understand it.\"\n\nSpeaking on a podcast hosted by Jane Garvey and Fi Glover, Fortunately... With Fi And Jane, Edwards said he decided to share publicly that he has depression as he felt it was \"complete hypocrisy\" to support organisations such as the Shawmind Foundation or Mind without explaining why.\n\n\"I also felt that it might be someway helpful to people if I opened up about it and say, 'You can do a job and you can be successful', whether it's just reading a bit of autocue or doing whatever it is... while also dealing with issues like that,\" he told the podcast.", "source": {"uri": "guernseypress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Guernsey Press"}, "authors": [],

So it's been at the back of my mind since then.\"\n\nThis last salary marked an increase from 2022/23, when he was paid between \u00a3435,000 and 439,999 for 180 days presenting on BBC One, as well as news specials.\n\nIn 2018, it was reported he agreed to take a pay cut following revelations over unequal pay for men and women at the BBC.\n\nEdwards said in 2021 that he was considering his future presenting News At Ten as he approached his 60th birthday.\n\n\"A time comes when you're bound to reassess what's in front of you,\" he told Radio Cymru in a Welsh-language interview.\n\n\"Now that a big milestone is here, which is 60 years old, it's natural for a man to think 'Am I going to continue in this job for another five years, or do I want to do something different?'\n\n\"The nightly news business, after 20 years, that can be taxing, even though I still enjoy the job.\n\n\"I don't think I'll be doing that for long. Because I believe that, in the first place, I think it's fair for the viewers to get a change.\n\n\"Secondly, I have co-workers who are very talented - it's time to give them a chance too.\"\n\nHe added: \"I won't disappear tomorrow from the 10 o'clock news because I'm still enjoying myself.\n\n\"But of course, I'm thinking about the working patterns of the future. And the truth is that I don't want to sustain these working patterns for a long time to come, because I don't believe it's a very wise thing at all.\"\n\nAn article on the BBC website in 2002 said Edwards was determined to stamp his own identity on News At Ten.\n\n\"You don't want to let people down, but at the same time, I want to do it in my own way. I don't want to be a clone of Sissons or Buerk,\" he said.\n\nEdwards, who attended Llanelli Grammar School and graduated in French from Cardiff University, is an honorary professor in the School of Journalism, Media and Culture at his old university.\n\nEdwards is listed as a vice president on the website of the National Churches Trust and has appeared on Songs Of Praise.\n\nHe has also made documentaries for the BBC including Wales: Who Do We Think We Are? and talked about his depression on S4C's Huw Edwards Is 60.\n\nIn a documentary in 2021, Edwards revealed he has had bouts of depression over the last two decades which have left him \"bedridden\".\n\n\"Like everyone that suffers with depression, you don't get one bout of it. It comes and goes,\" he said.\n\n\"For me, it started around 2002 I think. I went down fairly quickly and I couldn't understand it.\"\n\nSpeaking on a podcast hosted by Jane Garvey and Fi Glover, Fortunately... With Fi And Jane, he said he decided to share publicly that he has depression as he felt it was \"complete hypocrisy\" to support organisations such as the Shawmind Foundation or Mind without explaining why.\n\n\"I also felt that it might be someway helpful to people if I opened up about it and say, 'You can do a job and you can be successful', whether it's just reading a bit of autocue or doing whatever it is... while also dealing with issues like that,\" he told the podcast.", "source": {"uri": "guernseypress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Guernsey Press"}, "authors": [],

2022.\n\nAlso read British TV doctor Mosley found dead on Greek island of Symi British police get 100 million pounds to tackle knife crime surge Making a case for private prosecutions European police

children.\n\nOf the most serious images, the estimated age of most of the children was between 13 and 15, but one was aged between seven and nine, the court was told.\n\nEdwards had told the man not to send any illegal images, the court heard.\n\nHe was released on conditional bail until his next hearing on September 16, when he could be sentenced.\n\nEdwards was the BBC's lead presenter on key events, such as the death and funeral of Queen Elizabeth II, but was suspended in July 2023 when allegations first emerged.\n\nHe had also been the anchor of the BBC's flagship 10:00 pm news programme since 2003.\n\nHe quit on April 22 after 40 years with the broadcaster.\n\nAs the accusations became front-page news last July, Edwards's wife Vicky Flind said the father-of-five was \"suffering from serious mental health issues\" and had been admitted to hospital.\n\nEdwards himself has not publicly commented on the allegations.\n\nThe BBC's brand has been built on public trust but the broadcaster has been rocked in recent years by scandals which saw some big names revealed as serial sex offenders.", "source": {"uri": "gulfnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GULF NEWS"},

A spokesperson said the corporation was \"shocked\" to hear of the details that emerged in court on Wednesday and that Edwards was no longer a BBC employee when he was charged, having resigned two months earlier. Read the full statement below.\n\nPreviously: Huw Edwards has pled guilty to three charges of making indecent images of children during his first appearance in a U.K. court.\n\nMore from Variety\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Edwards appeared at Westminster Magistrates Court in London to acknowledge the charges before Chief Magistrate Paul Goldspring and a packed press gallery.\n\nThe former BBC news anchor, who was once one of the highest paid figures at the BBC, showed no emotion as he was led through Courtroom 1 and into the glass-panelled dock, dressed in a dark suit, white shirt and blue tie. While he entered the courthouse in dark sunglasses, he had removed these before entering the court.\n\nEdwards spoke only to give his name, date of birth and his partial U.K. address, to enter his plea for each charge and to confirm he understood the bail conditions. His counsel requested that, in contravention of U.K. court tradition, Edwards should not read out his full address due to the \"volatile\" situation outside the court which included protests.\n\nThe prosecutor explained how the images were sent to him via WhatsApp by \"an adult man who contacted Mr Edwards on social media.\" They were automatically saved to his phone. Edwards asked the WhatsApp sender to stop sending \"illegal\" images of underage children. The chat continued thereafter with \"further legal pornographic images\" being sent.\n\nThe charges related to 41 images and videos that were shared on the messaging site between 2020 and 2022. Six of those were Category A, considered the most serious.\n\nThe maximum sentence is 10 years in prison.\n\nThe sentencing has been adjourned until September for a pre-sentence report. In the meantime, Edwards has been released on conditional bail.\n\nHis lawyer told the court in mitigation that Edwards was a man \"not only of good character but of exemplary character.\" He also added there were mental health issues at play \"at the time of the offending and now.\" The lawyer was also keen to emphasize that Edwards had not \"made\" any images or videos in the \"traditional\" sense.\n\nThe news anchor, who had spent 40 years at the BBC, resigned in April citing medical advice. He had been on a 10-month absence of leave after a tabloid newspaper revealed a senior presenter at the BBC had been involved in a sex photo scandal. Although Edwards was not initially named, after rumors reached fever pitch his wife made a statement confirming the BBC anchor was implicated and had checked into a hospital for mental health treatment.\n\nRead the BBC's full statement below:\n\nThe BBC is shocked to hear the details which have emerged in court today. There can be no place for such abhorrent behaviour and our thoughts are with all those affected.\n\nThe police have confirmed that the charges are not connected to the original complaint raised with the BBC in the summer of 2023, nevertheless in the interests of transparency we think it important to set out some points about events of the last year.\n\nIn November 2023, whilst Mr Edwards was suspended, the BBC as his employer at the time was made aware in confidence that he had been arrested on suspicion of serious offences and released on bail whilst the police continued their investigation. At the time, no charges had been brought against Mr Edwards and the BBC had also been made aware of significant risk to his health.\n\nToday we have learnt of the conclusion of the police process in the details as presented to the court. If at any point during the period Mr Edwards was employed by the BBC he had been charged, the BBC had determined it would act immediately to dismiss him. In the end, at the point of charge he was no longer an employee of the BBC.\n\nDuring this period, in the usual way, the BBC has kept its corporate management of these issues separate from its independent editorial functions.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huw_Edwards", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Huw Edwards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_presenter", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "News presenter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_Magistrates'_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Westminster Magistrates' Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_pornography", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Child pornography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magistrate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Magistrate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pornography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabloid_(newspaper_format)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tabloid (newspaper format)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/variety.com/f3e0b90ac893c19be1a02c001a43ae38", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772866", "eventUri": "eng-9772866", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 460136821, "relevance": 2}

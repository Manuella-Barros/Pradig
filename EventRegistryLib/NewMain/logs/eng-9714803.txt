Beyond blessed.\"\n\nBut who is the WAG, who has been keeping the winger company while he's dropped from the Euros as England reach the semi-finals. Here's all you need to know...\n\nModel behaviour\n\nWhile Jack has been making headlines on the pitch - as well as off them when he was dropped by Gareth Southgate from the England team this summer - Sasha has been forging her own career path. She was reportedly scouted by a modelling agent ahed 13 while out on a shopping trip with her mum in Birmingham.\n\nAccording to her Instagram, the mum-to-be is represented by Elite Model World and and Jadore Models Manchester. Sasha, who goes by Sasha Rebecca on social media, has modelled from brands such as Boohoo, Lipsy and GHD. When she's not cheering on her boyfriend on the sidelines, the Brummie also has a popular YouTube channel where she uploads beauty routines and style guides.\n\nCheating rumours\n\nJack was accused of cheating on Sasha in 2021 after The Sun reported he had been hooking up with Inbetweeners star, Emily Atack, and Love Islander Amber Gill - something he categorically denied, as did Amber.\n\nReports suggested that Emily had no idea he was involved with his childhood sweetheart, Sasha - while other reports suggested he had appeared on a dating app, thereby reasonably leading women to believe he was unattached.\n\nEmily remained silent, but did unfollow Jack on social media. The fracas resulted in Sasha allegedly giving the Man City star an ultimatum and the pair splitting briefly.\n\nDuring the drama, Jack attempted to silence the rumours about his love life and alleged cheating. Taking aim at headlines, the star wrote on Instagram : \"Please don't believe everything you read in the newspapers\" alongside a smiling emoji and handshake emoji\n\nHowever, his denial didn't stop reality star Amber being branded a 'homewrecker' as rumours of a romance between her and the Man City star continued to circulate.\n\nThe Love Island winner had reportedly enjoyed a string of secret dates with the footballer. However, Amber shared an impassioned video on her Instagram Stories where she denied dating Jack and claimed that the rumours had 'ruined' her real relationship.\n\nShe fumed: \"Any relationships that I've got going on or any dating get ruined immediately by people going 'This is who she's dating now' and I'm like 'Hold on, am I?' You wanted to know who I was really dating. You'll never find out because of this kind of s**t everyday. Stop lying!\"\n\n'Blessed' with a baby\n\nThree years after the cheating rumours, Jack and Sasha announced they are expecting their first child together. The footballer broke the news on his Instagram account on Sunday, sharing a picture of himself hugging his girlfriend, with both of their hands over her blossoming bump.\n\nJack captioned the snap: \"Life's biggest blessing.\" Sasha shared the same picture on her account, captioning her post: \"Half of me , half of you - beyond blessed.\"\n\nResponding to the happy news, Jack's teammates shared their well wishes as Manchester City's Erling Haaland posted two heart emojis in response to the news. \"Congratulations,\" replied England captain Harry Kane, while fellow Three Lions star Jude Bellingham wrote: \"Congrats brother.\"\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTubeand Threads", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

I'm not exaggerating when I say that.\n\n\"I had so many messages every single day. I still get them now, all day every day.\"\n\nJealousy was clearly a factor for her abusers, as Sasha's own career began to take off.\n\nShe signed to Elite Model Management, where the work piled in.\n\nThe fashion influencer, who can count on an army 300,000 Instagram followers for likes and comments, then follow in Grealish's footsteps as a model for Boohoo.\n\nPretty Little Thing also used Sasha to endorse their products.\n\nWhile skincare tutorials in partnership with L'Oreal draw plenty of eyes to her social media accounts.\n\nSasha, herself, became a hot commodity for brands.\n\nMaking time for one another has allowed Grealish and Sasha to thrive as a couple.\n\nOver the years, Grealish has enjoyed lads' breaks in Las Vegas and Ibiza - but Sasha always comes first.\n\nBack in 2022, they celebrated their 10-year anniversary like many loved-up couple would.\n\nThey cuddled up on the sofa and watched romantic movie The Notebook from a projector.\n\nThen, at Halloween that same year, Grealish and Sasha dressed as Grease's Danny and Sandy - with matching T-Birds leather jackets.\n\nA couple in unison, romantic getaways were also the order of the day.\n\nIf Jack did go away with the boys, Sasha was treated to her own five-star holiday.\n\nThe most notable came in 2023, when Grealish whisked his beloved off to the legendary Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc in the South of France.\n\nWorld's away from Cheshire, where they live in a \u00a36million mansion, the resort boasts rooms that cost up to \u00a314,000-per-night.\n\nJust a short drive from the glitz and glamour of Cannes, the hotel has played host to some of the biggest names in history including Picasso and Cary Grant.\n\nJack and Sasha are getting ready to embrace parenthood.\n\nTheir announcement on social media was met with a chorus of well-wishes from the footballing fraternity.\n\nEngland pal Jude Bellingham replied: \"Congrats brother\u2764\ufe0f.\"\n\nWhile Three Lions skipper Harry Kane said: \"Congratulations!! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f.\"\n\nThe later could act as inspiration for Grealish, with family man Kane juggling life as an international footballer and devoted dad seemingly with ease.\n\nInterestingly, Sasha already modelled maternity wear for a Boohoo range.\n\nNow, maybe it's a photoshoot she can revisit for real this time.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.ie", "dataType":

This comes at what seems to be a perfect time for the couple especially considering Grealish is sitting out the Euros this year after not making the England's final squad.\n\nSasha has been Jack's long-term girlfriend since the two were just 16 years old and studied together at St Peter's Roman Catholic Secondary School in Solihull. Despite their ups and downs the couple now appear to be on a high, often seen together online and in public celebrating each other's wins.\n\nSo, it should come as no surprise that girls across the country are eager to know more about the leading lady in Jack's life. Here's a look inside the life of Sasha Attwood.\n\nLike Jack, Sasha is 28 and from Birmingham but now living in Manchester following Jack's Man City move. However, her lavish lifestyle sees that she's always travelling, as she often shares on her Instagram.\n\nNot only is Sasha a soon to be mother but she is also signed to Elite models worldwide and J'adore Models in Manchester. Apparently her career even kicked off even sooner than Jack's, with her being scouted at 13. She's worked with many big brands including Boohoo, Pretty Little Thing and House of Fraser.\n\nShe currently has 296, 000 followers on Instagram where she goes by Sasha Rebecca, in addition to her YouTube Channel with over 47,000 subscribers. She mostly shares lifestyle content of what she's up to or brands she uses and many many vlogs.\n\nIf her Instagram is anything to go by then it would seem that Sasha rarely sits still for any length of time. From girls trips, to work trips, and weekends in Paris, it's hard not to be jealous of all the places she's been.\n\nIf she didn't already have it all, it would seem that her life is complete as she is the proud dog owner of adorable cockapoo, Skye, whom she shares with Jack. It seems that the life of Sasha Attwood is pretty sweet.\n\n* Influencers to professional golfers: Meet the Formula One WAGs turning heads on the racetrack\n\n* The sexiest Euros 2024 players you can stare at whilst pretending to watch the game", "source": {"uri": "thetab.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tab"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Grealish", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jack Grealish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Peter's_Basilica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Peter's Basilica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solihull", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solihull"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Solihull"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlog", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vlog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAGs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WAGs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Fraser", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "House of Fraser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockapoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cockapoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_track", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Race track"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://media.thetab.com/blogs.dir/90/files/2024/07/img-2483-1.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9714803", "eventUri": "eng-9714803", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

But he feels like it's time to write a new chapter in his life with his perfect little family.\"\n\nThe pal added: \"Jack and Sasha are besotted with each other and couldn't be more delighted and excited at the thought of raising their own little one together.\n\n\"Getting dropped from the England squad broke Jack's heart.\n\n\"He is so proud to represent his country and gives his all every time he pulls on the shirt.\n\n\"But the silver lining is that he has at least been able to spend more time with Sasha and be at her beck and call as she carries their child.\"\n\nSo in the coming months and years, we can expect to see a different side to lovable Jack, who was born in Birmingham, raised in nearby Solihull and who has made his name across the globe.\n\nSince bursting on to the scene with a debut for his boyhood club Aston Villa 10 years ago, Jack has stolen hearts with his raw personality and genuine connection with supporters.\n\nUnlike most of today's sports pros, who appear scared to share too much, Jack speaks with searing honesty -- whether about his performances on the pitch or the family heartbreak he has suffered away from it.\n\nAnd he clearly has no qualms about being snapped enjoying himself out on the lash. He has been pictured at Wayne Lineker's O Beach bar in Ibiza and with a pal steadying him on holiday in Dubai last month.\n\nIt is this side of his character that has sometimes landed him in hot water, like when he was snapped bleary-eyed leaving a Las Vegas club with a brunette at 3am in 2022, or when, aged just 19, he was seen passed out on a road in Tenerife.\n\nBut it is also this side to Jack that has endeared him to fans across the football divide -- rival Birmingham City supporters aside -- in a way that only a handful of stars, such as Three Lions legend Paul Gascoigne, have done before.\n\nTake, for example, when this sorry journo (a Manchester United fan) was tasked with covering the Champions League final in Istanbul, Turkey, in June last year, where City beat Inter Milan 1-0 to match the Red Devils' feat of winning that trophy, the Premier League and FA Cup.\n\nThe following day, as celebrating players downed bottles of beer after little or no sleep, and made their way on to the City-emblazoned team coach outside their hotel, a head kept poking out of the vehicle's sunroof.\n\nIt was none other than Grealish -- who else? -- and he was belting out a rap song and shouting, \"Woo!\" before they set off for home, the famous old \"big ears\" trophy in their clutches for the first time.\n\nEven as a begrudging rival fan, I could not help but laugh at the sight of a lad who is the same age as me, at the pinnacle of his profession, just loving life.\n\nJack continued to lead the boozy blowout back home, standing topless on a tram to City's trophy parade, before having Grey Goose vodka poured down his throat by a team-mate while covering up his top half with just a hi-vis jacket.\n\nAlong the way, cheering Jack on through the highs and lows, has been model Sasha. The pair began dating when they were 16, having met at St Peter's Catholic School in Solihull.\n\nThey live in a \u00a35.6million Cheshire mansion with their beloved apricot cockapoo Skye, whose fourth birthday they celebrated on Sunday, along with their big pregnancy reveal.\n\nJack was given Skye as a birthday present by Sasha, and calls her the \"world's best dog\".\n\nThe couple enjoy holidays to destinations including Dubai and the South of France when \u00a3300,000-a-week Jack has a break from his footie schedule.\n\nBut they were left shaken when their home was targeted in a terrifying, mid-week raid in December as Jack played against Everton -- while Sasha and others were inside.\n\nDespite some bumps along the road, it is clear for all to see that the couple remain deeply in love.\n\nAfter City's Champions League final triumph over Inter Milan, Sasha was seen holding the trophy with her man and they shared a kiss on the pitch.\n\nAlso there was Jack's family, who he is incredibly close to. The footie ace -- who could have played for Ireland thanks to his grandparents' roots -- is the eldest of five kids.\n\nHis dad Kevin is a former plasterer and mum Karen is company director of a property management firm.\n\nIn 2000, when Jack was four, the family tragically lost Keelan to sudden infant death syndrome when he was just nine months old.\n\nThe star dedicated his Aston Villa derby goal against Birmingham to Keelan in 2018.\n\nHis sister Hollie, 20, was born with cerebral palsy and he calls her his \"best friend\".\n\nJack has said of his family life: \"My little brother passed away when I was young.\n\n\"My little sister has cerebral palsy. She's like my best friend.\" Jack also does his bit for charity.\n\nHe supports Children In Need and last year became an ambassador for Special Olympics GB, saying passionately: \"Nobody should be excluded from opportunities, and I can't stand bullying or discrimination.\"\n\nHe donated \u00a35,000 to a GoFundMe page for Dylan Lamb, a 20-year-old student given weeks to live after being diagnosed with leukaemia, to help him get medical treatment in America.\n\nIn 2022, Jack vowed to do a goal celebration for Finlay Fisher, an 11-year-old fan with cerebral palsy, if he scored at the World Cup in Qatar.\n\nLo and behold, he did -- and stayed true to his word, performing the lad's favourite \"worm\" dance.\n\nJack is the David Beckham of his generation, adored by so many and with the footie skills, boyish good looks and mega-money brand deals to boot. Although his monster calves put Becks' to shame.\n\nDespite being gutted at missing out on Southgate's Euros squad, he is first to admit when he has not been up to scratch.\n\nAfter manager Pep Guardiola's City won a record fourth Premier League title in a row, Jack said: \"I don't feel like I've performed well this season.\" But Spanish coach Pep, 53, vowed: \"Jack will be back.\"\n\nWhile getting his career on track again track, the footie ace will soon have another mouth to feed.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Completing her look with braids, Sasha exuded confidence and strength.\n\nDue to her family's history of promoting health and wellness, Sasha's dedication to fitness is not entirely surprising. Her mother, Michelle Obama, is well-known for her impactful 'Let's Move!' initiative, aimed at combating childhood obesity and encouraging a healthier lifestyle among Americans. It seems Sasha has taken these values to heart, embracing a rigorous fitness routine that is clearly yielding impressive results.\n\nWhile the specifics of Sasha's workout regimen remain private, her appearance suggests a comprehensive approach to fitness. Regularly hitting the gym and engaging in a variety of exercises like running on the treadmill, strength training, and possibly yoga or pilates, Sasha has sculpted a physique that speaks volumes about her discipline and perseverance.\n\nSasha Obama's fitness journey is more than just a personal achievement; it inspires young women everywhere. In an era where body positivity and self-care are emphasized, Sasha is a role model for embracing one's body and working hard to achieve personal goals.\n\nOn June 10, 2024, Sasha Obama celebrated her 23rd birthday. President Obama and Michelle took to Instagram to share a heartfelt message to commemorate this day, reflecting their deep bond.\n\n\"Happy birthday, Sasha! You make me so incredibly proud. Hope this year brings you everything you want and more. Love you. \ud83d\udc95\" Michelle wrote, accompanying her post with a touching photo that captured a precious moment of her and Sasha embracing each other.\n\nThe former President also shared a sweet snap when Sasha was younger. \"Happy birthday, Sasha!

The midfielder was elated with the news that he's about to become a father and captioned the post: \"Life's biggest blessing.\"\n\nAttwood also shared the same picture on her account as she captioned it: \"Half of me, half of you - beyond blessed\".\n\nIt looks as though Grealish and Attwood will be bringing the child into a very financially stable environment with the skilful star now estimated to be worth \u00a320million thanks to a huge salary at his club and off-field deals with fashion houses, as well as carrying out savvy negotiations for his image rights.\n\nAlongside Grealish's current net worth, his salary since he switched to Manchester City for a cool \u00a3100million in 2021 is bringing him in around \u00a3300,000-a-week, which works out to just over \u00a315million a year. The wage also makes him the club's third-highest earner behind City superstars Erling Haaland and Kevin De Bruyne.\n\nThe former Villa captain also signed a \u00a310million deal with esteemed fashion house Gucci, with some insiders even claiming Grealish could soon be earning close to \u00a31million a week from his various off-the-field interests. The Premier League title winner has been dubbed \"the most marketable footballer since David Beckham\", with brands such as Pepsi and Puma all going into business with the Champions League winner.\n\nAttwood and Grealish have been an item since his early time at Aston Villa and both upped sticks to live in a wealthy part of Cheshire when the England star joined City. In 2022, Grealish reportedly paid \u00a36million for a mansion in the area that includes seven bedrooms, a swimming pool and tennis court and even had plans to build a bar in the grounds.\n\nAside from Grealish's astronomical income, Attwood also has her own sturdy portfolio. She is know to work as a model and advertises for brands including L'Oreal, House of Fraser, Pretty Little Thing and Boohoo.\n\nReach's chief business of football writer Dave Powell told Birmingham Live how Grealish's wage of \u00a315.6m from City is before tax - an important distinction, as high earnings like that mean that the player would be subject to the 45% income tax bracket. All broken down, this means his annual salary after tax would be about \u00a37million, which is still a healthy pay packet.\n\nWhile Grealish did not make the cut for England's Euro 2024 squad, a decision he made years ago will mean he will be financially sound for a long time should the rest of his playing career not go the way he wants. Powell said that Grealish cemented his income with a smart move by creating a 'limited company' for his image rights as far back as 2014.\n\n\"Back in 2014, Grealish did what many top level footballers do and created a limited company for his image rights, with his firm known as Kelandan Ltd,\" Powell said. \"As players have become brands, in some cases being even stronger and compelling to younger generations that the social pull of the clubs themselves, players and agents have realised the brand value that exists, and how it can be monetised.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

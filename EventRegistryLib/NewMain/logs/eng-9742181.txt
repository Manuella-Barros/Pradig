The staff named it Crush after the Denver Broncos' legendary Orange Crush defense from 1976 to 1986.\n\nFood & Cooking Red Lobster offered customers all-you-can-eat shrimp. That was a mistake Marisa Gerber, Los Angeles Times\n\n\"Myself and many of my team are born and raised Denver Broncos fans, so as soon as we saw that orange color, we knew that Crush would be an excellent representation,\" said Kendra Kastendieck, the restaurant's general manager. \"And we all want our defensive line to be that good again.\"\n\nWhen the Pueblo Zoo couldn't take Crush, Kastendieck called the Downtown Aquarium, which she said was interested right away.\n\nPeople are also reading...

It was caught off a coast of Canada, said Kastendieck, but she was unable to confirm which coast.\n\nGenetic mutations can lead to lobsters that are orange, blue and yellow.

It was given the name Crush - a nod to the vaunted Denver Broncos \"Orange Crush\" defense of the 1970s and 80s - and a tank that fits the name.\n\nThe orange shell is likely a result of \"a combination of genetic and environmental factors\" that impact just one in 30 million lobsters, according to the University of New England Marine Science Center.\n\n\"We knew he was extremely rare right from the get-go,\" said Kendra Kastendieck, the general manager of the Pueblo Red Lobster that found the rare animal. \"We started trying to find a zoo or an aquarium here in Colorado that would take him on.\"\n\nFor perspective, about one out of every 2 million lobsters is blue, and one in 50 million is \"split-colored,\" according to UNE.\n\nThe lobsters that come in regular shipments to Red Lobster stores are dark brown with only slight discoloration, Kastendieck said.\n\n\"So having one that was bright orange that none of us had ever seen was definitely a bit of a shock,\" she said.\n\nCrush was formally welcomed to Denver's Downtown Aquarium in a Wednesday afternoon ceremony - but don't expect to see it just yet. The aquarium quarantines all of its new animals for 30 days as standard procedure, said Michael Lewis, an aquarist at the Downtown Aquarium. It's to make sure new animals aren't bringing bacteria or other harmful things into its tanks.\n\nAfter the 30-day quarantine, Crush, who came from the Canadian coast, will be put on exhibit with other marine life native to the Northern Atlantic, Lewis said.\n\n\"Showing you know a slice of ocean in Denver Colorado is a really neat thing we get to do and displaying cool animal like an orange lobster is something we're very excited about,\" he said. \"We think a lot of people will be excited for it.\"", "source": {"uri": "denver7.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Denver 7 Colorado News (KMGH)"}, "authors": [{"uri": "landon_haaf@denver7.com", "name": "Landon Haaf", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chain store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crustacean", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crustacean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobster", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lobster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Lobster", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Red Lobster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquarium", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aquarium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pueblo,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pueblo, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pueblo, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver Broncos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orange County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orange County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoskeleton", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exoskeleton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marine life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarantine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bacteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Fish_and_Aquaria", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Fish and Aquaria", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Guides_and_Outfitters", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Guides and Outfitters", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Fish", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Fish", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Camps", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Camps", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fa2c600/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x672+0+5/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2F0e%2Fa983622841db9671bc29c1b00f9e%2Fred-lobster-orange-lobster.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9742181", "eventUri": "eng-9742181", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

That's because the odds of a bright orange lobster occurring in nature are approximately 1-in-30 million. As a point of comparison, the odds of a blue lobster are 1-in-2 million so this is 15x more rare than a blue lobster.\n\nOf all the places in the world for this bright orange lobster to show up it was a Red Lobster restaurant in Pueblo, Colorado (near Colorado Springs), which in a straight line is around 850 miles from the Pacific Ocean and 1,100 miles by car but from the Atlantic Ocean, where this lobster almost certainly originated, it's 1,400+ miles back to the sea. Suffice it to say this orange lobster traveled a LONG way to Colorado.\n\nThe Red Lobster manager in Pueblo, Kendra Kastendieck, spoke with The Pueblo Chieftain's Zach Hillstrom about this 1-in-30 million find. She said \"Everybody knows the blue lobsters because they make such headlines and they're so brilliant in color, but those are only one in 2 million, the orange ones are one in 30 million. So we thought that was extra cool when it came into the restaurant.\"\n\nThe bright orange color might seem familiar to you and that's because when they're fully cooked they turn bright orange but in the ocean they are dark and closer to brown like the one seen on the left here:\n\nKastendieck added that once they identified the bright orange lobster they immediately pulled it and set aside as they realized there was a celebrity in their midst. She said \"Obviously, we didn't want to sell him. He's never been for sale ... so we are working to try and find him a permanent home at one of the local Colorado zoos or aquariums. We definitely want to find him a home.\"\n\nIt didn't take long for the Pueblo Red Lobster to find their 1-in-30 million lobster a new home. They announced on Instagram that the Aquarium Denver had a home for 'Crush' which was named in honor of the Denver Broncos' defense nicknamed the 'Orange Crush.'\n\nThis isn't the first 1-in-30 million orange lobster found at a Red Lobster which, when you consider that Red Lobster purchase 1 in every 5 lobsters sold in North America, makes sense. Two years ago, another lobster named 'Cheddar' after the biscuits was found:\n\nHow a specimen as bright as these makes it from the Atlantic Ocean to Colorado without any of the fishermen flagging it as special is beyond me. They stick out like a sore thumb.", "source": {"uri": "brobible.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BroBible"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cass_anderson@brobible.com", "name": "Cass Anderson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Lobster", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red Lobster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobster", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lobster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pueblo,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pueblo, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pueblo, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diamond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Springs,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Springs, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado Springs, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver Broncos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquarium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aquarium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheddar_cheese", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cheddar cheese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orange County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orange County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Company_Loyalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Company Loyalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Camps", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Camps", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/red-lobster.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9742181", "eventUri": "eng-9742181", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

"\"Accidental Delivery: Rare Orange Lobster Meant for Colorado Aquarium Ends up at Red Lobster Restaurant\" - Internewscast Journal", "body": "An ultra-rare orange lobster has narrowly escaped becoming someone's seafood supper after a delivery mishap sent it to a Red Lobster restaurant - instead of an aquarium.\n\nThe one-in-30-million crustacean, named 'Crush', was 'accidentally' shipped to the Red Lobster in Pueblo, Colorado this week.\n\nIt is unclear how the accident happened, but luckily the staff noticed its vibrant hue of the rare sea creature.\n\n'They're very dark brown with maybe a few small spots or discoloration points, so having one that was bright orange that none of us had ever seen was definitely a bit of a shock,' Kendra Kastendieck, general manager of the Pueblo Red Lobster, told Fox 31.\n\n'We actually had several guests see him in the tank in our lobby and asked why do we have a cooked lobster in our lobster tank,' she added.\n\nCrush, named after the legendary Broncos defense, arrived at his new home safely on Wednesday, living it up as the star attraction at the Downtown Aquarium.\n\nThe unusual pumpkin hue is triggered by an extremely rare genetic defect which causes the lobster to under-produce a protein, known as carotenoid.\n\nThis protein typically gives lobsters a muddy brown color, which helps them blend in with the murky depths of the ocean.\n\n'The lack of one or several proteins can manifest as different colors, including blue, yellow and orange,' the Downtown Aquarium in Denver, where Crush now resides, told the outlet.\n\nBy some estimates, there is only a one-in-30-million chance that a lobster will be born orange, according to The Lobster Institute at the University of Maine.\n\nAnother rare 'one-in-30-million' orange lobster was spared from becoming someone's dinner after it was rescued from a supermarket in Massachusetts back in 2018.\n\nThe colorful crustacean, which was spotted in a shipment of lobsters by grocery store workers, has been donated to a local aquarium.\n\nOrange specimens are around 15 times rarer than blue lobsters, which are born at a rate of around one-in-2-million.\n\nHowever, the rarest lobsters are albino, which are born completely white and will not turn red when they are cooked.\n\nJust 1-in-100-million lobsters are albino.\n\nUnusual lobster coloration is the result of genetic mutations which change the amount of the protein carotenoid produced by the crustaceans.\n\n'Blue, in particular, is a genetic defect in that the lobsters are producing more of a certain protein than normal,' National Aquarium curator Jay Bradley told National Geographic.\n\n'Combined with their normal pigmentation, it forms a blue color.\n\n'But they turn red when they're boiled, like the rest.\n\n'The more orange-y ones [when they're alive] are an expression of the lack of that protein, so they're only showing this carotenoid pigment, and it's bright red, like how they look when they're boiled.'\n\nThe male lobster was found at a supermarket in Westborough, a town just west of Boston, after it was shipped from Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Lobster", "type": "wiki",

a delivery mishap sent it to a Red Lobster restaurant - instead of an aquarium.\n\nThe one-in-30-million crustacean, named 'Crush', was 'accidentally' shipped to the Red Lobster in Pueblo, Colorado this week.\n\nIt is unclear how the accident happened, but luckily the staff noticed its vibrant hue of the rare sea creature.\n\n'They're very dark brown with maybe a few small spots or discoloration points, so having one that was bright orange that none of us had ever seen was definitely a bit of a shock,' Kendra Kastendieck, general manager of the Pueblo Red Lobster, told Fox 31.\n\n'We actually had several guests see him in the tank in our lobby and asked why do we have a cooked lobster in our lobster tank,' she added.\n\nAn ultra-rare orange lobster has narrowly escaped becoming someone's seafood supper after a delivery mishap sent it to a Red Lobster restaurant - instead of an aquarium\n\nThe one-in-30-million crustacean, named 'Crush', was accidentally shipped to the Red Lobster in Pueblo, Colorado\n\nCrush, named after the legendary Broncos defense, arrived at his new home safely on Wednesday, living it up as the star attraction at the Downtown Aquarium.\n\nThe unusual pumpkin hue is triggered by an extremely rare genetic defect which causes the lobster to under-produce a protein, known as carotenoid.\n\nRead More Red Lobster officially files for bankruptcy\n\nThis protein typically gives lobsters a muddy brown color, which helps them blend in with the murky depths of the ocean.\n\n'The lack of one or several proteins can manifest as different colors, including blue, yellow and orange,' the Downtown Aquarium in Denver, where Crush now resides, told the outlet.\n\nBy some estimates, there is only a one-in-30-million chance that a lobster will be born orange, according to The Lobster Institute at the University of Maine.\n\nAnother rare 'one-in-30-million' orange lobster was spared from becoming someone's dinner after it was rescued from a supermarket in Massachusetts back in 2018.\n\nThe colorful crustacean, which was spotted in a shipment of lobsters by grocery store workers, has been donated to a local aquarium.\n\nThe vibrant color is the result of a genetic mutation so rare which affects and prevents encoded proteins\n\nLuckily, the staff noticed its vibrant hue\n\nOrange specimens are around 15 times rarer than blue lobsters, which are born at a rate of around one-in-2-million.\n\nHowever, the rarest lobsters are albino, which are born completely white and will not turn red when they are cooked.\n\nJust 1-in-100-million lobsters are albino.\n\nUnusual lobster coloration is the result of genetic mutations which change the amount of the protein carotenoid produced by the crustaceans.\n\n'Blue, in particular, is a genetic defect in that the lobsters are producing more of a certain protein than normal,' National Aquarium curator Jay Bradley told National Geographic.\n\n'Combined with their normal pigmentation, it forms a blue color.\n\nCrush, named after the legendary Broncos defense, arrived at his new home safely on Wednesday, living it up as the star attraction at the Downtown Aquarium\n\n'But they turn red when they're boiled, like the rest.\n\n'The more orange-y ones [when they're alive] are an expression of the lack of that protein, so they're only showing this carotenoid pigment, and it's bright red, like how they look when they're boiled.'\n\nThe male lobster was found at a supermarket in Westborough, a town just west of Boston, after it was shipped from Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia.", "source":

The staff named it Crush after the Denver Broncos' legendary Orange Crush defense from 1976 to 1986.\n\nFood & Cooking Red Lobster offered customers all-you-can-eat shrimp. That was a mistake Marisa Gerber, Los Angeles Times\n\n\"Myself and many of my team are born and raised Denver Broncos fans, so as soon as we saw that orange color, we knew that Crush would be an excellent representation,\" said Kendra Kastendieck, the restaurant's general manager. \"And we all want our defensive line to be that good again.\"\n\nWhen the Pueblo Zoo couldn't take Crush, Kastendieck called the Downtown Aquarium, which she said was interested right away.\n\nPeople are also reading...

It was caught off a coast of Canada, said Kastendieck, but she was unable to confirm which coast.\n\nGenetic mutations can lead to lobsters that are orange, blue and yellow.

By comparison, blue lobsters are found in about one out of every 2 million lobsters, according to the University of New England.\n\nAquarium officials told the Chieftain orange lobsters aren't only rare in nature, but also in aquarium settings -- the Downtown Aquarium has only had one other \"orange morph\" lobster in its collection over its 25-year history.\n\nCrush was delivered to the Pueblo Red Lobster on July 12, as part of one of the \"seven or eight\" seafood shipments the restaurant receives in any given month, restaurant General Manager Kendra Kastendieck told the Chieftain.\n\nJose Romero, a longtime dishwasher at the restaurant whose duties include unpacking all the live lobster shipments, immediately recognized that this one was exceptional.\n\n\"The first thought that went through his head was that he's seen a blue lobster before, which was different, but he's never seen an orange one,\" Romero recalled for the Chieftain through a translator. \"When he saw it he just immediately was like ... 'Let me go get my leadership.'\"\n\n\"Everybody knows the blue lobsters because they make such headlines and they're so brilliant in color, but those are only one in 2 million, the orange ones are one in 30 million,\" Kastendieck said. \"So we thought that was extra cool when it came into the restaurant.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, restaurant staff contacted the Denver Downtown Aquarium, which agreed to take him in. Kastendieck then delivered Crush to the aquarium, saving him from becoming dinner for a hungry Red Lobster diner.\n\nMore local news: Bullets from a vending machine?

Once he's checked out by a veterinarian, Crush will live in the Lurkers exhibit, part of the At The Wharf exhibit chain.\n\nCrush arrived around 2 p.m. Wednesday and already has a host of new fans in aquarium staff who want to visit him in quarantine, Herman said.\n\n\"His presence has brought a lot of smiles to people's faces,\" he said.\n\nGet more Colorado news by signing up for our daily Your Morning Dozen email newsletter.", "source": {"uri": "denverpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Denver Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "katie_langford@denverpost.com", "name": "Katie Langford", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobster", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lobster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Lobster", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Red Lobster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pueblo,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pueblo, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pueblo, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Aquarium", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New England Aquarium"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Protein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquarium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aquarium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver Broncos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crustacean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crustacean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Downtown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Curator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orange County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orange County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinarian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Veterinarian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarantine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Fishing", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Fishing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Fish_and_Aquaria", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Fish and Aquaria", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Fish", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Fish", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TDP-L-orangelobster071424-cha-729.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9742181", "eventUri": "eng-9742181", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

'Let me go get my leadership.'\"\n\nKendra Kastendieck, the restaurant's general manager, has only overseen the Pueblo seafood eatery for about a year but has worked in restaurants for about two decades. In all of her years, she said she'd never come across an orange lobster and her director, who's worked for Red Lobster for 10 years, had never seen one either.\n\nPueblo is located about 44 miles south of Colorado Springs and 114 miles south of Denver.\n\n\"Everybody knows the blue lobsters because they make such headlines and they're so brilliant in color, but those are only one in 2 million, the orange ones are one in 30 million. So we thought that was extra cool when it came into the restaurant,\" Kastendieck said.\n\nWhich Red Lobsters are still open? Here's every location in all 44 states\n\nWhat happened to the orange lobster?\n\nThe lobster was never for sale, Kastendieck said, and they turned instead to finding him a permanent home at a local Colorado zoo or aquarium.\n\nLuckily, a new home was found pretty quickly, as representatives with the Downtown Aquarium in Denver confirmed to the Pueblo Chieftain Wednesday that the lobster was accepted and being transported to his new digs that day.\n\nThe Pueblo Red Lobster's staff chose the a very appropriate name for an orange lobster found in Colorado -- they're calling him \"Crush\" as an homage to the legendary Denver Broncos \"Orange Crush\" defense of the late 1970s.\n\nHow rare are orange lobsters?\n\nThe orange lobster's color is the result of a genetic mutation, the Downtown Aquarium said, with the chance of one being one in about 30 million.\n\nStill rare, although less so, are blue lobsters, which are believed to be found one in every two million, according to the New England Aquarium in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nAmerican lobsters are mainly found in the northwest Atlantic Ocean and are most abundant in the coastal waters from Maine to New Jersey, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries.\n\nThey have a long lifespan, but it's difficult to determine a lobster's exact age because they shed their hard shell when they molt.

The staff decided on Crush after the Denver Broncos' first championship team, the Orange Crush.\n\nAfter making a few calls, the Colorado Red Lobster found a home for Crush at Denver's Downtown Aquarium.\n\nRelated: World's Rarest Whale May Have Washed Ashore in New Zealand: 'Next to Nothing Is Known About Them'\n\n\"We are thrilled to be able to share this very rare and extraordinary animal with the community and visitors to Colorado,\" Ryan Herman, general curator of the aquarium, said in the press release.\n\nThe PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here!

The lack of one or several proteins can manifest as different colors, including blue, yellow, and orange,\" the Downtown Aquarium added.\n\nRelated: Flavor Flav Officially Teams with Red Lobster After Attempting to Save the Bankrupt Chain on Social Media\n\nOther rare lobster colors include blue, yellow, grey, and dusty orange.

'Let me go get my leadership.'\"\n\nKendra Kastendieck, the restaurant's general manager, has only overseen the Pueblo seafood eatery for about a year but has worked in restaurants for about two decades. In all of her years, she said she'd never come across an orange lobster and her director, who's worked for Red Lobster for 10 years, had never seen one either.\n\n\"Everybody knows the blue lobsters because they make such headlines and they're so brilliant in color, but those are only one in 2 million, the orange ones are one in 30 million. So we thought that was extra cool when it came into the restaurant,\" Kastendieck said.\n\n\"Obviously, we didn't want to sell him. He's never been for sale ... so we are working to try and find him a permanent home at one of the local Colorado zoos or aquariums. We definitely want to find him a home.\"\n\nWhile the creamsicle-colored crustaceans -- who get their color from a genetic mutation -- are exceedingly rare, the lobster that recently arrived in Pueblo isn't the only one found at a Red Lobster in recent years.\n\nTwo such lobsters were found at different locations of the seafood chain in one month in 2022. They were aptly named \"Cheddar\" and \"Biscuit\" for Red Lobster's popular cheddar biscuits.\n\nBut the Pueblo Red Lobster's staff have perhaps chosen an even more appropriate name for an orange lobster found in Colorado -- they're calling him \"Crush\" as an homage to the legendary Denver Broncos \"Orange Crush\" defense of the late 1970s.\n\n\"Another reason we gravitated toward the name Crush is that my team here at the Pueblo Red Lobster, in particular, has really been put through the wringer since the middle of May since all those closures started happening because we are on that possible closure list,\" Kastendieck said.\n\n\"But also ... we've had some deaths in the family on our team, we've had some births of babies on the team, so we've really been going through a lot, and we just like to always think that even with any adversity that we're being put through, we're still here in Pueblo, we're on Elizabeth, and we're still crushing it. So the name was kind of twofold.\"\n\nMore Pueblo news: Swarms of grasshoppers are gobbling up Pueblo gardens.

Luckily, the shell was much brighter than the other crustaceans it was traveling with.\n\nKendra Kastendieck, the restaurant's general manager, said lobsters are typically \"very dark brown with maybe a few small spots or discoloration points.\"\n\n\"So having one that was bright orange that none of us had ever seen was definitely a bit of a shock,\" she said.\n\nThe lobster came from the coast of Canada, according to the restaurant's food vendor.\n\n\"We actually had several guests see him in the tank in our lobby and asked why do we have a cooked lobster in our lobster tank,\" Kastendieck said.\n\nTurns out, about one in 30 million lobsters have a similar orange tint, according to the aquarium.\n\n\"The lobster's coloration is from a genetic mutation which affects and prevents encoded proteins. The lack of one or several proteins can manifest as different colors, including blue, yellow and orange,\" the aquarium noted.\n\nOrange lobsters have been found before, but they are few and far between. In a more recent record, one grocery store worker in Massachusetts found an orange lobster while working at a supermarket in 2018.\n\nThe orange lobster that was originally set for the Colorado restaurant arrived safely at the aquarium on Wednesday.

Meet Crush", "body": "As a Colorado Red Lobster dishwasher was unpacking crustaceans, something gave him pause.\n\nHe noticed one of them was different, Downtown Aquarium said in a July 18 news release.\n\nOne lobster was orange.\n\n\"The first thought that went through his head was that he's seen a blue lobster before, which was different, but he's never seen an orange one,\" Jose Romero, who has worked at the Pueblo Red Lobster for 12 years, recalled to the Pueblo Chieftain through a translator.\n\nRomero's not alone.\n\nMost people have never seen an orange lobster before, as they are \"extremely rare,\" according to the Denver aquarium.\n\n\"Orange lobsters are one in 30 million,\" the aquarium said.\n\nIts coloration stems \"from a genetic mutation,\" the aquarium said. The mutation \"affects and prevents encoded proteins.\"\n\nWithout one or several proteins, it can result in the lobsters being different colors, such as blue, yellow and orange, like the one Romero stumbled upon, the aquarium said.\n\n\"When he saw it he just immediately was like ... 'Let me go get my leadership,'\" Romero's translator told the Chieftain.\n\nThey, too, were stunned.\n\n\"They're very dark brown with maybe a few small spots or discoloration points, so having one that was bright orange that none of us had ever seen was definitely a bit of a shock,\" Kendra Kastendieck, Pueblo Red Lobster's general manager, told KDVR.\n\nRed Lobster did not immediately return McClatchy News' request for comment.\n\n\"Restaurant staff named him 'Crush,' after the Denver Bronco's legendary Orange Crush defense,\" the aquarium said.\n\n\"As soon as we realized how rare Crush was, we started reaching out to local Colorado zoos and aquariums to see if anyone was set up and equipped to take over this beautiful animal,\" Kastendieck told KRDO.\n\nAnd now, Crush has found his home at Downtown Aquarium.\n\n\"We are thrilled to be able to share this very rare and extraordinary animal with the community and visitors to Colorado,\" Ryan Herman, general curator at the aquarium, said in the release.\n\nWhen Crush arrived July 17, he was put in quarantine, \"where he will be examined by a veterinarian,\" the aquarium said.\n\nAfter 30 days, he will be put in the Lurks exhibit and join other cold water North Atlantic Ocean species, according to the aquarium.", "source": {"uri": "charlotteobserver.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Charlotte Observer"}, "authors":

Fortunately, it didn't end up as someone's meal.\n\nIn 12 years of working at a Red Lobster in Pueblo, Colorado, Jose Romero has unloaded too many shipments of lobster to count.\n\nThe longtime dishwasher is always the man in charge of unpacking the lobsters, but in performing his regular duty on July 12, he came across something he -- and most other people -- had never seen before: an incredibly rare and vibrantly colored orange lobster.\n\n\"The first thought that went through his head was that he's seen a blue lobster before, which was different, but he's never seen an orange one,\" Romero told the Pueblo Chieftain, part of the USA TODAY Network, through a translator. \"When he saw it he just immediately was like ... 'Let me go get my leadership.'\"\n\nKendra Kastendieck, the restaurant's general manager, has only overseen the Pueblo seafood eatery for about a year but has worked in restaurants for about two decades. In all of her years, she said she'd never come across an orange lobster and her director, who's worked for Red Lobster for 10 years, had never seen one either.\n\nPueblo is located about 44 miles south of Colorado Springs and 114 miles south of Denver.\n\n\"Everybody knows the blue lobsters because they make such headlines and they're so brilliant in color, but those are only one in 2 million, the orange ones are one in 30 million. So we thought that was extra cool when it came into the restaurant,\" Kastendieck said.\n\nThe lobster was never for sale, Kastendieck said, and they turned instead to finding him a permanent home at a local Colorado zoo or aquarium.\n\nLuckily, a new home was found pretty quickly, as representatives with the Downtown Aquarium in Denver confirmed to the Pueblo Chieftain Wednesday that the lobster was accepted and being transported to his new digs that day.\n\nThe Pueblo Red Lobster's staff chose the a very appropriate name for an orange lobster found in Colorado -- they're calling him \"Crush\" as an homage to the legendary Denver Broncos \"Orange Crush\" defense of the late 1970s.\n\nHow rare are orange lobsters?\n\nThe orange lobster's color is the result of a genetic mutation, the Downtown Aquarium said, with the chance of one being one in about 30 million.\n\nStill rare, although less so, are blue lobsters, which are believed to be found one in every two million, according to the New England Aquarium in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nAmerican lobsters are mainly found in the northwest Atlantic Ocean and are most abundant in the coastal waters from Maine to New Jersey, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries.\n\nThey have a long lifespan, but it's difficult to determine a lobster's exact age because they shed their hard shell when they molt. Scientists believe that lobsters can live to be 100 years old.", "source": {"uri": "rgj.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reno Gazette Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Lobster", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red Lobster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobster", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lobster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pueblo,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pueblo, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pueblo, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquarium", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aquarium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Downtown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seafood", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seafood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Springs,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Springs, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado Springs, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_lobster", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American lobster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoskeleton", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exoskeleton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Aquarium", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New England Aquarium"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver Broncos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orange County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orange County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maine"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maine"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Fish_and_Seafood", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Fish and Seafood", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Fish_and_Seafood", "label": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Fish and Seafood", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Fish_and_Aquaria", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Fish and Aquaria", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Fish", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Fish", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups/Opposing Views", "wgt": 6}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/07/19/USAT/74466595007-usatsi-20903927.jpg?auto=webp&crop=4607,2591,x0,y0&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9742181", "eventUri": "eng-9742181", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-12", "textStart": 373, "textEnd": 380}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

She has been working at PEOPLE since 2024, and was previously an entertainment reporter at The Messenger.\n\nA rare orange lobster discovered in a live crustacean shipment to a Colorado Red Lobster got a second chance at life thanks to the keen eye of one of the restaurant's dishwashers.\n\nOn Wednesday, July 17, a dishwasher at the Red Lobster location in Pueblo, Colo., was unpacking a shipment of live lobsters for cooking when he spotted the bright orange crustacean, the Denver Downtown Aquarium said in a press release shared with PEOPLE.\n\nThe dishwasher then alerted the restaurant manager, who promptly began calling around to find a home for the rare lobster -- but not before the Red Lobster employees got a chance to name the unique sea creature. The staff decided on Crush after the Denver Broncos' first championship team, the Orange Crush.\n\nAfter making a few calls, the Colorado Red Lobster found a home for Crush at Denver's Downtown Aquarium.\n\n\"We are thrilled to be able to share this very rare and extraordinary animal with the community and visitors to Colorado,\" Ryan Herman, general curator of the aquarium, said in the press release.\n\nThe PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here! How quickly can you solve it? Play now!\n\nAccording to the aquarium, brightly-colored orange lobsters are extremely rare. Orange lobsters like Crush are estimated to occur once in every 30 million lobsters.\n\n\"The lobster's coloration is from a genetic mutation which affects and prevents encoded proteins. The lack of one or several proteins can manifest as different colors, including blue, yellow, and orange,\" the Downtown Aquarium added.\n\nOther rare lobster colors include blue, yellow, grey, and dusty orange. The crustaceans can also appear spotted or multi-colored, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nAfter arriving in Denver, Crush was placed in quarantine and is currently being monitored by a veterinarian.

It turns out it had a rare, one-in-30 million genetic mutation that gave it a unique orange color.\n\n\"They're very dark brown with maybe a few small spots or discoloration points, so having one that was bright orange that none of us had ever seen was definitely a bit of a shock,\" general manager Kendra Kastendieck told KDVR.\n\nIt wasn't even one of the employees that noticed the off-colored crustacean, but the customers. \"We actually had several guests see him in the tank in our lobby and asked why do we have a cooked lobster in our lobster tank,\" Kastendieck said.\n\nThe Downtown Aquarium in Denver said the lobster was \"accidentally delivered\" to a Red Lobster in Pueblo. The restaurant's quick thinking saved the lobster's life.\n\n\"The lobster's coloration is from a genetic mutation which affects and prevents encoded proteins,\" the aquarium explained to KDVR. \"The lack of one or several proteins can manifest as different colors, including blue, yellow, and orange.\"\n\nIt's not the first time an orange lobster has been seen. Back in 2018, a Massachusetts grocery store worker found an orange lobster while working at a supermarket.\n\nAs for this lobster, it's since been re-homed at the aquarium and been named \"Crush\" after the Denver Broncos' famous defense in the 1970s and '80s.", "source": {"uri": "mensjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Men's Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_malone_mendez@mensjournal.com", "name": "Chris Malone M\u00e9ndez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Lobster", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red Lobster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobster", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lobster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crustacean", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Crustacean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pueblo,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pueblo, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pueblo, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orange County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orange County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KDVR", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "KDVR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquarium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aquarium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver Broncos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Downtown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Protein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Fish_and_Seafood", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Fish and Seafood", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Fish_and_Seafood", "label": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Fish and Seafood", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Dining_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Dining Guides", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Fish_and_Aquaria", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Fish and Aquaria", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Fish", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Fish", "wgt": 10}], "image": "https://www.mensjournal.com/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjA3OTQ0NjYxNzQwODI0MzI1/red-lobster-locations-ahead-of-bankruptcy-hearing.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9742181", "eventUri": "eng-9742181", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

The odds of an orange-colored lobster just chilling in your local Red Lobster, apparently more common than you think.\n\nThe Denver's Downtown Aquarium has a new resident thanks to a local Red Lobster. An orange lobster arrived in a routine shipment to a Red Lobster in Pueblo, Colorado. The confused restaurant staff noticed something different about the lobster when he was put in the tank with the rest of his 'friends'.\n\nThe general manager told Fox 31, \"They're very dark brown with maybe a few small spots or discoloration points, so having one that was bright orange that none of us had ever seen was definitely a bit of a shock.\"\n\nShe noted even guests stopped to ask about the orange lobster. The staff then named their crustacean friend, \"Crush,\" after the Denver Bronco's Orange Crush defense.\n\nIt wasn't long after when they all decided Crush wasn't destined to be eaten, but rather admired.

It's so beloved that Flavor Flav has made it his business to keep it afloat.\n\nBut for lobsters? Red Lobster is hell on Earth.\n\nIt's a cavalcade of people celebrating those weird, middling birthdays that aren't really special occasions (27, 32, 58, etc.; anything without a zero or five at the end) and tourists who were too scared to ask locals where to eat, wandering past, eyeing you, and imagining you with your butt split open and drenched in butter.\n\nLike I said; hell on Earth...\n\nHowever, one lobster lucked out by being saved from being lunch (or early, 4 pm old-person dinner) all thanks to a rare genetic characteristic that made it orange, something that happens to only 1-in-30 million lobsters.\n\nI won't lie: had someone not told me this was a special lobster, I'd have no idea. It looks like any lobster I've ever seen, and I don't think I'd pick up on its orangeness being unique. I'd have figured it would come out nice and red when steamed up and served next to a baked potato.\n\nFortunately, others know more about lobsters than I do and plucked this guy out of the tank because of its rarity as well as the fact that he shares a color with the Denver Broncos.\n\nThe Lobster has since been named \"Crush\" after the team's famed Orange Crush defense.\n\nCrush is in quarantine for 30 days, but after that, he'll take up residence at Denver's Downtown Aquarium.\n\n\"We're hoping he's on exhibit in time for the regular season and that he brings them good luck this season,\" Downtown Aquarium General Curator Ryan Herman said.\n\nI mean...

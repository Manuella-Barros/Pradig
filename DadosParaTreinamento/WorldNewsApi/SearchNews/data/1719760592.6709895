The \u201c13 Going on 30\u201d actress \u201cwants the best\u201d for her ex-husband amid his marital woes with his wife, Jennifer Lopez. \u201cShe wants him happy and healthy so he can be the best dad possible,\u201d a source told People Tuesday. The former couple notably have co-parented Violet, 18, Seraphina, 15, and Samuel, 12, since separating in 2015. The duo finalized their divorce three years later, with Affleck, 51, going on to marry Lopez in 2022. The magazine reported that Garner, 52, \u201clikes\u201d the \u201cLet\u2019s Get Loud\u201d singer, 54, for her \u201chealthy lifestyle\u201d and \u201csupport\u201d of Affleck\u2019s sobriety. \u201cJen wants that for Ben,\u201d the insider said. The exes have continued to amicably co-parent as headlines swirl about Affleck stepping out without his wedding ring and missing Lopez\u2019s \u201cAtlas\u201d premieres. The \u201cGone Girl\u201d star even attended his eldest child\u2019s graduation party over Memorial Day weekend sans Lopez. Violet got her high school diploma earlier this month, with Garner sharing emotional snaps of herself sobbing via Instagram. \u201cTell me you have a graduate without telling me you have a graduate. ? (bless our hearts ?\u2665\ufe0f?),\u201d the proud mom gushed on May 20. Lopez, who has been photographed spending time with Violet and her siblings over the years, has two children of her own. The performer shares twins Emme and Max, 16, with ex-husband Marc Anthony. Lopez and Affleck\u2019s love story began before she became a mom, with the pair initially being engaged from 2002 to 2004. They reconciled in 2021 and got engaged in April of the following year. Garner is \u201cencouraging\u201d Affleck to \u201cwork on\u201d his romance with the Grammy nominee, a source told Us Weekly last week. \u201cShe fully supports their relationship and wants nothing more than for him to be happy,\u201d the outlet reported. Affleck and Lopez have yet to directly comment on split rumors \u2014 although the \u201cShades of Blue\u201d alum did shut down a reporter who should have known \u201cbetter\u201d than to ask her outright at a recent press conference.", "summary": "The \"13 Going on 30\" actress needs her ex-husband \"happy and healthy so he can be the best dad\" to Violet, 18, Seraphina, 15, and Samuel, 12, a source said.", "url": "https://pagesix.com/2024/05/29/entertainment/jennifer-garner-wants-the-best-for-ben-affleck-amid-j-lo-woes/", "image": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/ben-affleck-jennifer-lopez-garner.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:18:17", "author": "Riley Cardoza", "authors": ["Riley Cardoza"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.342}

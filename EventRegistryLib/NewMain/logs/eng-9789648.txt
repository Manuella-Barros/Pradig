We are going to contest as the MVA alliance and bring about change.

The Mahayuti government has copied Congress schemes. The Congress has initiated the Mahalaxmi scheme for women in Karnataka. In Maharashtra, Sanjay Gandhi Niradhar scheme is being implemented for several years,\" he said.\n\nPatole said the BJP-led Mahayuti, which also has Eknath Shinde's Shiv Sena and Ajit Pawar-headed NCP as partners, has announced only Rs 1,500 for women but the Congress will make women \"lakhpatis\" once it comes to power.\n\nAsked about dismissed Mumbai police officer Sachin Waze's bribery allegation against former home minister and NCP (SP) leader Anil Deshmukh, Patole said, \"This is all drama.

Therefore, this meeting among top leaders is crucial.\"\n\nNotably, the MVA won 31 out of 48 seats in Maharashtra, while the NDA-led Mahayuti Alliance of the BJP, Shiv Sena (Eknath Shinde) and NCP (Ajit Pawar) won the remaining 17 seats.\n\nMeanwhile, sources within the Sena (UBT) camp say Uddhav Thackeray is eager to be declared the chief ministerial candidate soon.\n\n\"Shiv Sena (UBT) may have won fewer seats than Congress and the NCP (SP) in the Lok Sabha, but no one can deny that Uddhav Thackeray was the face of the campaign, and his speeches resonated more with the public. The people of Maharashtra are eager to see Thackeray as chief minister again after his government was toppled by the BJP,\" said a Shiv Sena (UBT) leader, requesting anonymity.\n\n\"Declaring Thackeray the chief ministerial candidate would not only galvanise the party cadre but also the voters. This would provide a clearer choice between Uddhav Thackeray and the incumbent chief minister, Eknath Shinde, or Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis. Hence, MVA should not miss this opportunity to sway more voters to our side,\" the Sena (UBT) leader added.\n\nMeanwhile, the former Maharashtra CM met with the AICC in-charge of Maharashtra, Ramesh Chennithala, on Tuesday and is expected to meet other party leaders on Wednesday.\n\nChennithala confirmed that Thackeray's meetings with Congress's top leaders are scheduled, but discussions about the chief ministerial candidate isn't on the meeting agenda and that official and unofficial discussions are underway among MVA partners.\n\n\"Earlier in Mumbai, I met with Sharad Pawar and Uddhav Thackeray as well. We are meeting again in Delhi with top leaders. The current Maharashtra government is very corrupt, so we must work hard to oust it. We have yet to start discussions on seat-sharing, and the decision on the chief ministerial candidate has also not been made,\" Chennithala said.", "source": {"uri": "newindianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sudhir_suryawanshi@newindianexpress.com", "name": "Sudhir Suryawanshi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiv_Sena_(Uddhav_Balasaheb_Thackeray)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maha_Vikas_Aghadi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Maha Vikas Aghadi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uddhav_Thackeray", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uddhav Thackeray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samajwadi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Samajwadi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalist_Congress_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nationalist Congress Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharashtra", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Maharashtra"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maharashtra"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjay_Raut", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sanjay Raut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eknath_Shinde", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eknath Shinde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallikarjun_Kharge", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mallikarjun Kharge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonia_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sonia Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Democratic Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharad_Pawar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sharad Pawar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu_Legislative_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajit_Pawar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ajit Pawar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiv_Sena", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shiv Sena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devendra_Fadnavis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Devendra Fadnavis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Congress_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All India Congress Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Maharashtra", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of Maharashtra"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/newindianexpress%2F2024-05%2F89fdbe8e-77bb-4266-a4cc-0ae40713053b%2FUddhav_Thackeray.jpg?rect=0%2C0%2C1200%2C630&w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789648", "eventUri": "eng-9789648", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

The two leaders will meet in Mumbai on August 7 to negotiate seat-sharing plans for Maharashtra assembly polls.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThackeray's visit to Delhi is his first since the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), which includes the Shiv Sena (UBT), Congress, and NCP (SP), won 31 of the 48 Lok Sabha seats in Maharashtra. Thackeray is likely to meet with major opposition figures during his visit, such as Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge, Lok Sabha Opposition Leader Rahul Gandhi, and Congress Parliamentary Party Chief Sonia Gandhi.\n\nChennithala described the meeting with Thackeray as informal, held at Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut's residence. Raut stated that discussions would naturally revolve around the state and the upcoming Maharashtra Assembly Polls and that Thackeray's visit is part of a larger \"samvad tour\" to meet with various leaders, including those from the Trinamool Congress, Samajwadi Party, and Aam Aadmi Party.\n\n\"Leaders of the Trinamool Congress, Samajwadi Party, Aam Aadmi Party will meet him,\" Raut had said.\n\nAs the state prepares for Maharashtra assembly Polls in October, representatives from the INDIA alliance are expected to meet in the national capital this week.\n\nSanjay Nirupam, a Shiv Sena politician, attacked Thackeray for his journey to Delhi, claiming that he is placing his ambitions for chief minister over addressing the issues of Maharashtra residents hit by recent rains. Nirupam stated Thackeray's primary goal is to secure a better deal for himself in future Maharashtra Assembly Polls, while Sharad Pawar intends to place his daughter, Supriya Sule, as chief minister.\n\nHe noted that, while Thackeray appears to have given power to the Congress party, there are several candidates for chief minister within the state Congress.\n\n\"Thackeray went to Delhi to get a better deal ahead of the upcoming assembly elections. It appears that he is more focussed on his political interests rather than addressing the sufferings of the people affected by rains,\" Nirupam claimed.\n\n\"Uddhav Thackeray is aiming to become the chief ministerial face of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA).

The meeting with Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge and other prominent figures such as Sonia and Rahul Gandhi is scheduled for tomorrow. Several other political parties from INDIA, including Trinamool Congress, are also set to convene later - marking their first gathering since the Lok Sabha polls.\n\nPrior to the discussion with Sena, Rahul Gandhi, Mallikarjun Kharge, and Sonia Gandhi will have an internal meeting tomorrow.\n\nSanjay Raut, the UBT leader of Shiv Sena, who is hosting Mr. Thackeray and his son, former Maharashtra minister Aaditya Thackeray, at his residence, stated, \"Uddhav Thackeray, Sharad Pawar, Mallikarjun Kharge, Rahul Gandhi are currently in Delhi, so the deliberations will take place here.

Shiv Sena contested the remaining 23 seats and emerged victorious in 18.\n\nHowever, this time around, the BJP only managed to win nine seats. Their allies -- the breakaway groups of Sena under Eknath Shinde and NCP under Ajit Pawar -- secured eight out of the 19 seats they contested.\n\nThe outcomes were perceived as the electorate's response to the significant political upheaval that had gripped the state since the 2019 state elections. Over the past two years, the situation has escalated, resulting in consecutive splits within Shiv Sena and NCP, with the dissident factions in both parties aligning with the BJP.\n\nThe president of Maharashtra Congress, Nana Patole, has already expressed certainty that a change in leadership is imminent in the state.\n\nWith that objective in mind, tomorrow's planning session is anticipated to outline a strategy.

A major program will be organized in Mumbai, with Rahul Gandhi, Party President Mallikarjun Kharge, Sharad Pawar, and Uddhav Thackeray expected to attend, as informed by Chennithala to the press.\n\nRamesh Chennithala informed the press that no discussions about seat sharing took place during this meeting. \"Discussions on seat sharing will be held at the August 7 meeting. We will determine who will contest the elections and on how many seats, which has not yet been decided. MVA is capable of winning. We are all working to bring the MVA government to Maharashtra. We received a positive response in the Lok Sabha elections and expect the same in the upcoming State Assembly elections,\" said Chennithala.\n\nAdditionally, Congress State President Nana Patole stated, \"MVA is working to uphold the pride of Maharashtra. The Mahabhrashta Yuti has sold it out, and the current government is benefiting Gujarat. Maharashtra is being looted, and the stolen goods are being taken to Surat. The government is selling state land and properties. In this situation, saving Maharashtra is MVA's mission. Patole announced that Congress will prepare a chargesheet against the Mahabhrashta Yuti and distribute it to the public. Campaigning for the State Assembly election will begin on Rajiv Gandhi's birth anniversary.\"\n\nOn July 26, Congress General Secretary K.C. Venugopal issued a list of ten members of the Maharashtra Congress party.

Ahead of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi meeting later this week, the Congress, as decided in its internal meeting, will demand around 120 seats in Maharashtra, including 16 in Mumbai.\n\nThe Congress held a meeting of the election committees of Maharashtra and Mumbai on Sunday in the presence of Ramesh Chennithala, AICC general secretary in charge of Maharashtra, Patole, Balasaheb Thorat, Prithviraj Chavan, Nitin Raut, Arif Naseem Khan and Varsha Gaikwad among others. The party leaders discussed the strategy and finalised the agenda for the seat-sharing talks that will begin on August 7 in Mumbai.\n\nChennithala and Patole denied that the party would be asking for 120 seats in Maharashtra, including 16 in Mumbai, saying these were just media reports. \"The Congress believes in fighting the polls as an alliance with the Sharad Pawar-led NCP and the Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena,\" said Patole. \"The talks will be held with our allies during the meeting on August 7 in Mumbai.\" The three parties are expected to hold a joint rally in Mumbai.\n\nPressed by the Shiv Sena (UBT), the Congress is expected to take action against its seven MLAs who reportedly cross-voted for the ruling party candidates during the legislative council elections held on July 12. Five of them defied the party diktat of voting for their own candidate Pradnya Satav, and two did not vote for the alliance candidate Milind Narvekar. Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Varun Sardesai met Chennithala in this regard and demanded action.\n\n\"We have identified the MLAs -- the two names submitted by the Sena and the ones identified by us are the same,\" Patole said. \"Disciplinary action will be taken against them and a chargesheet has been prepared. You will see the action taken against them very soon.\"\n\nWhen asked about the renomination of sitting MLAs in the assembly polls, Patole said the party was conducting an internal survey of elective merit before taking a call on the candidates. He said the survey would begin on August 12 and the decision over the renomination of sitting MLAs and nomination of candidates would be taken in due course.\n\nThe Congress is also expected to begin its statewide review meetings from August 10, beginning from Latur in Marathwada. Headed by Chennithala, senior party leaders will tour various regions to tap possible candidates and weed out the differences within local units. \"It will be an exercise to make the local leaders understand that the Congress will not be able to accommodate as many leaders as it used to in previous elections, as we now have an alliance of three parties,\" said a leader requesting anonymity. \"Our focus will be on Vidarbha, as we expect to win maximum seats from the region.\"\n\nThe party also set its agenda of targeting the ruling alliance over corruption, unemployment and its constant attempts to \"safeguard the interests of Gujarat\". \"The state government is pro-Gujarat, and it has mortgaged Maharashtra's pride to that state,\" said Patole. \"Land parcels, state assets and public sector undertakings are being sold to industrialists, pushing the state to the brink of bankruptcy. The state has a serious law-and-order problem and maximum farmer suicides. We have prepared a chargesheet against the government and will go to the people ahead of the polls.\"\n\nVarun Sardesai to contest from Bandra East?\n\nSpeculation is rife that Uddhav Thackeray's family member and Yuva Sena leader Varun Sardesai will contest the assembly polls from Bandra East constituency. So far held by the Congress' Zeeshan Siddique, the seat may go to the Thackeray-led Shiv Sena, as Siddique is reportedly on the verge of quitting the party. Sardesai met Congress leaders during their meeting on Sunday and reportedly discussed the seat. Congress state chief Patole, however said, \"He met us regarding the cross-voting by two Congress MLAs during the legislative council elections last month.\"", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com",

Following MVA's victory in Lok Sabha election in Maharashtra, there has been a competition between the three parties on who could get the chief ministership with more than half a dozen potential CMs in the three parties. Shiv Sena (UBT) even publicly said that Uddhav Thackeray should be declared the chief ministerial candidate. On the other hand, state Congress president Nana Patole's aides have started putting up hoardings describing him as the future chief minister. In this background, leaders of the three parties have decided that the contentious issue needs to be kept off the table to avoid any bitterness even before their campaign takes off. \"It has been decided to concentrate on finalising the seat-sharing and launch the campaign as we will have barely eight weeks in hand before the elections,\" said a top MVA leader.\n\nMeanwhile, the Congress is planning to launch its campaign in Mumbai from August 20 in the presence of Rahul Gandhi. It is likely to be a Congress show but the party has also invited allies Sharad Pawar and Uddhav Thackeray for the event, which could mark the launch of their campaign.\n\nShiv Sena (UBT) wants to stick to mashal\n\nThe Shiv Sena (UBT) wants to stick to the new symbol flaming torch or mashal in Marathi for the coming assembly election. In a recent meeting of the party leaders, Uddhav Thackeray told them that they should take the mashal symbol to each and every house as they have decided to continue with the same in the assembly elections. A party leader said the top brass is not sure that the Supreme Court will deliver its order on petitions related to disqualification of Eknath Shinde and his MLAs as well as the party's challenge to Election Commission of India's order allotting official Shiv Sena name and symbol to Shinde before the assembly elections. The party has also requested the ECI to remove symbols similar to mashal from the list of symbols available for independent candidates, just the way it did in case of NCP (SP). Several Shiv Sena (UBT) leaders also feel that the new symbol has better visual appeal than the bow and arrow.\n\n'People-friendly' Ajit Pawar\n\nThe effect of newly appointed political strategists can be seen in Ajit Pawar's persona and it is not limited to the onion-coloured jackets he is donning now-a-days. The deputy chief minister has started speaking more to the media and his public speeches have become more focused and less negative. Soon, he will also be seen reaching out to people in a way he has not done yet. A close aide has advised Ajitdada to be seen as \"people-friendly\" as he is the face of his party. That was the reason he was seen at Siddhivinayak temple with all his MLAs, performing a pooja before launching his mission. The idea was to reach out to a wider voter base including that of allies BJP and Shiv Sena.\n\nTheir enmity continues\n\nThe age-old enmity between two heavyweight politicians in Ahmednagar has got renewed now with the Lok Sabha elections. Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil and Balasaheb Thorat are known as sworn rivals. Thorat, a senior Congress leader, played a significant role in the victory of the MVA candidates in Ahmednagar and Shirdi constituencies in the district, especially in Ahmednagar where NCP (SP) candidate Nilesh Lanke defeated sitting MP Sujay Vikhe-Patil which has upset the latter's father, Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil, a senior BJP leader. The father-son duo is determined to defeat Thorat in the assembly election. Now Sujay has announced that he will contest from Sangamner assembly constituency from where Thorat has been elected eight times in a row. Looks like the political drama will continue in the politically volatile district of north Maharashtra.\n\nThe last burst of transfers\n\nWith barely a month left for the election code of conduct to kick in, transfers in the state administration have become a hot topic in Mantralaya.

The serial poaching of MLAs and engineered defections have undermined the State's political culture, which was once built on mutual respect and cooperation among opposition parties.\n\nIt began with the 2019 Assembly election that disrupted the status quo in Maharashtra politics when the Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena broke away from the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and joined the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), led by Sharad Pawar, to form a government in the State.\n\nUntil 1995, when the Shiv Sena and the BJP joined hands and came to power, it was the Congress that had held sway over Maharashtra for many decades. That year marked the beginning of coalition politics in the State, with the Congress and the NCP predominantly on one side and the Shiv Sena-BJP on the other.\n\nThe saffron alliance continued in the elections that came thereafter. Significantly, the Shiv Sena was a founding member of the BJP-led NDA, which ruled the country in 1998, and it was the only constituent that shared the BJP's Hindutva agenda. In 2014, both parties contested the Assembly election separately, but formed a government in a post-election alliance, with Devendra Fadnavis of the BJP as Chief Minister.\n\nThe 2019 election, however, upset the apple cart. The Shiv Sena, which was in a pre-election alliance with the BJP, demanded the Chief Minister's post, stating that the then BJP president Amit Shah had assured them of this. The BJP denied having given any such assurance. The snub prompted Uddhav to join the Congress-NCP alliance, and he became Chief Minister of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government on November 26, 2019.\n\nParadigm shift\n\nThis was a paradigm shift in Maharashtra politics. The Sena, founded in 1966 on a sons-of-the-soil plank, had taken a right turn in the early 1990s and was one of the loudest voices of the Hindu Right until the rise of Narendra Modi. As such, Uddhav's alliance with the Congress and the NCP shook the right-wing ecosystem.\n\nIn its aftermath, the BJP tried every trick to discredit the Uddhav government. It attacked the MVA government on all issues, and worse, it unleashed investigation agencies, such as the Enforcement Directorate, the Central Bureau of Investigation, and the Income Tax department against several MVA leaders.\n\nThis no-holds-barred attack on the opposition altered the political culture of the State, bringing in an animosity hitherto unknown among its political leaders. The State has always taken pride in its tradition of maintaining cordial personal relationships between its ruling and opposition leaders, from the time of the BJP's first-generation leaders in Maharashtra such as Pramod Mahajan, Gopinath Munde, and Nitin Gadkari.\n\nDuring a protest on the Pune-Solapur Highway in connection with Maratha reservation, in Solapur on November 1, 2023. The State government's inept handling of the sensitive issue made it worse. | Photo Credit: PTI\n\nAs Shiv Sena and NCP leaders began to feel the heat, many of them asked their leadership to relinquish power. Finally, in June 2022, a large group of Shiv Sena MLAs broke away from the Uddhav camp. The BJP supported the breakaway faction led by Eknath Shinde and made him Chief Minister. Devendra Fadnavis, reportedly much against his wish, became the Deputy Chief Minister.\n\nThe next step was to engineer a split in Sharad Pawar's NCP. His nephew Ajit Pawar, who was under investigation by many agencies, joined the Shinde-led Cabinet in June 2023. Ajit shared the Deputy Chief Minister's post with Fadnavis. Later, the Election Commission recognised the Shinde and Ajit Pawar groups of the Shiv Sena and the NCP, respectively, as the \"real\" parties. Both verdicts have been challenged and are pending in the Supreme Court.\n\nSetback to the NDA\n\nDespite these efforts, however, two years later the BJP's ambitions took a beating in the Lok Sabha election. Of the 48 Lok Sabha seats in the State, the MVA won 30 and the NDA won 17. One Independent who won affiliated himself with the Congress.\n\nThe BJP itself won a mere 9 seats against the 24 and 23 seats it won in 2014 and 2019 respectively in alliance with Uddhav. In 2014 and 2019, the BJP had been the first party since 1990 to win over 100 seats in the Assembly, 123 and 105 seats respectively. However, given the results of the general election, it looks as if the BJP might have a tough task repeating such past performances.\n\nThe results also defy a myth about the BJP that it works to a long-term plan. Bringing down the MVA government by splitting parties is not being seen so much as a \"Chanakya move\" as an abuse of power. This has led to the BJP losing its psychological leverage over the opposition.\n\n\"Of the 48 Lok Sabha seats in the State, the MVA won 30 and the NDA won 17. The BJP won a mere 9 seats against the 24 and 23 seats it had won in 2014 and 2019 respectively in alliance with Uddhav.\"\n\nWorse, it is the State that has paid a huge price for the political instability. Once the most industrialised State in the country, Maharashtra is now lagging behind on many development parameters. The State's economic growth, according to the Economic Survey, was 4.5 per cent in 2019-24, falling from 6.1 per cent in 2014-19. The State debt amounts to Rs.7.11 lakh crore. It is estimated that at this pace, by 2026, debt will rise faster than the growth rate.\n\nThe Economic Survey says the State is in the sixth place in the country's per capita income index. However, as pointed out by opposition leaders, a Press Information Bureau press note of July 24, 2023, says that Maharashtra, with a per capita net State domestic product of Rs.1.46 lakh, is actually at number 11 (see \"Maharashtra Budget: Ambitious focus on welfare programmes, but where is the money?\", Frontline, July 19, 2024).\n\nThe average growth rate in the industrial sector has fallen from 5.5 per cent in 2014-19 to 1.3 per cent in 2019-24. The average manufacturing growth rate from 2019 to 2024 has been negative, at -1 per cent.\n\nChallenges ahead\n\nSocial indicators too have declined. According to Hindutva Watch, an independent research project that documents hate crimes and hate speech against religious minorities in India, Maharashtra saw the largest number of hate speeches in the country in 2023. Data from the National Crime Records Bureau reveal that Maharashtra had the highest number of people arrested in cases of riots in the country in 2022. Critics point out that Hindu right-wing groups tried to communalise society ahead of the recent Lok Sabha election as well.\n\nThe State has also seen a rift between the Maratha and Other Backward Classes in the past eight months over the issue of reservation. The State government's inept handling of the sensitive issue made it worse. Adding fuel to the fire were aggressive statements on reservation made by Ministers such as Chhagan Bhujbal.\n\nCommunal and caste conflicts have pushed real challenges like the agricultural crisis to the back burner. As many as 55 per cent of the State's population lives in rural areas. Of this, 87 per cent is dependent on agriculture. Maharashtra has the ignominy of leading the country in farmer suicides. Until July 15 this year, nearly 600 farmers had died by suicide. Political developments, rather than farmer suicides, have hogged media and social media attention.\n\nIt is against this background that the upcoming Assembly election gains significance.

infrastructure, and a stand-alone look at its capital Mumbai.", "source": {"uri": "frontline.thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Frontline"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The record producer, 54 - who recently returned his ceremonial key to New York City at Mayor Eric Adams' request - opted to not post on social media, but most of his kids shared messages to their father. His son Justin, 30 - whom he shares with Misa Hylton - took to his Instagram stories to share throwback photos of himself with the Coming Home rapper. 'Happy Father's Day pops,' he wrote in text added towards the bottom of one image as the pair posed for a picture together. Another picture was taken as a young Justin was propped up on Diddy's right shoulder while wearing football gear. Lastly, Justin shared a throwback clip while he appeared to be on set with his father and at one point, Sean affectionately rubbed his hand on his son's head in between filming. His daughter, Chance, 18 - whom he shares with Sarah Chapman - also jumped to her own Instagram stories on Sunday as well. She uploaded a black and white photo as she lounged with her dad while on a boat and typed out, 'happy father's day! i love you endlessly.' His twins, Jessie and D'Lila also posted on their joint account and uploaded a throwback picture while posing with Diddy and their siblings. 'Happy fathers day to the best dad in the worldddddddd. We love u so much,' they penned at the bottom. His son Christian 'King' Combs, 26, shared a post on his main Instagram page and also included a carousel of photos from the past, including one when he was a baby and sat on his father's lap in a black and white snap. Another was taken when he was a toddler and could be seen wearing floaties on his arms during a pool day while Diddy watched nearby. Christian additionally uploaded a picture as the two posed on the red carpet together, and lastly shared an image as they showed off their arm muscles while looking in a mirror. 'HAPPY FATHERS DAY TO THE GREATEST!! Love you pops !' he wrote in the caption of the post. Diddy shares Christian as well as twins Jessie and D'Lila with Kim Porter who passed away in 2018 following a battle with pneumonia. He also adopted her son, Quincy, 33, during the course of their relationship. The star is also father to daughter, Love, one - whom he welcomed with Dana Tran in October 2022. The rapper has been embroiled in legal troubles and sexual assault lawsuits, with a video recently obtained by CNN showing footage of him beating singer, Cassie, inside the InterContinental Hotel. Earlier this week, Diddy returned his ceremonial key to New York City that he was awarded last year by Mayor Eric Adams. It came after the Mayor sent the embattled rapper a letter on June 4, requesting the honor back, following backlash over footage of the disgraced rapper assaulting his ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura. Adams wrote that he stands with survivors of domestic abuse and then noted that the Key to the City is awarded to model citizens and that Combs no longer met the criteria for selection. TMZ reported that Diddy's team returned the Key using the instructions provided by the Mayor's office. The City of New York keeps a list of all recipients of the Key to the City and Combs will remain in the log, however his entry has already been amended. 'This Key to the City was rescinded by Mayor Eric Adams on June 4, 2024, via a formal letter due to actions of domestic and gender-based violence committed by Mr. Combs.' Last month, Adams told PIX11 that his team was getting together to reconsider the honor. 'I think all of us were deeply disturbed by watching that chilling video of the young lady being assaulted by him. 'The committee and the team have never rescinded a key before, but we are now sitting down to see what the next steps forward are going to be,' he said. Diddy is currently under federal investigation and facing serious allegations of sexual assault and abuse. Last September, when he gave Diddy the key, he declared it as a representation of everything the rapper has done for NYC, through his long-running support for black entrepreneurs, including millions of dollars in donations. 'A son of Harlem, Combs worked his way to the top, becoming a successful musical talent both in front of and behind the mic,' said Adams. 'Despite all of his successes, Sean has never forgotten where he came from,' he said, calling Diddy the 'embodiment of New York City attitude.' Diddy broke his silence after the shocking video of him beating up his former girlfriend Cassie Ventura surfaced. The rapper took to Instagram to apologize, saying: 'I hit rock bottom, but I make no excuses. So difficult to reflect on the darkest times in your life, sometimes you got to do that. I was f***ed up.' 'I mean I hit rock bottom, but I make no excuses, my behavior in that video is inexcusable. I take full responsibility for my actions in that video, I'm disgusted.' 'I was disgusted then when I did it, I am disgusted now. I went and I sought out professional help, I got into going to therapy, going to rehab,' he added. 'Had to ask God for his mercy and grace. I'm so sorry. But I am committed to be a better man each and every day. I'm not asking for forgiveness, I'm truly sorry.' Sources said Diddy went to rehab following the 2016 incident and continues to seek both therapy and spiritual work. The video, obtained by CNN, shows the rapper shirtless with a towel wrapped around his waist, chasing Cassie down the hall at the InterContinental Hotel in Century City. As she tried to get into an elevator, he grabbed her by the back of the head and slammed her to the ground. He then kicked her as she lay on the floor motionless, before grabbing the two designer bags she'd tried to escape with. Diddy stood over her, kicked her again, and then dragged her back to their room by the hoodie. Cassie claimed in a since-settled lawsuit that Diddy had paid the same hotel $50,000 for the footage after the attack. Speaking on Sunday, Cassie's attorney Meredith Firetog, said: 'Combs' most recent statement is more about himself than the many people he has hurt.' 'When Cassie and multiple other women came forward, he denied everything and suggested that his victims were looking for a payday.' 'That he was only compelled to \"apologize\" once his repeated denials were proven false shows his pathetic desperation, and no one will be swayed by his disingenuous words.' The apology comes after the LA County District Attorney said they would not be able to prosecute Diddy for the assault as the statute of limitations had passed. California's statute of limitations for simple assault is one year, though aggravated assault is three years. Based on the timeline, neither charge could be levied against Diddy. Sean was later blasted by Kim Porter's father over the over 'disgusting' video of Cassie's assault, and stated, 'It was despicable. I couldn't believe it. I was in Vietnam, and I wouldn't do that to my enemy.", "summary": "Sean 'Diddy' Combs, 54, received Father's Day tributes from his children on Instagram on Sunday - amid the rapper's sexual assault lawsuits and sex-trafficking probes.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-13540005/Sean-Diddy-Combs-children-share-Fathers-Day-tributes-disgraced-rapper-amid-sexual-assault-lawsuits-mounting-legal-troubles.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/17/23/86237967-0-image-m-29_1718661956377.jpg", "video": "https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2024/06/17/7431780401842571150/1024x576_MP4_7431780401842571150.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-18 00:11:08", "author": "Amy Lamare,Editor,Jacqueline Lindenberg,Sophie Mann", "authors": ["Amy Lamare", "Editor", "Jacqueline Lindenberg", "Sophie Mann"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": 0.006}

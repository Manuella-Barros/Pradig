It's an often overlooked area that requires extra care during showering and now one healthcare specialist went on to emphasise the importance of regularly cleaning your belly button to prevent the onset of unwanted conditions. However, the doctor has also cautioned that there's one condition you want to steer clear of. Dr Geeta Yadav explains that substances can easily accumulate inside the belly button, leading to an unpleasant odour. In a TikTok video, she revealed why it's important to clean the area as often as you can, expressing to her followers: \"Does your belly button smell? Well, you could have an umbolith or navel stone. Want to prevent this? Please wash your belly buttons.\" A navel stone is a condition that consists of sebum, skin oil, hair, and dead skin cells. According to WebMD: \"The navel stone itself isn't a health problem or a symptom of an underlying condition\" However, \"a stone can start to irritate the skin in and around your navel and that irritation might lead to a skin infection inside your navel.\" Dermatologist Dr Geeta Yadav recommends people clean their belly button with an earbud, soap, and water, every single day in the shower as part of their daily routine. However, if you fail to do so, Dr Ajayi-Sotubo revealed this could \"lead to rashes, inflammation and infections\" too. They added: \"Like any part of the body, the belly button also needs to be cleaned as bacteria, sebum, and dead skin cells can become trapped in and around it.\" She also warned: \u201cIt\u2019s important to thoroughly dry the area after washing with a towel, as areas left wet and moist can breed infection.\u201d Speaking on TikTok, Dr Geeta Yadav says people should \"aim to focus on cleaning the belly button once a week.\" Adding: \"If the belly button is particularly deep, you can use a wet cotton bud as that\u2019s what I do when cleaning people's belly buttons before surgery.\" Some people seemed to agree with the method. One social media user penned: \"I have always cleaned mine and my kids, as they got older I made them clean theirs daily and always thought I was crazy lol.\" Do you have a story to sell?

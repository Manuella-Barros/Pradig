That includes Homelander bisecting his enemies \u2014 specifically Sub-Zero \u2014 with powerful eye lasers, and sending hundreds of commercial airline passengers to their deaths, in this case by throwing Liu Kang through a jet engine. Mortal Kombat 1\u2019s take on Homelander looks faithful to the onscreen version played by actor Antony Starr (who has said he\u2019s not voicing the supervillain in this DLC). We see him pull a few signature Homelander moves, like a deafening ear clap and casually launching his opponent into the upper atmosphere. Like another Kombat Pack character in MK1, Omni-Man, Homelander hovers and flies throughout his fights, rushing down his opponents with super speed. In Homelander\u2019s first gameplay, he\u2019s paired with Ferra, the soon-to-be-released Kameo Fighter. Mortal Kombat fans will fondly remember Ferra as the partner of Torr from Mortal Kombat X. She\u2019ll behave much like she did in the past, serving as a spritely combat partner who can be thrown as a projectile when needed. In addition to Homelander\u2019s two Fatalities shown here, we also get a look at Ferra\u2019s: another split-down-the-middle finisher. Homelander and Ferra are part of MK1\u2019s Kombat Pack add-on, which has also brought the following characters to the game\u2019s roster: Quan Chi, DC\u2019s Peacemaker, Invincible\u2019s Omni-Man, and Ermac. The sixth post-launch fighter included in the Kombat Pack is Takeda Takahashi, who arrives sometime this summer. Five Kameo Fighters are also included in the Kombat Pack: Tremor, Ferra, Janet Cage, Khameleon, and Mavado. Mortal Kombat 1\u2019s Kombat Pack, on sale for $15.99 now through Sunday, is also included as part of the Premium Edition of the game, which costs $109.99. Prime Video\u2019s The Boys returns for a fourth season on June 13.", "url": "https://www.polygon.com/24043196/mk1-homelander-gameplay-fatality-mortal-kombat", "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kfpIh4h9ZMYbs2LQ94xp7Srhw6o=/0x0:2560x1340/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25468904/Mortal_Kombat_1___Official_Homelander_Gameplay_Trailer_2_12_screenshot.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 14:21:00", "author": "Michael McWhertor", "authors": ["Michael McWhertor"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.312}

He said such a buffer area \"would be quite difficult to penetrate\" with foreign weapons.Solovyov, who has close ties to Putin, raised this topic on his evening program on the Russia 1 channel where he frequently describes the war started by Putin as a proxy conflict between NATO and Moscow and calls for missile strikes on the West.One guest, Rodion Miroshnik, a Russian foreign ministry ambassador-at-large, asked \"why is there a question about a sanitary zone?\" given that the 20-mile distance between the combat zone and the border city of Belgorod could be breached by Ukrainian artillery and multi-launched rocket systems (MLRS).But Solovyov said that \"the real sanitary zone is the Atlantic,\" with the arrival of F-16 fighter jets and \"missiles that can travel 1,000 km (621 miles).\"Washington gave the go ahead for other countries to supply the U.S.-made aircraft which are expected to appear on the front line this summer. Kyiv is awaiting the delivery of a $61 billion military aid package passed by U.S. Congress in April.\"These dirtbags will not calm down until Russian soldiers are making porridge to feed the liberated citizens of Berlin, Paris and Lisbon,\" he said in comments in a clip shared on X by journalist and Russia watcher, Julia Davis.Solovyov said that he was in favor of \"very harsh methods\" in the war suggesting that a Russian flag would be planted in the rubble after the country's destruction after which \"we will build everything from scratch.\"Solovyov also spoke of the need for \"Nazi dirtbags to be eradicated,\" referring to one of Putin's justifications for his full-scale invasion being to \"denazify\" Ukraine, which has been roundly rejected by Kyiv and the international community.Solovyov then used dehumanizing rhetoric in describing the fight against Ukraine by asking, \"have you ever tried getting rid of bedbugs?\"Next to the video clip, Davis posted on X: \"Meanwhile in Russia: Vladimir Solovyov insisted that Russia's 'sanitary zone' should stretch all the way to the Atlantic.\"He compared Ukrainians to \"bedbugs\" that have to be eradicated, in order for Ukraine to be 'cleansed,\" the posted added.", "summary": "Kremlin propagandist Vladimir Solovyov has said that a buffer zone in the war in Ukraine extends to the Atlantic Ocean.", "url": "https://www.newsweek.com/russia-ukraine-solovyov-nato-1910012", "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2406295/kremlin-propagandist-vladimir-solovyov.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:13:20", "author": "Brendan Cole", "authors": ["Brendan Cole"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.066}

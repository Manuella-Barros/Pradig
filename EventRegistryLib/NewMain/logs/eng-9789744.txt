The condition can make it hard for the infant to extend and lift their tongue to grasp a nipple and draw milk -- which in turn can be painful for the mother.\n\nExperts Say THC Could Linger In Breastmilk\n\nPast research shows that cannabis use has increased significantly among women before pregnancy and after pregnancy, but experts are now warnin...\n\nDoctors say it's critical to get breastfeeding on track in the first three to four weeks, and surveys indicate most parents want to breastfeed, so it's natural that they want a quick solution to a problem, Bunik said.\n\nAnkyloglossia diagnoses have been increasing worldwide, though there is no uniform diagnostic criteria for this condition and no consensus on how to treat it. One common approach is to cut the tissue with scissors, but dentists increasingly are using lasers to vaporize the tissue -- some charging $800 or more.\n\nBut the procedures can cause pain and sore mouths, potentially deterring babies from trying to breastfeed, Bunik said.\n\n\"The practice (of treating tongue-tie) got to be very common without a lot of good data,\" said Wisconsin pediatrician Dr. Jennifer Thomas, who also co-authored the report.\n\nThe report also recommends lactation experts, pediatricians and surgeons and other medical professionals work with parents to evaluate possible reasons for breastfeeding challenges and make the best treatment decision.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics, which has 67,000 members who specialize in treating children, started working on the report in 2015 after some pediatricians began to notice that an increasing number of patients were going to dentists to get treatment for tongue-tie, Thomas said. Pediatricians were finding out after the surgeries.\n\nAt least two other medical groups have issued statements about tongue-tie. In 2020, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery issued a consensus statement in which member physicians said they believe tongue-tie is being overdiagnosed in some places and that there isn't sufficient evidence to support claims that using lasers is superior to other techniques.\n\nA year later, the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine, an international group, issued a position calling for more research into tongue-tie treatment and stressed that decisions \"require a high level of clinical skill, judgment and discernment.\"\n\nThe American Dental Association didn't directly respond to The Associated Press' questions about the new report. It sent a statement saying the organization agrees with a 2022 policy statement by the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry, which noted not all children with ankyloglossia need surgical intervention and that a team-based approach with other specialists can aid in treatment planning.\n\nHaley Brown saw a lactation consultant two years ago after her son Shiloh, who was born prematurely, had trouble nursing. But as months passed and the situation didn't improve, Brown turned to a Denver dentist she heard about on social media The dentist diagnosed Shiloh with tongue-tie and also lip-tie, in which the tissue inside the upper lip is too tight. Shiloh underwent a short laser procedure that cost $750.\n\nBreastfeeding improved immediately. \"Things just seemed a little easier for him,\" said Brown, 33, of Englewood, Colorado.\n\nBrown later had another baby, and another lactation consultant told her that a scissors snip could have been less involved and just as effective.

The condition can make it hard for the infant to extend and lift their tongue to grasp a nipple and draw milk -- which in turn can be painful for the mother.\n\nExperts Say THC Could Linger In Breastmilk\n\nPast research shows that cannabis use has increased significantly among women before pregnancy and after pregnancy, but experts are now warnin...\n\nDoctors say it's critical to get breastfeeding on track in the first three to four weeks, and surveys indicate most parents want to breastfeed, so it's natural that they want a quick solution to a problem, Bunik said.\n\nAnkyloglossia diagnoses have been increasing worldwide, though there is no uniform diagnostic criteria for this condition and no consensus on how to treat it. One common approach is to cut the tissue with scissors, but dentists increasingly are using lasers to vaporize the tissue -- some charging $800 or more.\n\nBut the procedures can cause pain and sore mouths, potentially deterring babies from trying to breastfeed, Bunik said.\n\n\"The practice (of treating tongue-tie) got to be very common without a lot of good data,\" said Wisconsin pediatrician Dr. Jennifer Thomas, who also co-authored the report.\n\nThe report also recommends lactation experts, pediatricians and surgeons and other medical professionals work with parents to evaluate possible reasons for breastfeeding challenges and make the best treatment decision.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics, which has 67,000 members who specialize in treating children, started working on the report in 2015 after some pediatricians began to notice that an increasing number of patients were going to dentists to get treatment for tongue-tie, Thomas said. Pediatricians were finding out after the surgeries.\n\nAt least two other medical groups have issued statements about tongue-tie. In 2020, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery issued a consensus statement in which member physicians said they believe tongue-tie is being overdiagnosed in some places and that there isn't sufficient evidence to support claims that using lasers is superior to other techniques.\n\nA year later, the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine, an international group, issued a position calling for more research into tongue-tie treatment and stressed that decisions \"require a high level of clinical skill, judgment and discernment.\"\n\nThe American Dental Association didn't directly respond to The Associated Press' questions about the new report. It sent a statement saying the organization agrees with a 2022 policy statement by the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry, which noted not all children with ankyloglossia need surgical intervention and that a team-based approach with other specialists can aid in treatment planning.\n\nHaley Brown saw a lactation consultant two years ago after her son Shiloh, who was born prematurely, had trouble nursing. But as months passed and the situation didn't improve, Brown turned to a Denver dentist she heard about on social media The dentist diagnosed Shiloh with tongue-tie and also lip-tie, in which the tissue inside the upper lip is too tight. Shiloh underwent a short laser procedure that cost $750.\n\nBreastfeeding improved immediately. \"Things just seemed a little easier for him,\" said Brown, 33, of Englewood, Colorado.\n\nBrown later had another baby, and another lactation consultant told her that a scissors snip could have been less involved and just as effective.

The condition can make it hard for the infant to extend and lift their tongue to grasp a nipple and draw milk -- which in turn can be painful for the mother.\n\nExperts Say THC Could Linger In Breastmilk\n\nPast research shows that cannabis use has increased significantly among women before pregnancy and after pregnancy, but experts are now warnin...\n\nDoctors say it's critical to get breastfeeding on track in the first three to four weeks, and surveys indicate most parents want to breastfeed, so it's natural that they want a quick solution to a problem, Bunik said.\n\nAnkyloglossia diagnoses have been increasing worldwide, though there is no uniform diagnostic criteria for this condition and no consensus on how to treat it. One common approach is to cut the tissue with scissors, but dentists increasingly are using lasers to vaporize the tissue -- some charging $800 or more.\n\nBut the procedures can cause pain and sore mouths, potentially deterring babies from trying to breastfeed, Bunik said.\n\n\"The practice (of treating tongue-tie) got to be very common without a lot of good data,\" said Wisconsin pediatrician Dr. Jennifer Thomas, who also co-authored the report.\n\nThe report also recommends lactation experts, pediatricians and surgeons and other medical professionals work with parents to evaluate possible reasons for breastfeeding challenges and make the best treatment decision.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics, which has 67,000 members who specialize in treating children, started working on the report in 2015 after some pediatricians began to notice that an increasing number of patients were going to dentists to get treatment for tongue-tie, Thomas said. Pediatricians were finding out after the surgeries.\n\nAt least two other medical groups have issued statements about tongue-tie. In 2020, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery issued a consensus statement in which member physicians said they believe tongue-tie is being overdiagnosed in some places and that there isn't sufficient evidence to support claims that using lasers is superior to other techniques.\n\nA year later, the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine, an international group, issued a position calling for more research into tongue-tie treatment and stressed that decisions \"require a high level of clinical skill, judgment and discernment.\"\n\nThe American Dental Association didn't directly respond to The Associated Press' questions about the new report. It sent a statement saying the organization agrees with a 2022 policy statement by the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry, which noted not all children with ankyloglossia need surgical intervention and that a team-based approach with other specialists can aid in treatment planning.\n\nHaley Brown saw a lactation consultant two years ago after her son Shiloh, who was born prematurely, had trouble nursing. But as months passed and the situation didn't improve, Brown turned to a Denver dentist she heard about on social media The dentist diagnosed Shiloh with tongue-tie and also lip-tie, in which the tissue inside the upper lip is too tight. Shiloh underwent a short laser procedure that cost $750.\n\nBreastfeeding improved immediately. \"Things just seemed a little easier for him,\" said Brown, 33, of Englewood, Colorado.\n\nBrown later had another baby, and another lactation consultant told her that a scissors snip could have been less involved and just as effective. Brown said the laser treatment worked for Shiloh, but added: \"I probably should have consulted with my pediatrician before I went straight to the dentist.\"\n\nDo health policies keep exclusive breastfeeding out of reach?

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nExperts have sounded the alarm over a surge in baby tongue-tie surgeries. The American Academy of Paediatrics is the latest health firm to express concern regarding the increased use of scissors or lasers to snip infants' tongue tissue when breastfeeding proves challenging.\n\n\"It's almost an epidemic,\" Dr. Maya Bunik, who co-authored the academy's report and is based in Colorado, was quoted by the Independent. While there isn't a precise figure on how many babies undergo tongue-tie surgery each year, Dr. Bunik estimates it could be over 100,000.\n\nShe pointed out that research indicates many of these procedures might be unnecessary. The academy's recent report urges paediatricians and other healthcare providers to explore non-surgical methods for resolving breastfeeding issues.\n\nIt references a study which found that fewer than half of the infants identified with tongue-tie symptoms actually experience breastfeeding difficulties. Dr Jennifer Thomas, a paediatrician from Wisconsin and fellow co-author of the report, commented on the trend.\n\nShe said: \"The practice (of treating tongue-tie) got to be very common without a lot of good data.\" She highlighted that the surgeries can lead to pain and soreness in the mouth, which may discourage babies from breastfeeding.\n\nThe NHS explains that tongue-tie is a condition where the strip of skin connecting the baby's tongue to the bottom of their mouth is shorter or tighter than usual. While it's most common in babies and might not always cause issues, treatment options are available if needed.\n\nIn babies, tongue-tie can make it difficult for them to breastfeed or bottle-feed. They may:\n\nhave difficulty attaching (latching) or staying attached to the breast or bottle teat feed for a long time and need to be fed very often dribble a lot during feeds cough, choke or make clicking noises when feeding only take a small amount of milk at each feed lose weight or struggle to put on weight\n\nIf your baby has tongue-tie and you're breastfeeding, you may have sore nipples or painful and swollen breasts.", "source": {"uri": "walesonline.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "WalesOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lucy_domachowski@walesonline.co.uk", "name": "Lucy Domachowski", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue-tie_(tack)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tongue-tie (tack)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pediatrics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breastfeeding", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Breastfeeding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Infant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epidemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Laser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tissue (biology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_markings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horse markings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Thomas_(pianist)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Thomas (pianist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mouth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nipple", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nipple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Skin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Breast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cough"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Birth_Control", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Birth Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Wounds_and_Injuries", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Wounds and Injuries", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Teen_Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Teen Pregnancy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/First_Aid", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/First Aid", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://i2-prod.walesonline.co.uk/incoming/article29670818.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-542734621.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789744", "eventUri": "eng-9789744", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 233, "relevance": 1}

Research suggests many of those treatments are not necessary, she added.\n\nThe academy's new report encourages pediatricians and other medical professionals to consider nonsurgical options to address breastfeeding problems. The report cites a study that suggests less than half of the kids with the characteristics of tongue-tie actually have difficulty breastfeeding.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The condition can make it hard for the infant to extend and lift their tongue to grasp a nipple and draw milk -- which in turn can be painful for the mother.\n\nExperts Say THC Could Linger In Breastmilk\n\nPast research shows that cannabis use has increased significantly among women before pregnancy and after pregnancy, but experts are now warnin...\n\nDoctors say it's critical to get breastfeeding on track in the first three to four weeks, and surveys indicate most parents want to breastfeed, so it's natural that they want a quick solution to a problem, Bunik said.\n\nAnkyloglossia diagnoses have been increasing worldwide, though there is no uniform diagnostic criteria for this condition and no consensus on how to treat it. One common approach is to cut the tissue with scissors, but dentists increasingly are using lasers to vaporize the tissue -- some charging $800 or more.\n\nBut the procedures can cause pain and sore mouths, potentially deterring babies from trying to breastfeed, Bunik said.\n\n\"The practice (of treating tongue-tie) got to be very common without a lot of good data,\" said Wisconsin pediatrician Dr. Jennifer Thomas, who also co-authored the report.\n\nThe report also recommends lactation experts, pediatricians and surgeons and other medical professionals work with parents to evaluate possible reasons for breastfeeding challenges and make the best treatment decision.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics, which has 67,000 members who specialize in treating children, started working on the report in 2015 after some pediatricians began to notice that an increasing number of patients were going to dentists to get treatment for tongue-tie, Thomas said. Pediatricians were finding out after the surgeries.\n\nAt least two other medical groups have issued statements about tongue-tie. In 2020, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery issued a consensus statement in which member physicians said they believe tongue-tie is being overdiagnosed in some places and that there isn't sufficient evidence to support claims that using lasers is superior to other techniques.\n\nA year later, the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine, an international group, issued a position calling for more research into tongue-tie treatment and stressed that decisions \"require a high level of clinical skill, judgment and discernment.\"\n\nThe American Dental Association didn't directly respond to The Associated Press' questions about the new report. It sent a statement saying the organization agrees with a 2022 policy statement by the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry, which noted not all children with ankyloglossia need surgical intervention and that a team-based approach with other specialists can aid in treatment planning.\n\nHaley Brown saw a lactation consultant two years ago after her son Shiloh, who was born prematurely, had trouble nursing. But as months passed and the situation didn't improve, Brown turned to a Denver dentist she heard about on social media The dentist diagnosed Shiloh with tongue-tie and also lip-tie, in which the tissue inside the upper lip is too tight. Shiloh underwent a short laser procedure that cost $750.\n\nBreastfeeding improved immediately. \"Things just seemed a little easier for him,\" said Brown, 33, of Englewood, Colorado.\n\nBrown later had another baby, and another lactation consultant told her that a scissors snip could have been less involved and just as effective. Brown said the laser treatment worked for Shiloh, but added: \"I probably should have consulted with my pediatrician before I went straight to the dentist.\"\n\nDo health policies keep exclusive breastfeeding out of reach?

The condition can make it hard for the infant to extend and lift their tongue to grasp a nipple and draw milk -- which in turn can be painful for the mother.\n\nExperts Say THC Could Linger In Breastmilk\n\nPast research shows that cannabis use has increased significantly among women before pregnancy and after pregnancy, but experts are now warnin...\n\nDoctors say it's critical to get breastfeeding on track in the first three to four weeks, and surveys indicate most parents want to breastfeed, so it's natural that they want a quick solution to a problem, Bunik said.\n\nAnkyloglossia diagnoses have been increasing worldwide, though there is no uniform diagnostic criteria for this condition and no consensus on how to treat it. One common approach is to cut the tissue with scissors, but dentists increasingly are using lasers to vaporize the tissue -- some charging $800 or more.\n\nBut the procedures can cause pain and sore mouths, potentially deterring babies from trying to breastfeed, Bunik said.\n\n\"The practice (of treating tongue-tie) got to be very common without a lot of good data,\" said Wisconsin pediatrician Dr. Jennifer Thomas, who also co-authored the report.\n\nThe report also recommends lactation experts, pediatricians and surgeons and other medical professionals work with parents to evaluate possible reasons for breastfeeding challenges and make the best treatment decision.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics, which has 67,000 members who specialize in treating children, started working on the report in 2015 after some pediatricians began to notice that an increasing number of patients were going to dentists to get treatment for tongue-tie, Thomas said. Pediatricians were finding out after the surgeries.\n\nAt least two other medical groups have issued statements about tongue-tie. In 2020, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery issued a consensus statement in which member physicians said they believe tongue-tie is being overdiagnosed in some places and that there isn't sufficient evidence to support claims that using lasers is superior to other techniques.\n\nA year later, the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine, an international group, issued a position calling for more research into tongue-tie treatment and stressed that decisions \"require a high level of clinical skill, judgment and discernment.\"\n\nThe American Dental Association didn't directly respond to The Associated Press' questions about the new report. It sent a statement saying the organization agrees with a 2022 policy statement by the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry, which noted not all children with ankyloglossia need surgical intervention and that a team-based approach with other specialists can aid in treatment planning.\n\nHaley Brown saw a lactation consultant two years ago after her son Shiloh, who was born prematurely, had trouble nursing. But as months passed and the situation didn't improve, Brown turned to a Denver dentist she heard about on social media The dentist diagnosed Shiloh with tongue-tie and also lip-tie, in which the tissue inside the upper lip is too tight. Shiloh underwent a short laser procedure that cost $750.\n\nBreastfeeding improved immediately. \"Things just seemed a little easier for him,\" said Brown, 33, of Englewood, Colorado.\n\nBrown later had another baby, and another lactation consultant told her that a scissors snip could have been less involved and just as effective. Brown said the laser treatment worked for Shiloh, but added: \"I probably should have consulted with my pediatrician before I went straight to the dentist.\"\n\nDo health policies keep exclusive breastfeeding out of reach?

The condition can make it hard for the infant to extend and lift their tongue to grasp a nipple and draw milk -- which in turn can be painful for the mother.\n\nExperts Say THC Could Linger In Breastmilk\n\nPast research shows that cannabis use has increased significantly among women before pregnancy and after pregnancy, but experts are now warnin...\n\nDoctors say it's critical to get breastfeeding on track in the first three to four weeks, and surveys indicate most parents want to breastfeed, so it's natural that they want a quick solution to a problem, Bunik said.\n\nAnkyloglossia diagnoses have been increasing worldwide, though there is no uniform diagnostic criteria for this condition and no consensus on how to treat it. One common approach is to cut the tissue with scissors, but dentists increasingly are using lasers to vaporize the tissue -- some charging $800 or more.\n\nBut the procedures can cause pain and sore mouths, potentially deterring babies from trying to breastfeed, Bunik said.\n\n\"The practice (of treating tongue-tie) got to be very common without a lot of good data,\" said Wisconsin pediatrician Dr. Jennifer Thomas, who also co-authored the report.\n\nThe report also recommends lactation experts, pediatricians and surgeons and other medical professionals work with parents to evaluate possible reasons for breastfeeding challenges and make the best treatment decision.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics, which has 67,000 members who specialize in treating children, started working on the report in 2015 after some pediatricians began to notice that an increasing number of patients were going to dentists to get treatment for tongue-tie, Thomas said. Pediatricians were finding out after the surgeries.\n\nAt least two other medical groups have issued statements about tongue-tie. In 2020, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery issued a consensus statement in which member physicians said they believe tongue-tie is being overdiagnosed in some places and that there isn't sufficient evidence to support claims that using lasers is superior to other techniques.\n\nA year later, the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine, an international group, issued a position calling for more research into tongue-tie treatment and stressed that decisions \"require a high level of clinical skill, judgment and discernment.\"\n\nThe American Dental Association didn't directly respond to The Associated Press' questions about the new report. It sent a statement saying the organization agrees with a 2022 policy statement by the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry, which noted not all children with ankyloglossia need surgical intervention and that a team-based approach with other specialists can aid in treatment planning.\n\nHaley Brown saw a lactation consultant two years ago after her son Shiloh, who was born prematurely, had trouble nursing. But as months passed and the situation didn't improve, Brown turned to a Denver dentist she heard about on social media The dentist diagnosed Shiloh with tongue-tie and also lip-tie, in which the tissue inside the upper lip is too tight. Shiloh underwent a short laser procedure that cost $750.\n\nBreastfeeding improved immediately. \"Things just seemed a little easier for him,\" said Brown, 33, of Englewood, Colorado.\n\nBrown later had another baby, and another lactation consultant told her that a scissors snip could have been less involved and just as effective.

Research suggests many of those treatments are not necessary, she added.\n\nThe academy's new report encourages pediatricians and other medical professionals to consider nonsurgical options to address breastfeeding problems. The report cites a study that suggests less than half of the kids with the characteristics of tongue-tie actually have difficulty breastfeeding.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The condition can make it hard for the infant to extend and lift their tongue to grasp a nipple and draw milk -- which in turn can be painful for the mother.\n\nExperts Say THC Could Linger In Breastmilk\n\nPast research shows that cannabis use has increased significantly among women before pregnancy and after pregnancy, but experts are now warnin...\n\nDoctors say it's critical to get breastfeeding on track in the first three to four weeks, and surveys indicate most parents want to breastfeed, so it's natural that they want a quick solution to a problem, Bunik said.\n\nAnkyloglossia diagnoses have been increasing worldwide, though there is no uniform diagnostic criteria for this condition and no consensus on how to treat it. One common approach is to cut the tissue with scissors, but dentists increasingly are using lasers to vaporize the tissue -- some charging $800 or more.\n\nBut the procedures can cause pain and sore mouths, potentially deterring babies from trying to breastfeed, Bunik said.\n\n\"The practice (of treating tongue-tie) got to be very common without a lot of good data,\" said Wisconsin pediatrician Dr. Jennifer Thomas, who also co-authored the report.\n\nThe report also recommends lactation experts, pediatricians and surgeons and other medical professionals work with parents to evaluate possible reasons for breastfeeding challenges and make the best treatment decision.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics, which has 67,000 members who specialize in treating children, started working on the report in 2015 after some pediatricians began to notice that an increasing number of patients were going to dentists to get treatment for tongue-tie, Thomas said. Pediatricians were finding out after the surgeries.\n\nAt least two other medical groups have issued statements about tongue-tie. In 2020, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery issued a consensus statement in which member physicians said they believe tongue-tie is being overdiagnosed in some places and that there isn't sufficient evidence to support claims that using lasers is superior to other techniques.\n\nA year later, the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine, an international group, issued a position calling for more research into tongue-tie treatment and stressed that decisions \"require a high level of clinical skill, judgment and discernment.\"\n\nThe American Dental Association didn't directly respond to The Associated Press' questions about the new report. It sent a statement saying the organization agrees with a 2022 policy statement by the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry, which noted not all children with ankyloglossia need surgical intervention and that a team-based approach with other specialists can aid in treatment planning.\n\nHaley Brown saw a lactation consultant two years ago after her son Shiloh, who was born prematurely, had trouble nursing. But as months passed and the situation didn't improve, Brown turned to a Denver dentist she heard about on social media The dentist diagnosed Shiloh with tongue-tie and also lip-tie, in which the tissue inside the upper lip is too tight. Shiloh underwent a short laser procedure that cost $750.\n\nBreastfeeding improved immediately. \"Things just seemed a little easier for him,\" said Brown, 33, of Englewood, Colorado.\n\nBrown later had another baby, and another lactation consultant told her that a scissors snip could have been less involved and just as effective. Brown said the laser treatment worked for Shiloh, but added: \"I probably should have consulted with my pediatrician before I went straight to the dentist.\"\n\nDo health policies keep exclusive breastfeeding out of reach?

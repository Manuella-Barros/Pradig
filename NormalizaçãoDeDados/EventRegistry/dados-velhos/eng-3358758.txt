They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.\" Friday morning, Trump warned North Korea that the US military is \"locked and loaded.\"\n\nTrump has learned that bombing other countries enhances a president's popularity. In April, with 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles, each armed with over 1,000 pounds of explosives, he went from scoundrel-in-chief to national hero virtually overnight. The corporate media, the neoconservatives and most of Congress hailed Trump as strong and presidential for lobbing the missiles into Syria, reportedly killing nine civilians, including four children.\n\nSeveral hours after Trump's recent \"fire and fury\" statement, Pyongyang warned it was \"carefully examining\" a strike that would create \"an enveloping fire\" around Guam, the site of an important US military base and home to more than 160,000 people.\n\nNorth Korea has accused the United States of planning a \"preventive war,\" saying that plans to mount one would be met with an \"all-out war, wiping out all the strongholds of enemies, including the US mainland.\" A spokesman for the General Staff of the Korean People's Army promised, \"the tragic end of the American empire will be hastened.\"\n\nIn an attempt to tamp down fears of all-out war, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said there is not \"any imminent threat\" from North Korea.\n\nBut Defense Secretary James Mattis cautioned that Pyongyang \"should cease any consideration of actions that would lead to the end of its regime and the destruction of its people.\" And National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster said that the White House is considering all options, including \"preventative war.\"\n\nTrump's bellicose rhetoric against North Korea began shortly after the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) claimed that Pyongyang has developed a miniature nuclear warhead for its missiles. A DNI report issued in July said, \"North Korea has produced nuclear weapons for ballistic-missile delivery, to include delivery by ICBM-class missiles,\" according to the Washington Post.\n\nThe DNI's claim is questionable, however, as none of the other US intelligence agencies has ratified it. In fact, the DNI issued an identical report on North Korean nuclear capabilities in 2013.\n\nTrump has indicated his willingness to use nuclear weapons. In August 2016 MSNBC's Joe Scarborough reported that Trump asked a senior foreign policy adviser about nuclear weapons three times during a briefing, then queried, \"If we had them why can't we use them?\"\n\nAn Attack on North Korea Would Be Dangerous\n\nThe Intercept reports that \"even a conventional war between the US and [North Korea] could kill more than 1 million people; a nuclear exchange, therefore, might result in tens of millions of casualties.\"\n\nMore than 60 House Democrats, led by Rep. John Conyers (D-Michigan), sent a letter to Tillerson expressing their \"profound concern over the statements made by President Trump that dramatically increased tensions with North Korea and raised the specter of nuclear war.\" The letter says, \"These statements are irresponsible and dangerous, and also senselessly provide a boon to domestic North Korean propaganda which has long sought to portray the United States as a threat to their people.\"\n\nThe letter to Tillerson quoted a prior letter sent to Trump by 64 Congress members in May, which said:\n\nMilitary action against North Korea was considered by the Obama, Bush and Clinton Administrations, but all ultimately determined there was no military option that would not run the unacceptable risk of a counter-reaction from Pyongyang [that] could immediately threaten the lives of as many as a third of the South Korean population, put nearly 30,000 U.S. service members and over 100,000 other U.S. citizens residing in South Korea in grave danger, and also threaten other regional allies such as Japan.\n\n\"Simply put, there is no military solution to this problem,\" the August letter continued. \"We respectfully but firmly urge you to do everything in your power to ensure that President Trump and other Administration officials understand the importance of speaking and acting with the utmost caution and restraint on this delicate issue. Congress and the American public will hold President Trump responsible if a careless or ill-advised miscalculation results in conflict that endangers our servicemembers and regional allies.\"\n\nNevertheless, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) stated, \"If there's going to be a war to stop [Kim Jong-un], it will be over there. If thousands die, they're going to die over there. They're not going to die here. And [Trump] has told me that to my face.\"\n\nTrump and Graham apparently feel that massive casualties are acceptable as long as they don't occur on the US mainland.\n\nA Preemptive Strike on North Korea Would Violate the UN Charter\n\nA preemptive strike on North Korea would be illegal. It would violate the United Nations Charter, which forbids the use of military force unless conducted in self-defense or when approved by the Security Council.\n\n\"Self-defense\" is a narrow exception to the Charter's prohibition of the use of force. Countries may engage in individual or collective self-defense only in the face of an armed attack. There must exist \"a necessity of self-defense, instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation,\" under the well-established Caroline Case. In the case of North Korea, there has been no armed attack, and there is no imminent threat of one.\n\nThe Charter specifies that non-forceful measures, including diplomacy, must be pursued in order to maintain or restore international peace and security.\n\nOn August 5, in response to North Korea's recent test launches of two intercontinental ballistic missiles, the UN Security Council unanimously enacted a sanctions regime that would reduce North Korea's annual export earnings by at least one-third, an estimated $1 billion. It would affect 90 percent of North Korea's economy. Resolution 2371 targets North Korea's primary exports, which include iron, iron ore, coal, lead, lead ore and seafood. It is also aimed at banks and joint ventures between North Korea and foreign corporations. The resolution imposes the toughest sanctions on North Korea to date.\n\nThe resolution does not, however, authorize the United States or any other country to use military force against North Korea. It ends by stating that the Security Council \"decides to remain seized of the matter.\" That means that the Council, and only the Council, has the authority to approve military action.\n\nTillerson has called for direct talks with North Korea and offered assurances that the United States is not its enemy and does not seek regime change.\n\nBut CIA Director Mike Pompeo strongly intimated that the US is considering regime change in North Korea.\n\nFor North Korea, the past is prologue. Determined to avoid the fate of Saddam Hussein, who didn't have nukes, as well as that of Muammar Qaddafi, who did but relinquished them, Pyongyang is developing a nuclear deterrent. Kim Jong-un has repeatedly maintained that North Korea's nuclear capabilities are critical to its self-defense.\n\nIndeed, Dan Coats, director of national intelligence, told the Aspen Security Forum of Kim Jong-un: \"There is some rationale backing his actions, which are survival -- survival for his regime, survival for his country. And he has watched, I think, what has happened around the world relative to nations that possess nuclear capabilities and the leverage they have, and seen that having the nuclear card in your pocket results in a lot of deterrence capability.\"\n\nSign a Peace Treaty, End the Korean War\n\nMoreover, North Korea cannot forget the 1950-1953 Korean War, which reduced North Korea's population of 10 million by approximately one-third. Sixty-four years ago, the United States and North Korea signed an armistice agreement, but the US never permitted the creation of a peace treaty.\n\nOn several occasions, North Korea has suggested a way to a lasting peace. Christine Hong, associate professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, wrote in the Progressive, \"Unsurprisingly, few media outlets have reported on North Korea's overtures to the United States, even as these, if pursued, might result in meaningful de-escalation on both sides. To be clear: peaceful alternatives are at hand. Far from being an intractable foe, North Korea has repeatedly asked the United States to sign a peace treaty that would bring the unresolved Korean War to a long-overdue end.\"\n\nA month ago, China and Russia proposed a \"freeze-for-freeze\" strategy, which would entail North Korea freezing its nuclear and missile testing, and in return, the US and South Korea would end their annual joint military exercises. This proposal, issued in a joint statement by the Chinese and Russian Foreign Ministries after meetings between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, is a diplomatic solution that should be pursued. Vassily Nebenzia, Russia's ambassador to the UN, said this plan would offer \"a way out\" of the present situation.\n\nThe Congress members' letter to Tillerson cited successful efforts at direct diplomacy between Washington and Pyongyang in 1994 and 2000, later scuttled by Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security John Bolton under George W. Bush.\n\nBolton told Fox Business on Monday, \"I don't think there are any further diplomatic options in terms of trying to persuade North Korea to change its behavior.\" And Vice President Mike Pence said \"engaging North Korea directly\" is a non-starter at the present time.\n\nBut Susan Rice, Barack Obama's national security adviser and US ambassador to the UN, wrote in the New York Times, \"We have long lived with successive Kims' belligerent and colorful rhetoric.... I came to expect it whenever we passed resolutions. What is unprecedented and especially dangerous this time,\" however, \"is the reaction of President Trump.\" His threats, Rice wrote, \"risk tipping the Korean Peninsula into war, if the North's leader, Kim Jong-un, believes them and acts precipitously.\"\n\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in told Trump in a recent telephone call, \"South Korea can never accept a war erupting again on the Korean Peninsula,\" rather \"the North Korean nuclear issue must be resolved in a peaceful, diplomatic manner through a close coordination between South Korea and the United States.\"\n\nIn May, Trump told Bloomberg News that he would meet with Kim Jong-un: \"If it would be appropriate for me to meet with him, I would absolutely, I would be honored to do it ... under the right circumstances. But I would do that.\"\n\nAs we stand on the precipice of a disastrous war, these are the right circumstances for Trump to meet with Kim Jong-un. If Trump were to successfully negotiate a peace treaty with North Korea, he would receive plaudits for being a real diplomat.

He will head then head to China on the previously scheduled visit, Yonhap News Agency reported, citing an unidentified military official.\n\nDunford's Asia visit comes as fears grow that a war of words between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un will lead to a miscalculation that sparks an actual military conflict. In a call with Trump on Saturday, President Xi Jinping called for all sides to maintain restraint and avoid inflammatory comments.\n\nA tweet from the joint chiefs on Sunday showed him arriving at Yokota Air Base in Japan.\n\nThe US hasn't taken any public steps to prepare for hostilities such as evacuating Americans from Seoul, which is within range of North Korean artillery, or moving ships, aircraft or troops into position for an imminent response. The US has about 28,500 troops stationed in South Korea.\n\nFollowing Trump's vow to unleash \"fire and fury\" on North Korea, Kim's government threatened to fire missiles over Japan into waters near Guam, home to US military bases. The US and its allies warned Kim against such a move and Japan deployed four Patriot missile interceptors into the western part of the country.\n\nSome analysts expect further escalation in the coming days as North and South Korea celebrate the August 15 anniversary of the end of Japan's occupation of the Korean peninsula and Seoul conducts joint military exercises with the US from August 21. Japan is also holding annual drills with the US over the next few weeks.\n\nNorth Korean media on Sunday condemned the planned military drills and said the US is \"letting out dangerous war rhetoric\" and Trump's \"wild remarks\" are causing concern and anger in South Korea.\n\nMoon's administration has pushed to start talks with North Korea even while looking to strengthen its defences. On Sunday, Deputy Unification Minister Chun Haesung said South Korea was seeking to ease tensions and the door for dialogue with North Korea was still open.\n\nSatellite photos suggest North Korea preparing submarine missile test: report\n\nDunford said last month that it was \"unimaginable\" to allow North Korea to develop the capability to strike a US city with a nuclear weapon.\n\nMore recently, Defence Secretary James Mattis has sought to reassure US partners in the region. He said on Thursday that the US works closely with its allies to ensure that any military response wouldn't be unilateral, warning that the impact of a conflict \"would be catastrophic\".\n\nTrump has continued to take an aggressive tone on North Korea. On Friday, Trump said if Kim makes any \"overt threat\" or strike at a US territory or ally \"he will truly regret it and he will regret it fast\". Trump also said the US was considering tighter sanctions against North Korea.\n\n\"Hopefully it will all work out,\" he told reporters in Bedminster, New Jersey. \"Nobody loves a peaceful solution better than President Trump.\"\n\nChina, North Korea's main benefactor, agreed to harsh United Nations sanctions earlier this month even while calling on all sides to take a step back and negotiate a solution.\n\nUS should prepare to shoot down North Korean missiles if Kim doesn't ditch Guam strike plan: experts\n\nTrump's posture suggested he was trying to dissuade Kim from further provocations rather than setting the stage for a US military strike, according to Terence Roehrig, a national security affairs professor at the US Naval War College in Newport.\n\n\"The president's rhetoric could be aimed at China, but largely it is aimed at North Korea, trying to deter,\" Roehrig said. \"North Koreans are not suicidal. They may continue launching missile tests but they don't want a war, and the US doesn't want military action either.\"", "timeCrawl": "10:54:00", "sim": 0.729411780834198, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 1663, "date": "2017-08-15", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1672}, {"textStart": 1803, "date": "2017-08-21", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1812}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8904585", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "id": 164, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Topic", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Topic", "id": 653, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Defense", "id": 778, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

avoid words or action that raise tensions.\n\nXi's comments came hours after Trump warned North Korea that the U.S. military was \"locked and loaded\" as Pyongyang accused the U.S. leader of driving the Korean peninsula to the brink of nuclear war.\n\nThe Pentagon said the United States and South Korea would proceed as planned with a joint military exercise in 10 days, an action sure to further antagonize North Korea.\n\nChina's foreign ministry said in a statement that Xi told Trump a peaceful resolution to the North Korean nuclear issue was essential, and urged calm.\n\n\"Concerned parties must exercise restraint and avoid remarks and actions that escalate tensions on the Korean peninsula,\" it cited Xi as saying.\n\nIn their phone call, Trump and Xi \"agreed North Korea must stop its provocative and escalatory behavior,\" the White House said in a statement, and reiterated their mutual commitment to denuclearize the Korean peninsula. It added the relationship between Trump and Xi was \"extremely close\" and \"will hopefully lead to a peaceful resolution of the North Korea problem.\"\n\nTrump, vacationing at his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf resort, earlier took to Twitter to warn North Korean leader Kim Jong Un that U.S. \"military solutions are now fully in place, locked and loaded, should North Korea act unwisely\".\n\nAgain referring to Kim, Trump added, \"If he utters one threat ... or if he does anything with respect to Guam or any place else that's an American territory or an American ally, he will truly regret it, and he will regret it fast.\"\n\nIn remarks to reporters on Friday after a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, Trump said the situation with North Korea was \"very dangerous and it will not continue\".\n\nHe added, \"We will see what happens. We think that lots of good things could happen, and we could also have a bad solution.\"\n\nDespite the tough rhetoric, Trump insisted that \"nobody loves a peaceful solution better than President Trump.\"\n\nSouth Korea's presidential Blue House said in a statement on Saturday the United States and China were working to resolve the North Korea crisis, and it hoped the two leaders' phone call \"will be able to resolve the peak of tension and act as a catalyst for the situation to move on to a new dimension.\"\n\nGuam, the Pacific island that is a U.S. territory and home to a U.S. air base, a Navy installation, a Coast Guard group and around 6,000 U.S. military personnel, posted emergency guidelines on Friday to help residents prepare for any potential nuclear attack.\n\nNorth Korean state news agency KCNA said on Thursday the North Korean army would complete plans in mid-August to fire four intermediate-range missiles over Japan to land in the sea 18 to 25 miles (30 to 40 km) from Guam.\n\nJapan's government decided to deploy its Patriot missile defense system to four locations in the west of the country, media reported. No one at Japan's defense ministry was available to comment on Saturday.\n\nTrump said he did not want to talk about diplomatic \"back channels\" with North Korea after U.S. media reports that Joseph Yun, the U.S. envoy for North Korea policy, had engaged in diplomacy for several months with Pak Song Il, a senior diplomat at Pyongyang's U.N. mission, on the deteriorating ties and the issue of Americans imprisoned in North Korea.\n\nBut Daniel Russel, until April the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia, said this so-called New York channel had been a relatively commonplace means of communication with North Korea over the years, and was not a forum for negotiation.\n\n\"It's never been a vehicle for negotiations and this doesn't constitute substantive U.S.-DPRK dialogue,\" he said, using the acronym for North Korea's formal name, Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\n\nBoth Moscow and Berlin expressed alarm over the rise in rhetoric over North Korea, and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov urged Pyongyang and Washington to sign up to a joint Russian-Chinese plan by which North Korea would freeze missile tests and the United States and South Korea would impose a moratorium on large-scale military exercises. Neither the United States nor North Korea has embraced the plan.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said there is no military solution, adding that \"an escalation of the rhetoric is the wrong answer.\"\n\nThe French presidency said North Korea was engaged in a \"dangerous escalation\" of tensions.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron \"calls for all parties to act responsibly and prevent any further escalation in tensions,\" the Elysee palace said in a statement.\n\nTrump and Macron spoke on Saturday. The White House said Trump reiterated the U.S. commitment to stop the \"North Korean nuclear menace\" and said Washington was ready with diplomatic, economic and military measures.\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said blame for problems lay with North Korea, and that the international community was \"shoulder to shoulder\" in efforts to stop North Korean aggression.\n\n\"We are working with the US and our partners in the region to bring this crisis to a diplomatic end,\" he tweeted.\n\nAs the rhetoric has ratcheted up, South Koreans are buying more ready-to-eat meals for emergency use, and the government aims to expand nationwide civil defense drills planned for Aug. 23.

He will head to China next on the previously scheduled visit, Yonhap News Agency reported, citing an unidentified military official.\n\nDunford's Asia visit comes as fears grow that a war of words between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will lead to a miscalculation that sparks an actual military conflict. In a call with Trump on Saturday in Asia, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for all sides to maintain restraint and avoid inflammatory comments.\n\nThe U.S. Pacific Command referred all questions on Dunford's schedule to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Nobody at the office picked up the phone after regular working hours. A tweet from the joint chiefs on Sunday showed him arriving at Yokota Air Base in Japan.\n\nThe U.S. hasn't taken any public steps to prepare for hostilities such as evacuating Americans from Seoul, which is within range of North Korean artillery, or moving ships, aircraft or troops into position for an imminent response. The U.S. has about 28,500 troops stationed in South Korea.\n\nRead more on signs that a war may be coming\n\nFollowing Trump's vow to unleash \"fire and fury\" on North Korea, Kim's regime threatened to fire four Hwasong-12 missiles over Japan into waters near Guam, home to U.S. military bases in the region. The U.S. and its allies warned Kim against such a move, and Japan deployed four Patriot missile interceptors into the western part of the country.\n\nSome analysts expect further escalation in the coming days as both North and South Korea celebrate the Aug. 15 anniversary of the end of Japan's occupation of the Korean peninsula, and the latter conducts joint military exercises with the U.S. from Aug. 21. Japan is also holding annual military drills with the U.S. over the next few weeks.\n\nNorth Korea's state-run media on Sunday condemned the planned military drills and said the U.S. is \"letting out dangerous war rhetoric.\" The Korean Central News Agency added that Trump's \"wild remarks\" are causing concern and anger in South Korea.\n\nMoon's administration has pushed to start talks with North Korea even while looking to strengthen its defenses after North Korea test-fired two intercontinental ballistic missiles in July. On Sunday, Deputy Unification Minister Chun Haesung said South Korea was seeking to ease tensions and the door for dialogue with North Korea was still open.\n\n'Die Over There'\n\nRecent comments from Trump have raised concerns that the U.S. would be willing to accept collateral damage among its Asian allies to protect the American homeland.\n\nDunford said last month that it was \"unimaginable\" to allow North Korea to develop the capability to strike a U.S. city with a nuclear weapon. South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican, told NBC News that Trump told him that \"if thousands die, they're going to die over there.\"\n\nMore recently, Defense Secretary James Mattis has sought to reassure U.S. partners in the region. He said on Thursday that the U.S. works closely with its allies to ensure that any military response wouldn't be unilateral, warning that the impact of a conflict \"would be catastrophic.\"\n\nTrump has continued to take an aggressive tone on North Korea. On Friday, Trump said that if Kim makes any \"overt threat\" or strike at a U.S. territory or ally \"he will truly regret it and he will regret it fast.\" Trump also said the U.S. was considering tighter sanctions against North Korea.\n\nChina Pressure\n\n\"Hopefully it will all work out,\" he told reporters in Bedminster, New Jersey. \"Nobody loves a peaceful solution better than President Trump.\"\n\nChina, North Korea's main benefactor, agreed to harsh United Nations sanctions earlier this month even while calling on all sides to take a step back and negotiate a solution. Beijing is reluctant to put so much pressure on the regime that it risks collapse, in part to avoid a scenario that could lead to a unified Korea and push U.S. troops right up to China's border.\n\nTrump has sought to pressure China to do more by linking action on North Korea to better trade terms. On Monday, he plans to take steps that will increase pressure on China over what the U.S. perceives to be theft of intellectual property.\n\nTrump's posture suggested he was trying to dissuade Kim from further provocations rather than setting the stage for a U.S. military strike, according to Terence Roehrig, a national security affairs professor at the U.S. Naval War College in Newport.\n\n\"The president's rhetoric could be aimed at China, but largely it is aimed at North Korea, trying to deter,\" Roehrig said. \"North Koreans are not suicidal. They may continue launching missile tests but they don't want a war, and the U.S. doesn't want military action either.\"", "timeCrawl": "11:52:00", "sim": 0.7058823704719543, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 1926, "date": "2017-08-15", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1933}, {"textStart": 2072, "date": "2017-08-21", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 2079}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8910407", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "id": 164, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "id": 287, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Topic", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Topic", "id": 653, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Defense", "id": 778, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

His recent Pyongyang-style threat to unleash \"fire and fury\" on North Korea has been met with silence from the top levels of South Korea's government -- and worry, sometimes anger, from the country's citizens.\n\nIt highlights an interesting feature of South Korea, a strong U.S. ally, trading partner and fellow democracy where there can seem to be as much, maybe more, worry about Trump's unpredictable style of leadership as there is about archrival North Korea.\n\nMany South Koreans ignore Pyongyang because they have lived with near-constant North Korean belligerence, and sometimes violence, since the Korean Peninsula was divided in 1945 and the two countries fought a bloody, three-year war five years later.\n\nThe government in Seoul, however, is far from indifferent to its northern neighbour.\n\nWhen North Korea on Thursday repeated a threat against Guam, saying it was working on a plan to launch missiles into the waters near the U.S. territory, Roh Jae-cheon, spokesman of South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff, appeared on TV to declare that Seoul and Washington were prepared to \"immediately and sternly punish\" any provocation by the North.\n\nContrast that with the official silence out of Seoul after Trump's comments on Tuesday, which seemed to take a page out of the North Korean playbook by warning of \"fire and fury\" if the North didn't stop threatening the United States.\n\nSouth Korean citizens and the media have been less shy about ripping into both Trump, for his threat, and the government of President Moon Jae-in, for not taking the U.S. president to task for evoking a potential war that would likely result in tens of thousands of Korean deaths.\n\n\"Doesn't the Moon Jae-in government have to say something about Trump's over-the-line comments?\" Jang Shin-ki, a 42-year-old man who lives in Seoul, wrote on Facebook.\n\nThere are feelings of bewilderment and powerlessness: Why should South Korea get sucked into a crisis created by a war of words between leaders in Washington and Pyongyang?\n\n\"Moon has talked about how South Korea should be in the driver's seat when it comes to dealing with North Korea, but that clearly was just rhetoric,\" Choi Do-hyun, a 39-year-old office worker in Seoul, said in an interview. \"In reality, he can't say a word to Trump over an uncoordinated, excessive comment that threatens to send the Korean Peninsula to the path of war.\"\n\nMoon, a liberal who favours engagement with the North, has kept mostly quiet over the past week. In a meeting with military officials Wednesday, he said that South Korea would need to \"slightly supplement\" its military readiness in the face of threats from North Korean nuclear weapons and missiles.\n\nThe daily JoongAng Ilbo newspaper took those comments as a sign of Moon's lack of urgency while Washington and Pyongyang trade \"verbal bombs as if they are predicting a real war.\"\n\n\"These are times of emergency, when the strategic balance of the Korean Peninsula is entirely changing, and the expression 'slightly supplement' reflects an understanding of the situation that is too lax,\" the newspaper said in an editorial Thursday.\n\nSouth Korea has long worried about being sidelined in international diplomacy meant to persuade the North to abandon its nuclear ambitions. The angst even has a name in Seoul: Korea Passing.\n\nThe Hankyoreh newspaper called for South Korea's government to take on a bigger role in solving the North Korean nuclear problem.\n\n\"It's very concerning that both Trump and (North Korean leader) Kim Jong Un are more unpredictable than the countries' previous leaders,\" the newspaper said in an editorial. \"Although rhetoric is just rhetoric, you can't dismiss the possibility that a small misunderstanding could lead to an accidental clash if the comments continue to escalate.\"\n\nThe paper compared the situation to \"two cars speeding toward each other.\"", "timeCrawl": "11:11:00", "sim": 0.7019608020782471, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8906317", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "id": 164, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Time_Period", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Time Period", "id": 286, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

in particular, seems detached from the prospect of war.\n\nOn September 15, 1996, 26 North Korean commandoes slipped ashore near the South Korean town of Gangneung after their submarine foundered off the coast. The impromptu mini-invasion made international headlines, and tensions rose sharply for several weeks between the two countries as the South Korean military hunted down the infiltrators. Two dozen were killed.\n\nBut in the city of Busan, where I'd been teaching English for more than a year, my friends seemed unconcerned; no one I knew was preparing for war. The only person I knew who was truly worried was my mother in Michigan. Was I safe? Wasn't it a good idea to come home and get out of harm's way?\n\nI told her the same thing that everyone in South Korea says whenever North Korea threatened to turn the nation into a \"lake of fire,\" which was often: Everything was fine.\n\nAfter two decades, multiple skirmishes, the rapid development of North Korea's nuclear program, and the arrival of a new-generation dictator from the Kim dynasty, the mood in South Korea is much the same. On Tuesday, President Donald Trump alarmed the world when he warned the country that it could face \"fire and fury like the world has never seen.\" A day later, the North Korean military threatened to strike Guam (home to important U.S. military bases) with four intermediate-range ballistic missiles fired over Japan. On Friday morning, Trump continued the escalation, via a tweet promising that the U.S. military is \"locked and loaded.\"\n\nBut as the president trades doomsday threats with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and American tabloids erupt with mushroom-cloud stock photos, the people of Seoul, just 35 miles from the North Korean border, remain typically blas\u00e9. On Wednesday, the website of the Chosun Ilbo, South Korea's largest daily newspaper, lead with a story on Samsung microchips.\n\nThe reason? They have heard it all before.\n\n\"North Korean provocation is always a concern, but it is kind of like background noise,\" says Abraham Kim, former vice president of the Korea Economic Institute of America in Washington, D.C., and current director of the Maureen and Mike Mansfield Center at the University of Montana. \"Sometimes it gets very loud, but it's always been there. People are kind of numb to it.\"\n\nThat's particularly the case among younger residents of Seoul. For them, the prospect of conflict feels hypothetical, says Walter Paik, chair of the Department of Military Force at Korea Tourism University in Incheon. \"They don't know the reality of the North Korean leaders.\"\n\nVia email, Christina Lee, who works in Seoul for NK News, a publication that reports on North Korea, also notes this strict generational division. Talking to residents on Wednesday, she found that \"younger Seoulites seemed detached from the whole issue,\" she says. Because nothing has come of past North Korean saber rattling, the current threat doesn't seem to register as out of the ordinary. On the other hand, older residents are properly wary. \"An older South Korean man thought the NK threat is very dangerous,\" she says. \"[He] said, 'The younger generation who hasn't experienced war wouldn't understand.'\"\n\nIt's hard to overstate the importance of Seoul to South Korea. More than half of South Korea's 50 million residents live in the Seoul metropolitan area -- more than 10 million in the city itself -- and approximately 70 percent of the country's economy is tied to the city. It's also hard to overstate its vulnerability. Decades before North Korea became a nuclear threat to the rest of the world, the city lay in the crosshairs of North Korean conventional artillery, minutes away from its jets.\n\nWhat's new, of course, is that North Korea no longer directly threatens only Seoul or nearby neighbors like Japan. In July, U.S. officials told Reuters that North Korea's latest test of an intercontinental ballistic missile shows that it may be able to strike nearly anywhere in the continental United States. That danger is new to U.S. cities and territories, not Seoul. Promises from Defense Secretary Jim Mattis that the U.S. would ultimately prevail in any armed exchange aren't very reassuring for residents of the South Korean capital: The city suffers catastrophic damage in even the best scenarios of a conflict on the peninsula.\n\nThere is another element to this crisis that does feel different, however: the American president. Bong Youngshik, a research fellow at Yonsei University Institute for North Korean Studies, says that Donald Trump is \"an untested and new phenomenon\" in the decades-old conflict. \"He presents an idiosyncrasy to Koreans ... unpredictability.\" But that unpredictability could be an asset in pressuring North Korea: \"That is, he may really put his words into actions, including military actions.\"\n\nBut Bong says rather than stockpiling ramen, the young generation in Seoul is \"aware of the possibility of the government potentially manipulating the security issues in order to restrain civic liberty, which happened during the era of (South Korean) military dictatorship.\"\n\nUnable to predict the potential impact of Trump and Kim's fiery rhetoric, many Korea experts pay more attention to financial markets, which, like Seoulites, are expressing little concern. The Korea Stock Exchange Index KOSPI fell .4 percent on Thursday. And although North Korea has fired 18 missiles since February, the South Korean benchmark has not fallen more than 1 percent on any day that a missile was fired, according to Bloomberg.\n\nNow it's my turn to worry about friends and family back in South Korea. My wife and I returned to the United States in 2001. In the years since, whenever the threat of war floats to the top of the U.S. media cycle, we discuss my in-laws in Busan. We're the ones who call and quiz them about their safety, and occasionally urge them to prepare. Should we try to get them to Guam and then to the U.S. if the situation escalates?\n\nToday, like most other Koreans, they seem unconcerned. They couldn't leave even if they wanted to, it turns out: They let their passports expire.\n\nThis post appears courtesy of Citylab.", "timeCrawl": "12:50:00", "sim": 0.6901960968971252, "extractedDates": [{"date": "1996-09-15", "textStart": 84, "amb": false, "textEnd": 102}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8793263", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges_and_Universities", "label": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges and Universities", "id": 143, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "id": 164, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Time_Period", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Time Period", "id": 286, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

North Korean commandoes slipped ashore near the South Korean town of Gangneung after their submarine foundered off the coast. The impromptu mini-invasion made international headlines, and tensions rose sharply for several weeks between the two countries as the South Korean military hunted down the infiltrators. Two dozen were killed.\n\nBut in the city of Busan, where I'd been teaching English for more than a year, my friends seemed unconcerned; no one I knew was preparing for war. The only person I knew who was truly worried was my mother in Michigan. Was I safe? Wasn't it a good idea to come home and get out of harm's way?\n\nI told her the same thing that everyone in South Korea says whenever North Korea threatened to turn the nation into a \"lake of fire,\" which was often: Everything was fine.\n\nAfter two decades, multiple skirmishes, the rapid development of North Korea's nuclear program, and the arrival of a new-generation dictator from the Kim dynasty, the mood in South Korea is much the same. On Tuesday, President Donald Trump alarmed the world when he warned the country that it could face \"fire and fury like the world has never seen.\" A day later, the North Korean military threatened to strike Guam (home to important U.S. military bases) with four intermediate-range ballistic missiles fired over Japan. On Friday morning, Trump continued the escalation, via a tweet promising that the U.S. military is \"locked and loaded.\"\n\nRecommended: Is the World Slouching Toward a Grave Systemic Crisis?\n\nBut as the president trades doomsday threats with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and American tabloids erupt with mushroom-cloud stock photos, the people of Seoul, just 35 miles from the North Korean border, remain typically blas\u00e9. On Wednesday, the website of the Chosun Ilbo, South Korea's largest daily newspaper, lead with a story on Samsung microchips.\n\nThe reason? They have heard it all before.\n\n\"North Korean provocation is always a concern, but it is kind of like background noise,\" says Abraham Kim, former vice president of the Korea Economic Institute of America in Washington, D.C., and current director of the Maureen and Mike Mansfield Center at the University of Montana. \"Sometimes it gets very loud, but it's always been there. People are kind of numb to it.\"\n\nThat's particularly the case among younger residents of Seoul. For them, the prospect of conflict feels hypothetical, says Walter Paik, chair of the Department of Military Force at Korea Tourism University in Incheon. \"They don't know the reality of the North Korean leaders.\"\n\nMore From Our PartnersThe Foreign Buyers You Haven't Heard AboutThe Berlin Borough Buying Out Private Landlords\n\nVia email, Christina Lee, who works in Seoul for NK News, a publication that reports on North Korea, also notes this strict generational division. Talking to residents on Wednesday, she found that \"younger Seoulites seemed detached from the whole issue,\" she says. Because nothing has come of past North Korean saber rattling, the current threat doesn't seem to register as out of the ordinary. On the other hand, older residents are properly wary. \"An older South Korean man thought the NK threat is very dangerous,\" she says. \"[He] said, 'The younger generation who hasn't experienced war wouldn't understand.'\"\n\nIt's hard to overstate the importance of Seoul to South Korea. More than half of South Korea's 50 million residents live in the Seoul metropolitan area -- more than 10 million in the city itself -- and approximately 70 percent of the country's economy is tied to the city. It's also hard to overstate its vulnerability. Decades before North Korea became a nuclear threat to the rest of the world, the city lay in the crosshairs of North Korean conventional artillery, minutes away from its jets.\n\nRecommended: Why Does Trump Still Refuse to Criticize Putin?\n\nWhat's new, of course, is that North Korea no longer directly threatens only Seoul or nearby neighbors like Japan. In July, U.S. officials told Reuters that North Korea's latest test of an intercontinental ballistic missile shows that it may be able to strike nearly anywhere in the continental United States. That danger is new to U.S. cities and territories, not Seoul. Promises from Defense Secretary Jim Mattis that the U.S. would ultimately prevail in any armed exchange aren't very reassuring for residents of the South Korean capital: The city suffers catastrophic damage in even the best scenarios of a conflict on the peninsula.\n\nThere is another element to this crisis that does feel different, however: the American president. Bong Youngshik, a research fellow at Yonsei University Institute for North Korean Studies, says that Donald Trump is \"an untested and new phenomenon\" in the decades-old conflict. \"He presents an idiosyncrasy to Koreans ... unpredictability.\" But that unpredictability could be an asset in pressuring North Korea: \"That is, he may really put his words into actions, including military actions.\"\n\nBut Bong says rather than stockpiling ramen, the young generation in Seoul is \"aware of the possibility of the government potentially manipulating the security issues in order to restrain civic liberty, which happened during the era of (South Korean) military dictatorship.\"\n\nRecommended: How to Deal With North Korea\n\nUnable to predict the potential impact of Trump and Kim's fiery rhetoric, many Korea experts pay more attention to financial markets, which, like Seoulites, are expressing little concern. The Korea Stock Exchange Index KOSPI fell .4 percent on Thursday. And although North Korea has fired 18 missiles since February, the South Korean benchmark has not fallen more than 1 percent on any day that a missile was fired, according to Bloomberg.\n\nNow it's my turn to worry about friends and family back in South Korea. My wife and I returned to the United States in 2001. In the years since, whenever the threat of war floats to the top of the U.S. media cycle, we discuss my in-laws in Busan. We're the ones who call and quiz them about their safety, and occasionally urge them to prepare. Should we try to get them to Guam and then to the U.S. if the situation escalates?\n\nToday, like most other Koreans, they seem unconcerned. They couldn't leave even if they wanted to, it turns out: They let their passports expire.\n\nThis post appears courtesy of Citylab.\n\nRead more from The Atlantic:\n\nTrump Is 'Locked and Loaded' in a Nuclear Game of ChickenEmmanuel Macron: Monsieur UnpopularHave Smartphones Destroyed a Generation?\n\nThis article was originally published on The Atlantic.", "timeCrawl": "00:59:00", "sim": 0.6784313917160034, "extractedDates": [{"date": "1996-09-15", "textStart": 3, "amb": false, "textEnd": 21}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8726919", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges_and_Universities", "label": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges and Universities", "id": 143, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "id": 164, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

In response, the United Nations approved new economic sanctions against North Korea that, predictably, inspired a bellicose response from the rogue regime.\n\nTrump threatened that further provocations will be met with \"fire and fury and frankly power, the likes of which this world has never seen before.\"\n\nIn response, North Korea issued a threat of its own -- missile strikes on the U.S. territory of Guam.\n\nWith tensions escalating, it is important to be realistic about how we can get out of this mess.\n\nIn short, any nonmilitary solution will rely on China choosing to apply its massive economic leverage over the North Korean regime. This is a point that Trump clearly recognizes. In July, he tweeted that Chinese trade with North Korea \" rose 40 percent in the first quarter,\" highlighting China's reluctance to punish North Korea for its pursuit of nuclear weapons.\n\nThe poor quality of the data hinders a detailed analysis, but Trump's overall sentiment is correct. China has increased its trade with North Korea in recent years and done little to forestall North Korea's nuclear ambitions besides backing the most recent round of U.N. sanctions. China's foremost objective seems to be promoting greater stability from its volatile neighbor.\n\nYet, a quick look at the data, however murky, shows just how much leverage China has, if it wishes to use it.\n\nIn general, exports from one country to another can be mostly explained by the distance between them and the sizes of their markets, a pattern that holds for China and North Korea.\n\nGeographically, they share a long border, which makes China a natural, though not inevitable, partner for trade. As a case in point, North Korea also shares a long border with South Korea, but these countries have almost no trade between them. In addition, North Korea shares a small border with Russia, with whom it has little, though ever-increasing, trade.\n\nChina's large market, proximity and -- most importantly -- willingness to trade with North Korea has led to a situation in which North Korea has become highly dependent on trade with what has become its primary patron. About half of North Korean exports and imports go directly to and from China and most of the rest of its trade is handled indirectly by Chinese middlemen.\n\nNorth Korea's dependence on its neighbor has grown hand-in-hand with China's increasing economic dominance of East Asia, which gained momentum 15 years ago when China joined the World Trade Organization. Since then, both Chinese gross domestic product as well as its annual trade with North Korea have increased nearly tenfold, to around $11 trillion and $6 billion, respectively.\n\nNorth Korea imports nearly everything from China, from rubber tires to refined petroleum to pears, with no single category dominating. Meanwhile, coal constitutes about 40 percent of North Korean exports to China, followed by \"non-knit men's coats.\"\n\nRecent events -- such as the use of front companies by Chinese firms to evade sanctions imposed on North Korea and China's reluctance to cut off energy supplies to the country -- have led to some uncertainty about the extent to which China is willing to use this economic leverage to rein in North Korea's military ambitions.\n\nOn one hand, China claims that coal imports from North Korea have recently been stopped as part of an effort to punish the regime for recent missile tests and the suspected assassination of Kim Jong-nam, the estranged half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. If true, this would be an important signal of China's willingness to support U.S. concerns about the missile program as it would represent a loss of about a third ($930 million) of North Korea's import revenue.\n\nBut there is evidence that coal shipments in fact never ceased. And, in any case, China may have dramatically increased its imports of iron ore from North Korea to offset the lost coal revenues.\n\nThis is consistent with the idea that China carefully considers the resources and revenue that are available to the North Korean regime at any moment, and uses trade as a lever to control them. In this way, China walks a fine line between providing too many resources, and thus allowing the regime to prosper, and not enough resources, such that North Korea is in danger of collapsing. Ultimately, trade may be used as a lever to do some light scolding, but China's overwhelming concern is preventing North Korea's collapse.\n\nFurther evidence that China has tight control over the North Korean economy comes from a recent report from C4ADS. The research group found close, and often common, ownership ties between most of the major Chinese companies who do business with North Korea. This suggests that trade with North Korea is highly centralized and thus easily controlled.\n\nChina is not the only country that North Korea trades with, though the others currently pale in comparison. Other top export destinations include India ($97.8 million), Pakistan ($43.1 million) and Burkina Faso ($32.8 million). In terms of imports, India ($108 million), Russia ($78.3 million) and Thailand ($73.8 million) currently sell the most to North Korea.\n\nRussia in particular may soon complicate U.S. efforts to isolate the regime. While still small, Russian trade with North Korea increased 73 percent over the first two months of 2017, compared with the same period of the previous year.\n\nBut whereas China is legitimately worried that an economic crisis in North Korea could lead to a flood of refugees or all-out war, Russia likely sees engagement with North Korea in much simpler terms, namely as an additional way to gain geopolitical advantage relative to the United States.\n\nNearly all experts agree that there is no easy way to \"solve\" the North Korea problem. But one plausible approach is to encourage South Korea and Japan to begin to develop nuclear weapons programs of their own, and to only discontinue these programs if China takes meaningful steps to use its trade with North Korea to reign in the regime.\n\nThreatening to introduce new nuclear powers to the world is clearly risky, however stable and peaceful South Korea and Japan currently are. But China is highly averse to having these economic and political rivals acquire nuclear capabilities, as it would threaten China's ongoing pursuit of regional control. In short, this is a sensitive pressure point that could be used to sway the Chinese leadership.\n\nOne way or another, China must become convinced that the costs of propping up the North Korean regime through trade are higher than the costs of an increased probability that the regime will collapse.", "timeCrawl": "12:48:00", "sim": 0.6666666865348816, "extractedDates": [{"date": "2017-04-01", "textStart": 165, "amb": false, "textEnd": 178}, {"textStart": 433, "date": "2017-07-04", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 439}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8916073", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "id": 164, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade", "id": 269, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

As you know, we have been prepared for an escalation on the Korean Peninsula since the armistice in 1953.\"\n\n\"The difference between then and now is the danger is much greater,\" he added. \"And it's growing every day, with every missile test, with the ... nuclear tests. And so what we can no longer do is afford to procrastinate. And President Trump has made it very clear, he cannot tolerate, will not tolerate, a threat to the United States from North Korea involving nuclear weapons.\"\n\nThe Korean Peninsula has been locked in a cycle of military tensions since the 1950-1953 Korean War, which ended in an armistice. No peace deal has been signed, meaning the two Koreas remain technically at war. The US was an ally of South Korea during the war.\n\nMcMaster said underscored the seriousness of rising tensions between the United States and North Korea but added that there is not immediate threat of war between the two.\n\n\"We're not closer to war than a week ago. But we're closer to war than we were a decade ago,\" McMaster said. \"And, as Dr. [Henry] Kissinger made clear in a great op-ed this weekend, this has been a problem that we have procrastinated on for a long period of time, and now it's coming to a head. Where the threat from North Korea, not only to the United States but to the world, is very, very clear. And it demands a concerted effort by the United States, but with our allies and all responsible nations.\"\n\nNo 'imminent' threat of North Korea strike\n\nMeanwhile, CIA Director Mike Pompeo said on Sunday that there is no \"imminent\" threat of North Korea attacking the United States with a nuclear weapon.\n\n\"There's nothing imminent today,\" Pompeo said when asked what kind of threat the US is facing. \"But make no mistake about it, the continuation, the increased chance that there will be a nuclear missile in Denver is a very serious threat, and the investigation is going to treat it as such.\"\n\nHe added that the US and North Korea are not on \"the cusp of a nuclear war.\" There is \"no intelligence that would indicate that we're in that place today.\"\n\nThe US is against North Korea's nuclear weapons but Pyongyang says it will not give up on its nuclear deterrence unless Washington ends its hostile policy toward the country and dissolves the US-led UN command in South Korea.

It was written by David Wright, an international expert on the technical aspects of arms control, particularly those related to missile defence systems, missile proliferation, and space weapons.\n\nCommenting in the CNN, he pointed out that a missile capable of reaching the United States topped with a nuclear warhead is considered by Pyongyang to be its ultimate goal. On July 28, Pyongyang made a major progress toward that goal. It announced that it had successfully tested an intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach most of the mainland US, including some of the country's largest cities. It appears that North Korea with each missile test has tried to prove that it is not only acquiring expertise but also slowly acquiring the ability to potentially strike US.\n\nThe July 28 test demonstrated that Pyongyang can now fire a missile almost straight up to an altitude of about 2,300 miles. That would enable a missile to land in the Sea of Japan/East Sea without flying over Japan. This dynamics has been interpreted by David Wright as a probability factor where on a standard trajectory it would have the range to reach a number of major cities in the US, including those on the West Coast as well as Denver, Chicago, and possibly Boston and New York. He has also observed that is a clear indication that North Korea has made very significant progress in its ability to launch long-range missiles. He has, however, observed that \"these missiles would be inaccurate and would not be able to destroy military targets, but would be able to attack large targets like cities\".\n\nNot all of North Korea's missile launches have been successful. There were three failures in April after the failed test in March. Little is known as to why those launches failed or even what missile was fired in March. On these occasions, unlike during successful tests, North Korea did not release detailed photographs and other information that would allow one to understand more about the missiles.\n\nThe United States, along with Japan and South Korea, as a consequence of these long-range missile tests, have been forced to adopt a more hands-on response with a re-think in tactics. This new path started with US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley pointing to China and asserting that \"The time for talk is over,\" and that Beijing \"must decide if it is finally willing to take this vital step\" of challenging Pyongyang. This was echoed by US President Donald Trump who tweeted his disappointment with China and strongly remarked that \"Our foolish past leaders have allowed (Beijing) to make hundreds of billions of dollars a year in trade, yet they do nothing for us with North Korea, just talk\". This was rubbed in further by Susan Thornton, Acting Assistant Secretary of the State Department's East Asia bureau. She commented that Chinese failure in this regard might persuade the United States \" to go after Chinese entities if need be.\"\n\nSome commentators on Far East strategic paradigm differ on China's ability to persuade or greatly influence North Korea. John Delury, an expert on Chinese-Korean relations at Seoul's Yonsei University, has pointed out that \"Beijing's channels to Pyongyang are frayed, they're weak. President Trump's tweets reflect this inherited Obama view that the road to Pyongyang leads through Beijing -- that's a dead end.\" Another commentator, Mike Chinoy, has observed that many high-level North Koreans \"resent the hell out of the Chinese. They hate the idea that the Chinese can come in and tell them what to do. And the reality is the Chinese can't.\"\n\nUN SANCTIONS: In the meantime, the UN Security Council has unanimously imposed new sanctions on North Korea. Russia and China also participated in this vote. The two countries have previously differed with others on how to handle Pyongyang, but in recent months have joined in calls for North Korea to stop its missile tests while also urging at the same time the US and South Korea to halt military drills.\n\nThe sanctions refer to the following aspects: (a) banning of import of coal, seafood, iron and iron ore, lead and lead ore from North Korea; (b) countries not receiving new North Korean workers; (c) ban on any new joint ventures with North Korean entities or individuals; (d) no new investment in existing joint ventures; (e) targeting more individuals with travel bans and assets freezes and (f) member states having to report to Security Council within 90 days on how they have implemented this resolution.\n\nNorth Korea has yet to officially respond to the new sanctions. However, a senior official has mentioned that \"We will make our stance clear when things are determined.\" The ruling party newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, has been more blunt and stated that nuclear action or sanctions taken by Washington would lead to an \"unimaginable sea of fire\" engulfing the US.\n\nProfessor Alexander Gillespie has made some interesting observations in the Al-Jazeera. He has pointed out that Mr Trump and his allies could choose to expand the THAAD system of missile air defence but the risk with this approach is that it will lead to both North Korea and China rattling their sabres even louder. Although the chance of these planned events leading to intentional war is very small, \"the risks of unplanned events caused by paranoia, accidents, mistakes or uncontrolled anger make this one of the most dangerous situations facing humanity since we almost had a nuclear war over Cuba in 1962\".\n\nFIRST HIGH-LEVEL ENCOUNTER BETWEEN THE TWO KOREAS: Nevertheless, despite the sanctions and international warnings and the stubbornness on the part of the North Korean authorities, there has been a faint glimmer of hope within the evolving dynamics. This was possible because of the Asean Ministerial meeting held in Manila. South Korean authorities told the BBC that its Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha spoke to her North Korean counterpart Ri Yong Ho on August 06, 2017 on the sidelines of the meeting. Ms Kang and Mr Ri shook hands in a brief and unarranged meeting at an official dinner. South Korea has apparently proposed talks with the North last month to ease tensions and resume reunions of families separated by the Korean War, but Pyongyang has yet to officially respond. Informally, North Korea is supposed to have remarked that South Korea's offer of talks was \"insincere\". This possible rejection has been interpreted as being connected with the mounting sanctions on North Korea. Wang Yi, the Foreign Minister of China, Pyongyang's closest ally (also present in the ASEAN meeting), was, however, more optimistic. He told journalists on August 07, \"My feeling is that the North did not entirely reject the positive proposals raised by the South.\" He added that China also supported the South's initiatives.\n\nThis was the first high-level encounter between the two Koreas since South Korean President Moon Jae-in took office in May this year. Moon has long been a proponent of greater dialogue with Pyongyang in order to diffuse tensions on the Korean Peninsula. Moon helped craft the so-called \"Sunshine Policy,\" which called for an increase of engagement in the political and economic spheres. In July, South Korea's Defence Ministry has also proposed talks between the representatives of the two countries' militaries at Tongil-gak on the North Korean side of Panmunjom, the so-called truce village in the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) that separates the two rivals. North Korea has yet to respond to the overtures.\n\nIt is understood that US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who also attended the forum, skipped the gala dinner where the two ministers spoke and also avoided discussing anything with the North Korean representative. After discussing growing tensions between the USA and Russia with the Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov, the US Secretary of State, according to CNN, told a press conference on August 07 that \"We hope again that this ultimately will result in North Korea coming to a conclusion to choose a different pathway, and when the conditions are right, we can sit and have a dialogue around the future of North Korea so that they feel secure and prosper economically.\"\n\nThe US has long been saying it would agree to talk only if North Korea agrees to denuclearisation -- something many analysts believe is unlikely.\n\nThe writer, a former Ambassador and Chief Information Commissioner of the Information Commission, is an analyst specialised in foreign affairs, right to information and good governance.\n\nmuhammadzamir0@gmail.com", "timeCrawl": "14:36:00", "sim": 0.6470588445663452, "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "freq": 2, "amb": false, "textEnd": 498, "date": "2017-07-28", "textStart": 491}, {"date": "2017-08-06", "textStart": 6055, "amb": false, "textEnd": 6070}, {"imp": true, "freq": 2, "amb": false, "textEnd": 6759, "date": "2017-08-07", "textStart": 6750}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8927695", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "id": 164, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

after it tested two intercontinental ballistic missiles in July. That prompted a new round of UN sanctions and an escalation of the war of words with the United States. As the provocations continue, what does Kim Jong-un really want to achieve?\n\nIs there anything the US could give North Korea that would make it end its nuclear and missile programmes?\n\nGiven the escalating war of words between the US and North Korea, and Donald Trump's warning of \"fire and fury\" if Kim Jong-un overtly threatens the United States or launches missiles against the US territory of Guam, it is unclear how useful diplomacy is as tool for moderating regional tensions.\n\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson and other senior Trump administration officials have stressed the importance of diplomacy, and even Mr Trump has in the past offered to talk to Mr Kim, but there are no signs that the North Koreans are open to dialogue.\n\nRecent informal track two level talks with North Korean officials in Europe suggest that Pyongyang is single-mindedly focused on continuing with its missile and nuclear-weapons testing programmes.\n\nStrikingly at the Asean Regional Forum meeting in Manila recently, there was no meeting between Mr Tillerson and Ri Yong-ho, the North Korean foreign minister, and a proposal for talks between Seoul and Pyongyang offered by Kang Kyung-wha, the South Korean foreign minister, was summarily rebuffed by the North Koreans.\n\nIn principle, there are incentives that the US could offer the North, including talks on a peace treaty ending the Korean War, preliminary steps towards diplomatic recognition (such as the establishment of a US liaison mission in Pyongyang), or an agreement on conventional arms reductions on the peninsula, but these are at best long-term objectives.\n\nThe North's repeated violations of past diplomatic agreements with the US has eroded any appetite for concessions in Washington where there is deep-seated distrust of the North on both sides of the political aisle and an assumption that pressure, via the latest round of tougher UN sanctions targeting the North's mineral and food exports, and restrictions on North Korean overseas labour, is the best way of bringing Pyongyang to heel.\n\nHow worried should you be?\n\nReality Check: Are Trump's assumptions right?\n\nIs North Korea's ultimate or unswayable goal the possession of a nuclear deterrent?\n\nSince coming to power in late 2011, Kim Jong-un's priorities have been focused consistently on two simple objectives of military modernization and delivering economic prosperity for the North Korean public.\n\nThe North's nuclear aspirations date from the 1960s and are consistent with the regime's desire for political and military autonomy in the face of opposition not only from its traditional enemies such as the United States, Japan and South Korea, but also over the objections of its historical partners such as China and Russia.\n\nWhat damage could North Korea do?\n\nKim Jong-un, North Korea's supreme commander\n\nWhy?\n\nPart of the North's motivation is a rational assessment of the country's strategic interests. The experience of Libya and Iraq is a reminder to Pyongyang that the only guarantee of national survival is the possession of a credible weapons of mass destruction capability.\n\nWhile Washington has expressed no \"hostile intent\" to the North, Pyongyang maintains that the United States, as a conventionally superior and nuclear armed power, with 28,000 troops in South Korean, and a policy of maintaining a first-use nuclear option, represents a clear threat to the country.\n\nMr Kim's nuclear and missile testing ambitions are also an expression of identity politics. The legitimacy of the Kim dynasty's political leadership is rooted in a narrative of defence against an implacably hostile United States.\n\nThe 1950-53 Korean War, framed in North Korean propaganda as the result of direct US aggression, is used to depict the United States to the North Korean people as an adversary intent on destroying the country.\n\nFor the country's older generation that recall US actions during the war, when virtually every urban centre in the North was obliterated by American bombing, this narrative is a convincing one and is routinely reinforced for the wider population in the state's daily political messages.\n\nMr Trump's recent bellicose public statements are a propaganda gift to Kim Jong-un, allowing him to bolster his standing as the nation's commander in chief and protector of the country.\n\nCan the US defend itself?\n\nCan North Korea nuclear threat focus minds?\n\nCould a nuclear-armed North Korea co-exist with the US?\n\nThe North's accelerated missile testing campaign and last year's two successful nuclear tests have materially enhanced the country's deterrent capabilities.\n\nRecent intelligence reports from the US have suggested that the country may have as many as 60 nuclear bombs (a figure disputed by some analysts) and its long-range missile tests of 4 and 28 July indicate that the North may have the capacity to hit parts of the United States.\n\nA recent report in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists has questioned the extent to which this improved missile capability genuinely allows the North to deploy a nuclear warhead against the US, but there is little doubt that Pyongyang has made dramatic progress in the last year in securing full de-facto membership of the nuclear club.\n\nWashington, however, has made it clear that it will not recognize or tolerate such a development. To do so would offer a propaganda victory to the North, critically undermine America's relations with its key regional allies - Japan and South Korea - prompt a destabilizing arms race in the region, and destabilize the global nuclear non-proliferation regime.\n\nTrump's team mixed messages\n\nWho said what: Trump of Kim?\n\nIs any of what North Korea wants realistic?\n\nPyongyang's priority is to push ahead aggressively with testing, both of its missiles and its nuclear weapons, in an effort to solidify its deterrent capabilities. For Mr Kim, this makes sense as means of boosting his political authority and legitimacy at home.\n\nHe can take comfort from China's apparent reluctance to impose, serious crippling economic restrictions on the North, despite its recent support for tougher UN sanctions.\n\nHe can also calculate rationally that ultimately the United States, as many experienced observers are arguing, will accept the need to negotiate some form of intermediate freeze in the North's military capabilities in the hope that this will stabilize the strategic situation while keeping the door open to future disarmament.\n\nBy then, Mr Kim may hope he will be able to secure a range of concessions from the US and South Korea, whether in the form of economic assistance, conventional arms reductions, or more importantly the political respect and status as an independent, sovereign state that the North has long craved.\n\nThe wild card in the current situation is how far President Trump's rhetorical brinkmanship will deter the North from pushing ahead with its missile testing programme. The North Korean military has threatened to test fire four intermediate range missiles in the vicinity of the US military facilities on Guam later this month.\n\nNo US President could tolerate a direct attack, but a test launch in the international waters close to the island would arguably represent a \"grey zone\" contingency that would require a more nuanced response, stopping short of full-blown military conflict.\n\nDiscussions of the current stand-off have focused on the parallels with the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 and the strategic judgment of the US president at the time, John F Kennedy. His caution in seeking to avoid nuclear war was shaped by his reading of Barbara Tuchman's book The Guns of August and its insights into the lessons of World War One.\n\nIt is ironic and telling that once again August is a time of acute strategic risk and uncertainty, when the rhetoric, assessments and actions of national leaders are likely to carry profound significance for regional and global security.\n\nsource: BBC", "timeCrawl": "13:02:00", "sim": 0.6431372761726379, "extractedDates": [{"dateEnd": "2017-07-28", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 5044, "date": "2017-07-04", "textStart": 5031}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8917532", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "id": 144, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "id": 164, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "id": 500, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Their differing national interests are heading towards irreconcilability and that is clearly reflected in President Trump's threat that the US would respond to any North Korean provocation with \"fire and fury like the world has never seen\". Those comments were made by the President in the wake of US intelligence report suggesting that North Korea had developed capabilities to miniaturise nuclear warheads and can fit that to an inter-continental ballistic missile (ICBM).\n\nThe Japanese Defence Ministry with its Annual White Paper also came to the aid of the US Intelligence assessment with a whole range of conjectural assertions without providing any concrete evidence. But the real focus of the paper was more directed at China's actions in the East and South China seas. Tokyo now sees the standoff between North Korea and the USA as an opportunity to further fortify its position as the key ally of the USA in the region and to counter China's growing influence. Furthermore, now Japan can use the threat from North Korea to justify its endeavour to lift constitutional restrictions to have its fully fledged operational armed forces capable of deploying overseas as and when it sees it fit to do so.\n\nWe have seen and heard that all before -- evil Iraqis pulling children out of incubators and the country being well stocked with weapons of mass destructions (WMDs). The same US intelligence sources are now peddling the information that North Korea has produced miniaturised nuclear war heads to fit into the ICBM which has recently been developed by North Korea. This is the core of the assessment made by the Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA). They even further concluded that North Korea had in possession of 60 such miniaturised warheads ready for deployment. But those assertions are contested by many US war experts. But how this intelligence has been gathered also remains a great mystery to most observers of North Korea. The Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is in full agreement with President Trump's strategy and the Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshohide Suga even emphasised to further strengthen the relationship between the two countries to deter and respond to the threat. These really sound like \"Saddam stockpiling WMDs\" or \"Iran is just six months away from having nuclear weapons\", peddled out every six months over 20 years until 2015.\n\nThe fire and fury statement by the President is historically completely inaccurate. In fact, North Korea did experience fire and fury from the USA military almost 70 years ago. President Harry Truman did threaten to use nuclear weapons against North Korea even though he knew the consequences of the experiment he conducted in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. But North Korea was so heavily carpet-bombed that 80 per cent of its cities were destroyed and 20 per cent of its people were killed. This devastation was wreaked by conventional weapons. The US was dropping 800 tons of bombs a day, most of it was pure napalm. There was nothing very much left large enough to use atomic weapons. In the USA, people know nothing much about it but North Koreans definitely know all about it. No wonder North Korea views the USA, not South Korea as its primary adversary and the hindrance to unification of the Korean Peninsula.\n\nAlso the Korean war was really never ended, only an armistice was signed but no peace treaty. Repeated calls by North Korea for a peace treaty and non-aggression pact, yielded no response from the USA till today. North Korea's pursuit of a nuclear weapon is very much because of that experience, of that lived experience and recovering from that experience of total devastation. Now North Korea believes that a peace treaty and non-aggression pact are no longer sufficient to guarantee North Korea's survival as a state. They have also seen what happened to both Saddam in Iraq and Gaddafi in Libya whose country gave up WMD programme. Kim Jong-Un may be a very unusual type of political leader but he is not irrational. He has rather some rationale to back his actions which are survival; survival of his regime and survival of his country. Under his leadership, North Korea has drastically accelerated its nuclear and missile programmes to develop demonstrable capacity to strike at the continental USA with nuclear weapons. It is a dangerous gamble but worth the risk from their point of view because the alternative is capitulation.\n\nTrump's fire and fury statement on North Korea is adding to intensify an already very tense situation. Now he has moved onto declare \"locked and loaded\" thus further upping the ante. These blustering is more geared to emphasise that the USA is the ultimate guarantor of security of South Korea and Japan. North Korea remains a very small military power relative to the United States. But definitely North Korea is not going to give up its what it considers as a rational strategic option against the threat of attack from the USA. In essence North Korea is \"threatening\" to defend itself if attacked and reserving the right to use nuclear weapons in its defence. Kim Jong-Un is neither a fool nor irrational. He is not going to commit suicide by unilaterally unleashing his nuclear weapons against the USA, Japan or South Korea. Its nuclear weapons are purely for deterrence purposes. By the same token, Donald Trump might be a loose cannon, but not irrational.\n\nThe corporate media in the USA and countries allied with the USA are turning purely conjectural assertions into a fantasy of an imminent North Korean nuclear attack on the USA. The weapons industry in the USA which accounts for 10 per cent of total manufacturing output of the country also has very close links with its corporate media. Furthermore, the industry exerts tremendous influence on the politics of the country. Obviously the weapons industry needs war or war-like situations (as is happening now with North Korea) to keep it well oiled and greased.\n\nBut other more strategic issues are at stake - the very future of the US presence in the Asia-Pacific region. With Japan (technically) under the US military occupation, the USA sees South Korea as the most important geo-strategic point to maintain its dominance in the Asia-Pacific region in particular to encircle China. The US also has the war-time operational control over South Korea. China also sees North Korea as a buffer against US military presence in the peninsula.\n\nNorth Korea in essence is a side-show, the real target is rising China. The US has 160,000 soldiers in the region with 30,000 in South Korea to surround China. The Japanese Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera rather got down to the core point and said that while North Korean represented a deepening threat but it was China's continuing threatening behaviour in the East and South China seas was a major concern for Japan. This clearly demonstrates the US-Japanese strategic view of the current situation in the region.\n\nBut the US never ever got swayed by its allies' security concerns but by its own strategic ones. In the event of a North Korean regime collapse (due to the US military actions or for any other reasons), South Korea will absorb North Korea like West Germany did to East Germany and by virtue of that absorption South Korea will automatically become a nuclearised country with strong industrial muscle. That will then become automatically the raison d'etat for Japan to nuclearise itself. That will render the USA as redundant power to provide any security cover for Japan and now a unified Korea. More importantly, the whole of North East Asia will become fully nuclearised. That is not a prospect the USA is looking forward to. So sabre rattling will continue; nothing very much else.\n\ne-mail: muhammad.mahmood47@gmail.com", "timeCrawl": "14:56:00", "sim": 0.6392157077789307, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8929752", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "id": 144, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "id": 164, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "id": 500, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

North Korea's top general threatened to launch missiles towards Guam, and President Donald Trump warned that the U.S. military is \"locked and loaded\" for a conflict on the Korean Peninsula. But while the U.S. is just now pondering the possibility of war with the rogue regime, North Korea has maintained a hostile wartime mentality for many years. Such aggressive thinking is instilled in North Koreans at a very young age.\n\n\"From kindergarten classrooms to the halls of power, this is how North Korea views itself: as a scrappy little country that has been bullied by the United States for far too long and is willing to fight back,\" writes Jean H. Lee, a global fellow at the Wilson Center who previously served as a reporter in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang, in The New York Times.\n\nNorth Korea finally has the weapons to at least stand up to the U.S. North Korea has developed an intercontinental ballistic missile that can range targets across the U.S., as well as nuclear warheads and reliable reentry vehicles to shield them in flight. The North appears to have everything it needs to launch a nuclear strike on the U.S.\n\nIn her article, Lee described a disturbing visit to a North Korean kindergarten, where much of the material was focused on defeating the \"imperialist aggressors.\"\n\nShe stumbled across a children's book called \"A Hedgehog Defeats A Tiger,\" which tells the tale of a scrappy hedgehog that defeats the larger tiger using the sharp quills on its back, likely clear symbols for the North's growing arsenal of ballistic missiles. One of the North Korean asked Lee, an American, \"Do you know who the tiger is?\"\n\nLee noted that in one room, there were images of American missionaries torturing North Korean boys bound to trees and American soldiers were setting wild dogs loose on North Korean girls. Another room was filled with mock weapons, which the children used to practice killing Americans.\n\nThroughout the country, there is propaganda everywhere that warns North Koreans that the Americans are preparing to attack. The government tells its people that only Kim Jong-un and his powerful collection of nuclear weapons can stop the U.S. invasion. Lee assesses that Trump's latest rhetoric may play into the North Korean leader's lies.\n\nIt is reportedly not uncommon to see North Korean children preparing for a war.\n\nThe young students of Pyongyang Number Four Elementary school ran obstacle courses with a mock AK-47 slung over their shoulders and tossed grenades as part of the activities for Korean Children's Union Day in June. \"We have to prepare ourselves to defend our country,\" Myong Hyon Jong, one of the students, said after completing the various tasks, adding that she wants to join the military when she grows up to \"safeguard the respected Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un with military power.\"\n\nA military solution in Korea, as Secretary of Defense James Mattis has said, would be \"tragic on an unbelievable scale,\" but the warped mindset the prevails inside North Korea is one of the greatest challenges to diplomacy.", "timeCrawl": "14:40:00", "sim": 0.5960784554481506, "extractedDates": null, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8928096", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "id": 164, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Naturally, this has a lot of people wondering exactly what kind of bombs North Korea has, and whether the country is likely to use them on the U.S..\n\nThe most immediate fear, of course, is nuclear weapons, North Korea's got 'em: The hermit kingdom has conducted five nuclear tests as of this writing, and in 2016, the government released a picture of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un next to what appeared to be a miniaturized nuclear warhead. Although it's impossible to say exactly how many weapons comprise country's nuclear stockpile, a Stanford professor and North Korea expert who's toured the country's nuclear facilities estimated that by the end of 2016, the country had somewhere around 20 nuclear bombs.\n\nBut despite the attention given to nuclear warheads, they're not the only weapons of mass destruction that North Korea possesses. According to estimates from South Korean and American intelligence agencies, the country also has thousands of tons of chemical weapons as well, one variety of which -- VX -- was used to assassinate Kim's half-brother in February. North Korea is also believed to possess the ability to create biological weapons, including anthrax, smallpox, and cholera.\n\nIn short: North Korea has a lot of bombs. Whether it has any intention of using them is another question entirely, however.\n\nThe U.S. and North Korea have never been on friendly terms, and it's not at all unusual for a North Korean leader to threaten to turn America -- or an American ally in the region, such as South Korea or Japan -- into a \"sea of fire.\" Kim has made such threats many, many times since taking office in 2011; at one point in 2013, he even warned that North Korea might nuke Austin, Texas.\n\nNeedless to say, though, he's never once followed through on any of these threats. This is most likely because, according to North Korea observers, Kim's true goal in issuing these warnings is shore up support within his own country. To the extent that North Korea has a national myth, it's based largely on demonizing the U.S. and its allies; depicting America as such a big threat that it might have to be nuked is a great way of reinforcing that idea. Furthermore, acquiring a stockpile of nuclear weapons is an excellent way of dissuading other countries from attacking you, a fate that North Korea has had some experience with in the past.\n\nNone of this is to say that North Korea isn't a serious danger. It undoubtedly is, and if American leaders have any good options for defusing the situation, they certainly haven't figured out what those options are yet. But just because a country has a frightening stockpile of deadly weapons, that doesn't mean it's planning on using them.", "timeCrawl": "13:36:00", "sim": 0.5921568870544434, "extractedDates": null, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States of America"}}, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8921210", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "id": 144, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "id": 164, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "id": 500, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Dunford, whose trip includes stops in Japan and China, arrived in Seoul on Sunday, the official said.\n\nDunford said last month that it was \"unimaginable\" to allow North Korea to develop the capability to strike a U.S. city with a nuclear weapon.\n\nThe visit comes after a week in which North Korea's Kim Jong-Un and the U.S. leader exchanged threats. China's President Xi Jinping told Trump in a phone call that all sides should maintain restraint and avoid inflammatory comments.\n\nJapan set up a missile-defense system in western areas of the country, following a threat by North Korea to fire missiles over Japan toward the U.S. territory of Guam.\n\nTrump said Friday that U.S. military options were \"locked and loaded\" if North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un acted unwisely.\n\nChina is North Korea's main benefactor, providing most of its food and fuel. Beijing is reluctant to put so much pressure on the regime that it risks collapse.

Talks on North Korea's nuclear program collapsed in 2009, and Kim has accelerated his efforts to obtain the ability to strike the U.S. with a nuclear weapon.\n\n----\n\n(Lee and Amano reported from Tokyo.

The UN sanctions, introduced to punish North Korea for its missile and nuclear programs, do not include any bans on textile exports.\n\n\"We take orders from all over the world,\" said one Korean-Chinese businessman in Dandong, the Chinese border city where the majority of North Korea trade passes through. Like many people Reuters interviewed for this story, he spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.\n\nDozens of clothing agents operate in Dandong, acting as go-betweens for Chinese clothing suppliers and buyers from the United States, Europe, Japan, South Korea, Canada and Russia, the businessman said.\n\n\"We will ask the Chinese suppliers who work with us if they plan on being open with their client -- sometimes the final buyer won't realize their clothes are being made in North Korea. It's extremely sensitive,\" he said.\n\nTextiles were North Korea's second-biggest export after coal and other minerals in 2016, totaling $752 million, according to data from the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency (KOTRA). Total exports from North Korea in 2016 rose 4.6 percent to $2.82 billion.\n\nThe latest U.N. sanctions, agreed earlier this month, have completely banned coal exports now.\n\nIts flourishing textiles industry shows how impoverished North Korea has adapted, with a limited embrace of market reforms, to sanctions since 2006 when it first tested a nuclear device. The industry also shows the extent to which North Korea relies on China as an economic lifeline, even as U.S. President Donald Trump piles pressure on Beijing to do more to rein in its neighbor's weapons programmes.\n\nChinese exports to North Korea rose almost 30 percent to $1.67 billion in the first half of the year, largely driven by textile materials and other traditional labor-intensive goods not included on the United Nations embargo list, Chinese customs spokesman Huang Songping told reporters.\n\nChinese suppliers send fabrics and other raw materials required for manufacturing clothing to North Korean factories across the border where garments are assembled and exported.\n\nFactories humming\n\nAustralian sportswear brand Rip Curl publicly apologized last year when it was discovered that some of its ski gear, labeled \"Made in China\", had been made in one of North Korea's garment factories. Rip Curl blamed a rogue supplier for outsourcing to \"an unauthorized subcontractor.\"\n\nBut traders and agents in Dandong say it's a widespread practice.\n\nManufacturers can save up to 75 percent by making their clothes in North Korea, said a Chinese trader who has lived in Pyongyang.\n\nSome of the North Korean factories are located in Siniuju city just across the border from Dandong. Other factories are located outside Pyongyang. Finished clothing is often directly shipped from North Korea to Chinese ports before being sent onto the rest of the world, the Chinese traders and businesses said.\n\nNorth Korea has about 15 large garment exporting enterprises, each operating several factories spread around the country, and dozens of medium sized companies, according to GPI Consultancy of the Netherlands, which helps foreign companies do business in North Korea.\n\nAll factories in North Korea are state-owned. And the textile ones appear to be humming, traders and agents say.\n\n\"We've been trying to get some of our clothes made in North Korea but the factories are fully booked at the moment,\" said a Korean-Chinese businesswoman at a factory in Dalian, a Chinese port city two hours away from Dandong by train.\n\n\"North Korean workers can produce 30 percent more clothes each day than a Chinese worker,\" said the Korean-Chinese businessman.\n\n\"In North Korea, factory workers can't just go to the toilet whenever they feel like, otherwise they think it slows down the whole assembly line.\"\n\n\"They aren't like Chinese factory workers who just work for the money. North Koreans have a different attitude -- they believe they are working for their country, for their leader.\"\n\nAnd they are paid wages significantly below many other Asian countries. North Korean workers at the now shuttered Kaesong industrial zone just across the border from South Korea received wages ranging from a minimum of around $75 a month to an average of around $160, compared to average factory wages of $450-$750 a month in China. Kaesong was run jointly with South Korea and the wage structure -- much higher than in the rest of North Korea -- was negotiated with Seoul.\n\nWorkers in China\n\nChinese clothing manufacturers have been increasingly using North Korean textile factories even as they relocate their own factories offshore, including to Bangladesh, Vietnam and Cambodia.\n\n\"Wages are too high in China now. It's no wonder so many orders are being sent to North Korea,\" said a Korean-Chinese businesswoman who works in the textiles industry in Dandong.\n\nChinese textile companies are also employing thousands of cheaper North Korean workers in China.\n\nNorth Korea relies on overseas workers to earn hard currency, especially since U.N. sanctions have choked off some other sources of export earnings. Much of their wages are remitted back to the state and help fund Pyongyang's ambitious nuclear and missile programs, the U.N. says.\n\nThe new U.N. sanctions imposed on North Korea this month ban countries from increasing the current numbers of North Korean laborers working abroad.\n\nChina does not disclose official figures for the number of North Koreans working in factories and restaurants in China, although numbers are down from a peak period two to three years ago, according to Cheng Xiaohe, a North Korea specialist at Beijing's Renmin University.\n\n\"It's a hassle to hire North Korean workers though,\" the Korean-Chinese businesswoman from Dalian said. \"You need to have the right set-up. Their living space has to be completely closed off, you have to provide a classroom where they can take classes every day. They bring their own doctor, nurse, cook and teachers who teach them North Korean ideology every day.\"\n\nOne clothing factory that Reuters visited in Dandong employs 40 North Korean workers. They fill smaller orders for clients who are more stringent about their supply chains and expressly request no production inside North Korea.\n\nNorth Korean factory workers in China earn about 2,000 yuan ($300.25), about half of the average for Chinese workers, the factory owner said.\n\nThey are allowed to keep around a third of their wages, with the rest going to their North Korean government handlers, he said. A typical shift at the factory runs from 7:30 a.m. to around 10 p.m.\n\nThe workers -- all women dressed in pink and black uniforms -- sat close together behind four rows of sewing machines, working on a consignment of dark-colored winter jackets. The Chinese characters for \"clean\" and \"tidy\" were emblazoned in bold blue lettering above their heads and the main factory floor was silent but for the tapping and whirring of sewing machines.\n\nAdditional reporting by Lusha Zhang and the Beijing newsroom.\n\nBusiness Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch\n\nMake it your business.

This misbegotten deal provided Pyongyang 500,000 tons of heavy fuel oil annually and two light-water nuclear reactors in exchange for the North's promise to abandon its nuclear-weapons efforts.\n\nPyongyang violated its promise before the ink was dry. In 1999, former Secretary of State James Baker denounced Clinton's approach as \"a policy of appeasement.\" Baker's characterization also applies to much of the subsequent U.S. diplomacy. North Korea has always been willing to promise to abandon its nuclear ambitions to get tangible economic benefits. It just never gets around to honoring its commitments.\n\nAfter 25 years of failure, we need not tarry long (or at all) on more diplomacy with Pyongyang. Fred Ikle once characterized the North as capable of \"boundless mendacity.\" He was being charitable. Talking to North Korea is worse than a mere waste of time. Negotiations legitimize the dictatorship, affording it more time to enhance its nuclear and ballistic-missile capabilities.\n\nToday, only one diplomatic option remains, and it does not involve talking to Pyongyang. Instead, President Trump should urge President Xi Jinping that reunifying the Korean Peninsula is in China's national interest. This is a hard argument to make, requiring reversal of decades of Chinese policy. It should have been broached years ago, but it is still doable. There is now growing awareness in China that maintaining the two Koreas, especially given the current nuclear crisis, does not benefit China long-term.\n\nHistorically, the Korean Peninsula's 1945 partition was always intended to be temporary. Kim Il-Sung's 1950 invasion of South Korea and three years of ultimately inconclusive war resulted in hardening the bifurcation into its current manifestation. Beijing has backed the status quo, believing that North Korea provided a buffer between Chinese territory and U.S. military forces.\n\nMaintaining its satellite, however, has been expensive and risky. China has long supplied more than 90 percent of the North's energy needs, and vast quantities of food and other assistance to sustain Pyongyang's gulag. China has also expended enormous political and diplomatic energy, costing it precious international credibility, to protect the North's erratic regime.\n\nInitially, China saw the North's nuclear and ballistic-missile programs as a problem for America, Japan and South Korea rather than itself. That notion has disappeared, however, under the harsh prospect that today's nuclear crisis will be merely the first of many with North Korea. Moreover, Japan is now increasingly likely to seek its own nuclear capability, a nightmare for China in some respects more troubling than America.\n\nConfronted by this new, deeply threatening reality, Beijing's views on Korean reunification are ripe for change. China has never applied its uniquely strong economic leverage on Pyongyang because it feared so doing could cause catastrophic collapse of the North's regime. That would in turn produce two unacceptable consequences: massive Korean refugee flows across the border into China, and American and South Korean troops crossing the DMZ and quickly reaching the Yalu and Tumen Rivers.\n\nThe answer to China's fear of uncontrolled collapse is a jointly managed effort to dismantle North Korea's government, effectively allowing the swift takeover of the North by the South. China can start by quietly bribing the Kim regime's top military and civilian officials, offering political asylum and a safe exile for them and their families in China, while simultaneously cutting off energy and other supplies to the North. Seoul can also offer inducements to key North Korean leaders, reminding them what life could be like in a post-Kim world.\n\nSimultaneously, massive information efforts should be launched throughout the North to spread word quickly on what is happening. The population may lack cell phones and the Internet, but they are far more aware of the outside world than conventional stereotypes. The end of North Korea, and hence the end of its nuclear threat, would be inevitable. The process will undoubtedly be dangerous and somewhat chaotic, but far less so than a completely uncontrolled collapse. And whatever the risks, they pale before the risks of nuclear conflict emanating from the erratic Kim regime.\n\nWashington can offer Beijing two assurances to assuage its concerns. First, we would work closely with China to prevent massive refugee flows either into China or South Korea. Our common interests here are clear. Second, as the North begins to collapse, allied forces would necessarily cross the DMZ to locate and secure Pyongyang's nuclear, chemical and biological weapons stockpiles and to maintain civil order.\n\nThese forces would ultimately reach China's border, but we can commit to Beijing that Washington will not station troops there for a sustained period. Instead, we would pledge to base virtually all U.S. military assets near Pusan at the Peninsula's southern tip, to be available for rapid deployment around Asia. They would not constitute a watch on the Yalu.\n\nThe alternative to this last available diplomatic play is military force. The imperative of protecting innocent American civilians from the long-term threat of North Korea's nuclear capability dictates that we should be willing to strike those capabilities pre-emptively.

sanctions against the Kim Jong-un regime do not ban textile exports.\n\nClothes carrying \"Made in China\" labels are reportedly not manufactured in the mainland but in the reclusive North Korean border city of Dandong, according to Korean-Chinese businessmen and traders.\n\nWhile it is believed that North Korea is getting further isolated from the world with ever-tightening UN sanctions, in reality, it has been earning money by indirectly exporting textiles to various countries, Reuters reported on Sunday (13 August).\n\nOn 5 August, the UN Security Council unanimously agreed to slap economic sanctions on the Kim Jong-un regime, targeting the exports of seafood, coal, iron ore, iron, lead and lead ore.\n\nThe new UN sanctions, which were imposed to punish the country over its nuclear and missiles programs, will see North Korea's $3bn (\u00a32.3bn) annual export revenue slashed by a third.\n\nBut the 15-member council did not ban textile exports, which Chinese textile firms are said to be taking advantage of by availing cheap labour from across the border.\n\nThe clothes made in Dandong are reportedly sold in countries like the US, Japan, Canada, Europe, South Korea and Russia, Reuters reported an unnamed Korean-Chinese businessman as saying. He, like many others the news agency interviewed, did not want to be named because of the sensitivity of the subject.\n\n\"We take orders from all over the world,\" the businessman was quoted as saying. \"We will ask the Chinese suppliers who work with us if they plan on being open with their client - sometimes the final buyer won't realize their clothes are being made in North Korea. It's extremely sensitive.\"\n\nChinese suppliers reportedly send fabrics and other raw materials to North Korean factories across the border to get the clothes stitched, which are then exported.\n\nThe finished garments are first shipped to China from the North Korean factories before being sent to the rest of the world.\n\nBy getting clothes made in North Korea, manufactures can reportedly save up to 75% of the production cost, a Chinese trader who has lived in Pyongyang said.\n\nAccording to Chinese traders and agents in Dandong, it is a widespread practice.\n\nHowever, not all brand owners from the western world are reported to be aware of this practice.\n\nAn Australian sportswear brand, Rip Curl, had to issue a public apology when it got to know that some of its ski gear was made in a North Korean factory while it carried the label \"Made in China\". The company blamed a rogue supplier for outsourcing to \"an unauthorised sub-contractor\".\n\nAccording to the Korean-Chinese businessman, North Korean workers are more productive than their Chinese counterparts as they do not take too many toilet breaks, which they think can slow down their efficiency.\n\n\"North Korean workers can produce 30% more clothes each day than a Chinese worker,\" he said. \"They aren't like Chinese factory workers who just work for the money. North Koreans have a different attitude - they believe they are working for their country, for their leader.\"\n\nBesides, wages paid to North Korean labourers are reported to be far below the rates in other Asian countries.\n\nNorth Koreans working at the now-closed Kaesong industrial zone across the border from South Korea were apparently paid an average salary of only $160 (\u00a3124) a month, whereas a labourer in China received $450-$750 (\u00a3348-\u00a3580) a month.\n\nThe wages paid in Kaesong were reportedly much higher than what North Koreans working in factories in other parts of the country received.\n\nBecause of the cheap labour in North Korea, some of the Chinese businessmen and traders are not surprised that Chinese textile companies send many orders to the rogue nation or employ North Koreans.\n\nA North Korean factory worker employed in the Chinese mainland gets paid about 2,000 yuan (\u00a3232, $300), which is about half the average wages paid to Chinese workers, a factory owner said.\n\nThey reportedly get to keep only one-third of their income, while the rest has to be donated to the Kim Jong-un government.\n\nEmploying North Koreans in China is, however, no longer easy, a Korean-Chinese businesswoman from the Chinese port city of Dalian told Reuters.\n\n\"It's a hassle to hire North Korean workers. You need to have the right set-up. Their living space has to be completely closed off, you have to provide a classroom where they can take classes every day.\n\n\"They bring their own doctor, nurse, cook and teachers who teach them North Korean ideology every day,\" she said.\n\nNorth Koreas reportedly work long hours in factories, from 7.30 am to around 10 pm.", "timeCrawl": "13:22:00", "sim": 0.5058823823928833, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 518, "date": "2017-08-13", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 527}, {"textStart": 534, "date": "2017-08-05", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 542}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8919681", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/Asian", "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/Asian", "id": 299, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

The nation's 50th state, which is comprised of numerous islands and has a population of 1.4 million people, was the scene of the notorious Pearl Harbor attack in which American sailors were caught off-guard, aircraft carriers were sunk, and hundreds of defenseless sailors, soldiers, Marines and civilians were killed. On a worldwide scale, fears of an all-out #nuclear war have been mounting daily as the world watches and awaits the outcome of this crisis.\n\nHawaii is determined never to be caught off-guard again.\n\nRhetoric between President #Donald Trump and #Kim Jong Un, the despotic dictator of North Korea, has been escalating and international tensions have been rising steadily. Earlier this week, Pyongyang, North Korea's largest city, promised \"thousand-fold\" ramifications against the United States in response to severe sanctions that were imposed on the small, rogue nation. The sanctions, which cost North Korea over $1 billion, were imposed on the troubled nation because of its repeated missile tests. Some of the more recent missile tests have indicated that North Korean missiles could reach the continental United States.\n\nThis week it was revealed that North Korea now is capable of affixing small nuclear warheads to the missiles that it launches to points unknown. Since it has been confirmed that Hawaii is a reachable destination for Jong-un's missiles, the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency has been stepping up its readiness program.\n\nIn actuality, the agency began its readiness program months before the war of words between Trump and Jong-un began. The program began preparing in January of this year. Then in July of this year, North Korea successfully test-launched two intercontinental ballistic missiles and the world learned that the rogue nation's missiles could reach the United States and be affixed with small, nuclear warheads.\n\nIn the meantime, tensions between the United States and North Korea have been mounting exponentially, and so has the rhetoric. Trump stated earlier this week that any actions by North Korea against Guam, the United States or America's allies, would result in \"fire and fury\" [VIDEO] unmatched by anything ever seen in the world previously. Then later, Trump told reporters that perhaps his \"fire and fury\" threat was \"not strong enough.\" Jong-un claimed that he was going to launch multiple missiles in the direction of Guam and that he would reduce American citizens to \"jelly.\"\n\nIn the midst of all the threats, confusion and escalating tensions, there have been few if any attempts to solve our differences with North Korea diplomatically.\n\nAlthough Trump has stated that he has made some diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis, the threatening rhetoric between the two leaders has overshadowed whatever diplomatic efforts that have been made.\n\nIn the event that North Korea does fire any missiles towards Hawaii, the State would only have 20 minutes to respond. And the citizens would only have 15 minutes to get to the shelter and take cover. Needless to say, the State of Hawaii is in a rush to readiness and the island state is determined never to be caught off-guard again.", "timeCrawl": "17:58:00", "sim": 0.5058823823928833, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8949827", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "id": 144, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "id": 164, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "id": 500, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

threats they would be met with \"fire and fury,\" the Left and their media allies immediately went into an overactive uproar.\n\nThey claimed that the president's words had undermined our credibility, limited our options and escalated tensions.\n\nDid they?\n\nThese same folks didn't seem to have the same angst when President Clinton made virtually the same threats almost a quarter of a century ago.\n\nUnfortunately, Clinton's threats had no teeth. He allowed Jimmy Carter, an appeasement specialist with the diplomatic skills of Neville Chamberlain, to negotiate a deal with the Kim government. The 1994 'deal' failed.\n\nThere are three basic options for dealing with North Korea, a throwback to the Stalinist era and the most repressive regime on the planet.\n\nFirst, we could take out the Kim regime. Second, we can employ various forms of diplomacy to hold the regime in check and, third, we can pressure the Chinese, who hold North Korea's fate in their hands, to, in turn, force the North Koreans to stay in line.\n\nFor years, and through several administrations we went the diplomatic route. Former President Barack Obama called his approach \"strategic patience.\"\n\nWe've seen how that worked out.\n\nFor years as we sat patiently and watched, as barbarous thugs inside North Korea moved full speed ahead in their quest to achieve nuclear attack capability. A dangerous, unstable, unpredictable and irrational little dictator now has the capacity to kill millions of people.\n\nWe spoke softly, but carried no stick. It was weak diplomacy with no military option.\n\nObama's National Security Advisor, Susan Rice, this week said that we should \"tolerate\" Kim Jong Un having nuclear warheads on intercontinental ballistic missiles. That's the logical--and tragic--result of \"strategic patience.\" What else would be \"tolerable\"? An attack on Guam, Hawaii, Alaska or worse?\n\nVirtually every leader would prefer to see the situation defused without military action. They all know that a war on the Korean Peninsula would be catastrophic.\n\nHowever, having the Koreans who surround their young dictator know that the United States is prepared, if necessary, to unleash its' awesome military might could be the linchpin to diplomatic solutions.\n\nThe big stick sometimes gets the attention of even the most irrational.\n\nOur military options are limited by several factors, not the least of which is North Korea's proximity to Seoul and the nearly 25 million people who live in and around the South Korean capital, and the devastation that would occur there in the case of attacks by conventional, chemical or nuclear attack.\n\nShort of war there are options that can be exercised. It may be necessary to escalate, both with rhetoric and military buildup, to create the possibility of de-escalation.\n\nThat could include moving more assets into the area, including defensive systems like THAAD as well as offensive carrier strike groups.\n\nSuch moves would have two key audiences. One in North Korea, the other in China.\n\nChina is the potential key to the situation. Trump's words may have been intended as much for Chinese leader Xi as well as Kim.\n\nChina controls the food and energy supplies of North Korea. They have maximum leverage over Kim. If they can be convinced it's in their interest to end support of Kim's regime it would defang Kim.\n\nConvincing China that they must do more than provide lip service in favor of additional sanctions at the U.N. could take several forms. One thing that will help move the Chinese is convincing them that war is a credible possibility. That's a scenario they don't want.\n\nAnother is to hurt their economy. That could take several forms, especially limiting their banking access to western capital. Additionally, a consumer boycott of Chinese goods would certainly get Beijing's attention.\n\nThey'd also be concerned if Japan is viewed as going nuclear in response to Kim's provocation.\n\nDuring the presidential campaign, candidate Trump was especially effective in verbal jiujitsu, turning opponents strengths against them and disabling them. His rhetorical battle with Kim may be his international application of that approach.\n\nNorth Korea has historically believed that we feared warfare on the peninsula so much that we'd ultimately back down.\n\nTrump is now, through his rhetoric and actions, turning that strategy on Kim. He's beginning to convince them, and their Chinese allies, that war isn't worth it to them.\n\nIt's today's version of the Cold War \"MAD\" or Mutually Assured Destruction. The difference, of course, is that Kim Jung Un doesn't have the same value for life and basic rationality of Nikita Khrushchev.\n\nThis is not the time to quibble about rhetoric. It's no time for partisanship. It is time for a united stand against the recurring threats of a hostile regime.\n\nAvoiding war is paramount. The best way to do that is with a diplomacy that proceeds from manifest strength not perceived weakness.", "timeCrawl": "16:08:00", "sim": 0.4862745106220245, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8937464", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "id": 164, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Time_Period", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Time Period", "id": 286, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Topic", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Topic", "id": 653, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

I was too young to have any memories of the war we fought there. I did know an elderly man who was a member of a senior golfer's association who played in tournaments in South Korea. Gene was an avid golfer -- a country club champion for multiple years and quite a good teacher of the game though all of his expertise and patience. He loved his visits to South Korea and often entertained us with anecdotes.\n\nIt wasn't until I facilitated a book club on the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, \"The Orphan Master's Son,\" by Adam Johnson, that I began to take interest in North Korea. Unlike the attractive, multicolored picture of South Korea painted by Gene -- modern, free, quite western in thought and deed -- Johnson's extremely well-researched book on North Korea painted quite a different landscape. Stark, disturbing, cruel black and white images of the most extreme totalitarian regime describe the mental illustrations conjured by reading it.\n\nWith last week's saber rattling between President Donald Trump and North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, it is not surprising I have been doing a lot of thinking about that faraway and dangerous place.\n\nWhile it is quite easy to poke fun at Kim, what is happening now is truly no laughing matter. North Korea has 15 nuclear weapons, a standing army of 1.2 million soldiers and a reserve force numbering 7.7 million. Short- and long-range missiles round out its arsenal, and recent tests appear to signify the U.S. is in its sights. Make no mistake; North Korea poses a definite threat. But it is far from being a new threat. One of the first pieces of advice outgoing President Barack Obama gave to incoming President Trump was to consider North Korea to be his No. 1 priority among threatening nations.\n\nLast week, Congress and the United Nations, spearheaded by our ambassador Nikki Haley, imposed strict sanctions on North Korea, prompting reactions from both Trump and Kim Jung Un. Ratcheting up the rhetoric, Kim threatened to attack Guam, where two U.S. military bases and 168,000 Americans reside. Trump threatened \"fire and fury\" unlike any the world has seen before.\n\nWith disapproval of the president's language coming from both sides of the aisle, our secretary of state explained it is language that Kim understands, whereas the language of diplomacy seems to go right over his head.\n\nAs incongruous as it seems, I agree with both sides. Diplomacy is necessary, but sanctions and talking haven't deterred either Kim or his father before him from making constant progress in their nuclear programs. Maybe no-holds-barred threats will be more effective.\n\nAll I do know for sure is it's scary.\n\nPower versus tact? My thoughts keep going back to what all golf pros know. Power alone will never win. No matter how strong one drives, without a finessed short game, victory will not ensue.

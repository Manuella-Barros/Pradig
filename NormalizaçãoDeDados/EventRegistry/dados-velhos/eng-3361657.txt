There is no shouting, no tension.\n\n'Everybody is hugging each other, we are showing love because this is our home, this is our Grove and this is how we do it in our Grove.\n\n'It's heartbreaking, it really is heartbreaking, I don't want the world to forget it, don't want the nation, the country, to forget it could happen to them also.'\n\nMeanwhile the survivors of the Grenfell Tower disaster may have to wait a year to find new homes, with around 200 believed to still be holed up in hotels.\n\nTheresa May promised to find new accommodation within three weeks of the tragedy in June, but it has now been almost nine and the Government is drastically delaying its deadline.\n\nThe Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Sajid Javid, has written to residents pledging they will find them permanent homes 'as quickly as possible, and within 12 months'.\n\nSome of those involved in the march also wore messages on their clothes demanding justice and calling for citizens to come together to get the truth\n\nThe participants wore solemn looks on their faces as they walked from Notting Hill Methodist Church to Ladbroke Grove\n\nThere has been much anger from the community about how the fire spread so quickly with plastic cladding on the building blamed for the disaster\n\nThe survivors of the disaster may have to wait a year to find new homes, with around 200 believed to still be holed up in hotels\n\nIt comes following news that 70 of the 80-plus victims of the inferno have now been identified.\n\nAccording to the Royal Borough of Kensington & Chelsea, 134 families are still living in temporary accommodation, with a further 24 from Grenfell Walk, where properties were also destroyed in the fire.\n\nNo exact figure is available on how many people this equates to, but it is believed it could be around 200.\n\nThe council said all survivors had been offered one emergency solution, but only 19 families accepted, according to The Sunday Times.\n\nIt also emerged this week that barely 15 per cent of the \u00a318.9million raised in the wake of the Grenfell disaster has been given to survivors.\n\nData from the Charity Commission shows \u00a37.25million has been handed to distributing organisations on the ground.\n\nBut only \u00a32.8million has reached survivors, almost two months after the blaze ripped through the 24-storey tower block.\n\nSeventy of the victims of the blaze have now been identified and some of those involved chanted 'no justice, no peace' to show how they would not let the matter lie\n\nOrganisers said the march was not designed to be political, but was 'letting the world know we are still here' and remembering those lost\n\nIt also emerged this week that barely 15 per cent of the \u00a318.9million raised in the wake of the

of the Grenfell Tower fire will have their grades reviewed to ensure their higher education prospects are not compromised by the tragedy.\n\nKensington and Chelsea Council said it is working with local schools and exam boards to ensure that any pupils who sat tests around the time of the deadly blaze have their grades \"looked at, reviewed and modified accordingly if necessary\".\n\nTeenagers will also have access to counselling and mental health support on results days and when they start their new school terms in September.\n\nCouncil leader Councillor Elizabeth Campbell said: \"We know that some pupils took exams following the night of the fire and in the days afterwards, and I want to ensure that their chances of a university or sixth form place are not impacted by something totally out of their control.\n\nRead more A Level pass grades fall for first time in three years\n\n\"The council has written to schools and made support available as pupils come to collect GCSE and A-level results over the next two weeks.\n\n\"We will also be there with help when the first day of term arrives in September.\"\n\nMany applications for \"special consideration\" were made by schools in the borough during the summer term following the fire, in which at least 80 people perished.\n\nCouncil officials have been in touch with schools throughout the summer in preparation for results days, and have been fast-tracking mental health referrals from schools.\n\nSchools in the area are also being provided with money for new uniforms for children who lost belongings in the fire.\n\nIn

A silent march to mark the two month anniversary of the Grenfell tower fire on August 14, 2017 in London, England. Leon Neal/Getty\n\nSurvivors of the Grenfell Tower fire held a silent march through London on Monday night as they marked two months since a blaze that killed at least 80 people. The west London fire took place on June 14, with the actual death toll thought to be considerably higher than that which has been officially confirmed.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA more realistic number of confirmed deaths is among the information wanted by the survivors, who marched in a protest organized by Grenfell United. They are planning similar events on the 14th of each month going forwards. Those taking part in the march were asked to carry a candle or yellow ribbon in tribute to those who lost their lives two months ago.\n\nThe group of around 300 marched through residential streets of north Kensington to nearby Ladbroke Grove before ending near a memorial wall in the shadow of the burned out tower.\n\nA post on a Facebook group called Silent March - Grenfell Tower read: \"A silent and peaceful march to take place on the 14th of every month. This is to pay respect to those who are no longer with us. This is also a movement to ensure we get Justice4Grenfell. The silence can speak a thousand words. We are more powerful together!\"\n\nThe protest came before news on Tuesday morning that the public inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire will not address broader questions of social housing policy. The British government has confirmed that it will focus instead on the actions of Kensington and Chelsea council in the lead up to the fatal incident. It will also take into account the adequacy of regulations, the tower's recent refurbishment, and the response of authorities in the blaze's aftermath.\n\nTonight people are gathering in Latimer Road to mark two month anniversary of the #Grenfell tower tragedy. pic.twitter.com/VVi5Zb7wvX -- Fiona Rutherford (@Fi_Rutherford)\n\nAugust 14, 2017\n\nHundreds of people have now joined the silent march, demanding justice two months after the #Grenfell tragedy pic.twitter.com/a9dU8c3cSW -- Fiona Rutherford (@Fi_Rutherford)\n\nAugust 14, 2017\n\n#GrenfellTower 2 month anniversary marchers have walked around North Kensington and are now beginning a vigil under the Westway. @LBC pic.twitter.com/aKtVDr7ZiV -- Vincent McAviney (@Vinny_LBC)\n\nAugust 14, 2017\n\n\"This happened on @theresa_may\u200b's watch\" says one of 400 who joined a silent march to mark 2 months since the #GrenfellTower fire. pic.twitter.com/fo590hBnpD -- RT UK (@RTUKnews)\n\nAugust 15, 2017\n\nChants of \"no justice, no peace\" at end.

powers to act where we see internal fire safety problems such as compromised fire doors and combustible materials on staircases'\n\nLondon Fire Brigade has denied it signed off the refurbishment of Grenfell Tower amid reports the service was consulted over renovation works before the devastating blaze.\n\nThere was \"close liaison\" between the fire brigade and Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation (KCTMO) during the project, according to documents seen by the BBC.\n\nFirefighters were reportedly shown the \"fire safety features of the building\" after the work was completed last summer.\n\nBut London Fire Brigade said it did not have the legal powers to inspect cladding or structural changes to buildings.\n\nA spokesman said: \"We do not 'sign off' refurbishment and we only have legal powers to act where we see internal fire safety problems such as compromised fire doors and combustible materials on staircases.\n\n\"While firefighters regularly visit local buildings to familiarise themselves with the layout and the firefighting equipment such as hydrants, this is not the same as making a detailed inspection of a building refurbishment especially when many of the changes would sit outside of our powers.\n\n\"We are unable to confirm exactly what contact we had with the TMO regarding the tower because this is now subject to a public inquiry.\"\n\nThe refurbishment of the tower is one area being considered by the public inquiry into the fire, which left at least 80 dead.\n\nHundreds march silently to mark two months since Grenfell Tower fire\n\nDuring the \u00a38.6 million renovation, new cladding with a flammable core was wrapped around the tower, along with combustible insulation.\n\nIt is suspected the combination of these materials helped aid the spread of the inferno, which engulfed the building within minutes.\n\nAn independent review into building regulations and fire safety, led by Dame Judith Hackitt, was also announced last month.\n\nThe Department for Communities and Local Government said the fire \"raised serious questions\" about fire safety, centred on the use of flammable cladding in tower blocks.\n\nIn Pictures: Grenfell Tower after the fire 51 show all In Pictures: Grenfell Tower after the fire 1/51\n\nPolice have released images from inside the tower where at least 58 people have

Martin will also scrutinise the \"adequacy\" of building regulations, the recent refurbishment of the block and the causes of the fire.\n\nThe inquiry's first hearing will be held on September 14,

There is no shouting, no tension,\" a representative for the group told the Daily Mail. \"Everybody is hugging each other, we are showing love because this is our home, this is our Grove and this is how we do it in our Grove.\n\n\"It's heartbreaking, it really is heartbreaking, I don't want the world to forget it, don't want the nation, the country, to forget it could happen to them also.\"\n\nEven two months on from the disaster, hundreds of families remain in emergency accommodation, despite UK Prime Minister Theresa May pledging to rehouse all victims within two weeks.\n\nIt was reported that only 14 of the 158 families accepted a rehousing offer. It is understood the majority of residents turned down relocation offers as they do not want to move to a different area, or they are hesitant about being housed in a building with the same safety concerns of Grenfell Tower.\n\nDespite the backlog of rehousing cases, more than a thousand properties belonging to oligarchs and tycoons are standing empty in Kensington and Chelsea.\n\nAlso close to Grenfell is the Sutton Estate, which has 159 empty apartments - just enough to relocate the Grenfell families.\n\nThe apartments, however, have been made uninhabitable by the buildings' owner and developer, Affinity Sutton, which wants to demolish four of its blocks to create luxury properties.", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Industrial_Supply", "wgt": 100, "id": 106, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Industrial Supply"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security", "wgt": 100, "id": 107, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety", "wgt": 100, "id": 109, "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Emergency_Services", "wgt": 100, "id": 110, "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Emergency Services"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Safety_Engineering", "wgt": 100, "id": 401, "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Safety Engineering"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Notting Hill"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notting_Hill", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Notting Hill"}, "type": "loc", "id": "85456"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "loc", "id": "86522"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Royal Kensington and Chelsea"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Borough_of_Kensington_and_Chelsea", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Royal Kensington and Chelsea"}, "type": "loc", "id": "163637"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theresa_May", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "304328", "label": {"eng": "Theresa May"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "306144", "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "307492", "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309533", "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_magnate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "310092", "label": {"eng": "Business magnate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_housing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "310973", "label": {"eng": "Public housing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_block", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "312341", "label": {"eng": "Tower block"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "314055", "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "328040", "label": {"eng": "Methodism"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladbroke_Grove", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ladbroke Grove"}, "type": "loc", "id": "364219"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Pyne_Grenfell", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "595997", "label": {"eng": "Bernard Pyne Grenfell"}}]}

housing.\n\nDowning Street set out the terms of reference of the probe led by Sir Martin Moore-Bick, which will include scrutiny of building regulations and the actions of Kensington council (RBKC) both before and after the blaze that killed at least 80 people.\n\nBut the inquiry will fall short of considering the wider questions raised by the fire, including the impact of Britain's social housing shortage.\n\nThe terms will instead evaluate the cause and spread of the fire, the design and refurbishment of the tower, building regulations, compliance, RBKC and the emergency service response to the fire.\n\nTheresa May said while broader questions would not form part of the inquiry, she was \"determined\" they would not be left unanswered.\n\n\"The terms of reference set out by Sir Martin address crucial issues such as the cause of the fire and the adequacy of building and fire regulations which will allow the inquiry to get to the truth of what happened and learn the lessons to stop a similar catastrophe happening in the future,\" she said.\n\n\"We are taking action with the Housing Minister (Alok Sharma) meeting social housing tenants to discuss the challenges they face and we will be setting out further proposals in due course.\"\n\nBut Labour's shadow Housing Minister John Healey said it was \"deeply unsatisfactory\" that housing policy failings were being excluded from Sir Martin's remit.\n\nIn Pictures: Grenfell Tower after the fire 51 show all In Pictures: Grenfell Tower after the fire 1/51\n\nPolice have released images from inside the tower

Clearly, the Government are running scared,\" she said.\n\nTottenham Labour MP David Lammy, whose friend Khadija Saye died in the fire, said the decision was a \"grave injustice\" to those who died.\n\n\"I am deeply disappointed that the narrow terms of reference ignore issue of the provision and management of social housing in the UK,\" he said.\n\n\"The decision to duck these important issues and fail to learn the broader lessons of Grenfell represents a grave injustice to those who died.\"\n\nRead more London's housing market has been revealed as a centre for dirty money\n\nRadical Housing Network - an activist collective that includes the Grenfell Action Group - said the Government had missed an opportunity to answer wider questions.\n\n\"This is yet another refusal by the Government to confront the enormity of Grenfell, and the indictment of our housing system which it represents,\" a spokesperson said.\n\n\"Investigators should be looking at the social policies which allowed such a tragedy in 21st-century Britain, and the way these have created a housing system in which some people matter more than others.\"\n\nSir Martin had previously warned the scope of the investigation was unlikely to be broad enough to satisfy all survivors.\n\nThe 70-year-old's appointment in June proved controversial after it emerged he once ruled in favour of Westminster council to rehouse a homeless mother-of-five 50 miles away in Milton Keynes.\n\nMore about: Grenfell Tower grenfell Grenfell tower fire terms of reference public inquiry emma dent coad David Lammy Reuse

associations wrote an open letter saying that residents have \"no confidence\" in the Tenant Management Organisation, which manages social housing in Kensington and Chelsea.\n\nIt was revealed on Monday that none of the 200 or so survivors of the Grenfell fire have secured a permanent home, according to London's Evening Standard.\n\nHuffPost UK reported last week that residents living just metres from the charred shell of the west London tower are still suffering from a range of physical ailments as fears grow about poor air quality in the wake of the devastating blaze.\n\nThose living in nearby buildings spoke of breathing problems, nausea and even mini-strokes, since the disaster, the final death toll of which may never be known for certain.", "date": "2017-08-14", "categories":

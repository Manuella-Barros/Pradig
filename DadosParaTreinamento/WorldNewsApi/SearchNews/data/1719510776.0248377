Leah Washington and Joe Pugh, who announced their engagement in March 2022, enjoyed a drinks reception with their loved ones at the idyllic Woodlands Hotel in Leeds. Leah looked stunning in a white dress paired with a veil and elegant jewels, while her husband opted for a tuxedo and bow tie. But since the crash in 2015, the couple went through hard times and Leah once admitted she had \"drifted apart\" from her now husband Joe in the aftermath of the accident. Here, we look at their journey as a couple, from tragedy to their happily ever after. Horror crash Leah, a sixth-form student at the time, had been dating Joe Pugh, then aged 18, for six weeks when they made a last-minute decision on the morning of June 2, 2014, to go and have some fun at Alton Towers. Leah recalled in an interview with the Daily Mirror two months after the crash: \"I wanted to go on Sonic Spinball but Joe said there's no point queuing for ages because it's not that good. He suggested we go on The Smiler. I was scared because I'd never been on it before. I wanted to go on a ride I'd already been on. \"After an hour and a half wait we were sent to queue for the front row.\" It was then that Leah first heard there were problems with the \u00a318million ride. We sat down but they lifted the safety bars up after 10 minutes, saying there was a technical difficulty and we had to get off. We were waiting ages and I said to Joe, 'let's go'. But when you've queued that long, you wait.\" Couple suffered injuries Both Leah and Joe suffered serious injuries in the crash. Leah's leg was later amputated and Joe had shattered knees. But despite the devastating accident, Leah was bravely upbeat. During her first interview with us, she had a pair of sparkly blue crutches donated by Crystals and Crutches and talked excitedly about being on the guest list for a gig by her favourite band, OneDirection. The boys sent her a video message as letters and gifts from well wishers poured into the hospital. \"I want to say thank you to everyone,\" said Leah. She was discharged from the hospital on July 22 and turned 18 six days later. \"I didn't want to be in hospital for my 18th,\" she said. \"I had a good birthday at home but I just wasn't what I expected it to be. I've missed out on so much.\" Leah nearly died twice Leah revealed she nearly died twice as medics fought to save her while she was trapped in the wreckage of the rollercoaster. She said: \"I think of all the people who were in the park that day and I ask myself, why were we at the front of the ride when it happened? Why us? But I wouldn't wish this on anyone else.\" She admitted she felt \"nervous\" for the future due to the extent of her injuries. She said: \"It hasn't really sunk in yet but I'm nervous for the future, because I'll have a different path and a different life. I'm always going to have to put my leg on in the morning or use crutches. But I've got to move on and live with it. I just want to start my life again.\" Court case The owner of Alton Towers, Merlin, was fined \u00a35million for the crash in which a total of five passengers suffered life-changing injuries and others were seriously hurt. Judge Michael Chambers QC said Merlin Attractions Operations' safety procedures were \"woefully inadequate\" and a \"shambles\" in scathing criticism over the Smiler crash. He added: \"This was a needless and avoidable accident in which those injured were fortunate not to have been killed or to have bled to death.\" The two-day sentencing at Stafford Crown Court heard how the crash was like a 90mph car accident and that the victims waited nearly an hour in mid-air before paramedics were able to access the rollercoaster. Engagement Leah and Joe got engaged during a romantic holiday in Italy two years ago and announced the happy news on social media. Posting a snap of herself alongside Joe after they got engaged, Leah beamed as she showed off her new engagement ring. \"So this happened yesterday\u2026 I SAID YES,\" she revealed. 'Drifted apart' Leah previously admitted she \"drifted apart\" from her now husband Joe at first as she struggled to cope with her life-changing injuries following the crash. She described they had only been officially dating for a week when the crash happened and the difficulties their relationship faced as she was unable to care for herself. \"If you'd told either of us during the weeks that followed our horrific accident at Alton Towers that we'd be planning our wedding now, I don't think we'd have believed it,\" the influencer told OK! Magazine. Wedding day The couple finally tied the knot this weekend and celebrated their special day in Leeds. They were pictured smiling and chatting to guests at the drinks as a pianist played live music to mark the occasion. Exclusive photos from the ceremony show the pair laughing and smiling with their loved ones, with wedding guests looking elegant in suits and colourful dresses.

The judge made the comments as he rejected an application from Corus Entertainment to throw out Dong's lawsuit against the news agency, saying it is in the public interest to hear the case. A report early last year that cited unidentified sources suggested Dong privately advised a senior Chinese diplomat to hold off on freeing the Two Michaels, Canadians who were being held in arbitrary detention in China. Dong left the Liberal caucus in March 2023 to become an Independent, saying he sought to clear his name after those and other allegations related to foreign interference emerged. The court found the reporter who wrote the story had no documentation to back up the allegations, did not see a transcript of the conversation between Dong and the diplomat and did not keep notes that reflected what the sources said. Corus says in a statement it is disappointed in the decision, but it is encouraged by the judge's acknowledgment that foreign interference is a matter of public interest.

The judge also ordered Global to pay Dong's legal costs for the failed motion to have his lawsuit dropped.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber?

One side or the other will be vindicated, and it is in the public interest to have that determined.\"\n\nGlobal has defended its reporting on Dong and foreign interference. \"While we are disappointed in the decision, we are encouraged by the recognition of foreign government interference as a matter of public interest in Justice Perell's ruling,\" spokesperson Rishma Govani said Thursday. \"As the matter remains before the courts, we will not comment further at this time. \"\n\nSam Cooper, the reporter who wrote the stories at issue in the lawsuit, declined to comment when contacted by the Star.\n\nPosting Thursday on social media, Dong welcomed the chance to seek damages for the harm the court agreed was done to his reputation.\n\n\"It is now even clearer that Global News must apologize and retract their defamatory reporting. Until they do, I will continue to fight to clear my name in the courts,\" he wrote.\n\nThe stories in questions were published in the winter of 2023, and were part of a series of media reports that helped fuel concerns about alleged foreign interference in Canadian politics.\n\nThe lawsuit focuses on how Global News reported -- citing confidential sources -- that Dong was a \"witting\" recipient of China's help in winning the Liberal nomination to run in Don Valley North in 2019.\n\nThe broadcaster also reported that Dong told a Chinese consular official that Beijing should \"delay freeing\" two Canadians imprisoned in the country -- the so-called \"two Michaels,\" Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor -- in what Ottawa had condemned as hostage diplomacy.\n\nIn his report on foreign interference last year, former governor general David Johnston concluded there was \"well-grounded suspicion\" that China was involved in \"irregularities\" around Dong's 2019 nomination, but concluded that the allegation about the two Michaels was \"false.\"\n\nDocuments tabled at the ongoing public inquiry into foreign interference included a summary of the conversation about the two Michaels prepared by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS). The summary said Dong told the Chinese diplomat that Canadian opposition parties would view their release as evidence that it works to take a hard line on Chinese-Canadian relations, and that it would help public opinion in Canada for Beijing to book a court date or a hearing in the case.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nDong has always denied he urged Beijing not to release the two Canadians, and says he never knowingly participated in any Chinese meddling. Dong resigned from the Liberal caucus last spring and launched a defamation suit against Global.\n\nDespite the fact Dong has publicly said he wants to return to the Liberal caucus, he so far has not been accepted.\n\nIn his decision Wednesday, Perell focused primarily on the allegation about the two Michaels conversation, \"which is the matter which most disgraces his morality, his character, his reputation and his livelihood.\"\n\nPerell determined that Global News stories about foreign interference and Dong's communications are in the public interest, but that they also damaged Dong's reputation. The matter Perell was deciding was whether Dong should have the chance to \"repair the damage,\" the judge wrote.\n\n\"There is no dispute, and indeed, it is indisputable that the defendants' reports slandered Dong,\" Perell's decision said. \"There is no dispute, and indeed, it is indisputable that the defendants' reports caused immense damage to Dong, his reputation, and to his career prospects.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIn allowing the case to proceed, Perell said Global News had \"no tangible and no documentary corroboration of the information\" it got from confidential sources about the two Michaels conversation. Instead, he wrote, the information was \"provided by sources who at some indeterminate degree of hearsay relayed what they had read or what someone else had told them they had read in a transcript or a summary\" of Dong's conversation with the Chinese diplomat.\n\nPerell also questioned whether Global should have held off publishing the two Michaels story until it had clearer information \"before dropping a cluster bomb on Dong's reputation.\"\n\nHe wrote, \"Dong has demonstrated that his defamation action has substantial merit and that the defendants may have no valid defence.\"\n\nNo date has been set for a defamation trial.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_ballingall@thestar.com", "name": "Alex Ballingall", "type":

The man was transferred to BRFK\u2019s officers at the Hungarian-Austrian border and taken to Budapest where he was heard on charges of life threatening violent acts. The defendant refused to testify and his arrest was initiated. Last year, members of the organisation travelled to Budapest to take part in coordinated attacks in connection with the anniversary of the Nazi breakout of the Castle District during the siege of the capital in February 1945. Coinciding with the anniversary, members of the group used telescopic stun batons and pepper spray to attack several people whom they picked because they were wearing clothing indicating far-right views. The police later said that five coordinated attacks had been carried out on Feb. 9-11 in 2023 in Budapest, leaving four victims with serious and another five with light injuries. Three suspects were arrested on Feb 11, including a 38-year-old Italian woman, a 29-year-old German man and a 26-year-old German woman. BRFK said on its website that the German man extradited on Friday was one of the three suspects apprehended abroad. A search is on for another eleven suspects wanted on international warrants.", "summary": "<p>You must be logged into the site to view this content.</p>", "url": "https://www.budapesttimes.hu/hungary/german-authorities-extradite-to-hungary-a-suspect-in-antifa-case/", "image": "https://www.budapesttimes.hu/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/police02_policehu.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 03:20:14", "author": "Attila Leitner", "authors": ["Attila Leitner"], "language": "en", "source_country": "hu", "sentiment": -0.104}

But while his early focus was on upgrading sewer infrastructure and investing in parks, he has now been thrust into the national spotlight for his outspoken criticism of fellow Democrat Joe Biden, over the president\u2019s support for Israel\u2019s military offensive in Gaza. \u201cI\u2019ll be the first to say that we don\u2019t want to see [Donald]Trump reelected to the White House,\u201d Hammoud told AFP in an interview. \u201cBut people want to be inspired to come out.\u201d Dearborn, a suburb of Detroit famous as the birthplace of Henry Ford and home of the Ford Motor Company\u2019s headquarters, has a population of around 110,000 residents, of whom 55 per cent claim Middle Eastern or North African heritage. In 2020, Dearborn voters overwhelmingly supported Biden and their ballots could tip the scales in Michigan \u2014 a crucial swing state that may ultimately decide the White House winner in November\u2019s election. Hammoud\u2019s profile surged in January after he declined an invitation to meet with Biden campaign officials seeking to shore up the Muslim vote. Since then, he helped galvanize a movement that saw over 100,000 voters mark \u201cuncommitted\u201d in Michigan\u2019s Democratic primary in protest against Biden\u2019s policy on Israel, and was asked by Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein if he would be her running mate. Humble roots Hammoud, who won\u2019t meet the Constitutional requirement of being 35 until next March, was too young to accept the role, though he said the offer was \u201cvery humbling\u201d. Besides, he remains unsure about how he\u2019ll cast his ballot. \u201cI would say that no presidential candidate has earned my vote,\u201d said the father-of-two, urging both parties to pay attention to increasing public disapproval of Israel\u2019s actions. \u201cIf you look at all the polling data that\u2019s emerging across the country, from coast to coast, the issues that we have been advocating for, fighting for... are issues that have popular support.\u201d These demands include a permanent ceasefire as the pathway to provide safe harbour for all hostages and prisoners, unfettered access to humanitarian aid, and ending the supply of weapons to Israel. The son of Lebanese immigrants, Hammoud grew up in a \u201cworking poor\u201d blue collar family. His father drove a truck while his mother\u2019s father worked on an auto factory assembly line. He was drawn towards the Democratic Party for its support of the labor movement, and equally repelled by Republicans, whom he says have a history of \u201cdemonising Arab Americans, Muslim Americans and other people of colour\u201d. Hammoud\u2019s first dream was to become a physician, but he wasn\u2019t able to get the grades. He instead trained as an epidemiologist and began climbing the corporate ladder as a healthcare executive. But the sudden death of his beloved elder brother \u2014 Hammoud was the second of five children \u2014 made him re-evaluate his priorities, and in 2016 he won election to the state legislature. \u2018What will Biden do?\u2019 Then in 2022, he became the second in a trio of new Muslim mayors in the southeast Michigan cities of Dearborn, Dearborn Heights and Hamtramck. Hammoud immediately set to work righting historical wrongs. For decades, the city had been marred by a reputation for racism, exemplified by the openly segregationist policies of former mayor Orville Hubbard. Hammoud appointed the city\u2019s first Arab-American police chief, which led to a drastic drop in tickets issued to Black drivers within a year, according to his spokesman. Until the war in Gaza, triggered by Hamas\u2019 sudden attacks and hostage taking on October 7, 2023, Hammoud considered Biden a \u201ctransformative\u201d president, but now believes \u201cthe genocide outweighs the impact of that domestic policy\u201d. Hammoud sidesteps the question of whether he could ultimately endorse Biden under the right circumstances, emphasising that whatever he might say, it\u2019s too late for some of his constituents who have lost dozens of relatives to Israeli bombs. He has no doubt that Trump, who imposed a Muslim travel ban during his tenure, would be an utter disaster. But Hammoud recoils at suggestions that members of his community would be to blame for potentially paving the way for Trump\u2019s return by withholding their support for Biden. Asked how he would respond to this criticism, Hammoud said: \u201cThe question should be asked of President Joe Biden \u2014 what will he do to prevent Trump being reelected come this November? What will he do to help prevent the unraveling of American democracy and the fabric of our society?\u201d", "summary": "<!-- google_ad_section_start --><div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"><p>DEARBORN, United States \u2014 Abdullah Hammoud\u2019s election as the first Muslim mayor of Dearborn was a watershed moment for this city, an automaking hub home to the highest concentration of Arab-Americans in the United States.</p>\n<p>But while his early focus was on upgrading sewer infrastructure and investing in parks, he has now been thrust into the national spotlight for his outspoken criticism of fellow Democrat Joe Biden, over the president\u2019s support for Israel\u2019s military offensive in Gaza.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be the first to say that we don\u2019t want to see [Donald]Trump reelected to the White House,\u201d Hammoud told AFP in an interview. \u201cBut people want to be inspired to come out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dearborn, a suburb of Detroit famous as the birthplace of Henry Ford and home of the Ford Motor Company\u2019s headquarters, has a population o", "url": "https://jordantimes.com/news/world/arab-american-mayor-warns-biden-has-not-%E2%80%98earned-my-vote%E2%80%99", "image": "https://jordantimes.com/sites/default/files/styles/section_left_col/public/5_83.png?itok=RX2f0OgC", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-23 01:08:01", "author": "Green Party,issa", "authors": ["Green Party", "issa"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "jo", "sentiment": 0.256}

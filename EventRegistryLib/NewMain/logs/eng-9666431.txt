(AP) -- Louisiana has become the first state to require that the Ten Commandments be displayed in every public school classroom, the latest move from a GOP-dominated Legislature pushing a conservative agenda under a new governor.\n\nThe legislation that Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed into law on Wednesday requires a poster-sized display of the Ten Commandments in \"large, easily readable font\" in all public classrooms, from kindergarten to state-funded universities.\n\n\"If you want to respect the rule of law, you've got to start from the original lawgiver, which was Moses\" who got the commandments from God, Landry said.\n\nOpponents questioned the law's constitutionality and vowed to challenge it in court. Proponents said the the measure is not solely religious, but that it has historical significance. In the language of the law, the Ten Commandments are \"foundational documents of our state and national government.\"\n\nThe posters will be paired with a four-paragraph \"context statement\" describing how the Ten Commandments \"were a prominent part of American public education for almost three centuries.\" They must be in place in classrooms by the start of 2025.\n\nUnder the law, state funds will not be used to implement the mandate. The posters would be paid for through donations.\n\nThe law also \"authorizes\" but does not require the display of other items in K-12 public schools, including: the Mayflower Compact, which was signed by religious pilgrims aboard the Mayflower in 1620 and is often referred to as America's \"First Constitution\"; the Declaration of Independence; and the Northwest Ordinance, which established a government in the Northwest Territory -- in the present-day Midwest -- and created a pathway for admitting new states to the Union.\n\nNot long after the governor signed the bill into law at Our Lady of Fatima Catholic School in Lafayette on Wednesday, civil rights groups and organizations that want to keep religion out of government promised to file a lawsuit challenging it.\n\nThe law prevents students from getting an equal education and will keep children who have different beliefs from feeling safe at school, the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the Freedom from Religion Foundation said in a joint statement Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"Even among those who may believe in some version of the Ten Commandments, the particular text that they adhere to can differ by religious denomination or tradition. The government should not be taking sides in this theological debate,\" the groups said.\n\nThe controversial law, in a state ensconced in the Bible Belt, comes during a new era of conservative leadership in Louisiana under Landry, who replaced two-term Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards in January. The GOP holds a supermajority in the Legislature, and Republicans hold every statewide elected position, paving the way for lawmakers to push through a conservative agenda.\n\nSimilar bills requiring the Ten Commandments be displayed in classrooms have been proposed in other states including Texas, Oklahoma and Utah. However, with threats of legal battles over the constitutionality of such measures, no state besides Louisiana has succeeded in making the bills law.\n\nLegal battles over the display of the Ten Commandments in classrooms are not new.\n\nIn 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law was unconstitutional and violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says Congress can \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\" The high court found that the law had no secular purpose but rather served a plainly religious purpose.\n\n___\n\nAssociated

Jeff Landry signed into law on Wednesday requires a poster-sized display of the Ten Commandments in \"large, easily readable font\" in all public classrooms, from kindergarten to state-funded universities.\n\nOpponents questioned the law's constitutionality and vowed to challenge it in court. Proponents said the measure is not solely religious, but that it has historical significance. In the language of the law, the Ten Commandments are \"foundational documents of our state and national government.\"\n\nThe posters, which will be paired with a four-paragraph \"context statement\" describing how the Ten Commandments \"were a prominent part of American public education for almost three centuries,\" must be in place in classrooms by the start of 2025.\n\nUnder the law, state funds will not be used to implement the mandate. The posters would be paid for through donations.\n\nThe law also \"authorizes\" but does not require the display of other items in K-12 public schools, including: The Mayflower Compact, which was signed by religious pilgrims aboard the Mayflower in 1620 and is often referred to as America's \"First Constitution\"; the Declaration of Independence; and the Northwest Ordinance, which established a government in the Northwest Territory - in the present day Midwest - and created a pathway for admitting new states to the Union.\n\nNot long after the governor signed the bill into law at Our Lady of Fatima Catholic School in Lafayette on Wednesday, civil rights groups and organizations that want to keep religion out of government promised to file a lawsuit challenging it.\n\nThe law prevents students from getting an equal education and will keep children who have different beliefs from feeling safe at school, the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the Freedom from Religion Foundation said in a joint statement Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"The law violates the separation of church and state and is blatantly unconstitutional,\" the groups said in a joint statement. \"The First Amendment promises that we all get to decide for ourselves what religious beliefs, if any, to hold and practice, without pressure from the government. Politicians have no business imposing their preferred religious doctrine on students and families in public schools. \"\n\nIn April, State Senator Royce Duplessis told CBS affiliate WWL-TV that he opposed the legislation.\n\n\"That's why we have a separation of church and state,\" said Duplessis, who is a Democrat. \"We learned the 10 Commandments when we went to Sunday school. As I said on the Senate floor, if you want your kids to learn the Ten Commandments, you can take them to church.\"\n\nThe controversial law, in a state ensconced in the Bible Belt, comes during a new era of conservative leadership in Louisiana under Landry, who replaced two-term Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards in January. The GOP holds a supermajority in the Legislature, and Republicans hold every statewide elected position, paving the way for lawmakers to push through a conservative agenda.\n\nState House Representative Dodie Horton is the author of the bill. In April, she defended it before the House, saying the Ten Commandments are the basis of all laws in Louisiana, WWL-TV reported.\n\n\"I hope and I pray that Louisiana is the first state to allow moral code to be placed back in the classrooms,\" Horton said. \"Since I was in kindergarten [at a private school], it was always on the wall. I learned there was a God, and I knew to honor him and his laws.\"\n\nSimilar bills requiring the Ten Commandments be displayed in classrooms have been proposed in other states including Texas, Oklahoma and Utah. However, with threats of legal battles over the constitutionality of such measures, no state besides Louisiana has succeeded in making the bills law.\n\nLegal battles over the display of the Ten Commandments in classrooms are not new.\n\nIn 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law was unconstitutional and violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says Congress can \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\" The high court found that the law had no secular purpose but rather served a plainly religious purpose.", "source": {"uri":

In the language of the law, the Ten Commandments are \"foundational documents of our state and national government.\"\n\nThe posters, which will be paired with a four-paragraph \"context statement\" describing how the Ten Commandments \"were a prominent part of American public education for almost three centuries,\" must be in place in classrooms by the start of 2025.\n\nUnder the law, state funds will not be used to implement the mandate. The posters would be paid for through donations.\n\nThe law also \"authorizes\" but does not require the display of other items in K-12 public schools, including: The Mayflower Compact, which was signed by religious pilgrims aboard the Mayflower in 1620 and is often referred to as America's \"First Constitution\"; the Declaration of Independence; and the Northwest Ordinance, which established a government in the Northwest Territory -- in the present day Midwest -- and created a pathway for admitting new states to the Union.\n\nNot long after the governor signed the bill into law at Our Lady of Fatima Catholic School in Lafayette on Wednesday, civil rights groups and organizations that want to keep religion out of government promised to file a lawsuit challenging it.\n\nThe law prevents students from getting an equal education and will keep children who have different beliefs from feeling safe at school, the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the Freedom from Religion Foundation said in a joint statement Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"Even among those who may believe in some version of the Ten Commandments, the particular text that they adhere to can differ by religious denomination or tradition. The government should not be taking sides in this theological debate,\" the groups said.\n\nThe controversial law, in a state ensconced in the Bible Belt, comes during a new era of conservative leadership in Louisiana under Landry, who replaced two-term Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards in January. The GOP holds a supermajority in the Legislature, and Republicans hold every statewide elected position, paving the way for lawmakers to push through a conservative agenda.\n\nSimilar bills requiring the Ten Commandments be displayed in classrooms have been proposed in other states including Texas, Oklahoma and Utah. However, with threats of legal battles over the constitutionality of such measures, no state besides Louisiana has succeeded in making the bills law.\n\nLegal battles over the display of the Ten Commandments in classrooms are not new.\n\nIn 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law was unconstitutional and violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says Congress can \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\" The high court found that the law had no secular purpose but rather served a plainly religious purpose.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporter Jeffrey Collins in Columbia, South Carolina, contributed.\n\n___\n\nThe story has been corrected to clarify that the time for gubernatorial action did not lapse.

The controversial legislation has sparked significant debate regarding the separation of church and state, with legal challenges expected to follow.\n\nThe new law requires that by 2025, all public school classrooms, from kindergarten through state-funded universities, must display the Ten Commandments in a large, easily readable font.This move is part of a broader conservative agenda being pushed by the GOP-dominated Legislature under Governor Landry, who took office in January. The law stipulates that the Ten Commandments must be presented as a poster or framed document and should include a four-paragraph context statement highlighting their historical significance.\n\nWhat does the new law entail?\n\nThe legislation mandates that the Ten Commandments be displayed in all public school classrooms across Louisiana. The text must be presented in a large, easily readable font and accompanied by a context statement explaining the historical role of the Ten Commandments in American education.\n\nWhy was this law enacted?\n\nGovernor Jeff Landry and proponents of the bill argue that the Ten Commandments are foundational documents of American government and law. Landry stated, \"If you want to respect the rule of law, you've got to start from the original lawgiver, which was Moses.\" Supporters believe the measure has educational and historical significance, not just religious.\n\nWhat are the key arguments against the law?\n\nOpponents, including the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), argue that the law violates the separation of church and state as outlined in the First Amendment of the US Constitution. The ACLU and other civil rights organizations have said, \"The law violates the separation of church and state and is blatantly unconstitutional.\" They are preparing to challenge the law in court, citing previous Supreme Court rulings that similar measures have a plainly religious purpose and lack secular justification.\n\nWill state funds be used to implement this law?\n\nNo, state funds will not be used to implement the mandate. The law specifies that the posters must be funded through donations, not taxpayer money.\n\nAre there any similar laws in other states?\n\nWhile similar bills have been proposed in other states, including Texas, Oklahoma, and Utah, none have succeeded in making it into law due to legal challenges and concerns over constitutionality. Louisiana is the first state to successfully pass such a measure.\n\nWhat other items does the law authorize for display?\n\nIn addition to the Ten Commandments, the law authorizes but does not require the display of other historical documents in K-12 public schools, such as the Mayflower Compact, the Declaration of Independence, and the Northwest Ordinance.\n\nWhat are the expected legal challenges?\n\nCivil rights groups, including the ACLU, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the Freedom from Religion Foundation, have promised to file lawsuits challenging the law. They argue that the law could prevent students from receiving an equal education and create an unsafe environment for those with different beliefs. \"Even among those who may believe in some version of the Ten Commandments, the particular text that they adhere to can differ by religious denomination or tradition,\" the groups said in a joint statement.\n\nThe new law, set in a state within the Bible Belt, represents a significant development in the ongoing debate over the role of religion in public education. Governor Landry, who anticipated legal challenges, remarked, \"I'm going home to sign a bill that places the Ten Commandments in public classrooms. And I can't wait to be sued.\"\n\n(With inputs from agencies)\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Jeff Landry, saying it would unconstitutionally breach protections against government-imposed religion.\n\nChris Dier, who was named the Louisiana Teacher of the Year in 2020, said Thursday that he worried the required display could send a message that a \"teacher, school, community and state prefers certain religions over others\" and could make some students \"feel incredibly isolated.\"\n\nState officials are stressing the history of the Ten Commandments, which the bill calls \"foundational documents of our state and national government.\"\n\n\"The 10 Commandments are pretty simple (don't kill, steal, cheat on your wife), but they also are important to our country's foundations,\" Attorney Gen. Liz Murrill, a Republican ally of Landry who will defend the law in court, said in a social media statement.\n\nSimilar bills requiring the Ten Commandments be displayed in classrooms have been proposed in other statehouses -- including Texas, Oklahoma and Utah.\n\nEarlier Ten Commandments controversies\n\nIn 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says Congress can \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\" The high court found that the law had no secular purpose but rather served a plainly religious purpose.\n\nIn its most recent rulings on Ten Commandments displays, the Supreme Court held in 2005 that such displays in a pair of Kentucky courthouses violated the Constitution. At the same time, the court upheld a Ten Commandments marker on the grounds of the Texas state Capitol in Austin. Those were 5-4 decisions but the court's makeup has changed, with a 6-3 conservative majority now.\n\nThe issue has roiled politics in other states from time to time.\n\nIn Alabama, Roy Moore was removed as chief justice of the state Supreme Court in 2003 for disobeying a court order to remove a Ten Commandments monument from the court's building. After he was elected to the post again, Moore was suspended from the bench in 2016 after a judicial discipline panel ruled he had urged probate judges to refuse marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Moore disputed the accusation.\n\nVoters approved an amendment to the Alabama Constitution in 2018 saying schools and public buildings can display the Ten Commandments as long as it is done in a way that \"complies with constitutional requirements,\" such as being intermingled with historical documents.\n\nOther religion-government fights\n\nLouisiana has had a prominent role in the church-state legal fight before. In 1987, the Supreme Court struck down a 1981 Louisiana statute that required instruction on evolution to be accompanied by teaching on \"creation science.\" The court found that the statute had no identifiable secular purpose and the \"pre-eminent purpose of the Louisiana Legislature was clearly to advance the religious viewpoint that a supernatural being created humankind.\"\n\nMississippi has mandated the display of \"In God We Trust\" in schools since 2001. Louisiana passed a similar mandate that became law last year.\n\nThe latest pushes to post the Ten Commandments follow a major victory for the religious right in 2022: The Supreme Court ruled that a high school football coach in the state of Washington who knelt and prayed on the field after games was protected by the Constitution.\n\nHow the Ten Commandments are viewed\n\nJews and Christians regard the Ten Commandments as having been given by God given to Moses, according to biblical accounts, to Moses on Mount Sinai. Not every Christian tradition uses the same Ten Commandments. The order varies as does the phrasing, depending on which Bible translation is used. The Ten Commandments in the signed Louisiana legislation are listed in an order common among some Protestant and Orthodox traditions.\n\nAssociated Press writers Sara Cline in Baton Rouge, Louisiana;

Source: AP\n\nLouisiana became the first state in the United States to require that the Ten Commandments be displayed in every public school classroom. The latest law that stirred headlines was passed by a GOP-dominated Legislature under a brand-new governor.\n\nThe legislation in question requires schools to put out a poster-sized display of the Ten Commandments in \"large, easily readable font\" in all public classrooms. The opponents questioned the constitutionality of the law and vowed to challenge it in court.\n\nMeanwhile, the proponents of the legislation argued that the measure is solely not religious but also has historical significance. They referred to the Ten Commandments as the \"foundational document\" of the country.\n\nKey aspects of the law\n\nThe posters that are mandatory in all classrooms will also be paired with a four-paragraph \"context statement\" describing how the Ten Commandments \"were a prominent part of American public education for almost three centuries.\" The Louisiana government set the year 2025 as a deadline for the implementation of the law, CBS News reported.\n\nAnother interesting aspect of the legislation is the fact that under the law, the state funds will not be used to implement the mandate, posters would be paid only through donations.\n\nShortly after Louisiana's Republican Governor Jeff Landry signed the bill into law at Our Lady of Fatima Catholic School in Lafayette on Wednesday, several civil rights groups demanded the government to keep religion and politics separated from each other.\n\nCriticisms that followed\n\nIn a joint statement from the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the Freedom from Religion Foundation, it was argued that the law will keep children who have different beliefs from feeling safe at school.\n\n\"The law violates the separation of church and state and is blatantly unconstitutional,\" the groups argued. \"The First Amendment promises that we all get to decide for ourselves what religious beliefs, if any, to hold and practice, without pressure from the government. Politicians have no business imposing their preferred religious doctrine on students and families in public schools,\" the statement further reads.\n\nIn April this year, Louisiana State Senator Royce Duplessis said that he is apprehensive about the legislation. \"That's why we have a separation of church and state,\" Duplessis said in a conversation with CBS News.\n\n\"We learned the 10 Commandments when we went to Sunday school.

(AP) -- Louisiana has become the first state to require that the Ten Commandments be displayed in every public school classroom under a bill signed into law by Republican Gov. Jeff Landry on Wednesday.\n\nThe GOP-drafted legislation mandates that a poster-sized display of the Ten Commandments in \"large, easily readable font\" be required in all public classrooms, from kindergarten to state-funded universities. Although the bill did not receive final approval from Landry, the time for gubernatorial action -- to sign or veto the bill -- has lapsed.\n\nOpponents question the law's constitutionality, warning that lawsuits are likely to follow. Proponents say the purpose of the measure is not solely religious, but that it has historical significance. In the law's language, the Ten Commandments are described as \"foundational documents of our state and national government.\"\n\nThe displays, which will be paired with a four-paragraph \"context statement\" describing how the Ten Commandments \"were a prominent part of American public education for almost three centuries,\" must be in place in classrooms by the start of 2025.\n\nThe posters would be paid for through donations. State funds will not be used to implement the mandate, based on language in the legislation.\n\nThe law also \"authorizes\" -- but does not require -- the display of the Mayflower Compact, the Declaration of Independence and the Northwest Ordinance in K-12 public schools.\n\nSimilar bills requiring the Ten Commandments be displayed in classrooms have been proposed in other states including Texas, Oklahoma and Utah. However, with threats of legal battles over the constitutionality of such measures, no state besides Louisiana has had success in making the bills law.\n\nCivil rights groups filed a lawsuit over the new law Thursday evening. They cite a 1980 U.S. Supreme court decision banning the public display of the commandments. Landry said he welcomes being sued.\n\nIn 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law was unconstitutional and violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says Congress can \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\" The high court found that the law had no secular purpose but rather served a plainly religious purpose.\n\nLouisiana's controversial law, in a state ensconced in the Bible Belt, comes during a new era of conservative leadership in the state under Landry, who replaced two-term Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards in January.\n\nThe GOP also has a two-thirds supermajority in the Legislature, and Republicans hold every statewide elected position, paving the way for lawmakers to push through a conservative agenda during the legislative session that concluded earlier this month.", "source": {"uri": "kadn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KADN News 15"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Jeff Landry signed the requirement into law Wednesday.\n\nHouse Bill 71, approved by state lawmakers last month, mandates that a poster-size display of the Ten Commandments with \"large, easily readable font\" be in every classroom at schools that receive state funding, from kindergarten through the university level.\n\nThe legislation specifies the exact language that must be printed on the classroom displays and outlines that the text of the Ten Commandments must be the central focus of the poster or framed document.\n\nBefore signing the bill, Landry called it \"one of (his) favorites.\"\n\n\"If you want to respect the rule of law, you gotta start from the original law given which was Moses. ... He got his commandments from God,\" Landry said.\n\nOpponents of the bill have argued that a state requiring a religious text in all classrooms would violate the establishment clause of the US Constitution, which says that Congress can \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\"\n\nCivil liberties groups swiftly vowed to challenge the law - which makes Louisiana the first in the nation to require the Ten Commandments be displayed in every classroom that receives state funding - in court.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana, Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the Freedom from Religion Foundation said that the law violates longstanding Supreme Court precedent and the First Amendment and would result in \"unconstitutional religious coercion of students.\"\n\n\"The First Amendment promises that we all get to decide for ourselves what religious beliefs, if any, to hold and practice, without pressure from the government. Politicians have no business imposing their preferred religious doctrine on students and families in public schools,\" the groups said in a joint statement.\n\nSupporters of the law, in defending the measure, have leaned on the 2022 US Supreme Court decision in Kennedy v. Bremerton School District, which gave a high school football coach his job back after he was disciplined over a controversy involving prayer on the field. The Supreme Court ruled that the coach's prayers amounted to private speech, protected by the First Amendment, and could not be restricted by the school district.\n\nThe decision lowered the bar between church and state in an opinion that legal experts predicted would allow more religious expression in public spaces. At the time, the court clarified that a government entity does not necessarily violate the establishment clause by permitting religious expression in public.\n\nLouisiana state Rep. Dodie Horton, the Republican author of the bill, said at the bill signing that \"it's like hope is in the air everywhere.\" Horton has dismissed concerns from Democratic opponents of the measure, saying the Ten Commandments are rooted in legal history and her bill would place a \"moral code\" in the classroom.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 CNN.

Jeff Landry, saying it would unconstitutionally breach protections against government-imposed religion.\n\nChris Dier, who was named the Louisiana Teacher of the Year in 2020, said Thursday that he worried the required display could send a message that a \"teacher, school, community and state prefers certain religions over others\" and could make some students \"feel incredibly isolated.\"\n\nState officials are stressing the history of the Ten Commandments, which the bill calls \"foundational documents of our state and national government.\"\n\n\"The 10 Commandments are pretty simple (don\u00b4t kill, steal, cheat on your wife), but they also are important to our country\u00b4s foundations,\" Attorney Gen. Liz Murrill, a Republican ally of Landry who will defend the law in court, said in a social media statement.\n\nA copy of the Ten Commandments hangs in the Alabama Capitol in Montgomery, Ala., Thursday, June 20, 2024. The wooden plaque hangs next to a display titled \"The Foundation of Our Law\" that also includes information about the Magna Carta and the Mayflower Compact. The display sits in a room that housed the Alabama Supreme Court library between 1885 and 1940 and is now used for historical displays. (AP Photo/Kim Chandler)\n\nSimilar bills requiring the Ten Commandments be displayed in classrooms have been proposed in other statehouses - including Texas, Oklahoma and Utah.\n\nIn 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says Congress can \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\" The high court found that the law had no secular purpose but rather served a plainly religious purpose.\n\nIn its most recent rulings on Ten Commandments displays, the Supreme Court held in 2005 that such displays in a pair of Kentucky courthouses violated the Constitution. At the same time, the court upheld a Ten Commandments marker on the grounds of the Texas state Capitol in Austin. Those were 5-4 decisions but the court\u00b4s makeup has changed, with a 6-3 conservative majority now.\n\nThe issue has roiled politics in other states from time to time.\n\nIn Alabama, Roy Moore was removed as chief justice of the state Supreme Court in 2003 for disobeying a court order to remove a Ten Commandments monument from the court's building. After he was elected to the post again, Moore was suspended from the bench in 2016 after a judicial discipline panel ruled he had urged probate judges to refuse marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Moore disputed the accusation.\n\nVoters approved an amendment to the Alabama Constitution in 2018 saying schools and public buildings can display the Ten Commandments as long as it is done in a way that \"complies with constitutional requirements,\" such as being intermingled with historical documents.\n\nLouisiana has had a prominent role in the church-state legal fight before. In 1987, the Supreme Court struck down a 1981 Louisiana statute that required instruction on evolution to be accompanied by teaching on \"creation science.\" The court found that the statute had no identifiable secular purpose and the \"pre-eminent purpose of the Louisiana Legislature was clearly to advance the religious viewpoint that a supernatural being created humankind.\"\n\nMississippi has mandated the display of \"In God We Trust\" in schools since 2001. Louisiana passed a similar mandate that became law last year.\n\nThe latest pushes to post the Ten Commandments follow a major victory for the religious right in 2022: The Supreme Court ruled that a high school football coach in the state of Washington who knelt and prayed on the field after games was protected by the Constitution.\n\nJews and Christians regard the Ten Commandments as having been given by God given to Moses, according to biblical accounts, to Moses on Mount Sinai. Not every Christian tradition uses the same Ten Commandments. The order varies as does the phrasing, depending on which Bible translation is used. The Ten Commandments in the signed Louisiana legislation are listed in an order common among some Protestant and Orthodox traditions.\n\nAssociated Press writers Sara Cline in Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Mark Sherman in Washington; Holly Meyer in Nashville, Tennessee; Emily Wagster Pettus in Jackson, Mississippi; and Peter Smith in Pittsburgh contributed to this report.\n\nLouisiana Gov. Jeff Landry signs bills related to his education plan on Wednesday, June 19, 2024, at Our Lady of Fatima Catholic School in Lafayette, La. Louisiana has become the first state to require that the Ten Commandments be displayed in every public school classroom, the latest move from a GOP-dominated Legislature pushing a conservative agenda under a new governor.

The government should not be taking sides in this theological debate,\" the groups said.\n\nThe controversial law comes during a new era of conservative leadership in Louisiana under Landry, who replaced two-term Democrat John Bel Edwards in January.\n\nSimilar bills have been proposed in other states including Texas, Oklahoma and Utah, but only Louisiana has thus far made it law.\n\nIn 1980, the US Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law was unconstitutional and violated a clause of the US Constitution, which says Congress can \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\"\n\nThe high court found that the law had no secular purpose but rather served a plainly religious purpose.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"},

Louisiana passed a similar mandate that became law last year.\n\nThe latest pushes to post the Ten Commandments follow a major victory for the religious right in 2022: The Supreme Court ruled that a high school football coach in the state of Washington who knelt and prayed on the field after games was protected by the Constitution.\n\nHow the Ten Commandments are viewed\n\nJews and Christians regard the Ten Commandments as having been given by God to Moses, according to biblical accounts, on Mount Sinai. Not every Christian tradition uses the same Ten Commandments. The order varies as does the phrasing, depending on which Bible translation is used. The Ten Commandments in the signed Louisiana legislation are listed in an order common among some Protestant and Orthodox traditions.\n\nAssociated Press writers Sara Cline in Baton Rouge, Louisiana;

Louisiana passed a similar mandate that became law last year.\n\nThe latest pushes to post the Ten Commandments follow a major victory for the religious right in 2022: The Supreme Court ruled that a high school football coach in the state of Washington who knelt and prayed on the field after games was protected by the Constitution.\n\nHow the Ten Commandments are viewed\n\nJews and Christians regard the Ten Commandments as having been given by God given to Moses, according to biblical accounts, to Moses on Mount Sinai. Not every Christian tradition uses the same Ten Commandments. The order varies as does the phrasing, depending on which Bible translation is used. The Ten Commandments in the signed Louisiana legislation are listed in an order common among some Protestant and Orthodox traditions.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Sara Cline in Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Mark Sherman in Washington; Holly Meyer in Nashville, Tennessee; Emily Wagster Pettus in Jackson, Mississippi; and Peter Smith in Pittsburgh contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Jeff Landry signed a bill drafted by the state's GOP-controlled legislature. It mandates that by Jan. 1, 2025, every public school classroom must display the Ten Commandments \"on a poster or framed document that is at least eleven inches by fourteen inches,\" and adds that \"[t]he text of the Ten Commandments shall be the central focus of the poster or framed document and shall be printed in a large, easily readable font.\"\n\n\"If you want to respect the rule of law, you have to respect the original law giver, Moses,\" Landry said as he signed the bill Wednesday.\n\nThe law's related \"context statement\" said that the Ten Commandments \"stand out as pivotal in the religious history of America and Louisiana's legal system,\" along with the Mayflower Compact, the Declaration of Independence, the Northwest Ordinance, and the Constitution.\n\n\"It is hoped that their study and relation to each other and the history of our state and nation will foster an appreciation for the role that religion has played in the legal history of America and the state of Louisiana and prompt further public study,\" the state legislature explained.\n\nFurther, the legislature said, \"American law, constitutionalism, and political theory have deep roots in religion,\" and the Ten Commandments \"was one of the earliest written expressions of law to be incorporated in American legal systems.\"\n\nLike a similar statute attempted in Texas, the constitutional issues raised by Louisiana's new statute are obvious: Any requirement that public schools post religious documents raises a clear First Amendment issue. Under the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, the government may not establish or endorse an official American religion, and legislation that involves religion must have some legitimate secular or legislative purpose. Whether Louisiana's stated purpose of educating children about the role of religion in American legal history constitutes a legitimate secular purpose is a matter for a court to decide.\n\nThe Supreme Court specifically addressed the posting of the Ten Commandments in classrooms in 1980 when it struck down a Kentucky statute that required posters to be displayed in classrooms. In 2005, the Supreme Court voted to leave in place a ruling against Alabama's former chief justice, Roy Moore, who defied a federal order to dismantle a Ten Commandments monument in the rotunda of the state's Supreme Court.\n\nIn addition to Texas, Oklahoma and Utah have also attempted to pass legislation that requires display of the Ten Commandments in classrooms. However, only Louisiana has been successful in passing the laws to date.\n\nThe Freedom From Religion Foundation, the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Louisiana and Americans United for Separation of Church and State issued a joint statement Wednesday calling the law \"blatantly unconstitutional,\" and announcing that they intend to challenge it in court.\n\n\"Politicians have no business imposing their preferred religious doctrine on students and families in public schools,\" the groups said, noting that Louisiana's public schools are religiously diverse and that even among religious individuals, there is disagreement bout the particular text or version of the Ten Commandments.\n\n\"The government should not be taking sides in this theological debate, and it certainly should not be coercing students to submit day in and day out to unavoidable promotions of religious doctrine,\" the statement read.\n\nLandry has already gone on record as welcoming legal challenges to the statute. At a fundraiser Saturday, the governor remarked, \"I can't wait to be sued,\" when asked about the Ten Commandments mandate.", "source": {"uri": "lawandcrime.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Law &

Jeff Landry, saying it would unconstitutionally breach protections against government-imposed religion.\n\nChris Dier, who was named the Louisiana Teacher of the Year in 2020, said Thursday that he worried the required display could send a message that a \"teacher, school, community and state prefers certain religions over others\" and could make some students \"feel incredibly isolated.\"\n\nState officials are stressing the history of the Ten Commandments, which the bill calls \"foundational documents of our state and national government.\"\n\n\"The 10 Commandments are pretty simple (don't kill, steal, cheat on your wife), but they also are important to our country's foundations,\" Attorney Gen. Liz Murrill, a Republican ally of Landry who will defend the law in court, said in a social media statement.\n\nSimilar bills requiring the Ten Commandments be displayed in classrooms have been proposed in other statehouses -- including Texas, Oklahoma and Utah.\n\nEarlier Ten Commandments controversies\n\nIn 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says Congress can \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\" The high court found that the law had no secular purpose but rather served a plainly religious purpose.\n\nIn its most recent rulings on Ten Commandments displays, the Supreme Court held in 2005 that such displays in a pair of Kentucky courthouses violated the Constitution. At the same time, the court upheld a Ten Commandments marker on the grounds of the Texas state Capitol in Austin. Those were 5-4 decisions but the court's makeup has changed, with a 6-3 conservative majority now.\n\nThe issue has roiled politics in other states from time to time.\n\nIn Alabama, Roy Moore was removed as chief justice of the state Supreme Court in 2003 for disobeying a court order to remove a Ten Commandments monument from the court's building. After he was elected to the post again, Moore was suspended from the bench in 2016 after a judicial discipline panel ruled he had urged probate judges to refuse marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Moore disputed the accusation.\n\nVoters approved an amendment to the Alabama Constitution in 2018 saying schools and public buildings can display the Ten Commandments as long as it is done in a way that \"complies with constitutional requirements,\" such as being intermingled with historical documents.\n\nOther religion-government fights\n\nLouisiana has had a prominent role in the church-state legal fight before. In 1987, the Supreme Court struck down a 1981 Louisiana statute that required instruction on evolution to be accompanied by teaching on \"creation science.\" The court found that the statute had no identifiable secular purpose and the \"pre-eminent purpose of the Louisiana Legislature was clearly to advance the religious viewpoint that a supernatural being created humankind.\"\n\nMississippi has mandated the display of \"In God We Trust\" in schools since 2001. Louisiana passed a similar mandate that became law last year.\n\nThe latest pushes to post the Ten Commandments follow a major victory for the religious right in 2022: The Supreme Court ruled that a high school football coach in the state of Washington who knelt and prayed on the field after games was protected by the Constitution.\n\nHow the Ten Commandments are viewed\n\nJews and Christians regard the Ten Commandments as having been given by God given to Moses, according to biblical accounts, to Moses on Mount Sinai. Not every Christian tradition uses the same Ten Commandments. The order varies as does the phrasing, depending on which Bible translation is used. The Ten Commandments in the signed Louisiana legislation are listed in an order common among some Protestant and Orthodox traditions.", "source": {"uri": "newsday.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Kim Chandler/Associated Press\n\nNEW ORLEANS -- A bill signed into law this week makes Louisiana the only state to require that the Ten Commandments be displayed in every classroom in public schools and colleges - and stirs the long-running debate over the role of religion in government institutions.\n\nUnder the new law, all public K-12 classrooms and state-funded universities will be required to display a poster-sized display of the Ten Commandments in \"large, easily readable font\" next year.\n\nCivil liberties groups planned lawsuits to block the law signed by Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, saying it would unconstitutionally breach protections against government-imposed religion.\n\nRelated New law requires all Louisiana public school classrooms to display Ten Commandments\n\nChris Dier, who was named the Louisiana Teacher of the Year in 2020, said Thursday that he worried the required display could send a message that a \"teacher, school, community and state prefers certain religions over others\" and could make some students \"feel incredibly isolated.\"\n\nState officials are stressing the history of the Ten Commandments, which the bill calls \"foundational documents of our state and national government.\"\n\n\"The 10 Commandments are pretty simple (don't kill, steal, cheat on your wife), but they also are important to our country's foundations,\" Attorney Gen. Liz Murrill, a Republican ally of Landry who will defend the law in court, said in a social media statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimilar bills requiring the Ten Commandments be displayed in classrooms have been proposed in other statehouses - including Texas, Oklahoma and Utah.\n\nEarlier Ten Commandments controversies\n\nIn 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says Congress can \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\" The high court found that the law had no secular purpose but rather served a plainly religious purpose.\n\nIn its most recent rulings on Ten Commandments displays, the Supreme Court held in 2005 that such displays in a pair of Kentucky courthouses violated the Constitution. At the same time, the court upheld a Ten Commandments marker on the grounds of the Texas state Capitol in Austin. Those were 5-4 decisions but the court's makeup has changed, with a 6-3 conservative majority now.\n\nThe issue has roiled politics in other states from time to time.\n\nIn Alabama, Roy Moore was removed as chief justice of the state Supreme Court in 2003 for disobeying a court order to remove a Ten Commandments monument from the court's building. After he was elected to the post again, Moore was suspended from the bench in 2016 after a judicial discipline panel ruled he had urged probate judges to refuse marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Moore disputed the accusation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVoters approved an amendment to the Alabama Constitution in 2018 saying schools and public buildings can display the Ten Commandments as long as it is done in a way that \"complies with constitutional requirements,\" such as being intermingled with historical documents.\n\nOther religion-government fights\n\nLouisiana has had a prominent role in the church-state legal fight before. In 1987, the Supreme Court struck down a 1981 Louisiana statute that required instruction on evolution to be accompanied by teaching on \"creation science.\" The court found that the statute had no identifiable secular purpose and the \"pre-eminent purpose of the Louisiana Legislature was clearly to advance the religious viewpoint that a supernatural being created humankind.\"\n\nMississippi has mandated the display of \"In God We Trust\" in schools since 2001. Louisiana passed a similar mandate that became law last year.\n\nThe latest pushes to post the Ten Commandments follow a major victory for the religious right in 2022: The Supreme Court ruled that a high school football coach in the state of Washington who knelt and prayed on the field after games was protected by the Constitution.\n\nHow the Ten Commandments are viewed\n\nJews and Christians regard the Ten Commandments as having been given by God given to Moses, according to biblical accounts, to Moses on Mount Sinai. Not every Christian tradition uses the same Ten Commandments. The order varies as does the phrasing, depending on which Bible translation is used. The Ten Commandments in the signed Louisiana legislation are listed in an order common among some Protestant and Orthodox traditions.\n\nAssociated Press writers Sara Cline in Baton Rouge, Louisiana;

Jeff Landry (R) signed legislation Wednesday requiring every public classroom in Louisiana to display the Ten Commandments, becoming the first state with such a law and inflaming tensions over the separation between church and state.\n\n\"This bill mandates the display of the Ten Commandments in every classroom - public elementary, secondary and post-education schools - in the state of Louisiana, because if you want to respect the rule of law, you've got to start from the original lawgiver, which was Moses,\" Landry said at a bill-signing ceremony.\n\nCritics vowed to challenge the law in court, calling it unconstitutional and warning that it will lead to religious coercion of students.\n\n\"The First Amendment promises that we all get to decide for ourselves what religious beliefs, if any, to hold and practice, without pressure from the government,\" the Louisiana chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, the Freedom From Religion Foundation and other groups said in a joint statement Wednesday. \"Politicians have no business imposing their preferred religious doctrine on students and families in public schools.\"\n\nLandry has signaled that he welcomes the fight.\n\n\"I'm going home to sign a bill that places the Ten Commandments in public classrooms,\" he said Saturday at a GOP fundraiser in Nashville, the Tennessean reported. \"And I can't wait to be sued.\"\n\nThe law gives schools until Jan. 1 to display the Ten Commandments - religious and ethical directives handed down to the prophet Moses in the Bible - on \"a poster or framed document that is at least eleven inches by fourteen inches\" in every classroom. The commandments have to be the display's \"central focus\" and be \"printed in a large, easily readable font.\"\n\nThe law requires a context statement to accompany the commandments, positioning the text as \"a prominent part of American public education\" from the late 17th century through the late 20th century. Schools have to use donated posters or spend donated money, rather than public funds, to purchase the displays.\n\nThe Louisiana House overwhelmingly passed the bill in April, and the state Senate followed suit in May. Both votes largely fell along party lines in the Republican-controlled chambers.\n\nSimilar proposals to display the Ten Commandments in schools have been introduced - but have not become law - in Texas, Oklahoma, Mississippi and South Carolina. In Utah, lawmakers diluted an attempt to mandate the commandments in classrooms, instead adding the religious directives to a list of documents that can be discussed in classrooms.\n\nLawmakers in mostly Republican-led states have proposed other efforts that blur the lines between church and state in recent years, with some framing the movement as an attempt to reclaim religious freedom.\n\nPublic education has been a common battleground. Inspired by a law passed in Texas in 2023, more than a dozen states have introduced legislation this year to bring chaplains into public schools. And as school voucher programs expand rapidly in GOP-run states, the vast majority of the funds - billions in taxpayer dollars - are directed to religious schools, The Washington Post reported this month.\n\nAfter Louisiana lawmakers voted to require the Ten Commandments in classrooms, the Center for Inquiry, a nonprofit that advocates for a secular society, wrote to Landry to urge him to veto it. The group said becoming the first state to require the commandments to be posted in classrooms would be \"a dishonorable distinction.\"\n\nThe bill \"is an exclusionary, heavy-handed measure that will make every student who is a member of a minority religion (or no religion at all) feel like an outsider in their own school and virtually invite litigation at taxpayer expense,\" the center said in a statement.\n\nRepublican state Rep. Michael Bayham, one of the bill's authors, argued Wednesday that the new law is not just about religion - nor are the Ten Commandments.\n\n\"It's our foundational law. Our sense of right and wrong is based off of the Ten Commandments,\" he told The Post, adding that Moses is a historical figure and not just a religious one.\n\n\"The Ten Commandments is as much about civilization and right and wrong,\" Bayham said. \"It does not say you have to be this particular faith or that particular faith.\"\n\nIt's unclear how Louisiana's law will fare if it winds its way to the Supreme Court. A decision to uphold the statute would fly in the face of direct precedent, said Douglas Laycock, a professor emeritus of constitutional law at the University of Virginia.\n\nThe Supreme Court in 1980 struck down a Kentucky law that also attempted to require the Ten Commandments to be displayed in classrooms. The court said the statute had no plausible secular purpose and violated the First Amendment's establishment clause, which bars the federal government from favoring any one religion.\n\n\"They've always said that public schools are different because children are more susceptible to influence,\" Laycock told The Post.\n\nBut recent Supreme Court rulings have been more lenient toward religion in schools. In 2022, the court ruled in favor of a Washington state football coach who knelt at midfield to pray and was joined by student-athletes. The prayers were protected by the Constitution's guarantees of free speech and religious exercise, the court said.\n\nProponents of the Louisiana law would have to convince the court that there's a secular purpose for it. They may be counting on the conservative-leaning court to rule in their favor, Laycock said.\n\n\"It is just impossible to imagine any secular reason for doing this,\" he said. \"We'll see how far they're willing to go.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anumita_kaur@washingtonpost.com", "name": "Anumita Kaur",

This mandate comes after a contentious bill was signed into law on Wednesday. House Bill 71 mandates that all public classrooms, from kindergarten through college, must have a poster of the Ten Commandments displayed by the beginning of 2025.\n\nCivil rights groups have already raised the alarm, arguing that the law infringes on the separation of church and state. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has vowed to challenge the legislation in court.\n\nRepublican Governor Jeff Landry, who signed the bill along with a suite of other measures aimed at \"expanding faith in public schools\", defended the decision. \"If you want to respect the rule of law, you've got to start from the original law-giver, which was Moses,\" Landry stated during a news conference.\n\nProponents of the bill argue that the Ten Commandments hold historical significance beyond their religious origins. The law's text describes them as \"foundational documents of our state and national government\".\n\nIt cites James Madison, the fourth President of the United States, who purportedly said, \"We have staked the whole future of our new nation...upon the capacity of each of ourselves to govern ourselves according to the moral principles of the Ten Commandments.\"\n\nThe displays, which will be funded through private donations rather than state dollars, are to be presented as posters or framed documents with large, easily readable text. Each display will also include a contextual statement outlining how the Ten Commandments were historically a significant part of American public education.\n\nDespite these justifications, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Louisiana asserts that the law is a clear violation of constitutional principles. The organization cites the 1980 Supreme Court decision in Stone v. Graham, which struck down a similar law in Kentucky for violating the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe ACLU warns that the mandated displays will lead to unconstitutional religious coercion of students, who are required by law to attend school and thus are a captive audience for these religious messages.\n\n\"The displays mandated by H.B. 71 will result in unconstitutional religious coercion of students,\" the Louisiana ACLU said in a statement. \"They will also send a chilling message to students and families who do not follow the state's preferred version of the Ten Commandments that they do not belong and are not welcome in our public schools.\"\n\nSource: Louisiana Public Schools to display Ten Commandments in classrooms after controversial law passes\n\nSeparation of Church and State: A 'misnomer', says Mike Johnson", "source": {"uri": "theindependent.sg", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gemma_iso@theindependent.sg", "name": "Gemma Iso", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American Civil Liberties Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ten Commandments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Landry", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Landry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Madison", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James Madison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_church_and_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Separation of church and state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_v._Graham", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stone v.

The law stipulates that the Ten Commandments must be displayed in poster format and be accompanied by a four-paragraph \"context statement\" that describes their historical significance in American public education. The funding for these displays, which must be installed by the beginning of 2025, will come from donations rather than governmental money.\n\nHowever, opponents have raised serious constitutional concerns and have pledged to challenge the law in court. Civil rights groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union and the Freedom from Religion Foundation, argue that the law violates the establishment clause of the US Constitution, which prohibits the government from making any law respecting the establishment of religion. These groups contend that the law not only breaches constitutional principles but also risks alienating students of different faiths or beliefs, potentially impeding their educational experience.\n\nLegal and constitutional challenges\n\nThe debate concerning the Ten Commandments' exhibition in public schools is not new. Similar regulations in other states have been challenged in court, as India Today reports. In 1980, the US Supreme Court declared that a related Kentucky legislation was unconstitutional.

Jeff Landry on Wednesday, celebrates the biblical commandments as foundational documents in United States history.\n\n\"If you want to respect the rule of law, you've got to start from the original lawgiver, which was Moses,\" Landry said about the new policy, according to The Associated Press.\n\nHe and other supporters of the policy argue that the state can require public schools to display the Ten Commandments since the text is historically significant in addition to being religiously significant.\n\nBut several organizations, including faith-based ones, take issue with this view and say that Louisiana's new law clearly violates the Constitution's establishment clause.\n\n\"The First Amendment promises that we all get to decide for ourselves what religious beliefs, if any, to hold and practice, without pressure from the government. Politicians have no business imposing their preferred religious doctrine on students and families in public schools,\" reads a joint statement from Americans United for Separation of Church and State, the American Civil Liberties Union, the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana, and the Freedom from Religion Foundation, which plan to file a lawsuit to block the new law.\n\nThe joint statement referenced a Supreme Court decision from the 1980s barring Ten Commandments displays in classrooms.\n\nIn Stone v. Graham, the court ruled 5-4 that Kentucky lawmakers had violated the establishment clause by requiring copies of the Ten Commandments to be hung in public schools.\n\n\"The Court noted that the Commandments did not confine themselves to arguably secular matters (such as murder, stealing, etc.), but rather concerned matters such as the worship of God and the observance of the Sabbath Day,\" according to Oyez. For this reason and others, the justices in the majority determined that Ten Commandments displays in classrooms were \"plainly religious in nature.\"\n\nMore recently, in 2005, the Supreme Court issued a confusing pair of rulings on other types of Ten Commandments displays.\n\nTaken as a whole, these rulings and others make it clear that the Supreme Court does not require public entities to entirely steer clear of religious messages and symbols.\n\nThe justices have acknowledged that faith-related displays can serve a secular purpose, but they've also criticized lawmakers who have used a possible secular purpose to obscure their faith-based motivations.\n\nThe court has also repeatedly expressed concern about the Ten Commandments' religious message, saying that, when the text is displayed prominently on its own, it sends a message about God rather than about American history.\n\n\"This is not to deny that the Commandments have had influence on civil or secular law,\" the majority opinion said in McCreary County. \"The point is simply that the original text viewed in its entirety is an unmistakably religious statement dealing with religious obligations and with morality subject to religious sanction. When the government initiates an effort to place this statement alone in public view, a religious object is unmistakable.\"\n\nIn light of Stone v. Graham and other, related rulings, some religious freedom experts expect Louisiana's Ten Commandments law to eventually be overturned.\n\n\"I think they are overreaching,\" said Charles C. Haynes of the Freedom Forum to The New York Times about the lawmakers behind the policy.\n\nHe said it's unlikely for the current Supreme Court to uphold the law, even though they've issued a variety of rulings in favor of religious conservatives in recent years.\n\n\"Even this court will have a hard time justifying\" what lawmakers are requiring, Haynes told the Times.\n\nPolicymakers in other states have come to similar conclusions in recent months as they've weighed related measures.\n\nBills that would have required the display of the Ten Commandments in classrooms in Mississippi, Oklahoma, Texas, South Carolina and Utah either failed or were significantly adjusted before passage, according to The New York Times.\n\nThe version of the Utah bill that passed added the Ten Commandments to a list of documents that teachers can use in history classes, as the Deseret News previously reported.\n\nBut other legal experts expect Louisiana's policy to stand and other states to pass their own versions of the bill.\n\n\"The Pelican State has rightly recognized the history and tradition of the Ten Commandments in the state,\" said Matt Krause, Of Counsel at First Liberty Institute, in a statement. \"We applaud Louisiana for being the first, but by no means the last, state to take this bold step for religious liberty.\"\n\nLouisiana's governor has said he looks forward to defending the new Ten Commandments law in court.\n\n\"I can't wait to be sued,\" he said over the weekend, according to The Tennessean.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ten Commandments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Establishment_Clause", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Establishment Clause"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American Civil Liberties Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "History of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Secularity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_v._Graham", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stone v.

Jeff Landry.\n\nThe groups - including The American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the Freedom from Religion Foundation - said Wednesday that they plan to challenge the law in court.\n\nThe groups say the law violates the separation of church and state in public buildings and would impact students' education and safety, according to an ACLU statement.\n\n\"The government should not be taking sides in this theological debate, and it certainly should not be coercing students to submit day in and day out to unavoidable promotions of religious doctrine,\" the ACLU wrote.\n\nMORE: Biden's Title IX rule change temporarily blocked over LGBTQ protections\n\nHB 71 mandates public schools -- from kindergarten to the collegiate level -- to display the Ten Commandments, a religious set of rules from the Old Testament, in every classroom on \"a poster or framed document that is at least 11 inches by 14 inches.\"\n\n\"If you want to respect the rule of law, you gotta start from the original lawgiver, which was Moses,\" said Landry Wednesday during the press conference where he signed the bills.\n\nThe bill also outlined a specific version of the Ten Commandments to be used for the display.\n\nPublic schools have until January 2025 to display the poster, which will be paid for by private donations and not state dollars, according to the law. The law does not state what would happen if a school does not comply with the order.\n\nMORE: Gov. Ron DeSantis' push for 'civics' education: What does it look like?\n\nThe bill is one of 18 signed by Landry as part of his \"Dream Big\" education plan that aims to \"bring back common sense in our classrooms,\" he said in a Wednesday statement.\n\nSupporters of HB 71 argue that the law isn't about religion: \"This is not preaching a Christian religion. It's not preaching any religion. It's teaching a moral code,\" Republican state Rep. Dodie Horton said during an April hearing, according to local news outlet WWL-TV.\n\nThe law argues that the Ten Commandments are also historically significant, reflecting \"the understanding of the founders of our nation with respect to the necessity of civic morality to a functional self-government,\" the text reads.\n\nOpponents of the bill believe this is a violation of the First Amendment.\n\nThe ACLU pointed to the 1980 Supreme Court case Stone v. Graham, which found that Kentucky's then-law requiring the Ten Commandments be posted in classrooms \"had no secular legislative purpose\" and was \"plainly religious in nature,\" the decision read.\n\n\"All students should feel safe and welcome in our public schools,\" the ACLU said in a statement.\n\nThe statement continued, \"H.B. 71 would undermine this critical goal and prevent schools from providing an equal education to all students, regardless of faith.

The American Civil Liberties Union has threatened to sue.\n\nThe bill was signed by Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, along with a package of others he said were designed to \"expand faith in public schools.\"\n\n\"If you want to respect the rule of law, you've got to start from the original law-giver, which was Moses,\" Landry said at a news conference where he signed the bill.\n\nThe bill's authors contend that the measure is not solely religious, but that it has historical significance. No other state currently has such a mandate for display of the Ten Commandments\n\nThe Ten Commandments are described in the law's text as \"foundational documents of our state and national government.\"\n\n\"History records that James Madison, the fourth President of the United States of America, stated that \"(w)e have staked the whole future of our new nation ... upon the capacity of each of ourselves to govern ourselves according to the moral principles of the Ten Commandments,\" the text of the law read.\n\nThe displays, which will be paid for by private donations and not state dollars, will be \"displayed on a poster or framed document,\" the law says. The legislation's text also calls for it to be printed in large, easily readable font.\n\nThe displays will also be paired with a four-paragraph \"context statement\" describing how the Ten Commandments \"were a prominent part of American public education for almost three centuries.\"\n\nThe Louisiana ACLU, however, contended that the law's language is blatantly unconstitutional and said in a statement it plans to sue the state.\n\nThe ACLU cited the 1980, U.S. Supreme Court decision Stone v. Graham, which ruled that a similar law passed in Kentucky for its public school system violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution.\n\n\"The displays mandated by H.B. 71 will result in unconstitutional religious coercion of students, who are legally required to attend school and are thus a captive audience for school-sponsored religious messages,\" the Louisiana ACLU said in a statement.\n\n\"They will also send a chilling message to students and families who do not follow the state's preferred version of the Ten Commandments that they do not belong, and are not welcome, in our public schools,\" the ACLU of Louisiana added.\n\nLandry's education package also includes laws that would authorize the hiring of chaplains in schools, restrict teachers from mentioning sexual orientation or gender identity, and prevent schools from using a transgender student's preferred name or pronouns unless granted permission by parents.", "source": {"uri": "weisradio.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WEIS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ten Commandments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Landry", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Landry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American Civil Liberties Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_church_and_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Separation of church and state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_legislature_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State legislature (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baton_Rouge,_Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baton Rouge, Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baton Rouge, Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Madison", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James Madison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_v._Graham", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stone v.

Jeff Landry.\n\nThe groups - including The American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the Freedom from Religion Foundation - said Wednesday that they plan to challenge the law in court.\n\nThe groups say the law violates the separation of church and state in public buildings and would impact students' education and safety, according to an ACLU statement.\n\n\"The government should not be taking sides in this theological debate, and it certainly should not be coercing students to submit day in and day out to unavoidable promotions of religious doctrine,\" the ACLU wrote.\n\nHB 71 mandates public schools -- from kindergarten to the collegiate level -- to display the Ten Commandments, a religious set of rules from the Old Testament, in every classroom on \"a poster or framed document that is at least 11 inches by 14 inches.\"\n\n\"If you want to respect the rule of law, you gotta start from the original lawgiver, which was Moses,\" said Landry Wednesday during the press conference where he signed the bills.\n\nThe bill also outlined a specific version of the Ten Commandments to be used for the display.\n\nPublic schools have until January 2025 to display the poster, which will be paid for by private donations and not state dollars, according to the law. The law does not state what would happen if a school does not comply with the order.\n\nThe bill is one of 18 signed by Landry as part of his \"Dream Big\" education plan that aims to \"bring back common sense in our classrooms,\" he said in a Wednesday statement.\n\nSupporters of HB 71 argue that the law isn't about religion: \"This is not preaching a Christian religion. It's not preaching any religion. It's teaching a moral code,\" Republican state Rep. Dodie Horton said during an April hearing, according to local news outlet WWL-TV.\n\nThe law argues that the Ten Commandments are also historically significant, reflecting \"the understanding of the founders of our nation with respect to the necessity of civic morality to a functional self-government,\" the text reads.\n\nOpponents of the bill believe this is a violation of the First Amendment.\n\nThe ACLU pointed to the 1980 Supreme Court case Stone v. Graham, which found that Kentucky's then-law requiring the Ten Commandments be posted in classrooms \"had no secular legislative purpose\" and was \"plainly religious in nature,\" the decision read.\n\n\"All students should feel safe and welcome in our public schools,\" the ACLU said in a statement.\n\nThe statement continued, \"H.B. 71 would undermine this critical goal and prevent schools from providing an equal education to all students, regardless of faith.

Meanwhile, the opponents of the bill argued that a state requiring a religious text in all classrooms would violate the establishment clause of the US Constitution, which highlights that Congress can \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\"\n\nHouse Bill 71, approved by state lawmakers last month, mandates that a poster-size display of the Ten Commandments with \"large, easily readable font\" be in every classroom at schools that receive state funding, from kindergarten through the university level. The legislation further specified the exact language in which the Commandments must be printed on the classroom display and outlined that the text of the Commandments must be the central focus of the poster or framed document, as reported by CNN.\n\nBefore signing it, Republican Gov Jeff Landry called the bill, \"one of (his) favourites.\" \"If you want to respect the rule of law, you gotta start from the original law given which was Moses. ... He got his commandments from God,\" Landry said.\n\nDuring the bill signing, Louisiana state Rep. Dodie Horton, the Republican author of the bill, said that \"it's like hope is in the air everywhere.\" Horton further dismissed concerns from Democratic opponents of the measure and said that the Ten Commandments are rooted in legal history and her bill would place a \"moral code\" in the classroom, as reported by CNN.\n\nHowever, the Civil liberties groups have swiftly vowed to challenge the law, CNN reported. The American Civil Liberties Union, the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana, Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the Freedom from Religion Foundation said that the law violates longstanding Supreme Court precedent and the First Amendment and would result in \"unconstitutional religious coercion of students.\"\n\n\"The First Amendment promises that we all get to decide for ourselves what religious beliefs, if any, to hold and practice, without pressure from the government. Politicians have no business imposing their preferred religious doctrine on students and families in public schools,\" the groups said in a joint statement. Meanwhile, the supporters of the law defended it and have leaned on the 2022 US Supreme Court decision in Kennedy v. Bremerton School District, which gave a high school football coach his job back after he was disciplined over a controversy involving prayer on the field.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled that the coach's prayers amounted to private speech, protected by the First Amendment, and could not be restricted by the school district. The decision further lowered the bar between church and state in an opinion that legal experts predicted would allow more religious expression in public spaces.

The authors of the law have defended it on the basis of the fact that it is not strictly religious, but also has historical significance.\n\nThe text of the law describes the Ten Commandments as \"foundational documents of our state and national government.\" It goes on to note how \"history records that James Madison, the fourth President of the United States of America, stated that '(w)e have staked the whole future of our new nation...upon the capacity of each of ourselves to govern ourselves according to the moral principles of the Ten Commandments.'\"\n\nAs per the new law, the displays of the Commandments will be paid for by private donations rather than taxpayer dollars, and will be \"displayed on a poster or framed document.\" It will feature large font that will be easy for students to read. In addition, the Commandments themselves will be displayed alongside a \"context statement\" of about four paragraphs, explaining how the Commandments \"were a prominent part of American public education for almost three centuries.\"\n\nBut the ACLU issued a statement denouncing the law as dangerous and unconstitutional, falsely accusing the law of \"unconstitutional religious coercion of students, who are legally required to attend school and are thus a captive audience for school-sponsored religious messages.\"\n\n\"They will also send a chilling message to students and families who do not follow the state's preferred version of the Ten Commandments that they do not belong, and are not welcome, in our public schools,\" the ACLU statement continued.", "source": {"uri": "amgreatness.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Greatness"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eric_lendrum@amgreatness.com", "name": "Eric Lendrum", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Landry", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Landry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ten Commandments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Transgender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindergarten", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kindergarten"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Legislature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_church_and_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Separation of church and state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-left_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Far-left politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Civil Liberties Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human sexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Madison", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Madison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coercion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coercion"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Church-State_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Church-State Relations", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://cdn.amgreatness.com/app/uploads/2024/06/Jeff-Landry-4000x2667.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666431", "eventUri": "eng-9666431", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-28", "textStart": 481, "textEnd": 489}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

The text of the Ten Commandments must be the \"central focus\" of the poster or framed documents, which shall be printed in \"large, easily readable font.\"\n\nIt must also include a four-paragraph \"context statement\" telling readers that \"The Ten Commandments were a prominent part of American public education for almost three centuries.\"\n\n\"Around the year 1688, The New England Primer became the first published American textbook and was the equivalent of a first grade reader. The New England Primer was used in public schools throughout the United States for more than 150 years to teach Americans to read and contained more than forty questions about the Ten Commandments,\" the context statement reads.\n\n\"The Ten Commandments were also included in public school textbooks published by educator William McGuffey, a noted university president and professor. A version of his famous McGuffey Readers was written in the early 1800s and became one of the most popular textbooks in the history of American education, selling more than 100 million copies. Copies of the McGuffey Readers are still available today.\"\n\nThe Christian Post reports the new law is likely to face legal challenges. Secular church-state separation groups have already threatened lawsuits, contending that it violates the US Constitution's Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.\n\nThe organisations believe the law also violates a 1980 US Supreme Court precedent set in a 5-4 ruling against a similar law passed in Kentucky requiring classrooms to post copies of the Ten Commandments. \"The law violates the separation of church and state and is blatantly unconstitutional. The First Amendment promises that we all get to decide for ourselves what religious beliefs, if any, to hold and practice, without pressure from the government. Politicians have no business imposing their preferred religious doctrine on students and families in public schools,\" the complainants said in a joint statement.\n\nSupporters of the law maintain that its purpose is to highlight the document's historical significance, as the legislation describes the Ten Commandments as one of the \"foundational documents of our state and national government.\" The bill also allows schools to display other historical documents, such as the Mayflower Compact, the Declaration of Independence and the Northwest Ordinance.", "source": {"uri":

In 2023, it joined almost 20 states that require or allow officials in public schools to post the national motto, \"In God We Trust.\"\n\nNow, the Bayou State has become the first in the nation to require the posting of the Ten Commandments in classrooms in public schools, colleges and universities.\n\nGov. Jeff Landry signed House Bill 71 into law on June 19, 2024, requiring officials in public schools, including colleges and universities, to post a specific version of the Ten Commandments. The text is similar to the King James translation of the Bible used in many Protestant churches.\n\nOfficials must post a context statement highlighting the role of the Ten Commandments in American history and may also display the Pilgrims' Mayflower Compact, the Declaration of Independence and the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, a federal enactment to settle the frontier - and the earliest congressional document encouraging the creation of schools.\n\nOne of the bill's supporters, state Sen. J. Adam Bass, defended it on the grounds that its \"purpose is not solely religious.\" He told fellow lawmakers that the Ten Commandments are important because of their \"historical significance, which is simply one of many documents that display the history of our country and foundation of our legal system.\"\n\nAs someone who teaches and researches law around religion and education, I believe the law is problematic. It is likely to invite litigation at a time when the Supreme Court's thinking on religion and state is shifting.\n\nLitigation over the Ten Commandments is not new. More than 40 years ago, in Stone v. Graham, the Supreme Court rejected a Kentucky statute that mandated displays of the Ten Commandments in classrooms.\n\nThe court reasoned that the underlying law violated the First Amendment's establishment clause - \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion\" - because the mandate lacked a secular purpose.\n\nThe justices were not persuaded by a small notation on posters that described the Ten Commandments as the \"fundamental legal code of Western Civilization and the Common Law of the United States.\"\n\nTwenty-five years later, the Supreme Court again took up cases challenging public displays of the Ten Commandments, although not in schools. This time, the justices reached mixed results.\n\nThe first arose in Kentucky, where officials had erected a county courthouse display about texts including the Ten Commandments, the Magna Carta, the Declaration of Independence and a biblical citation. In a 2005 ruling in McCreary County, Kentucky v. American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky, the five-person majority agreed that display of the Ten Commandments violated the establishment clause, largely because it lacked a secular legislative purpose.\n\nOn the same day, however, the Supreme Court reached the opposite result in Van Orden v. Perry, a case from Texas. The court upheld the constitutionality of a display of the Ten Commandments on the grounds of the state capitol as one of 17 monuments and 21 historical markers commemorating Texas' history.\n\nUnlike the fairly new display in Kentucky, the one in Texas, which had existed since the early 1960s, was erected using private funds. The court permitted the Ten Commandments to remain because, despite their religious significance, the monument was a more passive display than in Stone: spread out across 22 acres, rather than posted on the courthouse door.\n\nLouisiana's law requires public school officials to display framed copies of the Ten Commandments in all public school classrooms. Posters must be at least 11-by-14 inches and be printed with a large, easily readable font. The legislation allows, but does not require, officials to use state funds to purchase these posters. Displays can also be received as donations or purchased with gifted funds.\n\nThe bill's author, state Rep. Dodie Horton, previously sponsored Louisiana's law mandating that \"In God We Trust\" be posted in public school classrooms.\n\nIn defending the Ten Commandments proposal, she said it honors the country's religious origins.\n\n\"The Ten Commandments are the basis of all laws in Louisiana,\" she told fellow lawmakers, \"and given all the junk our children are exposed to in classrooms today, it's imperative that we put the Ten Commandments back in a prominent position.\"\n\nJustifying the bill, Horton pointed to Kennedy v. Bremerton School District, a 2022 Supreme Court decision. Here, the justices held that educational officials could not prevent a football coach from praying on the field at the end of games, because he engaged in personal religious observance protected by the First Amendment.\n\nFor decades, the Supreme Court used a set of criteria often called the Lemon v. Kurtzman test to assess whether a government action violated the establishment clause. Under this test, when a government action or policy intersects with religion, it had to meet three criteria. A policy had to have a secular legislative purpose; its principal or primary effect could not advance religion; and it could not result in excessive entanglement between state and religious officials.\n\nAnother test the Supreme Court sometimes applied, stemming from Lynch v. Donnelly in 1984, invalidated governmental actions appearing to endorse religion.\n\nThe majority of the current court, though, abandoned both the Lemon and endorsement tests. In the majority opinion in Kennedy v. Bremerton, Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote that \"the Establishment Clause must be interpreted by 'reference to historical practices and understandings.'\" He added that the court \"long ago abandoned Lemon and its endorsement test offshoot.\"\n\nWhat that new standard means remains to be seen.\n\nIn my view, the Louisiana law's supporters' reliance on Kennedy is mistaken. That decision upheld voluntary, private prayer, not mandated postings of religious statements, overlooking many students' beliefs.\n\nMore than 80 years ago, in West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette the Supreme Court decided in a 6-3 opinion that students cannot be compelled to participate in saluting the American flag, including the words \"under God\" in the Pledge of Allegiance, if doing so goes against their religious beliefs.\n\nUnder Louisiana's new law, students need not recite the Ten Commandments. Yet, given their distinctly religious message, I believe House Bill 71 faces a dubious future.\n\nThis article was updated on June 19, 2024 after Louisiana's governor signed House Bill 71 into law.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation, a nonprofit, independent news organization bringing you facts and trustworthy analysis to help you make sense of our complex world.

Bremerton School District, which gave a high school football coach his job back after he was disciplined over a controversy involving prayer on the field.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled that the coach's prayers amounted to private speech, protected by the First Amendment, and could not be restricted by the school district. The decision further lowered the bar between church and state in an opinion that legal experts predicted would allow more religious expression in public spaces.\n\nDuring that time, the court clarified that a government entity does not necessarily violate the Establishment Clause by permitting religious expression in public, reported CNN.

They also said it violated Louisiana state law, longstanding precedent established by the US supreme court and the first amendment of the US constitution, which guarantees separation of church and state.\n\n\"The first amendment promises that we all get to decide for ourselves what religious beliefs, if any, to hold and practice, without pressure from the government. Politicians have no business imposing their preferred religious doctrine on students and families in public schools,\" the statement said.\n\n\"Louisiana's communities and public schools are religiously diverse, yet HB 71 would require school officials to promote specific religious beliefs to which people of many faiths, and those of no faith, do not subscribe.\"\n\nThe legislation mandates that an 11-by-14in poster of the Ten Commandments must be displayed prominently in classrooms of all state-funded educational institutions, from kindergarten up to university, by 2025. No state funding is being offered to comply with the initiative.\n\nA four-paragraph \"context statement\" is to be shown beside the document describing how the biblical strictures \"were a prominent part of the American public education for almost three centuries\".\n\nCritics point out that the wording of the Ten Commandments vary within different branches of Christianity and that they are also a central part of Judaism. The Louisiana legislation appears to favour the Protestant phrasing, despite the presence of a Catholic minority comprising about 22% of the state's population.\n\n\"Even among those who may believe in some version of the Ten Commandments, the particular text that they adhere to can differ by religious denomination or tradition,\" the allied groups said in their statement. \"The government should not be taking sides in this theological debate, and it certainly should not be coercing students to submit day in and day out to unavoidable promotions of religious doctrine.\"\n\nSimilar bills have been proposed in three other states - Texas, Oklahoma and Utah - but, amid threats by opponents to mount legal challenges, they have yet to become law.\n\nA similar law passed by Kentucky in 1980 was struck down by the US supreme court on the grounds that it violated the establishment clause in the constitution's first amendment, which says Congress can \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion\". The court ruled that the Kentucky law served a plainly religious purpose.\n\nHowever, some analysts suggest that Louisiana Republicans - a southern state within the US's traditional \"Bible belt\" where the party enjoys a two-thirds supermajority in the state legislature - have been emboldened by the current rightwing makeup of the supreme court, where there is a six-to-three majority of conservative justices.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "robert_tait@uk.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Robert Tait", "type":

He got his commandments from God,\" Landry said.\n\nDuring the bill signing, Louisiana state Rep. Dodie Horton, the Republican author of the bill, said that \"it's like hope is in the air everywhere.\"\n\nHorton further dismissed concerns from Democratic opponents of the measure and said that the Ten Commandments are rooted in legal history and her bill would place a \"moral code\" in the classroom, as reported by CNN.\n\nHowever, the Civil liberties groups have swiftly vowed to challenge the law, CNN reported.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana, Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the Freedom from Religion Foundation said that the law violates longstanding Supreme Court precedent and the First Amendment and would result in \"unconstitutional religious coercion of students.\"\n\n\"The First Amendment promises that we all get to decide for ourselves what religious beliefs, if any, to hold and practice, without pressure from the government. Politicians have no business imposing their preferred religious doctrine on students and families in public schools,\" the groups said in a joint statement.\n\nMeanwhile, the supporters of the law defended it and have leaned on the 2022 US Supreme Court decision in Kennedy v. Bremerton School District, which gave a high school football coach his job back after he was disciplined over a controversy involving prayer on the field.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled that the coach's prayers amounted to private speech, protected by the First Amendment, and could not be restricted by the school district. The decision further lowered the bar between church and state in an opinion that legal experts predicted would allow more religious expression in public spaces.\n\nDuring that time, the court clarified that a government entity does not necessarily violate the Establishment Clause by permitting religious expression in public, reported CNN.

Signed into law by Governor Jeff Landry, proponents claim it's historically significant while opponents argue it violates constitutional rules separating church and state.\n\nLouisiana has become the first state to mandate that the Ten Commandments be displayed in every public school classroom, marking a significant move from a GOP-dominated Legislature under a new conservative governor.\n\nThe controversial legislation, signed into law by Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, requires a poster-sized display of the Ten Commandments in a \"large, easily readable font\" across all public classrooms, from kindergarten to universities. Landry emphasized the importance of the commandments as a foundational document, while opponents questioned the constitutionality, vowing to challenge it in court.\n\nProponents argue the law is historically significant, emphasizing that the Ten Commandments have long been part of American public education. However, civil rights groups contend that the law violates the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution. The high court's 1980 ruling against a similar law in Kentucky adds to the looming legal challenges. State funds will not be used to implement the mandate; donations will cover the costs. Controversy continues as the nation watches this legal battle unfold.\n\nSimilar mandates have been proposed in states like Texas, Oklahoma, and Utah, but Louisiana remains the only state where such a law has been enacted, given the GOP's supermajority in the state legislature. Opponents argue the law prevents equal education for students and may alienate those with differing religious beliefs, warranting further legal scrutiny.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Landry", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Landry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ten Commandments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Establishment_Clause", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Establishment Clause"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supermajority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_legislature_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State legislature (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/12_06_2024_17_34_14_3047581.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666431", "eventUri": "eng-9666431", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

The First Amendment of the American Constitution be damned. Louisiana is officially the first state in U.S. history to require by law that the Ten Commandments be displayed in every public school in the state from kindergarten through college. Another way of putting that is that Louisiana is the first state to make it against the law not to practice religious indoctrination in the classroom.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed into law Wednesday the requirement that a poster-sized display of the Ten Commandments in \"large, easily readable font\" be placed in every single state-funded classroom in the state, and he's justifying the legislation by lying to the easily lied to and suggesting that the very concept of law was borne through Christianity.\n\n\"If you want to respect the rule of law, you've got to start from the original lawgiver, which was Moses\" who got the commandments from God,\" Landry said.\n\nAs we previously reported, the bill's sponsor, state Rep. Dodie Horton, claimed prior to the bill's passing that the Ten Commandments are rooted in legal history and that plastering them all over every public institution of learning in the state would effectively place a \"moral code\" in the classroom.\n\nHere's what I wrote about that:\n\nGet TF outta here with this nonsense about the Ten Commandments being \"rooted in legal history,\" and about the display being about \"moral code\" and not explicit religious indoctrination. In fact, let's just take a quick look at this so-called \"code.\"\n\nFirst, it's not really clear what the practical value is of displaying for students biblical instructions not to kill and steal, as it is common knowledge that these are crimes. I suppose it does somewhat justify the \"legal history\" aspect, but they might as well require classrooms to display the adage, \"Play with fire, you will get burned\" since we're creating entire legally-binding bills just to state the obvious.\n\nBut beyond that, what's the \"moral\" value of instructing students to \"have no other Gods before\" the chosen Christian God, to \"not make unto thee any graven images,\" to \"not take the name of Lord thy God in vain,\" and to \"remember the Sabbath day and keep it holy?\" What does any of that have to do with the \"moral code\" of someone who is not a worshiper of the Christian faith?\n\nThe Louisiana GOP could have found sound moral advice from the texts of a myriad of religious and/or spiritual groups, but they chose the doctrine of their preferred religion -- America's most dominant religion -- and a list of rules, nearly half of which can't really be applied to non-Cristians. That's not about morals, it's about forced proselytizing in public schools.\n\nLies upon lies upon lies upon lies But Republicans only consider it \"indoctrination\" when conservatives are uncomfortable. When schools are teaching gender studies and about different sexualities, which could only result in an easier, safer, more socially normalized and accepted life for members of the LGBTQIA+ community, that's \"indoctrination.\" When educators are giving lessons on Black history that haven't been put through the American jingoist whitewashing machine to placate the white and eternally fragile, that's \"indoctrination.\" The very concept of systemic racism is \"indoctrination\" no matter how much data exists to substantiate it, but explicit reinforcement of what is already the nation's most dominant religion under penalty of law is not, according to the Louisiana GOP. In fact, the law, which the governor signed at Our Lady of Fatima Catholic School in Lafayette, the Ten Commandments are \"foundational documents of our state and national government,\" which they are not. The law also requires that the religious text be displayed along with a four-paragraph \"context statement\" describing how the Commandments \"were a prominent part of American public education for almost three centuries,\" which, even if true, would only mean they had something in common with slavery and legalized second-class citizenship for non-white people and women. (But \"Make America great again,\" amitrite?) Anyway, now that this Christian law that violates the actual founding documents of America and flirts with fascism, is officially on the books, many legal experts agree that all Louisiana officials have done is open up the floodgates (that can't be parted by Moses) to legal challenges revolving around the constitutionality of it all. From AP:\n\nThe law prevents students from getting an equal education and will keep children who have different beliefs from feeling safe at school, the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the Freedom from Religion Foundation said in a joint statement Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"Even among those who may believe in some version of the Ten Commandments, the particular text that they adhere to can differ by religious denomination or tradition. The government should not be taking sides in this theological debate,\" the groups said.\n\nLegal battles over the display of the Ten Commandments in classrooms are not new.\n\nIn 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law was unconstitutional and violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says Congress can \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\" The high court found that the law had no secular purpose but rather served a plainly religious purpose.\n\nMore to come....\n\nIt's worth noting that other red states such as Texas, Oklahoma and Utah -- all states where Republicans have argued some variation of \"woke ideology indoctrinates students\" -- have proposed similar bills to require the display of the Ten Commandments. Indoctrination isn't the problem -- it just needs to be the right kind of indoctrination. This is the message GOP hypocrites are sending, and there's nothing \"moral\" about that.\n\nHouse Bill 800: Why Senators Should Not Sell Louisiana (Or Any Other State) To Big Business\n\nThis Holy

The corporate media's reaction to this development is best described as a collective muted hysteria.\n\nEach of the major networks filed a brief denouncing the bill in its own particular way. ABC World News Tonight anchor David Muir took the opportunity to snark about the Supreme Court. Below is that report in its entirety:\n\nABC WORLD NEWS TONIGHT\n\n6/19/24\n\n6:44 PM\n\nDAVID MUIR: This evening, Louisiana is the first state to require the Ten Commandments now be displayed in every public classroom from kindergarten to state-funded universities. 30 years ago, the Supreme Court struck down a similar law in Kentucky, citing separation of church and state. Louisiana's law could face a similar challenge now, but it would come before today's more conservative High Court.\n\nPerhaps the Court repeals Louisiana's law, or it doesn't. But the left and their media never pass up on a chance to take a shot at conservatives. And so it is that Muir engages in this mindless speculation, which in this heated political climate could place Supreme Court justices at risk of violence.\n\nPer CBS, the ACLU is going to sue Louisiana. Also, the Ten Commandments will be funded privately. NBC echoed similar themes in their brief.\n\nCBS EVENING NEWS\n\n6/19/24\n\n6:41 PM\n\nNORAH O'DONNELL: And Louisiana's governor just signed a new bill that orders all public classrooms to display the Ten Commandments in large, easily readable font. CBS's Elise Preston explains.\n\nELISE PRESTON: Tonight, Norah, Louisiana has become the first state in the country to require poster-size copies like this one of the Ten Commandments be displayed in every public school classroom. Republican governor Jeff Landry signed the bill into law today. In a statement, the ACLU says it's planning to file a lawsuit, saying the new law is blatantly unconstitutional, and violates the separation of church and state. Supporters say private donations will be used to put up the displays, not state funds.\n\nNBC NIGHTLY NEWS\n\n6/19/24\n\n6:40 PM\n\nLESTER HOLT: In Louisiana, the Ten Commandments will now be displayed in every public school classroom under a controversial bill signed into law today by Republican governor Jeff Landry. Louisiana becomes the first state to mandate such a requirement. Opponents say the law is unconstitutional.\n\nThis story is ultimately less about the actual Ten Commandments than about what they represent in this particular instance: a challenge to the left's monopoly on what can be taught in schools. Said differently, Louisiana challenges the (secular) religious orthodoxies of the public education system as run by left-wing administrators in unison with the teachers' unions.\n\nThis is why the parents' rights battles as waged in Florida and elsewhere were covered so virulently, and why the media were quick to co-opt activist language when reporting parent's rights bills as \"Don't Say Gay\". The media have no problem with kindergarteners being taught on gender, or on third and fourth-graders having access to graphic sexual materials in school libraries. But the Ten Commandments are a bridge too far.\n\nThe leftwing media see this bill for the challenge to the system that it is and have acted accordingly.", "source": {"uri": "newsbusters.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "https://newsbusters.org/"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_World_News_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ABC World News Tonight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Muir", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "David Muir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ten Commandments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_church_and_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Separation of church and state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Civil Liberties Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Evening_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS Evening News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Landry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Landry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "High Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_Holt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lester Holt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Nightly_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC Nightly News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secularism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Church-State_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Church-State Relations", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Noahidism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Noahidism", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://cdn.newsbusters.org/styles/mobile_thumb_700x400_/s3/2024-06/ABC%20World%20News%20Tonight%20With%20David%20Muir-6_45_11%20pm-2024-06-19.jpg?itok=gFDomRb6", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666431", "eventUri": "eng-9666431", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Or a Buddhist? Or Atheist?\n\n\"This is completely illegal and an affront to our US Constitution. Thankfully you're getting the snot sued out of you, as you should. We are NOT a Theocracy.\"\n\nAnother X user, Marjorie, #MTGsbigtoe, wrote, \"You should keep your lifestyle choice of being a Christian to yourself. The Bible has no place in the classroom.\"\n\nAlso, carte blanche kitty with account #mrswhiskeykitty, said, \"Vouchers will demolish our public schools. This is just a taxpayer bailout for failing religious schools with minimal oversight.\"\n\nIn 1980, the US Supreme Court struck down a similar Kentucky law requiring that the document be displayed in elementary and high schools.\n\nIn a 5-4 vote, the high court ruled that the requirement that the Ten Commandments be posted \"had no secular legislative purpose\" and was \"plainly religious in nature\".\n\nThe court noted that in addition to criminal matters like killing and stealing, the Ten Commandments also made references to worshipping God including observing the Sabbath day.\n\nPUNCH Online reports that the Ten Commandments are a set of ethical guidelines and principles foundational to the Jewish, Christian, and maybe even Islamic traditions.\n\nThey are found in the Bible, in the books of Exodus and Deuteronomy.\n\nThese commandments serve as a moral and ethical foundation for many people and cultures worldwide.", "source": {"uri": "punchng.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

State funds will not be used to implement the mandate, based on language in the legislation.\n\nSeveral civil liberties groups announced they will file a lawsuit just minutes after the bill was signed.\n\n\"We will see you in court Governor Landry,\" said Alanah Odoms, Executive Directo of ACLU Louisiana. \"It strikes at the heart of our fundamental constitutional rights. The right to choose a faith of your own or choose no faith at all.\"\n\nOdoms said she believes the Ten Commandments law along with the law labeling abortion pills as controlled substances signal the demise of democracy.\n\n\"If the government can tell you what religion you have to be, perhaps the government can also tell you that you cannot speak out about a particular issue or else you'll be incarcerated,\" explained Odoms.\n\nLate Wednesday, Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill released a statement saying \"The 10 Commandments are pretty simple (don't kill, steal, cheat on your wife), but they also are important to our country's foundations.

Jeff Landry signed into law a bill requiring every public school classroom in the state to prominently display the Ten Commandments.\n\nThe religious text -- which is featured in all Abrahamic religions but which conservative Christians in the U.S. have tried to place in public and governmental settings for decades -- contains rules on how to worship God, restrictions against polytheism, prohibition on stealing and murder, and injunctions against coveting property and people's wives. Despite the clear religious nature of the Ten Commandments, Republican lawmakers are insisting that the new rule requiring the display is simply due to the historical value the religious rules have, with the text of the law noting it has been featured in U.S. schools in the distant past.\n\nIt's unclear what relevance the historical nature of the Ten Commandments might provide to certain classrooms or subjects, including math and science, and the new law doesn't make mention of other historical needs to display religious or non-religious texts, or the ability of teachers and schools to do so if they wish.\n\nThe law mandates that all public school classrooms -- from kindergarten all the way up to publicly funded colleges and universities in the state -- must display an 11-inch by 14-inch poster or display, showcasing the Ten Commandments in \"large, easily readable font.\" Schools must have the displays up by January 1, 2025.\n\nDuring his signing statement on Wednesday, Landry made reference to biblical events to justify his endorsing the new rules.\n\n\"This bill mandates the display of the Ten Commandments in every classroom -- public elementary, secondary and post-education schools -- in the state of Louisiana, because if you want to respect the rule of law, you've got to start from the original lawgiver, which was Moses,\" Landry said.\n\nLast weekend, before he signed the bill into law, Landry also indicated that he was prepared to defend it, stating that he \"can't wait to be sued\" over it.\n\nReligious freedom and secular rights advocates indicated that was going to happen.\n\n\"The First Amendment promises that we all get to decide for ourselves what religious beliefs, if any, to hold and practice, without pressure from the government. Politicians have no business imposing their preferred religious doctrine on students and families in public schools,\" read a joint statement from several groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, the Freedom From Religion Foundation, and more.\n\nThe statute \"is an exclusionary, heavy-handed measure that will make every student who is a member of a minority religion (or no religion at all) feel like an outsider in their own school and virtually invite litigation at taxpayer expense,\" read a statement from The Center for Inquiry, a secularist nonprofit organization, just prior to Landry signing the bill into law.\n\nAny lawsuit that goes through federal courts would likely end up at the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, regarded as one of the most conservative districts in the U.S. From there, an appeal (which would likely happen no matter what outcome occurs) would go to the Supreme Court, which has shifted far to the right, including on matters relating to the First Amendment's separation between church and state, over the past decade or so.\n\nRecent undercover recordings of at least one conservative bloc member of the High Court, Justice Samuel Alito, reveal his desire to use the Court to push for a more religious society.\n\nA journalist posing as a conservative backer of Alito's posited that the Court should \"return our country to a place of godliness\" at an event featuring several justices earlier this month.

This legislation is poised to face immediate legal challenges.\n\nWhy it matters: The new mandate distinguishes Louisiana from other states like Texas, South Carolina, and Utah, which have attempted but failed to pass similar measures. The push for such laws gained momentum after recent Supreme Court rulings, including Kennedy v. Bremerton School District, suggested a more lenient interpretation of the Establishment Clause, which prohibits state-sponsored religion.\n\nThe law's specifics: The law requires a Protestant translation of the Ten Commandments to be prominently displayed in all classrooms of schools receiving public funds, extending to colleges and universities. The commandments must be printed on a poster no smaller than 11 inches by 14 inches and must be \"the central focus\" of the document.\n\nFriction point: Civil rights groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the ACLU of Louisiana, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the Freedom from Religion Foundation, have announced plans to file lawsuits challenging the law. In a joint statement, they described the legislation as \"blatantly unconstitutional.\"\n\nGovernor's stance: Governor Landry anticipated legal opposition. \"I'm going home to sign a bill that places the Ten Commandments in public classrooms,\" he stated at a recent Republican fundraiser in Nashville. \"And I can't wait to be sued.\"\n\nLegislative background: The bill was authored by Rep.

It's important to note that the separation of church and state is a key principle in American government and law. This means that the government cannot endorse or promote a specific religion or religious doctrine.\n\nGiven this legal precedent, it's unlikely that New York would pass a law requiring the Ten Commandments to be displayed in public school classrooms. The U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that the government cannot endorse one religion over another.\n\nHowever, it's worth considering the broader issue of whether religious or moral education should have a place in public schools. The Establishment Clause prohibits government entities - which includes public schools - from endorsing, promoting, or establishing any religion, many argue that there is value in teaching students about various religions and moral principles, including the Ten Commandments.\n\nAdditionally, some argue that the Ten Commandments represent an important historical and cultural tradition that should be recognized. The commandments are important to many religions and can be studied from a historical or literary perspective, even if their religious significance is not being promoted by the school.\n\nUltimately, New York is unlikely to ever follow in Louisiana's footsteps by requiring the Ten Commandments to be displayed in public school classrooms but there is no doubt that this will be a topic many in the state will be discussing over the next few weeks.", "source": {"uri": "wnbf.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WNBF News Radio 1290"}, "authors": [{"uri": "traci_taylor@wnbf.com", "name": "Traci Taylor", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ten Commandments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctrine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doctrine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_church_and_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Separation of church and state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Precedent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Establishment_Clause", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Establishment Clause"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Religious_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Religious Studies", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Church-State_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Church-State Relations", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Noahidism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Noahidism", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://townsquare.media/site/498/files/2024/06/attachment-Copy-of-Add-a-subheading-7.jpg?w=1200&q=75&format=natural", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666431", "eventUri": "eng-9666431", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

He wasn't coy about his rationale. \"If you want to respect the rule of law, you've got to start from the original law-giver, which was Moses,\" Landry said at the signing ceremony. The bill's supporters were equally blunt. \"I'm not concerned with an atheist. I'm not concerned with a Muslim,\" said state Rep. Dodie Horton, who wrote the bill. \"I'm concerned with our children looking and seeing what God's law is.\" Others claimed the law was not \"solely religious\" in purpose. Rather, the Ten Commandments have \"historical significance, which is simply one of many documents that display the history of our country and foundation of our legal system,\" said a Republican state senator.\n\nBut Landry signed the bill alongside others intended to expand the influence of religion - or perhaps a specific strain of Christianity - in Louisiana public schools. As Reuters reported on Thursday, the measures would \"authorize the hiring of chaplains in schools, restrict teachers from mentioning sexual orientation or gender identity, and prevent schools from using a transgender student's preferred name or pronouns unless granted permission by parents.\" That news will please the Christian right, which has long sought to break down the wall separating church and state in public schools. Others may object. To risk belaboring the obvious, not all religious traditions embrace the Ten Commandments or believe that Moses was, as Landry put it, \"the original law-giver.\"\n\nLouisiana is the first state with such a requirement on the books. Republicans in other states have proposed similar laws, but they never came to fruition because legal action is guaranteed. And as expected, several organizations - including the ACLU and Americans United for Separation of Church and State, where I worked for several years - have already filed suit over the new law. \"Even among those who may believe in some version of the Ten Commandments, the particular text that they adhere to can differ by religious denomination or tradition. The government should not be taking sides in this theological debate, and it certainly should not be coercing students to submit day in and day out to unavoidable promotions of religious doctrine,\" the groups said in a joint statement. Will the courts agree? They should. The law's supporters can say what they like about the commandments being a historical document; that's a thin disguise for the true, and deeply religious, intentions behind the law. Even so, I don't love the groups' chances in court. The Supreme Court in particular has taken steps to erode the separation of church and state now that conservatives are in the majority.\n\nWhatever the eventual fate of the law, its very existence is telling. Public schools are secular by design, making them a key battleground for Christian nationalism. There is a difference between education and indoctrination, and the real purpose of laws like this one is to encourage the latter. Republicans did not act in a vacuum. The Christian right has successfully injected its specific beliefs into public schools all over the country. NBC News previously reported that over 300 public schools in a dozen states have set up chapters with LifeWise Academy, a Christian group that holds weekly religious instruction for students. Though students leave their public schools to attend lessons with LifeWise, instruction takes place during school hours - during lunch, or classes like gym and art. (LifeWise is legal, thanks to Supreme Court rulings that predate this iteration of the court.) The Oklahoma Supreme Court will soon decide whether a Catholic school will become the nation's first explicitly religious charter school.\n\nBattles over religion in public school are not only common; they date back centuries. In 1844, anti-Catholic riots erupted in Philadelphia after a chain of events that began with a local bishop objecting to readings of the Protestant Bible in city schools. But the Christian right's bid to embed the Ten Commandments more formally in American public life extends beyond the classroom door. It's part of a broader argument: America was founded not only on Christian principles, but on Christian laws, which makes it a Christian country. Before several women accused Roy Moore of sexually abusing them as teenagers and ended his hopes of becoming a U.S. senator, the former Alabama judge was known for displaying the Ten Commandments. Moore was suspended from his role as chief justice of the state supreme court after he refused to obey a judge's order to remove a 2.6 ton granite monument of the Ten Commandments from the rotunda of the Alabama Judicial Building. Alabama voters later reelected Moore as chief justice until he was suspended for judicial misconduct (again) in 2016. On Thursday, Moore praised the Louisiana law. \"There is a lot of talk in politics right now that we're so divided in our country,\" he told AL.com. \"But until we go back to some standard of right and wrong, it's all going to be about power in the country. It shouldn't be. Power will not solve our problems. God will.\"\n\nThe popular Christian minister David Barton has also promoted the idea that the Ten Commandments are a founding document of the American government. Barton, who is not a historian, despite how he portrays himself, testified in support of a Texas bill that resembled Louisiana's new law. \"It's hard to say that anything is more traditional in American education than the Ten Commandments,\" Barton said. His son Tim, the successor to his ministry, agreed. \"The very foundation of moral law for all of the western world for the morals of civilization have been derived from the Ten Commandments,\" he claimed. To Barton senior, the separation of church and state is just \"a liberal myth.\" The problem with Barton is that he doesn't tell the truth. He relies on fake quotes and cherry picked facts to argue, falsely, that America was based on the fundamentalist principles that he holds dear.\n\nWhy display the Ten Commandments? Likely several reasons, but among the most compelling is a thirst for sectarianism. Christian nationalists are looking to score points against their foes - and win an ideological war in the process. If America is a Christian nation, nobody else truly belongs. Not atheists, not Muslims, not Jews. Not even other Christians who may disagree with their interpretation of the Bible. That's a lesson that Louisiana Republicans hope to impart to Americans as children. Philadelphia's nativist riots remind us where sectarianism can lead. Louisiana's new law may not lead to physical violence against religious minorities. But it perpetuates violence of another sort. It's a brute power grab. It says everything about where Christian nationalism is right now - and where it's headed next.", "source": {"uri": "nymag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NYMag"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The First Amendment of the American Constitution be damned. Louisiana is officially the first state in U.S. history to require by law that the 10 Commandments be displayed in every public school in the state from kindergarten through college. Another way of putting that is that Louisiana is the first state to make it against the law not to practice religious indoctrination in the classroom.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed into law Wednesday the requirement that a poster-sized display of the Ten Commandments in \"large, easily readable font\" be placed in every single state-funded classroom in the state, and he's justifying the legislation by lying to the easily lied to and suggesting that the very concept of law was borne through Christianity.\n\n\"If you want to respect the rule of law, you've got to start from the original lawgiver, which was Moses\" who got the commandments from God, Landry said.\n\nAs we previously reported, the bill's sponsor, state Rep. Dodie Horton, claimed prior to the bill's passing that the Ten Commandments are rooted in legal history and that plastering them all over every public institution of learning in the state would effectively place a \"moral code\" in the classroom.\n\nHere's what I wrote about that:\n\nGet TF outta here with this nonsense about the Ten Commandments being \"rooted in legal history,\" and about the display being about \"moral code\" and not explicit religious indoctrination. In fact, let's just take a quick look at this so-called \"code.\"\n\nFirst, it's not really clear what the practical value is of displaying for students biblical instructions not to kill and steal, as it is common knowledge that these are crimes. I suppose it does somewhat justify the \"legal history\" aspect, but they might as well require classrooms to display the adage, \"Play with fire, you will get burned\" since we're creating entire legally-binding bills just to state the obvious.\n\nBut beyond that, what's the \"moral\" value of instructing students to \"have no other Gods before\" the chosen Christian God, to \"not make unto thee any graven images,\" to \"not take the name of Lord thy God in vain,\" and to \"remember the Sabbath day and keep it holy?\" What does any of that have to do with the \"moral code\" of someone who is not a worshiper of the Christian faith?\n\nThe Louisiana GOP could have found sound moral advice from the texts of a myriad of religious and/or spiritual groups, but they chose the doctrine of their preferred religion -- America's most dominant religion -- and a list of rules, nearly half of which can't really be applied to non-Cristians. That's not about morals, it's about forced proselytizing in public schools.\n\nLies upon lies upon lies upon lies But Republicans only consider it \"indoctrination\" when conservatives are uncomfortable. When schools are teaching gender studies and about different sexualities, which could only result in an easier, safer, more socially normalized and accepted life for members of the LGBTQIA+ community, that's \"indoctrination.\" When educators are giving lessons on Black history that haven't been put through the American jingoist whitewashing machine to placate the white and eternally fragile, that's \"indoctrination.\" The very concept of systemic racism is \"indoctrination\" no matter how much data exists to substantiate it, but explicit reinforcement of what is already the nation's most dominant religion under penalty of law is not, according to the Louisiana GOP. In fact, the law, which the governor signed at Our Lady of Fatima Catholic School in Lafayette, the Ten Commandments are \"foundational documents of our state and national government,\" which they are not. The law also requires that the religious text be displayed along with a four-paragraph \"context statement\" describing how the Commandments \"were a prominent part of American public education for almost three centuries,\" which, even if true, would only mean they had something in common with slavery and legalized second-class citizenship for non-white people and women. (But \"Make America great again,\" amitrite?) Anyway, now that this Christian law that violates the actual founding documents of American and flirts with fascism, is officially on the books, many legal experts agree that all Louisiana officials have done is open up the floodgates (that can't be parted by Moses) to legal challenges revolving around the constitutionality of it all. From AP:\n\nThe law prevents students from getting an equal education and will keep children who have different beliefs from feeling safe at school, the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the Freedom from Religion Foundation said in a joint statement Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"Even among those who may believe in some version of the Ten Commandments, the particular text that they adhere to can differ by religious denomination or tradition. The government should not be taking sides in this theological debate,\" the groups said.\n\nLegal battles over the display of the Ten Commandments in classrooms are not new.\n\nIn 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law was unconstitutional and violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says Congress can \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\" The high court found that the law had no secular purpose but rather served a plainly religious purpose.\n\nMore to come....\n\nIt's worth noting that other red states such as Texas, Oklahoma and Utah -- all states where Republicans have argued some variation of \"woke ideology indoctrinates students\" -- have proposed similar bills to require the display of the 10 Commandments. Indoctrination isn't the problem -- it just needs to be the right kind of indoctrination. This is the message GOP hypocrites are sending, and there's nothing \"moral\" about that.\n\nHouse Bill 800: Why Senators Should Not Sell Louisiana (Or Any Other State) To Big Business\n\nThis Holy

They also highlighted a 1980 U.S. Supreme Court decision that found a Kentucky law requiring the commandments in every public school classroom \"has no secular legislative purpose, and therefore is unconstitutional as violating the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.\"\n\nIn that case, Stone v. Graham, the 5-4 majority said that the Bible could be used in certain classes like history but that posting religious texts on walls \"serves no such educational function.\"\n\nLouisiana legislators cite another 5-4 Supreme Court decision in the law. Issued in 2005 in the case of Van Orden v. Perry, the Supreme Court found that the Establishment Clause allowed the display of a Ten Commandments monument on the grounds of the Texas State Capitol.\n\n\"The placement of the Ten Commandments monument on the Texas State Capitol grounds is a far more passive use of those texts than was the case in Stone, where the text confronted elementary school students every day,\" the majority said in that ruling. It added later that the display in Texas \"has a dual significance, partaking of both religion and government.\"\n\nLegislators also highlighted the 2019 decision in American Legion v. American Humanist Association. The Supreme Court in the 7-2 ruling said displaying a cross on public land in Maryland was not unconstitutional, in part because the monument \"has become a prominent community landmark, and its removal or radical alteration at this date would be seen by many not as a neutral act but as the manifestation of 'a hostility toward religion that has no place in our Establishment Clause traditions.'\"\n\nThe law requires a \"context statement\" to be displayed with the commandments. The statement includes a brief history of the commandments being used in public education.\n\nThe ACLU and the other groups said they're confident they will prevail. \"The First Amendment promises that we all get to decide for ourselves what religious beliefs, if any, to hold and practice, without pressure from the government. Politicians have no business imposing their preferred religious doctrine on students and families in public schools,\" they said in the joint statement.\n\nThe organizations said they \"will file suit\" against the new law.\n\nLouisiana officials said they were expecting legal challenges.\n\nLouisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill, a Republican, said on the social media platform X that the commandments \"are pretty simple (don't kill, steal, cheat on your wife), but they also are important to our country's foundations.\" She added, \"I look forward to defending the law.\"\n\nLouisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, another Republican, signed the bill on Wednesday along with about a dozen others.\n\nThe slate of bills included legislation that bars requiring COVID-19 vaccination to attend public or private schools, mandates that teachers be paid at least $30 an hour for work outside their regular duties, and prohibits punishment for not using names or pronouns inconsistent with the sex and legal names of students and employees.\n\n\"Today, we fulfilled our promise to bring drastic reform to our education system and bring common sense back to our classrooms,\" Mr. Landry said in a statement.", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American Civil Liberties Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ten Commandments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Establishment_Clause", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Establishment Clause"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bible"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans_United_for_Separation_of_Church_and_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Americans United for Separation of Church and State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_State_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas State Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_From_Religion_Foundation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freedom From Religion Foundation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_church_and_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Separation of church and state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "School district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secularity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_v._Graham", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stone v.

Since public schools are government entities, the establishment clause also applies to them. However, this has not stopped many Christians and Republicans from continually trying to insert religion into schools.\n\nChristian nationalism has been gaining steam recently, as the majority of Republicans want to declare the United States a Christian nation. As a result, challenges to the separation of church and state have been increasing. Recently, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of allowing a coach at a public school to lead his team in prayer on the field. Additionally, many right-wing states have passed legislation and utilized censorship to promote a faith-based interpretation of curriculum. For example, Texas has redacted chapters of science textbooks while quietly instilling reading programs brimming with religious material. Even so, Louisiana's latest defiance of separation of church and state is surprisingly bold.\n\nLouisiana recently passed House Bill 71, making it the first state in the nation to require public schools to display the Ten Commandments by law. By 2025, every school that receives state funding, including colleges and universities, will have to put up posters of the Ten Commandments. The bill even details the exact size requirements and language the posters must utilize. They must be 11 inches by 14 inches and include a Protestant translation of the Ten Commandments and a four-paragraph \"context statement\" highlighting the Ten Commandments' \"prominent\" history in American public education.\n\nIn addition, the bill prohibits schools from using state funding to finance the posters. Instead, the schools will have to pull from their own funds or donations to meet the requirement. While several states have proposed similar legislation, Louisiana is the only state where the bill successfully became law. Naturally, numerous civil liberties groups have already condemned the law and promised to file a lawsuit to stop it from going into effect.\n\nThe law has a good chance of being struck down as unconstitutional because similar cases have already played out in the past. In 2002, an appeals court ordered four Ohio schools to remove their public displays of the Ten Commandments on school grounds, ruling that the displays violated the Constitution. The Ten Commandments are a religious set of precepts revered as a moral foundation in Christianity, Judaism, and Islam and come directly from the Bible. Needless to say, if public schools promote the Ten Commandments, they are promoting religion and directly defying the government's necessity to remain neutral.\n\nOne also can't help but notice how hypocritical the law is. After all, Louisiana is quite big on book banning and has attacked books about Black history, women's history, and the LGBTQ+ community in schools. Republicans often argue that acknowledging the existence of the LGBTQ+ community in schools is \"indoctrination,\" yet support public displays of religion in schools. Similarly, some Republicans say that children can't be taught about slavery and racism because it will make them feel bad about themselves. Yet, they support promoting an unrealistic set of rules to children, which the Bible declares they are sinners and unworthy of heaven if they break.\n\nThe bill also highlights the double standard that often crops up in the separation of church and state. In some states, teachers aren't even allowed to wear hijabs because they're considered \"religious garb.\" However, in other states, the Supreme Court backs coaches in prayer with students on school grounds, and governors are demanding that every school display the Christian interpretation of the Ten Commandments. Certain religions are required to follow an extreme interpretation of the Constitution, while religions like Christianity often find loopholes in the clause. Hopefully, legal challenges to Louisana's law will prove effective in demonstrating that Christianity is not an exception to the Constitution.", "source": {"uri": "themarysue.com", "dataType": "news",

Jeff Landry (R) signed legislation Wednesday requiring every public classroom in Louisiana to display the Ten Commandments, becoming the first state with such a law and inflaming tensions over the separation between church and state.\n\n\"This bill mandates the display of the Ten Commandments in every classroom -- public elementary, secondary and post-education schools -- in the state of Louisiana, because if you want to respect the rule of law, you've got to start from the original lawgiver, which was Moses,\" Landry said at a bill-signing ceremony.\n\nCritics vowed to challenge the law in court, calling it unconstitutional and warning that it will lead to religious coercion of students...\n\nA law requiring the display of the Ten Commandments in every public school classroom, not just a monument outside a courthouse, certainly sounds like an unconstitutional \"establishment of religion\" proscribed by the First Amendment, and before the advent of the 6-3 Trump Supreme Court majority there's little question as to what would have been this law's fate. In today's post-Roe reality where no assumption of binding judicial precedent appears safe, what would have been clearly unconstitutional just a decade ago must now be seriously considered.\n\nAlthough the public display of the Ten Commandments hasn't debated as much in recent years in Colorado owing mostly to overwhelming Democratic control of the legislature and executive branch, much like Colorado GOP chairman Dave \"Let's Go Brandon\" Williams' attention-seeking malice against LGBTQ+ people, there's more support for pushing religion in Colorado public schools than polite Republicans care to admit. A Ten Commandments Monument outside the Colorado Capitol survived challenges all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court in the 1990s. In 2011, our friend and media critic Jason Salzman reported on the widespread Republican support for publicly displaying the Ten Commandments with taxpayer dollars, non-Shabbat honorers and non-Judeo-Christian idolaters be damned:\n\nDuring the 2010 primary U.S. Sen. candidate Ken Buck, U.S. Rep. Cory Gardner, State Sen. Ken Lambert (SD 9), State Sen. Kevin Grantham (SD 2), Rep. Mark Barker (HD 17), Rep. Jon Becker (HD 63), Rep. Ray Scott (HD 54), and Rep. Libby Szabo (HD 27) apparently filled out a survey from the Christian Family Alliance indicating that they support \"public posting of 10 Commandments.\"\n\nThe ACLU has already announced their intention to sue to prevent the law from taking effect, setting up the court challenge that was the whole purpose of Gov. Jeff Landry signing the bill. For Colorado conservatives, it's a case of wishing they had the power to \"push the envelope\" in the culture wars.

Louisiana Republicans passed a new law on this anyway.\n\nIn recent months, a handful of Republican-dominated states have flirted with the idea of government-sponsored religious displays in public school classrooms, though those efforts ultimately fell short. As NBC News reported, however, GOP officials in Louisiana actually followed through on the idea.\n\nUnder the new law, which will take effect in 2025, assorted other documents -- including the Mayflower Compact and the Declaration of Independence -- can also be displayed in classrooms, but only the Decalogue is required.\n\nThere will, of course, be some expense involved with displaying the Ten Commandments in every classroom in every elementary school, middle school, high school, and public university in the state of Louisiana, but the new law requires that they be financed through private donations.\n\nIt wasn't long before Americans United for Separation of Church and State, the American Civil Liberties Union, the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana, and the Freedom from Religion Foundation announced their intention to challenge the new law in court.\n\n\"The law violates the separation of church and state and is blatantly unconstitutional,\" the groups said in a joint statement. \"The First Amendment promises that we all get to decide for ourselves what religious beliefs, if any, to hold and practice, without pressure from the government. Politicians have no business imposing their preferred religious doctrine on students and families in public schools.\"\n\nAt first blush, it's easy to imagine this lawsuit succeeding. After all, Louisiana's new Ten Commandments is a legal, political, and theological mess.\n\nFor example, Protestants, Jews, and Catholics each honor the Commandments, but the different faith traditions number and word the Decalogue in different ways. It's not the job of politicians in state government to choose which version deserves an official endorsement to be imposed on public school children. (The Commandment law in Louisiana, for the record, appears to go with the Protestant version, despite the state's sizable Roman Catholic population.)\n\nThe legal dimension to this is every bit as jarring. Louisiana's far-right Republican governor, Jeff Landry, declared yesterday, \"If you want to respect the rule of law, you've got to start from the original law giver, which was Moses.\"\n\nActually, if Louisiana Republicans want to respect the rule of law, they have to start with their own country's Constitution, which includes the First Amendment, and honor U.S. Supreme Court precedent, which GOP officials in the state have decided to ignore.\n\nIndeed, when officials in Kentucky approved a nearly identical law nearly a half-century ago, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1980 that Ten Commandments displays in public schools were unconstitutional. The Decalogue, the justices ruled in Stone v. Graham, is \"undeniably a sacred text in the Jewish and Christian faiths\" and displaying them \"serves no ... educational function.\"\n\nSo why would Louisiana Republicans take a step that the Supreme Court has already rejected? It's probably because they're confident that the newly politicized high court and its dominant far-right majority -- not to mention the brazen Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals -- will simply overturn the Stone precedent, doing fresh harm to the wall that's supposed to separate church and state in this country.\n\n\"I can't wait to be sued,\" Landry said at a fundraiser over the weekend.

Governor Jeff Landry signed the Republican-backed measure into law, stating that the commandments are essential documents for our state and national government.\n\nHowever, this law is expected to face challenges from civil rights groups who argue that it goes against the separation of church and state outlined in the US Constitution's Establishment Clause. This clause prohibits the government from establishing or promoting any specific religion.\n\nThe state law mandates that the poster must feature the sacred text in a large, easily readable font on an 11 by 14-inch poster. The commandments should be the central focus of the display, accompanied by a four-paragraph \"context statement\" explaining their historical significance in American public education.\n\nBy 2025, all classrooms receiving state funding must have these posters on display, but the state is not providing funding for the posters themselves. Similar laws have been proposed in other Republican-led states like Texas, Oklahoma, and Utah.\n\nLegal battles surrounding the display of the Ten Commandments in public spaces, including schools, courthouses, and police stations, are not new. In 1980, the US Supreme Court invalidated a Kentucky law that required the display of the commandments in elementary and high schools. The court determined that the law had no secular purpose and was primarily religious in nature, citing references to worshipping God and observing the Sabbath day in the commandments.\n\nWhile Louisiana's decision to mandate Ten Commandments posters in classrooms may be seen as a nod to the state's religious heritage, it raises concerns about the potential violation of the constitutional principle of separation of church and state. As this issue unfolds, it will be interesting to see how legal challenges and debates shape the implementation of this controversial law.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ten Commandments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Landry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Landry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Establishment_Clause", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Establishment Clause"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_church_and_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Separation of church and state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabbat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shabbat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secularity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Church-State_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Church-State Relations", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Noahidism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Noahidism", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://usanews.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/news-19062024-192014.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666431", "eventUri": "eng-9666431", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

They also highlighted a 1980 U.S. Supreme Court decision that found a Kentucky law requiring the commandments in every public school classroom \"has no secular legislative purpose, and therefore is unconstitutional as violating the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.\"\n\nIn that case, Stone v. Graham, the 5-4 majority said that the Bible could be used in certain classes like history but that posting religious texts on walls \"serves no such educational function.\"\n\nLouisiana legislators cite another 5-4 Supreme Court decision in the law. Issued in 2005 in the case of Van Orden v. Perry, the Supreme Court found that the Establishment Clause allowed the display of a Ten Commandments monument on the grounds of the Texas State Capitol.\n\n\"The placement of the Ten Commandments monument on the Texas State Capitol grounds is a far more passive use of those texts than was the case in Stone, where the text confronted elementary school students every day,\" the majority said in that ruling. It added later that the display in Texas \"has a dual significance, partaking of both religion and government.\"\n\nLegislators also highlighted the 2019 decision in American Legion v. American Humanist Association. The Supreme Court in the 7-2 ruling said displaying a cross on public land in Maryland was not unconstitutional, in part because the monument \"has become a prominent community landmark, and its removal or radical alteration at this date would be seen by many not as a neutral act but as the manifestation of 'a hostility toward religion that has no place in our Establishment Clause traditions.'\"\n\nThe law requires a \"context statement\" to be displayed with the commandments. The statement includes a brief history of the commandments being used in public education.\n\nThe ACLU and the other groups said they're confident they will prevail. \"The First Amendment promises that we all get to decide for ourselves what religious beliefs, if any, to hold and practice, without pressure from the government. Politicians have no business imposing their preferred religious doctrine on students and families in public schools,\" they said in the joint statement.\n\nThe organizations said they \"will file suit\" against the new law.\n\nLouisiana officials said they were expecting legal challenges.\n\nLouisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill, a Republican, said on the social media platform X that the commandments \"are pretty simple (don't kill, steal, cheat on your wife), but they also are important to our country's foundations.\" She added, \"I look forward to defending the law.\"\n\nLouisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, another Republican, signed the bill on Wednesday along with about a dozen others.\n\nThe slate of bills included legislation that bars requiring COVID-19 vaccination to attend public or private schools, mandates that teachers be paid at least $30 an hour for work outside their regular duties, and prohibits punishment for not using names or pronouns inconsistent with the sex and legal names of students and employees.\n\n\"Today, we fulfilled our promise to bring drastic reform to our education system and bring common sense back to our classrooms,\" Mr. Landry said in a statement.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American Civil Liberties Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ten Commandments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Establishment_Clause", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Establishment Clause"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bible"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_v._Graham", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stone v.

Jeff Landry has a fan in Alabama, one who has been an old soldier in past culture war battles to get the Ten Commandments displayed in public venues.\n\nFormer Alabama State Supreme Court Judge Roy Moore, in an interview with AL.com Wednesday, said the new law in Louisiana requiring Ten Commandment displays in every public classroom \"is so much needed in our country,\" and should be able to withstand legal challenges.\n\nLandry, ahead of signing the law, said he couldn't \"wait to get sued.\" That is likely to happen, after several civil liberties groups have vowed to challenge the law based on an argument over a separation of church and state.\n\n\"It's a wonderful thing what the governor is doing,\" said Moore, during an interview with AL.com from his home in Etowah County.\n\nMoore gained the nickname the \"Ten Commandments Judge\" for refusing to take down a homemade wooden Ten Commandments plaque behind his bench when he was an Etowah County circuit court judge in the 1990s. And his placement of a Ten Commandments monument inside the state's judicial building led to his ouster as Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court several years later.\n\n\"I think it will be differently perceived in this (U.S. Supreme) Court,\" Moore said. \"I'm confident it will go through, and I willfully support the governor and will help him in any way I can.\"\n\nMoore, 77, said he has not spoken to Landry about Louisiana's efforts which culminated in the governor signing the Ten Commandments bill into law on Wednesday. The new law, a GOP-drafted legislation, mandates a poster-sized display of the Ten Commandments in \"large, easily readable font\" be required in all public classrooms, from kindergarten to state-funded universities.\n\nThe displays will be paired with a four-paragraph \"context statement\" describing how the Ten Commandments \"were a prominent part of American public education for almost three centuries.\" The displays must be put into place in classrooms by the start of 2025.\n\n\"It's historical and something our country is founded upon, and we sorely need that morality back,\" said Moore, who continues to run the non-profit Foundation for Moral Law with wife, Kayla, from their home in Etowah County. \"There is a lot of talk in politics right now that we're so divided in our country. But until we go back to some standard of right and wrong, it's all going to be about power in the country. It shouldn't be. Power will not solve our problems. God will.\"\n\nMoore and his former campaign strategist, Dean Young of Orange Beach, said they believe the legal challenges will be upheld by the current U.S. Supreme Court, where conservatives have a supermajority.\n\nIn 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law was unconstitutional and violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says Congress can \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\" The high court found that the Ten Commandments law in Kentucky served no secular purpose but rather was for a plainly religious purpose.\n\n\"The courts have confused that over religion,\" Moore said. \"God was not religion. The difference between religion and morality are the duties we owe to God. If you plug that into the First Amendment, it's about how you worship God and not that you couldn't recognize God.\"\n\nYoung said he is disappointed that Alabama lawmakers did not lead the efforts to get a similar law passed. Louisiana is the first state to require their displays, igniting the latest culture war issue that is sure to be debated by politicians as the presidential election season heats up.\n\n\"Alabama dropped the ball,\" Young said, adding that state lawmakers nationwide now have a \"blueprint\" by which to go by with Louisiana's new law.\n\n\"It takes a governor to stand up for what is right,\" said Young, a former Republican congressional candidate in South Alabama. \"That's what they have in Louisiana.\"\n\nMoore gained his reputation as a staunch defender of the Ten Commandments for his legal tussles with the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups for his refusal to remove the displays. After he was elected to the Alabama Supreme Court in 2000, Moore commissioned the display of a 2-1/2-ton granite monument inscribed with the Ten Commandments and had it placed in the rotunda of the Alabama Judicial Building in downtown Montgomery.\n\nA federal judge ruled the display unconstitutional in 2002, but Moore refused to have it taken out of the building. A state panel then ruled Moore had violated the judicial ethics code, and he was removed from the bench.\n\nThe Ten Commandments standoff led to national fame, and Moore did consider a presidential bid in 2012. He, instead, won back his state Supreme Court seat in a competitive race against Democrat Bob Vance. Moore did not bring back the Ten Commandments display, but he was suspended for ordering state judges to defy the Supreme Court's ruling in 2015 legalizing same-sex marriage and instead have them enforce a state ban on such marriages.\n\nMoore's age prevented him from running for the Supreme Court again. He, instead, ran for the U.S. Senate in a special Senate election in 2017. Moore won a crowded GOP primary and easily defeated then-Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange in the runoff.\n\nHe was then defeated by Democratic challenger Doug Jones by a narrow margin in a contest that drew international attention. Moore's candidacy unraveled about a month before the election after controversy surfaced about alleged sexual misconduct he had decades ago with teenage girls when he was in his 30s.\n\nMoore ran again for the Senate in 2020, but he finished a distant fourth place in that year's GOP primary won by Tommy Tuberville.", "source": {"uri": "al.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "al"}, "authors":

Commandments", "body": "The Ten Commandments are to be displayed in all classrooms in Louisiana after a controversial order was signed into law on Wednesday.\n\nThe Republican-backed rule, which applies to all state schools and universities, was labelled \"blatantly unconstitutional\" as it breaks the principle of treating all religions equally.\n\nCritics have vowed to mount a legal challenge, and some believe the move may get a sympathetic hearing from the Supreme Court, which has become more conservative since Donald Trump and more inclined to rule on the side of religious rights in recent years.\n\n\"I can't wait to be sued,\" Jeff Landry, Louisiana's Republican governor who signed the measure into law, said last week, according to The Tennessean.\n\nBy 2025, every Louisiana classroom will be required to display a poster or framed document, measuring at least 11 by 14 inches, with the commandments in a \"large, easily readable font\".\n\nMr Landry argued on Wednesday that the 10 Commandments - which include injunctions against murdering, stealing and adultery - provided valuable life lessons.\n\n\"If you want to respect the rule of law, you've got to start from the original lawgiver, which was Moses,\" he said.\n\nIn Stone v Graham (1980), the Supreme Court struck down a similar move in Kentucky, ruling that the 10 Commandments were \"plainly religious in nature\".\n\nThe instructions are not confined to secular matters but also those such as worshipping God and observing the Sabbath, it noted.\n\nCommentators have suggested that the ensuing legal battle may see the Supreme Court overturn the precedent set by the Stone case.\n\nIn recent years, conservative Christian groups have attempted to bring cases about public expressions of faith to the Court, which has proved more sympathetic to the issue than in the past.\n\n\"The climate is certainly better,\" Charles C Haynes, a senior fellow for religious liberty at the Freedom Forum foundation, told the New York Times.\n\nHowever, he suggested Louisiana lawmakers were \"overreaching\" and that \"even this court will have a hard time justifying\" the measure.\n\nLouisiana's push also reflects a broad scepticism from conservatives about Left-wing ideologies allegedly being put forward in schools.\n\nLeft-wing ideologies\n\n\"Given all the junk our children are exposed to in classrooms today, it is imperative that we put the 10 Commandments back in a prominent position,\" Dodie Horton, a Louisiana state representative, said.\n\nIt may spur on other Republican-led states which have proposed the measure, including Texas, Utah and Oklahoma, to follow suit.\n\nCritics claim the law breaches the Constitution's First Amendment that decrees a separation of church and state. \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,\" it reads.\n\nSeveral organisations, including the American Civil Liberties Union, pledged to immediately challenge the legislation in the courts and accused the state of trampling on religious rights.\n\n\"The First Amendment promises that we all get to decide for ourselves what religious beliefs, if any, to hold and practice, without pressure from the government,\" the groups said in a joint statement.\n\n\"Politicians have no business imposing their preferred religious doctrine on students and families in public schools.\n\n\"Louisiana's communities and public schools are religiously diverse, yet [the measure] would require school officials to promote specific religious beliefs to which people of many faiths, and those of no faith, do not subscribe.\"\n\nThey noted that the language of the Commandments differs in various religious denominations, accusing lawmakers of pushing a \"state-sanctioned version of scripture\".", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "benedict_smith@uk.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Benedict Smith", "type": "author",

Lauren Ventrella snapped at CNN host Boris Sanchez's pushback against the mandate requiring the display of the Ten Commandments in public schools.\n\nLouisiana became the first state to require the display of the Ten Commandments following the signing of legislation regarding the matter into law Wednesday by Republican Gov. Jeff Landry. The mandate led organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) to raise legal battles by arguing the state law is a First Amendment violation.\n\nSanchez and the state representative sparred over the mandate as the CNN host argued the U.S. Constitution is a secular document. Ventrella argued faith, along with the Ten Commandments, are a significant historical component to the founding of the U.S.\n\n\"Sure, but do you also recognize that the Constitution of this country, its founding document, doesn't include the word God or Jesus or Christianity and that's for a reason and that's because the founding fathers founded this country as a secular one,\" Sanchez said. \"You don't see that?\"\n\n\"Boris, I bet you CNN pays you a lot of money. I bet you got a lot of dollar bills in that wallet,\" Ventrella hit back.\n\n\"What does this have to do with the network that I work for or what I'm getting paid?\" Sanchez asked. \"Don't make this about that, answer that question. Why did the founding fathers not include God in the Constitution if they wanted this country to be the way that you see it?\"\n\n\"Let me finish my statement,\" she replied.\n\n\"Answer the question and don't make this about me,\" Sanchez snapped back.\n\n\"In God We Trust. We'll make it about me. I've got a dollar bill in my wallet. In God We Trust is written on that dollar. It is not forcing anybody to believe one viewpoint, it's merely posting a historical reference on the wall for students to read and interpret it if they choose,\" she argued.\n\nVentrella pushed back against critics who say the mandate will interfere with the beliefs of Jewish and Muslim students, arguing it is a historical document that influence the U.S. legal system. Sanchez said the Ten Commandments go beyond being a historical document by pushing specific religious beliefs. (RELATED: Joy Behar Suggests Religious People Who Vote For Trump Are Not Actually Christian)\n\n\"I don't agree with you this is a random, historical document. This is -- \" Ventrella said.\n\n\"I didn't say it was random,\" Sanchez interrupted. \"But there are others -- \"\n\n\"This is a very valuable document. Look, this nation has gotten out of hand with crime, with the bad, negative things that are going on. Why is it so preposterous that we would want our students to have the option to have some good principles instilled in them? If they don't hear it at home, let them read it in the classroom,\" she said. \"Which is different than the Mayflower Compact which is mentioned in the document as well. I don't understand why this is so preposterous in that litigation is being threatened. It doesn't scare us in the state of Louisiana, we say bring it on.\"\n\n\"Because if someone has a home in which they choose to believe something different, which is welcome in this country. It's literally why people fled to come here to found this country to begin with. Then they should be allowed to. And it's not really an option if you're requiring it to be put up in the wall of the classroom,\" Sanchez said.\n\nVentrella advised students, parents and teachers who do not share the \"religious views\" of the Ten Commandments to simply not look at it.\n\nThe CNN host compared the display of the Ten Commandments to hanging up the Five Pillars of Islam in public school classrooms.\n\n\"This is not about the Five Pillars of Islam. This bill specifically states the Ten Commandments. It is a historical document -- \" she began.\n\n\"Sure, but I'm presenting you with a hypothetical that would help you put yourself in the shoes of someone you may not understand and their point of view,\" he interjected. \"How would you feel if you walked into a classroom and something you didn't believe in was required to be on the wall? You can answer that question.\" (RELATED: Watch CNN Host's Face When GOP Rep Makes Comment About 'Slave Labor')\n\n\"I appreciate you, Boris. I cannot sit here and gather and fathom ... you could give me a thousand hypotheticals. But again, this specific bill applies to this specific text. The Quran, or Islam, that is a very broad statement. We're specifically talking about a limited text, on mind you, a piece of paper that's not much bigger than a legal sheet of paper.

It would be, you know, much more appropriate for what we face, really, in Louisiana,\" Carville told CNN's Anderson Cooper when asked on Wednesday about the new law in his home state.\n\n\"I don't know which one they're going to put up,\" Carville said. \"There's 10 different versions of the Ten Commandments, and our schools are so underfunded that I'm not sure half the kids even know how to read them. But it's one of the dumbest waste[s] of time that I've ever seen in my life.\"\n\nGov. Jeff Landry (R) on Wednesday signed the GOP-led bill that will require all public elementary and high school classrooms in Louisiana to display the Ten Commandments.\n\nUnder the laws, the signs must be in classrooms in \"large, easily readable font\" on a poster or framed document that is at least 11-by-14 inches, by the beginning of 2025. The posters will also contain a three-paragraph statement that will say the Ten Commandments have been a prominent part of American education.\n\nSpeaking with Carville, Cooper said Louisiana schools have traditionally ranked very low in American school ratings, while noting this rating has increased slightly over the years.\n\n\"Gov. Edwards -- John Bel -- did a great job. I mean, he got us, off the bottom, but Gov. Landry's intent on putting us back on the bottom, it seems like,\" Carville said. \"But I'm serious, when I look at this storm season and the summer coming ahead, it's going to be a fundamentally different country come mid-October of this year. It's going to really be bad.\"\n\nThe new law has already received backlash from civil rights organizations, who argue it violates the First Amendment's Establishment Clause, which guarantees separation of church and state.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and other groups on Thursday said they plan to file a lawsuit challenging the law.\n\n\"The First Amendment promises that we all get to decide for ourselves what religious beliefs, if any, to hold and practice, without pressure from the government. Politicians have no business imposing their preferred religious doctrine on students and families in public schools,\" the ACLU of Louisiana, Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the Freedom from Religion Foundation said in a statement.\n\nCooper pointed to the Establishment Clause and asked Carville if there is a difference between having a book with certain views in a library and a poster from the Bible in every classroom.\n\n\"Well, look, this is book burner talking points, all right? These people want to burn books, take them out of libraries. You know, you can't substitute reading, writing, arithmetic with ... you know, like I say, the courts are going to have to flush this out, but there's a thousand founding documents,\" Carville said adding later, \"The problem is you've got to have kids that can read them.\"\n\n\"What I find fascinating is the book burners really want the Ten Commandments,\" Carville quipped. \"Give me a break.\"\n\nCNN contributor Scott Jennings, who was also speaking with Cooper, argued instead the Ten Commandments could be thought of as part of the principles of the Western civilization.\n\n\"I'm not out here crusading for it, and I certainly don't think public school teachers should be preachers, but, you know, these are the fundamental tenets of Western civilization. They kind of underpin, you know, our entire criminal justice system,\" Jennings said. \"And look, if they're part of a historical display, if they're hanging up there next to the Constitution, the Mayflower Compact, the Declaration of Independence, I don't have a problem with it.\"\n\n\"I do think it's sort of amusing that there are people out here so enraged by this today who at the same time would love to use public schools and public libraries and other public facilities to distribute information that more matches their own agenda,\" Jennings continued, arguing people are \"overreacting\" to the new law.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "miranda_nazzaro@thehill.com", "name": "Miranda Nazzaro", "type":

Jeff Landry of Louisiana has signed a law that mandates the Ten Commandments be posted in every public education classroom in the state -- the first state to do so.\n\nAnd, yes, the Ten Commandments are a sacred Jewish text (known as the aseret ha-dibrot, the 10 utterances), which is not the reason why he has made that a mandate. I doubt he has reflected overly much on their Jewish origin; for him, they are part of that amorphous thing called \"the Judeo-Christian tradition\" -- useful because, supposedly, such a posting will create a more moral generation of young people.\n\nBut, no, this rabbi is not happy about this. I daresay I speak for many if not most Jews in America in voicing my displeasure and my concern.\n\nWhy?\n\nFirst, we might think the Ten Commandments are simply a list of basic moral rules. They are a religious text that comes from a particular religious tradition. The revelation of those commandments forms the core of the Jewish covenant with God.\n\nAs such, this is a violation of the establishment clause of the Constitution, which forbids the government from establishing an official religion. It also specifies that the government must neither promote nor inhibit religion. In this particular instance, the religion in question just happens to be mine (though, through that \"Judeo-Christian\" thing, it is not only \"mine\"). This does not make me feel better.\n\nBut, you will protest, doesn't the fact that this is \"Judeo-Christian\" have any bearing on the matter? After all, this is a \"Judeo-Christian\" country.\n\nTo which I would say: Dwight David Eisenhower just called and he wants his worldview back. That whole idea of \"Judeo-Christian\" is a nostalgia act -- the religious equivalent of a doo-wop revival. This country is Christian (and every flavor thereof), Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, Mormon, Wiccan, etc., etc. -- and it is also agnostic, atheist and everything in between. Again, posting the Ten Commandments favors one particular religious tradition as a source of inspiration and guidance.\n\nMoreover, we have an additional problem: Which version of the Ten Commandments?\n\nThere are two versions of the Ten Commandments/Aseret Ha-dibrot in the Torah. Here is a summary of the list in Exodus 20:\n\nThere is a second version in Deuteronomy 5. The two versions differ from each other in subtle, yet important ways. The Exodus version says Jews must \"remember\" the Sabbath; the Deuteronomy version says Jews must \"observe\" the Sabbath. More than that, the Ten Commandments reappear in the Holiness Code of Leviticus 19.\n\nLet's add to the problem: Whose Ten Commandments? We have seen there are two versions in the Torah.\n\nLet's make it more complicated. There are two Christian versions.\n\nFirst, the Catholic version.\n\nNotice: In this version, the first two commandments are combined into one, except that it omits the passage about graven images, and the last commandment about coveting is divided into two -- one about your neighbor's wife, and the other about your neighbor's goods.\n\nThere is also the Protestant version:\n\nThe version of the Ten Commandments that is about to find a place on classroom walls in Louisiana? That would be the Protestant version.\n\nSo, the placing of a Protestant text will seem, to many people, as the government establishment of a religion.\n\nFor me, as for many of us, that would be enough reason to oppose this legislation. That opposition need not be, and should not be, the sole responsibility of secular groups. All religions should oppose it as well -- even, and especially, Protestants who might choose not to view this as a theological victory, but as a moment to say \"gulp\" and to think about the American body politic.\n\nFinally, why do I oppose the posting of the Ten Commandments?\n\nFirst, let me channel my inner Hebrew scholar. The Christian versions canonize a mistranslation of the sixth commandment -- lo tirtzach. It does not say \"you shall not kill\"; rather, \"you shall not murder.\" The biblical tradition understands that there is a difference between murder -- the wanton taking of a human life -- and killing, which might be accidental or even, at times, tragically necessary.\n\nSnark alert: If, in fact, Louisiana (and perhaps other states) would want to post the Ten Commandments, with their directive to \"not kill,\" the least we could expect is some kind of activism regarding access to firearms. Nothing would be more effective in making the words of that commandment into a civic reality.\n\nBut, second: The Ten Commandments are too \"nice,\" too basic, too Hallmark greeting card. Even though no one has asked me, I would put a different biblical text into classrooms.\n\nWhich text would that be? How about Leviticus 19, the Holiness Code? True, you get the Ten Commandments in there anyway. But there are some other necessary gems in there.\n\nWould I really call for putting these verses into classrooms? Obviously not.\n\nBut that is the kind of society I would want to create.", "source": {"uri": "religionnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Religion News Service"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeffrey_salkin@religionnews.com", "name": "Jeffrey Salkin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judeo-Christian", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Judeo-Christian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ten Commandments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covenant_(biblical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Covenant (biblical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Establishment_Clause", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Establishment Clause"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torah", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Torah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revelation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Revelation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rabbi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabbat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shabbat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_text", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Religious text"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Morality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Protestantism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicca", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wicca"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Exodus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Exodus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnosticism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Agnosticism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormons", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mormons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jainism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dwight D.

Jeff Landry signed into effect on Wednesday, legislation that won praise from former Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore, who has championed Ten Commandments displays during his political career.\n\nBut Alabama voters did show strong support of Ten Commandments displays when they approved an amendment to the state constitution in 2018. Seventy-two percent of those who voted supported the measure, which is Amendment 942 to the Alabama Constitution.\n\nThe amendment said public schools and public bodies can display the Ten Commandments on property owned by the state. It added this qualifying language:\n\n\"The Ten Commandments shall be displayed in a manner that complies with constitutional requirements, including, but not limited to, being intermingled with historical or educational items, or both, in a larger display within or on property owned or administrated by a public school or public body.\"\n\nThe amendment also says: \"No public funds may be expended in defense of the constitutionality of this amendment.\"\n\nFormer state Sen. Gerald Dial, R-Lineville, sponsored the bill to put the amendment on the ballot.\n\nDial, who left the Legislature in 2018 after 10 terms, said he does not know what schools or public entities posted the Ten Commandments after voters approved the amendment. Dial said he distributed laminated copies of the Ten Commandments to schools but is not sure whether they were used.\n\nAs for Louisiana's approach, Dial said there were concerns in Alabama about the legal costs that could have resulted from mandating Ten Commandments displays.\n\n\"We tried to go down that road to a degree,\" Dial said. \"But then we were warned by all the legal scholars that it would be unconstitutional and it would just cost the state a lot of money to go all the way to the Supreme Court. And what I was doing was the most practical and easiest way and it would leave it up to the school boards and city managers and governmental officials to decide whether they wanted to put it up or not.\"\n\nDial, noting that he is not a lawyer, said he's uncertain how the conservative-leaning U.S. Supreme Court would rule on a challenge to the new Louisiana law and whether the principal of separation of church and state would result in blocking the law. Several groups have already said they plan to sue to block the Louisiana law.\n\nDial believes there would be benefits to Ten Commandments displays in public schools because of the influence it could have on students, even if that's a small number of students, especially in an era of concern over gun violence and school shootings.\n\n\"If it keeps one person from doing something, or if it changes one person's life, it's worth the effort,\" Dial said. \"What we seem to in America to have gotten away from is that one life is valuable. We've come almost to the point where, well, first thing on the news is somebody killed. That's just tough luck. That's just to be expected.\"\n\n\"If this helps to reinstall the value of what a human life or what human beings should be and how we should treat our neighbors, then it's worth the effort,\" Dial said.", "source": {"uri": "al.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "al"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ten Commandments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Alabama", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of Alabama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Landry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Landry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Alabama", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of Alabama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief Justice of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Moore", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roy Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_constitution_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State constitution (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_church_and_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Separation of church and state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Church-State_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Church-State Relations", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Noahidism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Noahidism", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.al.com/resizer/v2/TZVRX2AFGJHB3FJP6J6ZHYDZEA.jpg?auth=0fe50da9d52f02db2cc3305dd84ee24a47acd2d402d11b65c53b6fc5988603f4&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666431", "eventUri": "eng-9666431", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

With legal challenges certain to follow, Governor Jeff Landry noted that he \"can't wait to be sued.\" After the Supreme Court ruled more than 40 years ago that such displays violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, how do Pelican State lawmakers think this latest effort will differ in outcome?\n\nIn 1980, a five-to-four Supreme Court decision in Stone v. Graham ruled that by requiring the commandments to be displayed in schools, Kentucky violated the separation of church and state established by the First Amendment. More specifically, the court held that the statute failed the Lemon Test, a rubric based on the 1971 decision in Lemon v. Kurtzman.\n\nThe Lemon Test holds that to not violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, a \"statute must have a secular legislative purpose\" and that \"its principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion,\" and it cannot promote \"an excessive government entanglement with religion.\" The decision in Stone determined that Kentucky ran afoul of not having a \"secular legislative purpose.\" And this appears to be where Louisiana Republicans think they can tilt the scales.\n\nThe law requires that from January 1, 2025, the commandments be displayed in all classrooms on a \"poster or framed document that is at least eleven inches by fourteen inches\" and that a context statement is included that explains why they are \"a prominent part of American public education.\" The bill reads:\n\n\"Recognizing the historical role of the Ten Commandments accords with our nation's history and faithfully reflects the understanding of the founders of our nation with respect to the necessity of civil morality to a functional self-government.\n\n\"History records that James Madison, the fourth President of the United States of America, stated that '(w)e have staked the whole future of our new nation . . . upon the capacity of each of ourselves to govern ourselves according to the moral principles of the Ten Commandments.'\"\n\nThe four-paragraph context statement that must accompany each poster or document, says, in part, that the commandments have been \"a prominent part of American public education for almost three centuries.\"\n\nIt also allows (but doesn't require) other documents of historical note to be displayed, including the Declaration of Independence and the Mayflower Compact.\n\nA joint statement by the Louisiana chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union and the Freedom From Religion Foundation released on Wednesday argued that: \"The First Amendment promises that we all get to decide for ourselves what religious beliefs, if any, to hold and practice, without pressure from the government ... Politicians have no business imposing their preferred religious doctrine on students and families in public schools.\"\n\nThe Center for Inquiry group wrote to Governor Landry in advance of the bill becoming law, urging him to veto its passage, stating that it \"is an exclusionary, heavy-handed measure that will make every student who is a member of a minority religion (or no religion at all) feel like an outsider in their own school and virtually invite litigation at taxpayer expense.\"\n\nBut Landry seems eager to invite challenges. Why is he so confident he will prevail?\n\nIn 2023, the Supreme Court ruled in Kennedy v. Bremerton School District that football coach Joe Kennedy's silent prayers on the field did not violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. Writing the majority opinion, Justice Neil Gorsuch side-stepped the Lemon Test, writing: \"In place of Lemon and the endorsement test, this Court has instructed that the Establishment Clause must be interpreted by 'reference to historical practices and understandings.'\"\n\nMaking the case that the Ten Commandments can be viewed in a historical sense rather than a religious one could land on receptive ears - especially considering the composition of the court has changed since the Stone v.

They describe the commandments as \"a historical document.\" And after signing the legislation, Gov. Jeff Landry said: \"If you want to respect the rule of law, you've got to start from the original law giver, which was Moses.\"\n\nOkey doke. Let's go with that. Because respecting the rule of law matters. And if we're respecting the rule of law, I'm sure Gov. Landry would agree it would be educational malfeasance not to inform Louisiana students that the presumptive Republican presidential nominee and former president - a man Landry himself has enthusiastically endorsed - has broken a slew of the laws outlined on their classroom poster.\n\nThe law requires that the Ten Commandments posters be \"at least eleven inches by fourteen inches\" and that the \"text of the Ten Commandments shall be the central focus of the poster or framed document\" and be \"printed in a large, easily readable font.\"\n\nAnd again, that's all completely fine with me, as long as there are notes on the poster or on an accompanying poster that detail the ways Trump has violated certain commandments.\n\nFor example, per the language mandated by the state of Louisiana: \"Thou shalt not take the Name of the Lord Thy God in Vain.\" Trump has previously dropped \"g--damn\" in his rally speeches.\n\nTrump's violent speech: Trump, MAGA supporters' violent rhetoric isn't a glitch. It's a feature.\n\nAfter the then-president dropped a couple of GD bombs in 2019, Trump supporter and evangelical adviser Rev. Robert Jeffress of Texas told the Washington Post: \"I certainly do not condone taking the Lord's name in vain. There is a whole commandment dedicated to prohibiting that. I think it's very offensive to use the Lord's name in vain.\"\n\nNext up on the commandments poster is: \"Remember the Sabbath Day, to keep it holy.\" Trump rarely goes to church, and on this Easter Sunday he posted this decidedly non-holy screed on social media: \"HAPPY EASTER TO ALL, INCLUDING CROOKED AND CORRUPT PROSECUTORS AND JUDGES THAT ARE DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO INTERFERE WITH THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 2024, AND PUT ME IN PRISON, INCLUDING THOSE MANY PEOPLE THAT I COMPLETELY & TOTALLY DESPISE BECAUSE THEY WANT TO DESTROY AMERICA, A NOW FAILING NATION, LIKE 'DERANGED' JACK SMITH, WHO IS EVIL AND 'SICK.'\"\n\nThe \"Thou shalt not commit adultery\" line on the classroom poster will require a substantial asterisk, as Trump was recently convicted on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to cover up money paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels to keep her quiet about an alleged affair.\n\nTrump has a lengthy history of rumored dalliances that go along with his three marriages, and the infamous Access Hollywood tape, recorded a few months after he married his current wife, Melania, caught him commenting on a nearby actress: \"I've got to use some Tic Tacs, just in case I start kissing her. You know I'm automatically attracted to beautiful - I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait.\"\n\nNow Trump is apparently Jesus? Marjorie Taylor Greene compares Trump to Jesus. Which Bible is she reading?\n\nLouisiana students who look up from their desks and see \"Thou shalt not steal\" in large, easily readable font should certainly know that their governor's pick to be president of the United States was, in 2019, ordered to pay $2 million in damages for using money from his own charity to pay off business debts and buy a painting of himself. He has also been indicted for allegedly stealing classified documents, something thou should definitely not do.\n\nAnd then there's this foundational rule Landry and Louisiana's Republican lawmakers rightly believe all students, regardless of faith, apparently, should abide: \"Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.\"\n\nPut more succinctly: don't lie. If students of the Bayou State who gaze upon their government-mandated Ten Commandments poster are going to see that warning to \"not bear false witness,\" it is only fair that every remaining square inch of every classroom wall be devoted to detailing the multitudinous lies Trump told throughout his one-term presidency and the entire 2024 presidential campaign.\n\nThe ACLU has said it will sue the state of Louisiana over the Ten Commandments law, writing on social media: \"Public schools are not Sunday schools.\"\n\nThat's true. But I feel like we can avoid the courts if Louisiana simply abides by my idea of Trump-splaining to all students how often the avatar of the Republican Party violates those sacrosanct rules.\n\nEither that or each classroom should also have a poster-sized picture of Trump. That would likely cause the Ten Commandments posters to burst into flames.

Jeff Landry's Ten Commandments bill \"flagrantly\" unconstitutional on Wednesday, describing it as the \"perfect example of what the First Amendment prohibits.\"\n\nAsked by CNN host Kaitlan Collins whether Landry's bill requiring public schools to display the Ten Commandments in every classroom violated the First Amendment, Honig said:\n\nYes, flagrantly, in my view. If you wanted a perfect example of what the First Amendment prohibits, I think this is it.

Jeff Landry signed a bill, H.B. 71, on Wednesday requiring all public schools in the state to display a poster of the Ten Commandments in each classroom. The Commandments must be, per the text of the bill, in \"large, easily readable font,\" and they will be displayed at every level of schooling, including at public universities.\n\n\"If you want to respect the rule of law,\" Landry said recently, per National Review, \"you've got to start from the original law giver, which was Moses.\" Landry also said that he \"can't wait to be sued\" over this.\n\nLandry may be trying to garner a reputation as a culture war provocateur, but the governor could easily look around and figure out how the courts are likely to rule on this, since it's already been tried before.\n\nIn 1980, the Supreme Court overturned a similar statute in Stone v. Graham, ruling that the First Amendment bars displays of the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms. Such displays, the Court wrote, \"had no secular legislative purpose\" and were \"plainly religious in nature.\"\n\n\"The Commandments do not confine themselves to arguably secular matters, such as honoring one's parents, killing or murder, adultery, stealing, false witness, and covetousness,\" wrote the majority in that decision. \"Rather, the first part of the Commandments concerns the religious duties of believers: worshipping the Lord God alone, avoiding idolatry, not using the Lord's name in vain, and observing the Sabbath Day.\"\n\n\"This is not a case in which the Ten Commandments are integrated into the school curriculum, where the Bible may constitutionally be used in an appropriate study of history, civilization, ethics, comparative religion, or the like,\" wrote the Court. \"If the posted copies of the Ten Commandments are to have any effect at all, it will be to induce the schoolchildren to read, meditate upon, perhaps to venerate and obey, the Commandments. However desirable this might be as a matter of private devotion, it is not a permissible state objective under the Establishment Clause.\"\n\n\"Politicians have no business imposing their preferred religious doctrine on students and families in public schools,\" reads a statement issued jointly by groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, its Louisiana chapter, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the Freedom from Religion Foundation, that are suing over this law.\n\nBiden's lady issue: President Joe Biden's \"current standing among women is the weakest lead a Democrat has had since 2004, a key factor in how tight the race is,\" reports The New York Times, per recent polling data.\n\nFour years ago, when running for president, Biden's lead with women hovered at 13 percentage points. Now, it's more like eight percentage points, per polls conducted over the last six months. His lead with black and Hispanic women has dropped considerably since 2020.\n\nBiden \"is winning among Black women in the KFF survey by 58 percentage points, but that represents a significant drop from his 86 percentage point margin among Black women in the approach to the 2020 election, according to an average of New York Times/Siena College polls from that election,\" per the Times. Given how galvanized female voters tend to be by the abortion issue, there's some possibility he'll recover support over the next few months depending on what happens nationally with that issue.\n\nInterestingly, pollsters with KFF -- which focuses on polling related to health policy issues -- found that in states such as Arizona, with more restrictive abortion policies that may be voted on sooner, \"Democratic women were more motivated to vote than in states where abortion access was not at risk\" (per the Times); KFF found that Biden is performing worse with women in Michigan than in Arizona, possibly because Michigan already voted on an amendment which secured a constitutional right to abortion access two years ago, making it a less salient current-day issue.\n\n\"Many Michigan women see abortion as a settled issue in their state,\" reports KFF.\n\nScenes from New York: \"New York City's Rent Guidelines Board (RGB) voted to cut rents at rent-stabilized apartments yet again, although you might not know that from the press coverage,\" writes Reason's Christian Britschgi. \"Earlier this week, the RGB -- a city regulator responsible for setting maximum legal rent increases on the city's roughly one million rent-stabilized units -- voted to allow rent increases of 2.75 percent for one-year leases and 5.25 percent for two-year leases. Nominally, that is a rent increase. When compared against the year's 3.3 percent inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), that's a real decrease in rents.\"", "source": {"uri": "reason.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reason"}, "authors": [{"uri": "liz_wolfe@reason.com", "name": "Liz Wolfe", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Landry", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Landry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ten Commandments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Secularism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_v._Graham", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stone v.

14 inches (28cm by 35.5cm), with the commandments being the primary subject of the exhibit.\n\nAdditionally, the poster will be presented with a four-paragraph \"context statement\" that will detail the role of the commandments as a significant aspect of American public education for nearly three centuries.\n\nBy 2025, these posters are required to be displayed in all classrooms that receive state financial support, although the state will not provide any funds for the creation of these posters.\n\nNaija News reports that laws similar to this have been introduced in recent times by

The admonitions from God which serve as the basis of all Western, Judeo-Christian morality and law?\n\nThe Ten Commandments were ubiquitous within (and without) the confines of American education for hundreds of years, from before the nation's founding to practically five minutes ago. It was a Supreme Court decision in 1980 which invalidated a Kentucky Ten Commandments law as an \"establishment\" of religion.\n\nThat was Stone v. Graham, and in that case the Court's majority used something called the Lemon test, which was a formulation it had laid down in a prior case, Lemon v. Kurtzman. The Lemon test has three parts...\n\nIn Stone v. Graham, the Court found the Kentucky law lacked a legitimate secular purpose.\n\nWilliam Brennan wrote that opinion for the Supreme Court's majority. William Brennan was about as far-left a jurist as you could find in the 20th century, and he's responsible for a huge swath of the idiotic precedents the Court set in the 1960's and 1970's.\n\nThe current majority of the Supreme Court has very, very little resemblance to, and not quite much more respect for, the ideological positions espoused by Brennan.\n\nA case from two years ago, Kennedy v. Bremerton School District, involved a high school football coach in Washington State who took to midfield to pray after games. He got fired for his trouble and sued. According to the Lemon test, having school employees praying would be a violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. But the Court ruled that the Lemon test doesn't apply to an individual's conduct who might be a school employee.\n\nThis Ten Commandments bill might come off as a window-dressing cultural thing. But it's a bit more than that. Landry and the legislators aren't simply pandering to the Religious Right here, despite the fact that's how the bill and its signing have been portrayed in the legacy corporate media.\n\nThis is an attack on the Brennan Court. It's a frontal assault on Stone v. Graham and Brennan's ludicrous contention that the document which established the basis of our civilization's moral code has no secular purpose.\n\nThe guess is that out of John Roberts, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Brett Kavanaugh, Amy Coney Barrett and Neil Gorsuch we'd find five justices willing to throw Stone v. Graham out as nonsense.\n\nAnd if that's true, what this new law would do would be to help reset the relationship between the states, who are supposed to be sovereign under our constitution, and an obnoxious federal government dominated by busybody leftists who disparage the traditions the country is founded on.\n\nRemember, John Adams said our constitution is \"made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.\"\n\nDo you think Adams would object to the posting of the Ten Commandments in public classrooms?\n\nSo how can doing so be unconstitutional?\n\nThe Ten Commandments is not identified with any particular religious denomination. It applies in every Christian sect. It applies in Judaism. It even applies, a bit differently, in Islam. So how is it an establishment of a state religion to promote something which cuts across the vast majority of the religious tracks Americans follow?\n\nNews flash: it isn't. The only way you get there is if you hate religion as a whole.\n\nAnd that brings us to the American Civil Liberties Union...\n\nThis is an outfit which actively defends government censorship as constitutional but won't allow the precise sort of instruction the framers of the constitution envisioned in our schools.\n\nWhere is the credibility?\n\nAttorney General Liz Murrill is not afraid of the ACLU.\n\nThis is a good fight for the state to take on, because if this new law ends up breaking down the Brennan interpretation of the Lemon test, it could open a flood of items bringing traditional morality and the basic elements of Judeo-Christian teachings back into our schools.\n\nNobody seriously argues that moral instruction in those schools has improved since God was banned from the classroom. Instead what you get is name-calling, essentially that religious people are intolerant bigots and that it's a threat to various groups that they might gain some influence in those schools.\n\nBut the results are absurd. School districts are firing football coaches for praying on the field at halftime while those districts are dealing with scandal after scandal surrounding grooming and sexual abuse of kids in their care.\n\nIt's entirely reasonable for a state legislature and governor to turn to the most ecumenical moral document available in an effort to recenter its educational system. It's also entirely reasonable that the legislature and governor in question would have the power to do so.\n\nDon't dismiss the Ten Commandments bill as window dressing. This is a real fight about big things, and it's important to appreciate the historical and constitutional context this belongs in.", "source": {"uri": "thehayride.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hayride"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_v._Graham", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stone v.

Governor Jeff Landry signed related legislation on Wednesday (local time). According to media reports, Louisiana is the only state in the United States with such a regulation. The Republican-controlled state is located in what is known as the \"Bible Belt\" in the southern United States.\n\nAccording to the law's proponents, the Ten Commandments are the \"foundational documents\" for the conduct of government in the United States. If you want to respect law and order, you have to start with the \"original law\" that the biblical prophet Moses received from God, Landry said Wednesday, according to CNN. Citizens' associations intend to challenge the law in court. It violates the principle of separation of church and state and is \"flagrantly unconstitutional,\" according to the United States for Separation of Church and State.\n\nThe controversy over the separation of church and state is a long-standing socio-political issue in the United States. Decades ago, the Supreme Court ruled against Bible reading and organized prayer in public schools. However, there are now signs of change: in recent years, the Supreme Court has spoken out in favor of weakening the separation of church and state.\n\nIn June 2022, a state high school football coach could pray on the field with his players, a judge ruled. The Constitution protects the religious freedom of sports teachers. \u25a0", "source": {"uri": "thewestonforum.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aspetuck News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jordan_lambert@thewestonforum.com", "name": "Jordan Lambert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Landry", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Landry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ten Commandments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_church_and_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Separation of church and state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hanging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bible"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_Belt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bible Belt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prophet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_prayer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "School prayer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society", "label": "dmoz/Society", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Church-State_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Church-State Relations", "wgt": 38}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Simulations", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Simulations", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://berliner-zeitung.imgix.net/2024/06/20/44e73224-4c45-4995-bcce-26b69f1f6678.jpeg?w=1024&auto=format", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666431", "eventUri": "eng-9666431", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

Jeff Landry about the Ten Commandments. On Saturday, he told attendees at a Republican fund-raiser, \"I can't wait to be sued.\" Clearly, he knows that the Supreme Court has previously ruled against mandatory displays of the Ten Commandments in the classroom. In a 1980 case called Stone v. Graham, the Supreme Court struck down a Kentucky law that required the posting of the Ten Commandments, purchased through private donations, in every classroom in the state.\n\nLouisiana's law defies this precedent, so, yes, the state will be sued.\n\nBut Landry's comments didn't stop with bravado. He also said something else interesting. \"If you want to respect the rule of law,\" he told the guests, \"you've got to start from the original law giver, which was Moses.\" To teach respect for the rule of law he's defying the Supreme Court? That's an interesting message to send to students.\n\nIt's consistent with an emerging Republican approach to Constitutional law. Just as many Republicans view their constituency as composed of the \"real Americans,\" they tend to believe their interpretation of the Constitution represents the \"real Constitution.\" So we're seeing a flurry of culture war-motivated state laws, many of them aimed at the First Amendment, that confront existing precedent.\n\nThe Dobbs decision gave some Republicans hope for radical change, but reversing Roe has not signaled open season on the court's previous rulings. Republicans' challenges to the Voting Rights Act failed, the independent state legislature theory foundered, and efforts to expand the standing doctrine to limit access to the abortion pill faltered. Even so, it's premature to declare that the Supreme Court is frustrating the MAGA right.\n\nAltering Constitutional law is not the only motivation here; a version of Christian mysticism is also in play. There is a real belief that the Ten Commandments have a form of spiritual power over the hearts and minds of students, and that posting the displays can change their lives.\n\nI'm an evangelical Christian who believes in God and the divine inspiration of scripture, but I do not believe that documents radiate powers of personal virtue. I happened to grow up in Kentucky and went to classes before the Ten Commandments were ordered removed, and I can testify firsthand that the displays had no impact on our lives.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana has already said it will file a lawsuit in opposition to the Ten Commandment law and said it is in direct conflict with state law and violates the precedent set by the Supreme Court in the 1980 case Stone v. Graham. The court said in that case that the Ten Commandments \"had no secular legislative purpose\" and are \"plainly religious in nature,\" striking down a Kentucky law that would have required the text be posted in every classroom. The ACLU has also said that public school chaplain programs are dangerous policies that force religion upon students in what are meant to be secular spaces.\n\n\"The problem, of course, is that sometimes the legitimate reason of cultural literacy is used as a smokescreen to hide religious and ideological agendas,\" Mark Chancey, a religious studies professor at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, told The 74 of teaching religion in public school.\n\nThe Satanic Temple has said it will start providing classes for public school students in Oklahoma under the new religious instruction law. The organization has put out a sign up sheet for what it calls its Hellion Academy of Independent Learning, or HAIL, and spokesperson Lucien Greaves told a local news station the group has worked with educators to build curriculums. \"The Satanic Temple believes that public schools should be entirely free from religious influence,\" the group said. \"Nevertheless, if other religious groups insist on forcing their way into our schools through legislation, we will ensure our members' children enjoy the same opportunities as those of other religious backgrounds\"\n\nThe Supreme Court has ruled on the issue of separation of church and state several times, most notably in Engle v. Vitale in 1962, in which it ruled school-sponsored prayer is a violation of the First Amendment. Lawsuits have long challenged the use of \"In God We Trust\" on government buildings, schools and other uses -- like on currency -- but the Supreme Court declined to hear a case on the issue in 2019.\n\nNebraska is the latest state to propose school credit for religious classes attended outside of school, and legislators have proposed several other bills that mix religion with public education. State Sen. Loren Lippincott, the Republican who proposed the school credit bill, said getting a religious education will help students \"develop a stronger sense of morality,\" the Associated Press reported.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ten Commandments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American Civil Liberties Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_church_and_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Separation of church and state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bible"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secularity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_v._Graham", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stone v.

Sydell Stone, among others, sued, and James B. Graham, the state's superintendent of education, was named as the respondent. A trial court upheld the statute, ruling that its purpose was secular. The case then went to the Kentucky Supreme Court, which was divided, thereby leaving the lower court's ruling in place.\n\nIn 1980 the case was argued before the U.S. Supreme Court. In a per curiam (unsigned) opinion, it used the so-called Lemon test to evaluate whether the statute was permissible under the establishment clause. In Lemon v. Kurtzman (1971), the Supreme Court held that (a) a \"statute must have a secular legislative purpose\"; (b) \"its principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion\"; and (c) the statute cannot promote \"an excessive government entanglement with religion.\" If any of the points are violated, the statute must be ruled unconstitutional.\n\nThe Supreme Court held that the Kentucky statute violated the first part of the so-called Lemon test. The court rejected arguments that the notation on the bottom of the Ten Commandments was sufficient to indicate the secular purpose of the posting. Moreover, the court was of the opinion that the posting of the Ten Commandments was clearly religious and not educational. The Commandments were not part of the curriculum, and the court maintained that the state was instead encouraging students \"to read, meditate upon, and perhaps venerate and obey\" the Commandments, which is a violation of the establishment clause. The court considered it to be irrelevant that the copies were bought with private funds, because displaying the Commandments demonstrated official state support of their message.\n\nMalila N. Robinson\n\nLouisiana's law will not stand. I don't think the legislators involved expected it to stand when they passed it. It's meant to be a lightening rod and some sort of \"knee jerk issue\" issue.", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_v._Graham", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stone v.

Here's The Other Danger With That Law", "body": "Louisiana just passed a law to require classrooms to display the Ten Commandments, and critics have already raised the alarm about the violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. Civil Liberties groups are already challenging the law.\n\nMany critics have pointed out the irony of a legislature that has worked hard to end indoctrination in classroom seems intent on installing some indoctrination of their own.\n\nBut there's another troubling layer to this that highlights the danger of eliminating the wall between church and state.\n\nWhen you mix religion and politics, the old saw goes, you get politics.\n\nWriting for CNN, Eli Federman argues that by putting the Ten Commandments on an equal footing with such documents as the Mayflower Compact secularizes the commandments. The law \"harms religion by undermining the commandments' sanctity.\"\n\nThe law attempts to argue that the Ten Commandments are a crucial and foundational part of United States history, and critics are rightly concerned that the history taught to students may be altered to make the decalogue fit.\n\nBut as Federman suggests, there is danger to the religious side of the issue as well, even beyond treating holy scripture as just one more secular text.\n\nThe Old Testament provides three distinct versions of the commandments. But the law lays out exactly what version of the Ten Commandments is to appear in each classroom.\n\nThe law, for instance, includes the commandment not to make any graven images, but omits the scriptural warning against bowing down to such images because God is a jealous deity, \"visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me\" (Exodus 20:4-6, KJV). The law's version says only to keep the sabbath holy, omitting that one must do so neither you nor any member of your household should do any work (Exodus 20:8-11, KJV).\n\nThe law also ignores a variety of translations and sticks close to King James, not necessarily the most accurate. (For example, many scholars agree that a better translation is \"Thou shalt not murder.\")\n\nWhat students in Louisiana will get is the Louisiana legislature version of holy scripture. While the rewrite is not radical, it sets a troubling precedent. Should we welcome legislators editing anyone's scripture?\n\nIf you're thinking that this was already settled, it was. The Supreme Court struck down a similar law in Kentucky in 1980. But this time, proponents may expect a different result, citing a new set of precedents in the law itself.\n\nThe Supreme Court has changed since 1980, but so have many of the players in these issues. In addition to the lawsuits, expect other religious groups to insist their own scripture be represented. Expect the Satanic Temple to demand a piece of the action.\n\nLegislators may claim they can solve the problem, like Governor Ron DeSantis, by simply refusing to recognize some groups as legitimate religions.\n\nThat's not a solution, but an invitation to greater problems. Do we want a government department to decide which religions are \"real\"? Do we want legislators rewriting scriptural text to suit the political imperatives of the day?\n\nEvery attempt to push a particular religion into classrooms creates the same problem -- whose religion gets pushed, and who decides how to push it?", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ten Commandments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayflower_Compact", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayflower Compact"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_James_Version", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "King James Version"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Establishment_Clause", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Establishment Clause"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_text", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Religious text"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Legislature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabbath", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sabbath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idolatry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Idolatry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "History of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secularism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Satanic_Temple", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Satanic Temple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_DeSantis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ron DeSantis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Precedent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Religious_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Religious Studies", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Noahidism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Noahidism", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66747b705c6a3350e0767d25/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666431", "eventUri": "eng-9666431", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 117, "relevance": 1}

So Excited At Chance To Bully Non-Christian Schoolchildren!", "body": "Louisiana has become the first state in the United States to pass a law requiring every public school to post giant posters of the Ten Commandments (Protestant version) in every classroom.\n\nThis is the kind of thing that everyone knew was very obviously illegal prior to the Supreme Court deciding in 2022's Kennedy v. Bremerton School District that a public high school football coach praying with students on the 50-yard-line was permissible, and that the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment is largely decorative. Since then, Christian Nationalists have been very excited to start forcing their religion on schoolchildren everywhere.\n\nIt is a very exciting moment for Good Christians out there who haven't had the opportunity to bully any kids for not being Christian, or even the right kind of Christian, since they were in elementary school themselves -- new Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry most of all.\n\nPrior to signing the bill on Wednesday, Landry actually told attendees at a Republican fundraiser, \"I can't wait to be sued.\"\n\nThis is likely because he's excited to see it go to the Supreme Court so that they can give the official okay on forcing religion on schoolchildren, but let's be clear on what it is that he \"can't wait\" for.\n\nHe can't wait for kids who are not Christian to feel uncomfortable and unwelcome in public schools -- public schools that their parents pay taxes to support. He can't wait for a child to feel ostracized to the point that their parents have to call in the ACLU or other lawyers to help them, and then have to spend months, possibly years, of their lives fighting his stupid law in court.\n\nGiven that Landry signed this bill this week, that he signed another barring children from learning that racism exists in May, and that he is expected to sign another soon that will bar discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity, the only kids who are going to feel comfortable and welcomed in Louisiana public schools will be the children of white Christian racists (so long as those children are not gay or trans).\n\nI fully admit, I do not see the appeal!\n\nWith all of the talk of \"parental rights\" that has suddenly popped up lately with regard to teaching children about sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity, it's weird that people would not consider it any kind of violation of said \"parental rights\" to use their tax money to proselytize to their children. Do parents not have the right to raise their children in the religion they want or with no religion at all?\n\nNow, some people have tried to make a \"secular\" argument for putting these posters up, insisting that it is reasonable to put the Ten Commandments in classrooms because \"it is the basis for our laws.\"\n\nLet's check that, shall we? This is the version of the Ten Commandments that will be placed in Louisiana schools:\n\nSo no killing, no stealing. Why not just put up a sign saying \"Hey kids, don't kill each other or steal anything!\" Why does it have to be about God and taking the Lord's name in vain and and not belonging to other religions?\n\nHere's what I find pretty interesting -- Louisiana has a pretty significant Catholic population for a Southern state, at about 22 percent. Very large portions of New Orleans and the southern part of the state are Catholic, but this law specifically requires that schools post a specific version of the Ten Commandments taught in most Protestant denominations (apart from Lutherans). Why does this matter? Because \"graven images!\"\n\nThe Protestant version that will be used by the state makes the Second Commandment about not making any graven images and just one commandment about coveting instead of separating out neighbors' wives and asses. The versions used by Catholics, Lutherans, and other denominations do not have a specific \"graven images\" commandment and have two separate commandments about coveting.\n\nWhy? Well, according to the Catholic Answers site, \"Calvin and other Reformers, relying more on Exodus 20 and its presentation of the Decalogue, and wanting to make a strike against the statuary and icons in the Catholic Church, enumerated the commandments in a different way.\"\n\nIn other words, they were kiiiiiiind of taking a shot at Catholics and their pretty statues and paintings. Now, sure, you can say \"but that was a long time ago and no one thinks about it like that anymore\" -- but I know a whole lot of people who were raised evangelical who grew up hearing/believing that Catholics secretly worshiped Satan and that the Pope was the antichrist.\n\nDonate Just Once!\n\nThis is one reason (of many) why the very first Amendment (not Commandment) bars the state from establishing a religion. Because it's not just about Christians vs. Non-Christians, it's also about Christians vs. Other Christians. How do they decide which denomination to go by or whose Commandments to follow?

In a statement of intent, King said the proposal became \"legally feasible\" after the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 overturned the so-called \"Lemon test,\" which was used to determine whether a law violated the First Amendment's establishment clause that generally separates church and state.\n\nThe high court's opinion \"instead provided a test of whether a governmental display of religious content comports with America's history and tradition,\" King wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPatrick blamed House Speaker Dade Phelan of Beaumont, a fellow Republican, for the bill's demise, arguing that he killed it \"because the Democrats who put him in power opposed it.\"\n\n\"Every Texas Republican House member would have voted for it,\" Patrick wrote. \"But, SPEAKER Dade Phelan killed the bill by letting it languish in committee for a month assuring it would never have time for a vote on the floor. This was inexcusable and unacceptable. Putting the Ten Commandments back into our schools was obviously not a priority for Dade Phelan.\"\n\nPhelan's office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhelan and Patrick have clashed over a number of legislative priorities since Phelan became leader of the House in 2021. The rift widened when Patrick endorsed and campaigned for Phelan's primary opponent, David Covey, earlier this year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhelan narrowly defeated Covey in the May primary runoff.\n\nUnder Patrick's leadership, Senate Republicans have advanced legislation requiring schools to hang donated \"In God We Trust\" posters in classrooms, which became law in 2021, and to provide time for students and school employees to pray and read the Bible or other religious text, which stalled last year in the House.\n\nPatrick, who presides over the Senate, has said bringing the Ten Commandments and prayer to public schools will allow students to become better Texans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpponents say state-mandated displays infringe on the religious freedom of students.\n\n\"State politicians are trying to indoctrinate young Texans with government-imposed religion,\" said Caro Achar, engagement coordinator for free speech at the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas. \"How or whether we practice religion is up to us, not the government.\"\n\nRelated StoriesView MoreEditorial cartoon: Paxton and Patrick fight PhelanEffort to legalize casinos looks like a long shot for Texas lawmakers in 2025", "source": {"uri": "dallasnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Dallas Morning News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_King_(Texas_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phil King (Texas politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ten Commandments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dade_Phelan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dade Phelan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Patrick_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dan Patrick (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_Governor_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lieutenant Governor of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_North_Texas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of North Texas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemon_v._Kurtzman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lemon v.

First Amendment? Feh!\n\n\u00d7 Expand\n\nCarolyn Kaster/AP Photo\n\nWorkers repaint a Ten Commandments billboard off Interstate 71 near Chenoweth, Ohio, on Election Day, November 7, 2023.\n\nYesterday, the state of Louisiana went where Christian nationalists have longed to go, and where the First Amendment says it shouldn't. Its MAGA governor signed into law a bill passed by its MAGA legislature requiring all public schools (including public colleges and universities) to post the Ten Commandments in every classroom. It stipulates that these wall hangings be no smaller than 11 by 14 inches and that the text be \"in a large, easily readable font.\"\n\nJust in case the courts notice that this runs afoul of the Constitution, the new law included a rather perfunctory argument that the Commandments were also a historical document -- \"a prominent part of American public education for nearly three centuries.\" By that standard, of course, the state might also mandate displaying the Declaration of Independence and the Pythagorean theorem, but no such legislation has been forthcoming.\n\nMore from Harold Meyerson\n\nThat said, the legislators and governor didn't really intend the Commandments to be seen as documenting past educational practices. They passed the law, said state Rep. Dodie Horton, its author, so that \"our children [can] look up and see what God says is right and what He says is wrong.\"\n\nCommandments two through ten do provide such instruction; but number one, let's face it, is really more a statement of the divinity's identity: \"I am the Lord thy God; thou shalt have no other gods before me.\" There are, of course, tens of millions of Americans who don't actually believe that the god depicted in the Book of Exodus is their god, or that such gods actually exist.\n\nThat said, if the purpose of posting the Commandments is to inculcate sound behavior in the young, and if the hurdle such posting must clear is that these lessons are parts of our national heritage that were once widely celebrated, if not universally adhered to, I can think of other documents that might merit similar posting.\n\nConsider, for instance, the lyrics of a 1920s song that became a nationwide hit and provided young Americans with valuable life lessons, many of which still offer sound counsel today. Here are the first two stanzas:\n\nButton up your overcoat,\n\nWhen the wind is free,\n\nTake good care of yourself,\n\nYou belong to me!\n\n--\n\nEat an apple every day,\n\nGet to bed by three,\n\nOh, take good care of yourself,\n\nYou belong to me!\n\n(The \"You belong to me\" line, I acknowledge, isn't really a lesson as such, but might be analogous to that first Commandment, \"I am the Lord thy God\" etc.)\n\nIn its subsequent stanzas, the song actually enumerates more than ten discrete pieces of advice, culminating in:\n\nKeep away from bootleg hooch\n\nWhen you're on a spree,\n\nTake good care of yourself,\n\nYou belong to me!\n\nThe song was made famous by singer Helen Kane, who was the inspiration for the cartoon character Betty Boop. It was written by the very successful '20s songwriting team of DeSylva, Henderson, and Brown, so here, too, orthodox Christians should be happy to learn, the creator had a trinitarian identity.",

Jeff Landry, saying it would unconstitutionally breach protections against government-imposed religion. \"We're going to be seeing Gov. Landry in court,\"said Rachel Laser, the president and CEO of Americans United for Separation of Church and State.\n\nState officials are stressing the history of the Ten Commandments, which the bill calls \"foundational documents of our state and national government.\"\n\nSimilar bills requiring the Ten Commandments be displayed in classrooms have been proposed in other statehouses -- including Texas, Oklahoma and Utah.\n\nReasonable and needed or unconstitutional and harmful?\n\nAt Archbishop Shaw High School, a Catholic-run school in suburban New Orleans, the head of school, Father Steve Ryan, said he was pleased that the Ten Commandments will be posted on public school walls.\n\n\"These laws, which are part of the Judeo-Christian tradition, are good safeguards for society. They are actually reasonable,\" Ryan said.\n\nIn Baton Rouge, Attorney General Liz Murrill, a Republican ally of Landry, said she was looking forward to defending the law.\n\n\"The 10 Commandments are pretty simple (don't kill, steal, cheat on your wife), but they also are important to our country's foundations,\" she said on social media.\n\nOpponents of the law argued that eroding the constitutional barrier between religion and government is illegal and unfair.\n\n\"We're worried about public school families and students in Louisiana,\" Laser said. \"They come from a variety of different traditions and backgrounds, different religious beliefs, nonreligious beliefs and students in those classrooms will be made to feel like outsiders when they see the government endorsing one set of narrow religious beliefs over others.\"\n\nLouisiana's 2020 teacher of the year, Chris Dier, echoed those fears, and said he doesn't intend to post the Ten Commandments in his classroom.\n\n\"I don't believe in doing something that is unconstitutional and harmful to students,\" he said. It is unclear whether there is a punishment for refusing to comply with the mandate.\n\nThe law was praised by former Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore, who was removed from office in 2003 after disobeying a federal judge's order to remove a 5,280-pound (2.4 metric tonne) granite Ten Commandments display from the state court building.\n\n\"Nobody can make you believe in God. Government can't tell you that, but it must acknowledge the God upon which this nation is founded,\" Moore said.\n\nFeatured Local SavingsEarlier Ten Commandments controversies\n\nIn 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says Congress can \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\" The high court found that the law had no secular purpose but rather served a plainly religious purpose.\n\nIn its most recent rulings on Ten Commandments displays, the Supreme Court held in 2005 that such displays in a pair of Kentucky courthouses violated the Constitution. At the same time, the court upheld a Ten Commandments marker on the grounds of the Texas state Capitol in Austin. Those were 5-4 decisions but the court's makeup has changed, with a 6-3 conservative majority now.\n\nThe main differences in the two cases -- at least according to the one swing vote, then-Justice Stephen Breyer -- was that the Kentucky counties' officials demonstrated an unmistakable track record of religious motives in the posting, whereas the motives behind the Texas display were more on the \"borderline\" between religious and secular. Plus, Breyer said, the Texas monument had passed a test of time, standing among other monuments for decades without legal challenge.\n\nOther religion-government fights\n\nAfter he was removed as chief justice of Alabama Supreme Court in 2003 for his refusal to remove the Ten Commandments monument, Moore was elected to the post again, but was suspended from the bench in 2016 after a judicial discipline panel ruled he had urged probate judges to refuse marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Moore disputed the accusation.\n\nVoters approved an amendment to the Alabama Constitution in 2018 saying schools and public buildings can display the Ten Commandments as long as it is done in a way that \"complies with constitutional requirements,\" such as being intermingled with historical documents.\n\nLouisiana has had a prominent role in the church-state legal fight before. In 1987, the Supreme Court struck down a 1981 Louisiana statute that required instruction on evolution to be accompanied by teaching on \"creation science.\" The court found that the statute had no identifiable secular purpose and the \"pre-eminent purpose of the Louisiana Legislature was clearly to advance the religious viewpoint that a supernatural being created humankind.\"\n\nMississippi has mandated the display of \"In God We Trust\" in schools since 2001. Louisiana passed a similar mandate that became law last year.\n\nThe latest pushes to post the Ten Commandments follow a major victory for the religious right in 2022: The Supreme Court ruled that a high school football coach in the state of Washington who knelt and prayed on the field after games was protected by the Constitution.\n\nHow the Ten Commandments are viewed\n\nJews and Christians regard the Ten Commandments as having been given by God to Moses, according to biblical accounts, on Mount Sinai. Not every Christian tradition uses the same Ten Commandments. The order varies as does the phrasing, depending on which Bible translation is used. The Ten Commandments in the signed Louisiana legislation are listed in an order common among some Protestant and Orthodox traditions.\n\nDisputes over the law likely won't just be about whether the commandments should be mandated on school room walls, but also which version, said James Hudnut-Beumler, a professor of American religious history at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\n\"The Ten Commandments always look universal until you put a shortened list up on the wall and discover that there's room for dispute.\"\n\nCline reported from Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

(AP) -- As New England baked in a heat wave Thursday, guests at one campground were keeping their food and beer cold with blocks of ice harvested months earlier from a frozen lake.\n\nAnd while some relief is expected in the eastern Great Lakes region and New England starting Friday, the National Weather Service said scorching temperatures will linger across the Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic region, and even rise in places, including California and Arizona, where they could eclipse 100 degrees (nearly 38 degrees Celsius).\n\nOn Squam Lake in central New Hampshire, ice blocks about the size of microwaves that had been packed in sawdust since winter were lifted from an insulated storage hut. It's been a tradition at the rustic Rockywold Deephaven Camps for more than a century, keeping fresh ice available throughout the summer and into the fall.\n\nAngela Wilcox, who has vacationed at the camp for 16 years, took her children and nephews boating Thursday in search of the lake's coldest swimming spot.\n\n\"This is the hottest it's ever been, especially in June,\" Wilcox said. \"We're kind of shocked.\"\n\nNew Louisiana law requiring classrooms to display Ten Commandments churns old political conflicts\n\nNEW ORLEANS (AP) -- A bill signed into law this week makes Louisiana the only state to require that the Ten Commandments be displayed in every classroom in public schools and colleges -- and stirs the long-running debate over the role of religion in government institutions.\n\nUnder the new law, all public K-12 classrooms and state-funded universities will be required to display a poster-sized display of the Ten Commandments in \"large, easily readable font\" next year.\n\nCivil liberties groups planned lawsuits to block the law signed by Republican Gov.

They gazed upon a sea of balloon-toting children. They reviewed a military parade and eyed a crowd waving pompoms. They saw -- but were not shown interacting with -- groups of North Korean citizens, who if the past is any indication were meticulously vetted before getting anywhere near the scene.\n\nThose images were vivid and plentiful, but they represented the predictable output of an experienced propaganda apparatus.\n\nFar more striking were the in-between moments that managed to peek through -- also calibrated carefully, but revealing a smidgen more about the North and its leader than most imagery does. From stills and videos made by both Russian and North Korean state media operations (independent journalists were not given access to cover Putin's visit), the images were many and varied.\n\nUS will redirect air defense inceptor missiles to Ukraine that other allies had on order\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House announced Thursday that it will rush delivery of air defense interceptor missiles to Ukraine by redirecting planned shipments to other allied nations, as Washington scrambles to counter increased Russian attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure.\n\nNational security spokesman John Kirby said the U.S. had taken the \"difficult but necessary decision to reprioritize near-term planned deliveries of foreign military sales to other countries,\" though he wouldn't say which nations would be affected or how many.\n\n\"Right now, we know that Ukraine urgently needs these additional capabilities,\" Kirby said on a call with reporters, adding, \"Obviously more is needed, and it's needed now.\"\n\nThe announcement comes after President Joe Biden, during last week's Group of Seven meeting in Italy, suggested such action might be necessary, saying, \"We've let it be known for those countries that are expecting, from us, air defense systems in the future, that they're going to have to wait.\"\n\n\"Everything we have is going to go to Ukraine until their needs are met,\" Biden said. \"And then we will make good on the commitments we made to other countries.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court upholds a tax on foreign income over a challenge backed by business interests\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld a tax on foreign income over a challenge backed by business and anti-regulatory interests, declining their invitation to weigh in on a broader, never-enacted tax on wealth.\n\nThe justices, by a 7-2 vote, left in place a provision of a 2017 tax law that is expected to generate $340 billion, mainly from the foreign subsidiaries of domestic corporations that parked money abroad to shield it from U.S. taxes.\n\nThe law, passed by a Republican Congress and signed by then-President Donald Trump, includes a provision that applies to companies that are owned by Americans but do their business in foreign countries. It imposes a one-time tax on investors' shares of profits that have not been passed along to them, to offset other tax benefits.\n\nBut the larger significance of the ruling is what it didn't do. The case attracted outsize attention because some groups allied with the Washington couple who brought the case argued that the challenged provision is similar to a wealth tax, which would apply not to the incomes of the very richest Americans but to their assets, like stock holdings. Such assets now get taxed only when they are sold.\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh wrote in his majority opinion that \"nothing in this opinion should be read to authorize any hypothetical congressional effort to tax both an entity and its shareholders or partners on the same undistributed income realized by the entity.\"\n\nDonald Sutherland, the towering actor whose career spanned 'M.A.S.H.' to 'Hunger Games,' dies at 88\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Donald Sutherland, the Canadian actor whose wry, arrestingly off-kilter screen presence spanned more than half a century of films from \"M.A.S.H.\" to \"The Hunger Games,\" has died. He was 88.\n\nSutherland died Thursday in Miami after a long illness, according to a statement from Creative Artists Agency, which represented him.\n\nKiefer Sutherland said on X he believed his father was one of the most important actors in the history of film: \"Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly. He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that.\"\n\nThe tall and gaunt Sutherland, who flashed a grin that could be sweet or diabolical, was known for offbeat characters like Hawkeye Pierce in Robert Altman's \"M.A.S.H.,\" the hippie tank commander in \"Kelly's Heroes\" and the stoned professor in \"Animal House.\"\n\n\"Donald was a giant, not only physically but as a talent,\" Sutherland's \"M.A.S.H.\" co-star Elliott Gould said in a statement to The Associated Press as many paid tribute. \"He was also enormously kind and generous.\"\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. fails to qualify for CNN's debate. It'll be a showdown between Biden and Trump\n\nCOLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has failed to qualify for next week's debate in Atlanta, according to host network CNN, falling shy of benchmarks both for state ballot qualification and necessary polling.\n\nThe missed markers mean that the June 27 showdown will be solely between Democratic President Joe Biden and presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. That denies Kennedy a singular opportunity to stand alongside the leading candidates in an attempt to lend legitimacy to his longshot bid and convince potential supporters that he has a shot at winning.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, Kennedy called his exclusion from the debate \"undemocratic, un-American, and cowardly.\"\n\nBoth the Biden and Trump campaigns fear that Kennedy could play spoiler in what's anticipated to be a close general election.\n\nAccording to the criteria set out by CNN, candidates would be invited to participate in the debate if they had secured a place on the ballot in states totaling at least 270 votes in the Electoral College, the minimum needed to win the presidency.\n\nSouth Korea will consider supplying arms to Ukraine after Russia and North Korea sign strategic pact\n\nSEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Korea said Thursday that it would consider sending arms to Ukraine, a major policy change that was suggested after Russia and North Korea rattled the region and beyond by signing a pact to come to each other's defense in the event of war.\n\nThe comments from a senior presidential official came hours after North Korea's state media released the details of the agreement, which observers said could mark the strongest connection between Moscow and Pyongyang since the end of the Cold War. It comes at a time when Russia faces growing isolation over the war in Ukraine and both countries face escalating standoffs with the West.\n\nAccording to the text of the deal published by North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency, or KCNA, if either country gets invaded and is pushed into a state of war, the other must deploy \"all means at its disposal without delay\" to provide \"military and other assistance.\" But the agreement also says that such actions must be in accordance with the laws of both countries and Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, which recognizes a U.N. member state's right to self-defense.\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed the pact at a summit Wednesday in Pyongyang. Both described it as a major upgrade of bilateral relations, covering security, trade, investment, cultural and humanitarian ties.\n\nThe office of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol issued a statement condemning the agreement, calling it a threat to his country's security and a violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions, and warned that it would have negative consequences on Seoul's relations with Moscow.\n\nA US veteran died at a nursing home, abandoned. Hundreds of strangers came to say goodbye\n\nAUGUSTA, Maine (AP) -- Former U.S. Marine Gerry Brooks died alone at a nursing home in Maine, abandoned and all but forgotten. Then the funeral home posted a notice asking if anyone would serve as a pallbearer or simply attend his burial.\n\nWithin minutes, it was turning away volunteers to carry his casket.\n\nA bagpiper came forward to play at the service. A pilot offered to perform a flyover. Military groups across the state pledged a proper sendoff.\n\nHundreds of people who knew nothing about the 86-year-old beyond his name showed up on a sweltering afternoon and gave Brooks a final salute with full military honors Thursday at the Maine Veterans' Memorial Cemetery in Augusta.\n\nPatriot Guard Riders on motorcycles escorted his hearse on the 40-mile route from the funeral home in Belfast, Maine, to the cemetery. Members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars paid tribute with a 21-gun salute. Volunteers held American flags next to the casket while a crane hoisted a huge flag above the cemetery entrance.\n\nThe Lakers are hiring JJ Redick as their new head coach, an AP source says\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) -- JJ Redick is being hired as the head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers, a person with knowledge of the decision tells The Associated Press.\n\nThe person spoke on condition of anonymity Thursday because the Lakers hadn't yet publicly announced the decision to hire the former guard for his first coaching job.\n\nThe 39-year-old Redick is an extraordinary choice by the Lakers, who hired a 15-year veteran with absolutely no coaching experience to lead a franchise with 17 NBA titles, one of the biggest brand names in world sports -- and LeBron James, the top scorer in league history.\n\nRedick was a proficient outside shooter for six teams before his retirement in September 2021, when he moved into a career in broadcasting and podcasting. He joined ESPN's lead commentary team earlier this year.\n\nESPN first reported the decision.", "source": {"uri": "hjnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Jeff Landry (R) Wednesday is the first one of its kind in the country since 1980, when a more moderate Supreme Court ruled a similar Kentucky law unconstitutional. The new law gives schools until Jan. 1 to display the Ten Commandments on \"a poster or framed document that is at least eleven inches by fourteen inches\" in every classroom. The commandments have to be the display's \"central focus\" and be \"printed in a large, easily readable font,\" the law says.\n\nOn Thursday, as legal experts debated how courts would see the Louisiana law, various religious leaders in the state voiced excitement and worry about what the Ten Commandments measure portends.\n\nLawyers from the Freedom From Religion Foundation, Americans United for the Separation of Church and State, and the ACLU said they planned to file a lawsuit next week against the new law.\n\n\"It's true this Supreme Court hasn't been the best on church-state issues but we think this will be a bridge too far. Nothing they have said remotely suggests they would allow Ten Commandments in every classroom, where students are a captive audience and required to attend,\" said Heather Weaver, staff attorney with the ACLU's Program on Freedom of Religion and Belief.\n\nSome outside experts on church-state law sounded less sure.\n\n\"Now we are in somewhat uncharted territory,\" said Michael Helfand, a professor focused on religion and ethics at Pepperdine University's law school.\n\nEfforts to infuse religion into government entities, including public schools, have increased in the past decade as the high court has sided with those who want fewer restrictions on religion. State lawmakers, particularly in conservative areas, have put forward hundreds of bills aimed at adding everything from public school chaplains and \"In God We Trust\" signs in school entranceways to public funding for religious schools through vouchers.\n\nThe Louisiana law is part of a new crop of measures stemming from a 2022 Supreme Court ruling in favor of a high school football coach whose contract was not renewed because of his postgame prayers at the 50-yard line. The ruling in Kennedy v. Bremerton School District threw out the test used for more than 50 years to decide whether a law violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.\n\nThe Lemon test, named after a 1971 Supreme Court ruling, asked questions like: Does the law cause \"excessive government entanglement with religion?\" or \"Does the law advance or inhibit religion?\" In the football coach case, the Supreme Court said that the Lemon test is no longer good law and that instead judges should look at \"history and tradition.\"\n\nNoting that the Bremerton ruling deemed the coach's actions constitutional, the ACLU's Weaver said reasoning differs from the Louisiana law because the court said his prayers weren't \"public\" or delivered to a \"captive\" audience.\n\n\"Regardless of the Lemon test, there has always in this country been an understanding the government can't favor one denomination or one religion over others. Here, not only is the state mandating the Ten Commandments, but the statute even says which version, and lays out the text,\" Weaver said.\n\nThe law calls for a particular Protestant text based on the King James Bible, which differs from versions used by Catholics, Jews and others, much less those used by other religions with their own faith texts.\n\nAnnie Laurie Gaylor, co-president of Freedom From Religion, said the new law is \"overreaching.\"\n\n\"The religious right, Christian Nationalist types and their legal outfits have been crowing since the Bremerton decision that somehow all the precedent against religion in public schools has been overturned. This is not the case,\" she said. \"The Supreme Court has been captured under Trump but my hope is it's not ready to go that far.\"\n\n\"There is no history of the Ten Commandments in our founding, in the Constitution, even though a lot of ignorant people might think it's there,\" she said, calling the law the \"antithesis of the Bill of Rights.\"\n\nPepperdine's Helfand said it is true that the Founding Fathers invoked the Bible and the Ten Commandments when America was born, but they still called for people to be able to worship or not as they pleased. The legal debate now may shift to the question of coercion, he said. When is someone being forced to engage with a religion they do not embrace? Might that include seeing the Ten Commandments on their classroom wall?\n\n\"You still can't prefer one religion over another,\" Helfand said.\n\nJohn Inazu, a religion and law expert at Washington University in St. Louis, noted that the Supreme Court that threw out a similar law in 1980 was operating under a different legal approach. The earlier case, he wrote in an email, \"was decided under a very different approach to the Establishment Clause. The Supreme Court has since moved toward a focus on history, text, and tradition. But it's not clear to me that the Louisiana statute survives even under the newer framework.\"\n\nPutting this version of the Ten Commandments into classrooms is not a long-standing monument or tradition, and it's \"blatantly religious and monotheistic,\" Inazu wrote.\n\nHe noted the Supreme Court in 2005 upheld a Ten Commandments monument that sits on the Texas Capitol grounds in Austin. However, he said, the monument is separate from the Capitol itself, accompanied by a U.S. flag and Star of David as well as the seal of the civic group that donated it. The court said the monument had a secular purpose and did not imply a government endorsement of religion.\n\nAmong the flurry of post-Bremerton bills aimed at promoting religion in public schools was an effort last year in Texas to approve a Ten Commandment measure like Louisiana's. It passed the state Senate but wasn't taken up by the House. But its supporters gave voice to Americans who see the Supreme Court as righting the American ship after a half-century of wrongly separating church and state.\n\n\"There is absolutely no separation of God and government, and that's what these bills are about. That has been confused; it's not real,\" Texas state Sen. Mayes Middleton (R), who co-sponsored the Texas bill, said last year.\n\nOne of the authors of the Louisiana law said the measure isn't just about religion - nor, he said, are the Ten Commandments.\n\n\"It's our foundational law. Our sense of right and wrong is based off of the Ten Commandments,\" state Rep. Michael Bayham (R) told The Washington Post. He said he believes Moses was a historical figure and not just a religious one.\n\nThose who object to the new bills say they reflect a country that is tipping into a new, dangerous phase in its balance of church and state, with people in power in some places seeking to assert a version of Christian dominance.\n\n\"Look, I love Jesus & the scriptures but this ain't it. Raise a glass to LA looking like a fool on the National stage,\" the Rev. Michael Alello, a Catholic priest in Baton Rouge, posted on X on Wednesday. \"How much tax payer money will be wasted defending this in the courts, only for it to be overturned?\"\n\nBut the Rev. Tony Spell, a Pentecostal pastor also from Baton Rouge, said the new law is an extension of his 2022 victory battling covid restrictions in Louisiana's highest court. The justices had scrapped charges against him for leading religious gatherings despite pandemic lockdown orders.\n\n\"We have a conservative court in Washington,\" Spell said, \"but really, this is about the people, the warriors, the fighters.\"\n\nMovements to incorporate Christianity into every part of life have only grown since his court showdown, he said. Now he is working with groups raising money for the posters of the Ten Commandments they hope will soon be featured in classrooms across the state.\n\nAsked about what the new law would say to people who aren't Christian or don't subscribe to that version of the Ten Commandments, Spell said: \"Being offended is a choice.\"\n\nMark Chancey, a Southern Methodist University professor who studies the use of the Bible in public schools, said the Supreme Court has put the country in a new era.\n\n\"It's the wild west out there when it comes to government-sponsored religion,\" he said, adding: \"It's not clear how these things will play out.\"", "source": {"uri": "adn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anchorage Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemon_v._Kurtzman", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lemon v.

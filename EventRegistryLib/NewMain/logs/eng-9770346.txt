An officiating decision she was sure was wrong. A chair umpire who wouldn't listen. Tears streaming down her cheeks. And, most disappointing of all, a loss, this time at the Paris Olympics.\n\nEven the site was the same: Court Philippe Chatrier was where the reigning U.S. Open champion was eliminated in the third round at the Summer Games by Donna Vekic of Croatia 7-6 (7), 6-2 on Tuesday. That's also the main stadium used annually for the French Open, where Gauff found herself in a nearly identical dispute over a call while being defeated by eventual champion Iga Swiatek in the semifinals last month.\n\n\"There's been multiple times this year where that's happened to me -- where I felt like I always have to be an advocate for myself on the court,\" Gauff said afterward, renewing a call for video review to be used in tennis, as it is in many other professional sports.\n\n\"I felt that he called it before I hit, and I don't think the ref disagreed,\" she said. \"I think he just thought it didn't affect my swing, which I felt like it did.\"\n\nGauff is one of the biggest stars at the 2024 Paris Games, a 20-year-old from Florida who was seeded No. 2 at the Olympics in singles and was the female flag bearer for the United States during the opening ceremony on Friday.\n\nLater Tuesday, Gauff returned to the court with U.S. teammate Taylor Fritz and won a first-round mixed doubles match, 6-1, 6-7 (6), 10-5 against Nadia Podoroska and Maximo Gonzalez of Argentina to get to the quarterfinals. Gauff also is competing in women's doubles at the Paris Olympics with Jessica Pegula.\n\n\"At the end of the day, if anything, doubles make you want to go out there more. You don't want to ruin someone else's chances based off your mentality,\" Gauff said. \"Taylor and I were talking about it earlier: A medal is a medal. I have two other events I can possibly do that in, so I'm just focused on that.\"\n\nIn singles, it was Vekic who was receiving much of the support from the stands early in the match, with chants of \"Don-na! Don-na!\" ringing out. When Vekic began her comeback after trailing 4-1, she responded to some applause by waving her arms overhead for more -- and the crowd responded. In the next game, Gauff delivered a backhand winner and raised a hand, wagging her fingers to ask the folks in the seats to back her -- and they responded, drawing a wry smile from Vekic.\n\nBy the time the disputed call happened two games from the end of the match, Gauff was way behind.\n\nShe hit a serve and Vekic's return landed near the baseline. A line judge initially called Vekic's shot out; Gauff did not keep the ball in play. Chair umpire Jaume Campistol thought Vekic's shot landed in and awarded her the point, giving her a service break and a 4-2 lead.\n\nGauff walked over to talk to the official and play was delayed for several minutes.\n\n\"I never argue these calls. But he called it out before I hit the ball,\" Gauff said to Campistol. \"It's not even a perception; it's the rules.\"\n\nShe easily won her first two singles matches, dropping a total of just five games. But her first Olympic singles tournament ended with a performance that was hardly her best on the hottest day of the Summer Games so far, with the heat rising above 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius).\n\n\"These points are big deals. Usually afterward, they apologize. So it's kind of frustrating. The 'Sorry' doesn't help you once the match is over,\" Gauff said. \"I can't say I would have won the match if I would have won that point.\"\n\nEven before the trouble over the umpiring decision, Gauff could not sustain a good start against Vekic, who was a semifinalist at Wimbledon this month.\n\nThe American led 4-1 and was a point from moving ahead 5-1 and serving for the opening set. But she didn't close the deal, then wasted a couple of set points at 6-4 in the ensuing tiebreaker. Vekic surged to the end of that set, then maintained her level in the second.\n\nOne measure of Vekic's superiority on this afternoon: She finished with 33 winners to just nine for Gauff.\n\n\"I'm not going to sit here and say one point affected the result today,\" Gauff acknowledged, \"because I was already on the losing side of things.\"\n\nStill, the most memorable moment in the match was that second-set argument. Gauff even alluded to that Swiatek loss while talking to Campistol and a supervisor who joined the conversation on the court Tuesday.\n\n\"It always happens here at the French Open to me. Every time,\" Gauff said, holding a tennis ball in one hand and her racket in the other while pleading her case. \"This is like the fourth, fifth time it's happened this year.\"\n\nVekic, who advanced to the quarterfinals, did not get involved, staying at her end of the court and fiddling with her strings.\n\n\"It's a very tricky situation. I personally thought the umpire made a good decision, because the call came quite late,\" Vekic said when asked afterward about what happened. \"But I'll have to rewatch it. It's tough to know exactly in the moment.\"\n\nWhen Gauff gave up and headed back on court to resume play, fans booed loudly -- anger directed at the official.\n\nThe first point of the next game went Gauff's way, and spectators cheered wildly for her.\n\nBut about 10 minutes later, the match was over.\n\nOver the weekend, Gauff spoke about aiming to leave with three medals -- one from each of her events in Paris. That won't happen now.\n\n\"I want,\" Gauff said Tuesday, \"to come home with something.\"", "source": {"uri": "adn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anchorage Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Veki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donna Veki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_tennis_match", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Types of tennis match"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadia_Podoroska", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nadia Podoroska"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Fritz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Fritz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Pegula", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Pegula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Official (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\u00e1ximo_Gonz\u00e1lez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "M\u00e1ximo Gonz\u00e1lez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkover", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Walkover"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiebreaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tiebreaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racket_(sports_equipment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racket (sports equipment)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.adn.com/resizer//tGkun01BCighd8VTm56saxaFlZ8=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/adn/YOZNESDMN7G7DKHOPFTYNRXCDM.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770346", "eventUri": "eng-9770346", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 227, "relevance": 1}

Vegard Gr\u00f8tt / Sipa USA via AP\n\nThe scene felt all too familiar to Coco Gauff. An officiating decision she was sure was wrong. A chair umpire who wouldn't listen. Tears streaming down her cheeks. And, most disappointing of all, a loss, this time at the Paris Olympics.\n\nEven the site was the same: Court Philippe Chatrier was where the reigning U.S. Open champion was eliminated in the third round at the Summer Games by Donna Vekic of Croatia 7-6 (7), 6-2 on Tuesday. That's also the main stadium used annually for the French Open, where Gauff found herself in a nearly identical dispute over a call while being defeated by eventual champion Iga Swiatek in the semifinals last month.\n\n\"There's been multiple times this year where that's happened to me -- where I felt like I always have to be an advocate for myself on the court,\" Gauff said afterward, renewing a call for video review to be used in tennis, as it is in many other professional sports.\n\n\"I felt that he called it before I hit, and I don't think the ref disagreed,\" she said. \"I think he just thought it didn't affect my swing, which I felt like it did.\"\n\nGauff is one of the biggest stars at the 2024 Paris Games, a 20-year-old from Florida who was seeded No. 2 at the Olympics in singles and was the female flag bearer for the United States during the opening ceremony on Friday.\n\nIt was Vekic, though, who was receiving much of the support from the stands early in the match, with chants of \"Don-na! Don-na!\" ringing out. When Vekic began her comeback after trailing 4-1, she responded to some applause by waving her arms overhead for more -- and the crowd responded. In the next game, Gauff delivered a backhand winner and raised a hand, wagging her fingers to ask the folks in the seats to back her -- and they responded, drawing a wry smile from Vekic.\n\nBy the time the disputed call happened two games from the end of the match, Gauff was way behind.\n\nShe hit a serve and Vekic's return landed near the baseline. A line judge initially called Vekic's shot out; Gauff did not keep the ball in play. Chair umpire Jaume Campistol thought Vekic's shot landed in and awarded her the point, giving her a service break and a 4-2 lead.\n\nGauff walked over to talk to the official and play was delayed for several minutes.\n\n\"I never argue these calls. But he called it out before I hit the ball,\" Gauff said to Campistol. \"It's not even a perception; it's the rules.\"\n\nShe easily won her first two singles matches, dropping a total of just five games. But her first Olympic singles tournament -- she is still in women's doubles and mixed doubles -- ended with a performance that was hardly her best on the hottest day of the Summer Games so far, with the heat rising above 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius).\n\n\"These points are big deals. Usually afterward, they apologize. So it's kind of frustrating. The 'Sorry' doesn't help you once the match is over,\" Gauff said. \"I can't say I would have won the match if I would have won that point.\"\n\nEven before the trouble over the umpiring decision, Gauff could not sustain a good start against Vekic, who was a semifinalist at Wimbledon this month.\n\nThe American led 4-1 and was a point from moving ahead 5-1 and serving for the opening set. But she didn't close the deal, then wasted a couple of set points at 6-4 in the ensuing tiebreaker. Vekic surged to the end of that set, then maintained her level in the second.\n\nOne measure of Vekic's superiority on this afternoon: She finished with 33 winners to just nine for Gauff.\n\n\"I'm not going to sit here and say one point affected the result today,\" Gauff acknowledged, \"because I was already on the losing side of things.\"\n\nStill, the most memorable moment in the match was that second-set argument. Gauff even alluded to that Swiatek loss while talking to Campistol and a supervisor who joined the conversation on the court Tuesday.\n\n\"It always happens here at the French Open to me. Every time,\" Gauff said, holding a tennis ball in one hand and her racket in the other while pleading her case. \"This is like the fourth, fifth time it's happened this year.\"\n\nVekic, who advanced to the quarterfinals, did not get involved, staying at her end of the court and fiddling with her strings.\n\n\"It's a very tricky situation. I personally thought the umpire made a good decision, because the call came quite late,\" Vekic said when asked afterward about what happened. \"But I'll have to rewatch it. It's tough to know exactly in the moment.\"\n\nWhen Gauff gave up and headed back on court to resume play, fans booed loudly -- anger directed at the official.\n\nThe first point of the next game went Gauff's way, and spectators cheered wildly for her.\n\nBut about 10 minutes later, the match was over.\n\nGauff was scheduled to head back out on court with U.S. teammate Taylor Fritz for a first-round mixed doubles match later Tuesday. She also is competing in women's doubles with Jessica Pegula at these Olympics.\n\nOver the weekend, Gauff spoke about aiming to leave with three medals -- one from each of her events in Paris.

A refereeing decision she knew was wrong. A chair umpire who wouldn't listen. Tears streaming down her cheeks. And, most disappointing of all, a loss, this time on the Olympic Games in Paris.\n\nEven the location was the same: Court Philippe Chatrier was the place where the reigning US Open Champion was eliminated in the third round of the Summer Games on Tuesday by Donna Vekic of Croatia 7-6 (7), 6-2. That is also the main stadium used annually for the French Open, where Gauff performed in an almost identical dispute over a call while being defeated by eventual champion Iga Swiatek in the semifinals last month.\n\nThis year, there have been several times where I felt like I always had to stand up for myself on the court, Gauff said afterwards, again calling for video review to be used in tennis, as is the case in many other professional sports.\n\nI felt like he was calling it before I hit it, and I don't think the umpire disagreed, she said. I think he just didn't think it affected my swing, which I did.\n\nGauff is one of the biggest stars at the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris. She is 20 years old and comes from Florida. She was seeded second at the Olympic Games in the singles and was the female United States flag bearer during the opening ceremony on Friday.\n\nLater on Tuesday, Gauff returned to the court with American teammate Taylor Fritz and won a first-round mixed doubles match, 6-1, 6-7 (6), 10-5, over Nadia Podoroska and Maximo Gonzalez of Argentina to reach the quarterfinals. Gauff also will compete in the women's doubles event at the Paris Olympics with Jessica Pegula.\n\nUltimately, if there's one thing, it's doubles that make you want to go. You don't want to ruin someone else's chances based on your mentality, Gauff said. Taylor and I talked about it earlier: a medal is a medal. I have two other events where I can potentially do that, so I'm just focusing on that.\n\nIn the singles, it was Vekic who received a lot of support from the stands early in the match, with chants of Don-na! Don-na! going off. When Vekic began her comeback from a 4-1 deficit, she responded to the applause by waving her arms above her head for more and the crowd responded. In the next game, Gauff hit a backhand winner and raised her hand, waving her fingers to ask the people in the stands to support her and they responded, which made Vekic smile wryly.\n\nWhen the disputed decision took place two games from the end of the match, Gauff was already far behind.\n\nShe hit a serve and Vekic's return landed near the baseline. A line judge called Vekic's shot out; Gauff did not keep the ball in play. Chair umpire Jaume Campistol ruled Vekic's shot in and awarded her the point, giving her a service break and a 4-2 lead.\n\nGauff walked over to the referee to talk to him, after which the game was stopped for several minutes.\n\nI never dispute these calls. But he called it before I hit the ball, Gauff told Campistol. It's not even a perception; it's the rules.\n\nShe easily won her first two singles matches, only lost five games in totalBut her first Olympic singles tournament ended with a performance that was hardly her best on the hottest day of the Summer Games so far, with temperatures above 32 degrees Celsius.\n\nThese points are big deals. Usually they apologize afterwards. So it's a little frustrating. The Sorry doesn't help you when the game is over, Gauff said. I can't say I would have won the game if I had won that point.\n\nEven before the problems surrounding the umpire's decision, Gauff had been unable to get off to a good start against Vekic, who was a semi-finalist at Wimbledon this month.\n\nThe American led 4-1 and was a point away from a 5-1 lead and serving for the opening set. But she failed to seal the deal, then squandered a pair of set points at 6-4 in the ensuing tiebreaker. Vekic raced to the end of that set, and held her ground in the second.\n\nAn example of Vekic's superiority this afternoon: she won 33 games, compared to only nine for Gauff.\n\nI'm not going to sit here and say that one point affected the outcome today, Gauff admitted, because I was already on the losing side.\n\nStill, the most memorable moment in the match was that second-set debate. Gauff even alluded to that Swiatek loss during a conversation with Campistol and a supervisor who was on court for the conversation on Tuesday.\n\nIt happens to me all the time here at the French Open. Every time, Gauff said, holding a tennis ball in one hand and her racket in the other as she pleaded her case. This is the fourth, fifth time it's happened this year.\n\nVekic, who advanced to the quarterfinals, did not interfere, remaining on her side of the court and playing with her strings.\n\nIt's a very difficult situation. I personally thought the referee made a good decision because it came quite late, Vekic said after the game when asked what had happened. But I'll have to look at it again. It's difficult to know exactly at that moment.\n\nWhen Gauff gave up and walked back onto the field to restart play, the fans booed the referee loudly and angrily.\n\nThe first point of the next match went to Gauff and the spectators cheered her wildly.\n\nBut about 10 minutes later the game was over.\n\nLast weekend Gauff spoke of her ambition to leave Paris with three medals, one from each of her events. That is not going to happen now.\n\nI want to come home with something, Gauff said Tuesday.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

That's also the main stadium used annually for the French Open, where Gauff found herself in a nearly indistinguishable dispute over a call while being defeated by eventual champion Iga Swiatek in the semifinals last month.\n\n\"There have been multiple instances this year where that's happened to me -- where I felt like I always have to be an advocate for myself on the court,\" Gauff said afterward, reiterating a call for video review to be utilized in tennis, as it is in many other professional sports.\n\n\"I felt that he called it before I hit, and I don't think the ref disagreed,\" she said. \"I think he just thought it didn't affect my swing, which I felt like it did.\"\n\nGauff is one of the biggest stars at the 2024 Paris Games, a 20-year-old from Florida who was seeded No. 2 at the Olympics in singles and was the female flag bearer for the United States during the opening ceremony on Friday.\n\nIt was Vekic, however, who was receiving much of the support from the stands early in the match, with chants of \"Don-na! Don-na!\" echoing. When Vekic began her comeback after trailing 4-1, she responded to some applause by waving her arms overhead for more -- and the crowd responded. In the next game, Gauff delivered a backhand winner and raised a hand, wagging her fingers to ask the folks in the seats to back her -- and they responded, drawing a wry smile from Vekic.\n\nBy the time the disputed call occurred two games from the end of the match, Gauff was far behind.\n\nShe hit a serve and Vekic's return landed near the baseline. A line judge initially called Vekic's shot out; Gauff did not keep the ball in play. Chair umpire Jaume Campistol thought Vekic's shot landed in and awarded her the point, giving her a service break and a 4-2 lead.\n\nGauff walked over to talk to the official and play was delayed for several minutes.\n\n\"I never dispute these calls. But he called it out before I hit the ball,\" Gauff said to Campistol. \"It's not even a perception; it's the rules.\"\n\nShe easily won her first two singles matches, losing a total of just five games. But her first Olympic singles tournament -- she is still in women's doubles and mixed doubles -- ended with a performance that was hardly her best on the hottest day of the Summer Games so far, with the heat rising above 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius).\n\n\"These points are big deals. Usually afterward, they apologize. So it's kind of frustrating. The 'Sorry' doesn't help you once the match is over,\" Gauff said. \"I can't say I would have won the match if I would have won that point.\"\n\nEven before the trouble over the umpiring decision, Gauff could not sustain a good start against Vekic, who was a semifinalist at Wimbledon this month.\n\nThe American led 4-1 and was a point from moving ahead 5-1 and serving for the opening set. But she didn't close the deal, then wasted a couple of set points at 6-4 in the ensuing tiebreaker. Vekic surged to the end of that set, then maintained her level in the second.\n\nOne measure of Vekic's superiority on this afternoon: She finished with 33 winners to just nine for Gauff.\n\n\"I'm not going to sit here and say one point affected the result today,\" Gauff acknowledged, \"because I was already on the losing side of things.\"\n\nStill, the most memorable moment in the match was that second-set argument. Gauff even alluded to that Swiatek loss while talking to Campistol and a supervisor who joined the conversation on the court Tuesday.\n\n\"It always happens here at the French Open to me. Every time,\" Gauff said, holding a tennis ball in one hand and her racket in the other while pleading her case. \"This is like the fourth, fifth time it's happened this year.\"\n\nVekic, who advanced to the quarterfinals, did not get involved, staying at her end of the court and fiddling with her strings.\n\n\"It's a very tricky situation. I personally thought the umpire made a good decision, because the call came quite late,\" Vekic said when asked afterward about what happened. \"But I'll have to rewatch it. It's tough to know exactly in the moment.\"\n\nWhen Gauff gave up and headed back on court to resume play, fans booed loudly -- anger directed at the official.\n\nThe first point of the next game went Gauff's way, and spectators cheered wildly for her.\n\nBut about 10 minutes later, the match was over.\n\nGauff was scheduled to head back out on court with U.S. teammate Taylor Fritz for a first-round mixed doubles match later Tuesday. She also is competing in women's doubles with Jessica Pegula at these Olympics.\n\nOver the weekend, Gauff spoke about aiming to leave with three medals -- one from each of her events in Paris. That won't happen now.\n\n\"I want\" Gauff said Tuesday, \"to come home with something.\"", "source": {"uri": "pehalnews.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pehal News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Veki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donna Veki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umpire_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Umpire (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Official (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_tennis_match", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Types of tennis match"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkover", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Walkover"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Fritz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Fritz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Pegula", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Pegula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racket_(sports_equipment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racket (sports equipment)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.pehalnews.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Coco-Gauffs-Dispute-with-Chair-Umpire-Leads-to-Defeat-Against.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770346", "eventUri": "eng-9770346", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 221, "relevance": 1}

Gauff also is competing in women's doubles at the Paris Olympics with Jessica Pegula.\n\n\"At the end of the day, if anything, doubles make you want to go out there more. You don't want to ruin someone else's chances based off your mentality,\" Gauff said. \"Taylor and I were talking about it earlier: A medal is a medal. I have two other events I can possibly do that in, so I'm just focused on that.\"\n\nIn singles, it was Vekic who was receiving much of the support from the stands early in the match, with chants of \"Don-na! Don-na!\" ringing out. When Vekic began her comeback after trailing 4-1, she responded to some applause by waving her arms overhead for more -- and the crowd responded. In the next game, Gauff delivered a backhand winner and raised a hand, wagging her fingers to ask the folks in the seats to back her -- and they responded, drawing a wry smile from Vekic.\n\nBy the time the disputed call happened two games from the end of the match, Gauff was way behind.\n\nShe hit a serve and Vekic's return landed near the baseline. A line judge initially called Vekic's shot out; Gauff did not keep the ball in play. Chair umpire Jaume Campistol thought Vekic's shot landed in and awarded her the point, giving her a service break and a 4-2 lead.\n\nGauff walked over to talk to the official and play was delayed for several minutes.\n\n\"I never argue these calls. But he called it out before I hit the ball,\" Gauff said to Campistol. \"It's not even a perception; it's the rules.\"\n\nShe easily won her first two singles matches, dropping a total of just five games. But her first Olympic singles tournament ended with a performance that was hardly her best on the hottest day of the Summer Games so far, with the heat rising above 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius).\n\n\"These points are big deals. Usually afterward, they apologize. So it's kind of frustrating. The 'Sorry' doesn't help you once the match is over,\" Gauff said. \"I can't say I would have won the match if I would have won that point.\"\n\nEven before the trouble over the umpiring decision, Gauff could not sustain a good start against Vekic, who was a semifinalist at Wimbledon this month.\n\nThe American led 4-1 and was a point from moving ahead 5-1 and serving for the opening set. But she didn't close the deal, then wasted a couple of set points at 6-4 in the ensuing tiebreaker. Vekic surged to the end of that set, then maintained her level in the second.\n\nOne measure of Vekic's superiority on this afternoon: She finished with 33 winners to just nine for Gauff.\n\n\"I'm not going to sit here and say one point affected the result today,\" Gauff acknowledged, \"because I was already on the losing side of things.\"\n\nStill, the most memorable moment in the match was that second-set argument. Gauff even alluded to that Swiatek loss while talking to Campistol and a supervisor who joined the conversation on the court Tuesday.\n\n\"It always happens here at the French Open to me. Every time,\" Gauff said, holding a tennis ball in one hand and her racket in the other while pleading her case. \"This is like the fourth, fifth time it's happened this year.\"\n\nVekic, who advanced to the quarterfinals, did not get involved, staying at her end of the court and fiddling with her strings.\n\n\"It's a very tricky situation. I personally thought the umpire made a good decision, because the call came quite late,\" Vekic said when asked afterward about what happened. \"But I'll have to rewatch it. It's tough to know exactly in the moment.\"\n\nWhen Gauff gave up and headed back on court to resume play, fans booed loudly -- anger directed at the official.\n\nThe first point of the next game went Gauff's way, and spectators cheered wildly for her.\n\nBut about 10 minutes later, the match was over.\n\nOver the weekend, Gauff spoke about aiming to leave with three medals -- one from each of her events in Paris. That won't happen now.\n\n\"I want,\" Gauff said Tuesday, \"to come home with something.\"\n\nLatest on SportstarShooting, Paris 2024 Olympics LIVE Score Updates, July 31: Aishwary Tomar, Swapnil Kusale in action in men's 50m 3 positionsTeam SportstarParis Olympics 2024: Italy silences French crowd to claim gold in women's fencing team event ReutersParis 2024 Olympics: Gauff renews call for video reviews in tennis after line-call controversy in loss to Vekic APParis Olympics 2024 Live Updates Day 5: Aishwary, Swapnil begin Men's 50m Rifle 3P qualification; PV Sindhu, Lakshya Sen in action in badmintonTeam SportstarBadminton LIVE Score, Paris Olympics 2024, Day 5: PV Sindhu in action; Lakshya Sen vs Jonatan Christie virtual knockout -- July 31 updatesTeam SportstarREAD MORE STORIES", "source": {"uri": "sportstar.thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportstar"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Veki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donna Veki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_tennis_match", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Types of tennis match"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadia_Podoroska", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nadia Podoroska"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Fritz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Fritz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\u00e1ximo_Gonz\u00e1lez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "M\u00e1ximo Gonz\u00e1lez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard-bearer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Standard-bearer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_at_the_2008_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_doubles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis at the 2008 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's doubles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Pegula", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Pegula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Official (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkover", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Walkover"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swapnil_Kusale", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swapnil Kusale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aishwary_Pratap_Singh_Tomar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aishwary Pratap Singh Tomar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakshya_Sen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lakshya Sen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._V._Sindhu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "P.

An officiating decision she was sure was wrong. A chair umpire who wouldn't listen. Tears streaming down her cheeks. And, most disappointing of all, a loss, this time at the Paris Olympics.\n\nEven the site was the same: Court Philippe Chatrier was where the reigning US Open champion was eliminated in the third round at the Summer Games by Donna Vekic of Croatia 7-6 (7), 6-2 on Tuesday.\n\nThat's also the main stadium used annually for the French Open, where Gauff found herself in a nearly identical dispute over a call while losing to eventual champion Iga Swiatek in a semifinal last month.\n\n\"There's been multiple times this year where that's happened to me -- where I felt like I always have to be an advocate for myself on the court,\" Gauff said afterward, renewing a call for video review to be used in tennis, as it is in many other professional sports.\n\n\"I felt that he called it before I hit, and I don't think the ref disagreed,\" she said. \"I think he just thought it didn't affect my swing, which I felt like it did.\"\n\nGauff, a 20-year-old American who was seeded No. 2 at the Olympics in singles, already was trailing by a lot when the episode happened two games from the end of the match.\n\nShe hit a serve, and Vekic's return landed near the baseline.

Gauff, the reigning US Open champion, lost 7-6 (7), 6-2 to Donna Vekic of Croatia in a third-round singles match in Paris on Tuesday.\n\nShe was already trailing by a lot when the episode happened two games from the end of the match, after the 20-year-old hit a serve and Vekic's return landed near the baseline. A line judge initially called the shot out after Gauff did not keep the ball in play. However, chair umpire Jaume Campistol thought Vekic's effort landed in and awarded her the point, giving her a service break and a 4-2 lead.\n\nA furious Gauff walked over to talk to the official and play was delayed for several minutes while an argument ensued. 'I never argue these calls. But he called it out before I hit the ball,' Gauff said to Campistol. 'It's not even a perception; it's the rules. I always have to advocate for myself.' Gauff was seeded second in Paris and easily won her first two singles matches, dropping a total of just five games.\n\nBut her first Olympic singles tournament -- she is still in the women's doubles and mixed doubles -- ended with a performance that was hardly her best on the hottest day of the Summer Games so far, with the heat rising above 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius). Even before the trouble over the umpiring decision, Gauff could not sustain a good start against Vekic, who was a semifinalist at Wimbledon this month.\n\nShe led 4-1 and was a point from moving ahead 5-1 and serving for the opening set. But she couldn't close the deal, then wasted a couple of set points at 6-4 in the ensuing tiebreaker. Vekic surged to the end of that set, then maintained her level in the second. One measure of Vekic's superiority on this afternoon: She finished with 33 winners to just nine for Gauff. But the most memorable portion of the match was the second-set dispute.\n\nIt's not the first time Gauff has been upset by a call she thought was incorrect -- not even the first time in Court Philippe Chatrier, the main stadium used for the annual French Open Grand Slam tournament that was also the site Tuesday.\n\nDuring her loss to eventual champion Iga Swiatek in the French Open semifinals last month, she also got nowhere with the chair umpire during a similar dispute. After that match, Gauff called it 'almost ridiculous' that tennis does not employ video replay technology at all events, the way many other sports do.\n\nShe alluded to that Swiatek match while talking to Campistol and a supervisor who joined the conversation on the court Tuesday. 'It always happens here at the French Open to me. Every time,' Gauff said, holding a tennis ball in one hand and her racket in the other while pleading her case. 'This is like the fourth, fifth time it's happened this year.'\n\nVekic did not get involved, staying at her end of the court and fiddling with her strings. When Gauff gave up and headed back on court to resume play, fans booed loudly -- anger directed at the official. The first point of the next game went Gauff's way, and spectators cheered wildly for her. But about 10 minutes later, the match was over.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

A line judge initially called Vekic's shot out; Gauff did not keep the ball in play. Chair umpire Jaume Campistol thought Vekic's shot landed in and awarded her the point, giving her a service break and a 4-2 lead.\n\nGauff walked over to talk to the official and play was delayed for several minutes.\n\n\"I never argue these calls.

She argued. She also got nowhere with the chair umpire. After that match, Gauff called it \"almost ridiculous\" that tennis does not employ video replay technology at all events, the way many other sports do.\n\nShe alluded to that Swiatek match while talking to Campistol and a supervisor who joined the conversation on the court Tuesday.\n\n\"It always happens here at the French Open to me.

The reigning US Open champion was eliminated in the third round by Croatia's Donna Vekic, 7-6 (7), 6-2, on Court Philippe Chatrier. The loss mirrored a previous disappointment on the same court where Gauff had lost to Iga Swiatek in a contentious French Open semifinal the prior month.\n\nThe match saw Gauff involved in a familiar scene: disputing an officiating decision she believed was incorrect. This time, it was a call by chair umpire Jaume Campistol that awarded Vekic a point, leading to a significant service break. Gauff argued the call with the umpire, delaying play for several minutes, but her appeals were ultimately unsuccessful.\n\nDespite the setback, Gauff quickly shifted her focus to other opportunities at the Games. Later the same day, she teamed up with U.S. teammate Taylor Fritz to win a first-round mixed doubles match against Argentina's Nadia Podoroska and Maximo Gonzalez, advancing to the quarterfinals. Gauff is also competing in women's doubles with Jessica Pegula, maintaining hope for a medal.\n\nOver the weekend, Gauff expressed her ambition to win medals in each of her events. Although the singles loss dashed one of those hopes, she remains focused on her doubles campaigns.\n\n\"I want,\" Gauff said, via The Associated Press, \"to come home with something.\"\n\nReflecting on her situation after her elimination, Gauff said, \"At the end of the day, if anything, doubles make you want to go out there more. You don't want to ruin someone else's chances based off your mentality.\"\n\nCoco Gauff reiterates calls for video replay\n\nDuring her singles match, Gauff initially had the upper hand, leading 4-1 and nearly securing the first set. However, Vekic rallied, buoyed by support from the stands, and ultimately outplayed Gauff with 33 winners compared to Gauff's nine. The Croatian advanced to the quarterfinals while Gauff, visibly frustrated, acknowledged her defeat.\n\n\"I'm not going to sit here and say one point affected the result today,\" Gauff said. \"Because I was already on the losing side of things.\"\n\nHowever, she added, \"There's been multiple times this year where that's happened to me - where I felt like I always have to be an advocate for myself on the court,\" reiterating her call for video review in tennis to prevent such disputes.\n\nGauff's presence at the Olympics has been significant beyond her performances. She was the female flag bearer for the United States during the opening ceremony, alongside Team USA basketball's LeBron James.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "erin_achenbach@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Erin Achenbach", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_tennis_match", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Types of tennis match"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Veki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donna Veki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadia_Podoroska", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nadia Podoroska"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Fritz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Fritz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Pegula", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Pegula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\u00e1ximo_Gonz\u00e1lez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "M\u00e1ximo Gonz\u00e1lez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_replay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instant replay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard-bearer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Standard-bearer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Dating", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Dating", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Ringtennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Ringtennis", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Multi-Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Multi-Events", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Olympics-news-Coco-Gauff-sets-new-goals-after-stunning-singles-loss.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770346", "eventUri": "eng-9770346", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

Vekic slammed a forehand into the net and gave Gauff a two-break lead.\n\nMATCH STATS\n\nBefore long, Vekic turned up her tennis and pushed Gauff to a tiebreak for Set 1. Vekic's forehand was on fire and she used it to land an impressive 11 winners, taking the tiebreak and the set.\n\nBut it was the second set that dismantled Gauff's game entirely.\n\nAt 3-2, 30-40, Gauff was on service when Vekic returned a forehand shot that a line judge called \"out\" as Gauff was striking the ball. The call seemed to cause Gauff to hit into the net. After Gauff made contact, the chair umpire called for a correction to the out call, thus making Vekic's shot in and Gauff's return shot a fault. The result would put Vekic up a break.\n\nGauff immediately approached the chair umpire to dispute the point.\n\n\"You called the ball out before I even hit the ball,\" Gauff emphatically told the ref.\n\n\"That doesn't matter,\" the chair umpire responded.\n\nAs Gauff and the umpire began to debate the point and call, the ITF tournament referee Clare Wood, came on court, and Gauff had choice words for her.\n\nWATCH: Coco Gauff crashes out after questionable call in Round 3\n\n\"It always happens to me on this court,\" Gauff relayed to the tournament referee. \"I feel like I've been cheated on constantly,\" Gauff noted, as tears streamed down the 20-year-old's face.\n\n\"I hope one day the game becomes fair because it's not,\" Gauff added before returning to the court.\n\nAs Vekic began her next service game, she was met with audible jeers.\n\n\"I did nothing wrong,\" Vekic could be seen saying on the court, in response to the crowd.\n\nGauff couldn't find her footing after the controversial call. The American lost the second set and swiftly left the court, as her gold medal dreams were dashed.\n\nGauff was candid with the media after her loss, citing that video review would have been an aid in resolving the line call discord.\n\n\"There's been multiple times this year where that happened to me, where I feel like I always have to be an advocate for myself on the court,\" Gauff told the media after the match. \"I feel like in tennis, we should have a VR (video review) system because these points are big deals. And, yeah, usually afterwards, they apologize, so it's kind of frustrating when the sorry doesn't help you once the match is over.\"\n\n\"I can't say I would have won the match if I would have won that point but, for sure, being not a break, whereas maybe replaying that point can make a big difference in that game. But I'm not going sit here and say one point affected the result today, because I was already on the losing side of things before that point happened.\"\n\nWhile her singles medal wasn't in the cards for her in 2024, Gauff has turned her attention to her mixed doubles match with partner Taylor Fritz later today.\n\n\"It's exciting,\" Gauff said of her upcoming match. \"I'm trying to do my best to mentally just be ready for that match. It was a tough match today, but I want to come home with something.\n\n\"(A medal) is the main goal.

And a loss, this time at the Paris Olympics.\n\n\"There's been multiple times this year where that's happened to me -- where I felt like I always have to be an advocate for myself on the court,\" Gauff said afterward, renewing a call for video review to be used in tennis, as it is in many other professional sports.\n\n\"I felt that [the umpire] called it before I hit, and I don't think the ref disagreed,\" she said. \"I think he just thought it didn't affect my swing, which I felt like it did.\"\n\nGauff is one of the biggest stars at the 2024 Paris Games, a 20-year-old from Florida who was seeded No. 2 at the Olympics in singles and was the female flag bearer for the United States during the opening ceremony on Friday.\n\nIt was Donna Vekic, though, who was receiving much of the support from the stands early in the match, with chants of \"Don-na! Don-na!\" ringing out.\n\nBy the time the disputed call happened two games from the end of the match, Gauff was way behind.\n\nShe hit a serve, and Vekic's return landed near the baseline. A line judge initially called Vekic's shot out; Gauff did not keep the ball in play. Chair umpire Jaume Campistol thought Vekic's shot landed in and awarded her the point, giving her a service break and a 4-2 lead.\n\nGauff walked over to argue with the official, and play was delayed for several minutes.\n\n\"I never argue these calls. But he called it out before I hit the ball,\" Gauff said to Campistol. \"It's not even a perception; it's the rules.\"\n\n\"These points are big deals. Usually afterward, they apologize. So it's kind of frustrating. The 'sorry' doesn't help you once the match is over,\" Gauff said. \"I can't say I would have won the match if I would have won that point.\"\n\nEven before the trouble over the umpiring decision, Gauff could not sustain a good start against Vekic, who was a semifinalist at Wimbledon this month.\n\nThe American led 4-1 and was a point from moving ahead 5-1 and serving for the opening set. But she didn't close the deal, then wasted a couple of set points at 6-4 in the ensuing tiebreaker. Vekic surged to the end of that set, then maintained her level in the second.\n\n\"I'm not going to sit here and say one point affected the result today,\" Gauff acknowledged, \"because I was already on the losing side of things.\"\n\n\"It always happens here at the French Open to me. Every time,\" Gauff said while pleading her case. \"This is like the fourth, fifth time it's happened this year.\"\n\nVekic, who advanced to the quarterfinals, did not get involved, staying at her end of the court.\n\n\"It's a very tricky situation. I personally thought the umpire made a good decision, because the call came quite late,\" Vekic said when asked afterward about what happened. \"But I'll have to rewatch it. It's tough to know exactly in the moment.\"\n\nGauff was scheduled to head back out on court with U.S. teammate Taylor Fritz for a first-round mixed doubles match later Tuesday. She also is competing in women's doubles with Jessica Pegula at these Olympics.\n\nOver the weekend, Gauff spoke about aiming to leave with three medals -- one from each of her events in Paris.

So what if she only put 55% of her first serves in play? So what if she wound up with six double-faults and zero aces?\n\nSo what if it took nearly 1\u00bd hours for the reigning US Open champion and No. 2-ranked Gauff to finish off an opponent who is ranked 85th, has never won a tour-level singles title and owns an 0-2 career record at Grand Slam tournaments?\n\n\"You can't argue with the scoreline, to be honest,\" the 20-year-old American said.\n\nSure can't.\n\nLook at what she has managed to do so far at her first Olympics: Not only is Gauff 3-0 across singles and women's doubles, where her partner is Jessica Pegula, but she has dropped a combined total of only nine games across six sets in those three matches.\n\n\"I knew that she was just going to probably try to out-rally me, which I feel like is one of my strengths. But also I had the ability to be aggressive,\" Gauff said about the matchup with Carle, someone she was familiar with from their days as junior players. \"So I think I was just trying to balance the mistakes and not let her win a lot of points off my racket.\"\n\nHer match was played at Court Suzanne Lenglen at the same time that, across the way at Court Philippe Chatrier, Novak Djokovic was beating Rafael Nadal 6-1, 6-4 in the 60th head-to-head matchup between two rivals with 46 Grand Slam titles between them.\n\nGauff said she was \"kind of sad\" that she missed the chance to watch a contest between two players who \"mean a lot\" to their sport.\n\nIn other action around the same facility used for the French Open, three-time major champion Angelique Kerber was a 6-4, 3-6, 6-4 winner against Jaqueline Adina Cristian of Romania, and Wimbledon champ Barbora Krejcikova of the Czech Republic and Wimbledon runner-up Jasmine Paolini of Italy advanced in straight sets.\n\nGauff's American teammates Danielle Collins and Emma Navarro both won, but the fifth-seeded Pegula was eliminated from singles 4-6, 6-1, 6-3 by Tokyo Games bronze medalist Elina Svitolina of Ukraine in the day's last match. Collins eliminated 2018 Australian Open title winner Caroline Wozniacki 6-3, 3-6, 6-3.\n\nGauff, Collins and Navarro give the United States three women in the third round of Olympics singles for the first time since 2004, when Venus Williams, Lisa Raymond and Chanda Rubin did it at the Athens Games.\n\nThe next opponent for Gauff will be Donna Vekic, a Croatian who was a semifinalist at Wimbledon a little more than two weeks ago and got past 2019 U.S. Open champion Bianca Andreescu of Canada 6-3, 6-4 on Monday.\n\nGauff vs. Vekic was scheduled for Tuesday, as was the first-round match for Gauff and Taylor Fritz in mixed doubles.\n\nGauff is hoping to win three medals at these Games -- in singles, doubles and mixed doubles. Since tennis returned to the Olympics in 1988, no player has ever left a single Games with medals from three events.\n\nOn Monday, Gauff was not at all concerned by the heat, which rose above 80 degrees Fahrenheit for the first time during the Paris Olympics.\n\nBeing from Florida means that sort of thing is not a big deal to Gauff, although she made some concessions, such as wearing ice-filled towels to cool off during changeovers and taking an ice bath after the match.\n\n\"I'm just trying my best to be preventative before maybe I feel fatigue and everything,\" Gauff said. \"Obviously, my last two matches, I went quick. So I'm just trying to think for the future, towards the end of the tournament.\"", "source": {"uri": "ktbb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBB"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

A line judge initially called Vekic's shot out; Gauff did not keep the ball in play. Chair umpire Jaume Campistol thought Vekic's shot landed in and awarded her the point, giving her a service break and a 4-2 lead.\n\nGauff walked over to talk to the official and play was delayed for several minutes.\n\n\"I never argue these calls. But he called it out before I hit the ball,\" Gauff said to Campistol. \"It's not even a perception; it's the rules. I always have to advocate for myself.\"\n\nGauff, a 20-year-old from Florida, was seeded second in Paris and easily won her first two singles matches, dropping a total of just five games.\n\nBut her first Olympic singles tournament -- she is still in women's doubles and mixed doubles -- ended with a performance that was hardly her best on the hottest day of the Summer Games so far, with the heat rising above 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius).\n\nEven before the trouble over the umpiring decision, Gauff could not sustain a good start against Vekic, who was a semifinalist at Wimbledon this month.\n\nThe American led 4-1 and was a point from moving ahead 5-1 and serving for the opening set. But she couldn't close the deal, then wasted a couple of set points at 6-4 in the ensuing tiebreaker. Vekic surged to the end of that set, then maintained her level in the second.\n\nOne measure of Vekic's superiority on this afternoon: She finished with 33 winners to just nine for Gauff.\n\nBut the most memorable portion of the match was the second-set dispute.\n\nIt's not the first time Gauff has been upset by a call she thought was incorrect -- not even the first time in Court Philippe Chatrier, the main stadium used for the annual French Open Grand Slam tournament that was also the site Tuesday.\n\nDuring her loss to eventual champion Iga Swiatek in the French Open semifinals last month, a similar thing happened to Gauff. She argued. She also got nowhere with the chair umpire. After that match, Gauff called it \"almost ridiculous\" that tennis does not employ video replay technology at all events, the way many other sports do.\n\nShe alluded to that Swiatek match while talking to Campistol and a supervisor who joined the conversation on the court Tuesday.\n\n\"It always happens here at the French Open to me. Every time,\" Gauff said, holding a tennis ball in one hand and her racket in the other while pleading her case. \"This is like the fourth, five time it's happened this year.\"\n\nVekic did not get involved, staying at her end of the court and fiddling with her strings.\n\nWhen Gauff gave up and headed back on court to resume play, fans booed loudly -- anger directed at the official.\n\nThe first point of the next game went Gauff's way, and spectators cheered wildly for her.", "source": {"uri": "nbcphiladelphia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC10 Philadelphia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Veki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donna Veki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Official (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_tennis_match", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Types of tennis match"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkover", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Walkover"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umpire_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Umpire (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiebreaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tiebreaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_replay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instant replay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Officiating", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Racing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/07/GettyImages-2163882358_30a4c1.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&crop=0px%2C0px%2C5220px%2C2936px&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770346", "eventUri": "eng-9770346", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

As the 20-year-old stepped back to connect on a backhand shot, the linesperson ruled that the previous shot was out as she made contact with the ball.\n\nThe chair umpire Jaume Campistol awarded the point to Vekic, which Gauff found extremely displeasing. A five-minute argument ensued, with Gauff pleading her case and becoming very emotional.\n\n\"I felt that he called it before I hit, and I don't think the ref disagreed,\" Gauff said. \"I think he just thought it didn't affect my swing, which I felt like it did.\"\n\n\"There have been multiple times this year where that's happened to me -- where I felt like I always have to be an advocate for myself on the court,\" Gauff added.\n\nGauff is one of the biggest stars at the 2024 Paris Games, who was seeded No. 2 at the Olympics in singles and was the female flag bearer for the United States during the opening ceremony on Friday.\n\nShe easily won her first two singles matches, dropping a total of just five games.

Usually, afterwards, they apologize, so it's kind of frustrating when the sorry doesn't help you once the match is over.\"\n\nThe dispute with the umpire in the second set, Gauff later explained, didn't alter the result of the match.\n\n\"Donna played well,\" said Gauff. \"She's been playing well throughout Wimbledon 'til now, so I knew it would be a tough match. I think I had a lot of chances in the first, and I felt like if I could clinch that set, it might have helped me with the momentum of the second.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to sit here and say one point affected the result today,\" Gauff acknowledged, \"because I was already on the losing side of things.\"\n\nGauff's Olympic campaign will continue with Taylor Fritz, who beat Britain's Jack Draper in the singles earlier. The duo will play in the mixed doubles later today, fourth on Simonne-Mathieu.

So what if she only put 55% of her first serves in play? So what if she wound up with six double-faults and zero aces?\n\nSo what if it took nearly 1 1/2 hours for the reigning U.S. Open champion and No. 2-ranked Gauff to finish off an opponent who is ranked 85th, has never won a tour-level singles title and owns an 0-2 career record at Grand Slam tournaments?\n\n\"You can't argue with the scoreline, to be honest,\" the 20-year-old American said.\n\nSure can't.\n\nLook at what she's managed to do so far at her first Olympics: Not only is Gauff 3-0 across singles and women's doubles, where her partner is Jessica Pegula, but she has dropped a combined total of only nine games across six sets in those three matches.\n\n\"I knew that she was just going to probably try to out-rally me, which I feel like is one of my strengths. But also I had the ability to be aggressive,\" Gauff said about the matchup with Carle, someone she was familiar with from their days as junior players. \"So I think I was just trying to balance the mistakes and not let her win a lot of points off my racket.\"\n\nHer match was played at Court Suzanne Lenglen at the same time that, across the way at Court Philippe Chatrier, Novak Djokovic was beating Rafael Nadal 6-1, 6-4 in the 60th head-to-head matchup between two rivals with 46 Grand Slam titles between them.\n\nGauff said she was \"kind of sad that I'm missing\" the chance to watch a contest between two players who \"mean a lot\" to their sport.\n\nMen moving into the third round included Casper Ruud of Norway and Stefanos Tsitsipas of Greece, who both have reached French Open finals, while Carlos Alcaraz -- who is teaming with Nadal in doubles for Spain -- was playing Tallon Griekspoor of the Netherlands in singles at night.\n\nIn other action around the same facility used for the French Open, where Nadal won 14 of his 22 major championships, three-time major champion Angelique Kerber was a 6-4, 3-6, 6-4 winner against Jaqueline Adina Cristian of Romania, and Wimbledon champ Barbora Krejcikova of the Czech Republic and Wimbledon runner-up Jasmine Paolini of Italy advanced in straight sets.\n\nGauff's American teammates Danielle Collins and Emma Navarro both won. Collins eliminated 2018 Australian Open title winner Caroline Wozniacki 6-3, 3-6, 6-3.\n\nThe next opponent for Gauff will be Donna Vekic, a Croatian who was a semifinalist at Wimbledon a little more than two weeks ago and got past 2019 U.S. Open champion Bianca Andreescu of Canada 6-3, 6-4 on Monday.\n\nGauff vs. Vekic was scheduled for Tuesday, as was the first-round match for Gauff and Taylor Fritz in mixed doubles.\n\nGauff is hoping to win three medals at these Games -- in singles, doubles and mixed doubles. Since tennis returned to the Olympics in 1988, no player has ever left a single Games with medals from three events.\n\nOn Monday, Gauff was not at all concerned by the heat, which rose into the 80s Fahrenheit for the first time during the Paris Olympics.\n\nBeing from Florida means that sort of thing is not a big deal to Gauff, although she made some concessions, wearing ice-filled towels to cool off during changeovers and taking an ice bath after the match.\n\n\"I'm just trying my best to be preventative before maybe I feel fatigue and everything,\" Gauff said. \"Obviously, my last two matches, I went quick. So I'm just trying to think for the future, towards the end of the tournament.\"", "source": {"uri": "sentinelcolorado.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sentinel Colorado"}, "authors": [{"uri":

So what if Gauff had more than twice as many unforced errors, 26, as winners, 11? So what if she only put 55% of her first serves in play? So what if she wound up with six double-faults and zero aces? So what if it took nearly 1 1/2 hours for the reigning U.S. Open champion and No. 2-ranked Gauff to finish off an opponent who is ranked 85th, has never won a tour-level singles title and owns an 0-2 career record at Grand Slam tournaments? \"You can't argue with the scoreline, to be honest,\" the 20-year-old American said. Sure can't. Look at what she's managed to do so far at her first Olympics: Not only is Gauff 3-0 across singles and women's doubles, where her partner is Jessica Pegula, but she has dropped a combined total of only nine games across six sets in those three matches.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"I knew that she was just going to probably try to out-rally me, which I feel like is one of my strengths. But also I had the ability to be aggressive,\" Gauff said about the matchup with Carle, someone she was familiar with from their days as junior players. \"So I think I was just trying to balance the mistakes and not let her win a lot of points off my racket.\" Her match was played at Court Suzanne Lenglen at the same time that, across the way at Court Philippe Chatrier, Novak Djokovic was beating Rafael Nadal 6-1, 6-4 in the 60th head-to-head matchup between two rivals with 46 Grand Slam titles between them. Gauff said she was \"kind of sad\" that she missed the chance to watch a contest between two players who \"mean a lot\" to their sport. Men moving into the third round included Carlos Alcaraz, who is scheduled to team with Nadal in doubles for Spain on Tuesday and defeated Tallon Griekspoor of the Netherlands 6-1, 7-6 (3) in singles on Monday night.\n\nAlcaraz needed a medical timeout for treatment on a hip in the second set, then was a point from getting pushed to a third, but finished the job. Alcaraz won the French Open last month for his third Grand Slam title, then added a fourth at Wimbledon this month. Other winners were Casper Ruud of Norway and Stefanos Tsitsipas of Greece, who both have reached French Open finals. In other action around the same facility used for the French Open, where Nadal won 14 of his 22 major championships, three-time major champion Angelique Kerber was a 6-4, 3-6, 6-4 winner against Jaqueline Adina Cristian of Romania, and Wimbledon champ Barbora Krejcikova of the Czech Republic and Wimbledon runner-up Jasmine Paolini of Italy advanced in straight sets. Gauff's American teammates Danielle Collins and Emma Navarro both won. Collins eliminated 2018 Australian Open title winner Caroline Wozniacki 6-3, 3-6, 6-3. The next opponent for Gauff will be Donna Vekic, a Croatian who was a semifinalist at Wimbledon a little more than two weeks ago and got past 2019 U.S. Open champion Bianca Andreescu of Canada 6-3, 6-4 on Monday.\n\nAlso Read: 'Don't have JioTV': Father reveals how media broke the news of Bhaker's bronze\n\nGauff vs. Vekic was scheduled for Tuesday, as was the first-round match for Gauff and Taylor Fritz in mixed doubles. Gauff is hoping to win three medals at these Games \" in singles, doubles and mixed doubles. Since tennis returned to the Olympics in 1988, no player has ever left a single Games with medals from three events. On Monday, Gauff was not at all concerned by the heat, which rose into the 80s Fahrenheit for the first time during the Paris Olympics. Being from Florida means that sort of thing is not a big deal to Gauff, although she made some concessions, wearing ice-filled towels to cool off during changeovers and taking an ice bath after the match. \"I'm just trying my best to be preventative before maybe I feel fatigue and everything,\" Gauff said. \"Obviously, my last two matches, I went quick. So I'm just trying to think for the future, towards the end of the tournament.\"", "source": {"uri": "mid-day.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mid-day"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The dispute occurred late in the match when Gauff was already trailing 7-6 (7), 6-2.\n\nThe controversy started when Gauff hit a serve, and Vekic's return shot landed near the baseline. Initially called out, the chair umpire overruled, awarding the point to Vekic and giving her a significant lead. Gauff, visibly upset, walked over to discuss the call, delaying the match for several minutes. She passionately argued her case, stating, \"I never argue these calls. But he called it out before I hit the ball. It's not even a perception; it's the rules. I always have to advocate for myself.\"\n\nDespite her efforts, the call stood, and Gauff struggled to regain her composure. The 20-year-old Floridian, seeded second in Paris, had been cruising through the tournament, winning her first two matches with ease. However, this match marked a turning point as Vekic, a recent Wimbledon semifinalist, showcased her skills and outplayed Gauff.\n\nVekic's performance was dominant, with 33 winners compared to just nine from Gauff. The American player had a strong start, leading 4-1 and nearly taking the first set, but she couldn't close the deal. The disputed call seemed to rattle her, and she couldn't recover her form in the scorching heat, which climbed above 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius).\n\nThis isn't the first time Gauff has been involved in an on-court dispute. Last month, during the French Open semifinals against Iga Swiatek, a similar situation occurred. Gauff expressed her frustration at the lack of video replay technology in tennis, feeling that crucial calls often go unchallenged.\n\nAs the match resumed, fans showed their support for Gauff, cheering her on despite the setback. However, Vekic maintained her composure and closed out the match, ending Gauff's hopes in the singles competition.\n\nDespite the disappointment, Gauff remains in contention in both women's doubles and mixed doubles, hoping to bounce back from this emotional experience.", "source": {"uri": "balleralert.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Baller Alert"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Veki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donna Veki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkover", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Walkover"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_tennis_match", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Types of tennis match"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://balleralert.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2164202728.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770346", "eventUri": "eng-9770346", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

So what if she only put 55% of her first serves in play? So what if she wound up with six double-faults and zero aces?\n\nSo what if it took nearly 1 1/2 hours for the reigning U.S. Open champion and No. 2-ranked Gauff to finish off an opponent who is ranked 85th, has never won a tour-level singles title and owns an 0-2 career record at Grand Slam tournaments?\n\n\"You can't argue with the scoreline, to be honest,\" the 20-year-old American said.\n\nSure can't.\n\nLook at what she's managed to do so far at her first Olympics: Not only is Gauff 3-0 across singles and women's doubles, where her partner is Jessica Pegula, but she has dropped a combined total of only nine games across six sets in those three matches.\n\n\"I knew that she was just going to probably try to out-rally me, which I feel like is one of my strengths. But also I had the ability to be aggressive,\" Gauff said about the matchup with Carle, someone she was familiar with from their days as junior players. \"So I think I was just trying to balance the mistakes and not let her win a lot of points off my racket.\"\n\nHer match was played at Court Suzanne Lenglen at the same time that, across the way at Court Philippe Chatrier, Novak Djokovic was beating Rafael Nadal 6-1, 6-4 in the 60th head-to-head matchup between two rivals with 46 Grand Slam titles between them.\n\nGauff said she was \"kind of sad\" that she missed the chance to watch a contest between two players who \"mean a lot\" to their sport.\n\nMen moving into the third round included Carlos Alcaraz, who is scheduled to team with Nadal in doubles for Spain on Tuesday and defeated Tallon Griekspoor of the Netherlands 6-1, 7-6 (3) in singles on Monday night. Alcaraz needed a medical timeout for treatment on a hip in the second set, then was a point from getting pushed to a third, but finished the job.\n\nAlcaraz won the French Open last month for his third Grand Slam title, then added a fourth at Wimbledon this month.\n\nOther winners were Casper Ruud of Norway and Stefanos Tsitsipas of Greece, who both have reached French Open finals.\n\nIn other action around the same facility used for the French Open, where Nadal won 14 of his 22 major championships, three-time major champion Angelique Kerber was a 6-4, 3-6, 6-4 winner against Jaqueline Adina Cristian of Romania, and Wimbledon champ Barbora Krejcikova of the Czech Republic and Wimbledon runner-up Jasmine Paolini of Italy advanced in straight sets.\n\nGauff's American teammates Danielle Collins and Emma Navarro both won. Collins eliminated 2018 Australian Open title winner Caroline Wozniacki 6-3, 3-6, 6-3.\n\nThe next opponent for Gauff will be Donna Vekic, a Croatian who was a semifinalist at Wimbledon a little more than two weeks ago and got past 2019 U.S. Open champion Bianca Andreescu of Canada 6-3, 6-4 on Monday.\n\nGauff vs. Vekic was scheduled for Tuesday, as was the first-round match for Gauff and Taylor Fritz in mixed doubles.\n\nGauff is hoping to win three medals at these Games -- in singles, doubles and mixed doubles. Since tennis returned to the Olympics in 1988, no player has ever left a single Games with medals from three events.\n\nOn Monday, Gauff was not at all concerned by the heat, which rose into the 80s Fahrenheit for the first time during the Paris Olympics.\n\nBeing from Florida means that sort of thing is not a big deal to Gauff, although she made some concessions, wearing ice-filled towels to cool off during changeovers and taking an ice bath after the match.\n\n\"I'm just trying my best to be preventative before maybe I feel fatigue and everything,\" Gauff said. \"Obviously, my last two matches, I went quick. So I'm just trying to think for the future, towards the end of the tournament.\"", "source": {"uri": "seattlepi.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Seattle Pi"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Which is why tennis player Coco Gauff was crying after an argument with the umpire during her match with Donna Vekic, which she ended up losing.\n\nDuring the match on June 30, Gauff was trailing her opponent when Vekic hit a shot near the baseline. The line judge called the shot out, per The Guardian, so Gauff didn't keep the ball in play. But then the chair umpire, Jaume Campistol, disagreed and gave Vekic the point, leading Gauff to pause the game to argue her side. \"I never argue these calls. But he called it out before I hit the ball,\" Gauff told Vekic. \"It's not even a perception; it's the rules. I always have to advocate for myself.\"\n\n\"It always happens here at the French Open to me. Every time,\" Gauff said, referring to Roland Garros, the French tennis court where she was playing. \"This is like the fourth, five time it's happened this year.\" Gauff reportedly left the argument in tears, while fans in the stands booed the officials who made the call.\n\nI can't blame Coco Gauff for crying here, but the good news is that she wouldn't be the first tennis GOAT to lose at the Olympics.

An officiating decision she was sure was wrong. A chair umpire who wouldn't listen. Tears streaming down her cheeks. And, most disappointing of all, a loss, this time at the Paris Olympics.\n\nEven the site was the same: Court Philippe Chatrier was where the reigning U.S. Open champion was eliminated in the third round at the Summer Games by Donna Vekic of Croatia 7-6 (7), 6-2 on Tuesday. That's also the main stadium used annually for the French Open, where Gauff found herself in a nearly identical dispute over a call while being defeated by eventual champion Iga Swiatek in the semifinals last month.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\n\"There's been multiple times this year where that's happened to me -- where I felt like I always have to be an advocate for myself on the court,\" Gauff said afterward, renewing a call for video review to be used in tennis, as it is in many other professional sports.\n\n\"I felt that he called it before I hit, and I don't think the ref disagreed,\" she said. \"I think he just thought it didn't affect my swing, which I felt like it did.\"\n\nGauff, a 20-year-old American who was seeded No. 2 at the Olympics in singles, already was trailing by a lot when the episode happened two games from the end of the match.\n\nShe hit a serve and Vekic's return landed near the baseline. A line judge initially called Vekic's shot out; Gauff did not keep the ball in play. Chair umpire Jaume Campistol thought Vekic's shot landed in and awarded her the point, giving her a service break and a 4-2 lead.\n\nGauff walked over to talk to the official and play was delayed for several minutes.\n\n\"I never argue these calls. But he called it out before I hit the ball,\" Gauff said to Campistol. \"It's not even a perception; it's the rules.\"\n\nShe easily won her first two singles matches, dropping a total of just five games. But her first Olympic singles tournament -- she is still in women's doubles and mixed doubles -- ended with a performance that was hardly her best on the hottest day of the Summer Games so far, with the heat rising above 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius).\n\n\"These points are big deals. Usually afterward, they apologize. So it's kind of frustrating. The 'Sorry' doesn't help you once the match is over,\" Gauff said. \"I can't say I would have won the match if I would have won that point.\"\n\nEven before the trouble over the umpiring decision, Gauff could not sustain a good start against Vekic, who was a semifinalist at Wimbledon this month.\n\nThe American led 4-1 and was a point from moving ahead 5-1 and serving for the opening set. But she didn't close the deal, then wasted a couple of set points at 6-4 in the ensuing tiebreaker. Vekic surged to the end of that set, then maintained her level in the second.\n\nOne measure of Vekic's superiority on this afternoon: She finished with 33 winners to just nine for Gauff.\n\n\"I'm not going to sit here and say one point affected the result today,\" Gauff acknowledged, \"because I was already on the losing side of things.\"\n\nStill, the most memorable moment in the match was that second-set argument. Gauff even alluded to that Swiatek loss while talking to Campistol and a supervisor who joined the conversation on the court Tuesday.\n\n\"It always happens here at the French Open to me. Every time,\" Gauff said, holding a tennis ball in one hand and her racket in the other while pleading her case. \"This is like the fourth, fifth time it's happened this year.\"\n\nVekic did not get involved, staying at her end of the court and fiddling with her strings.\n\nWhen Gauff gave up and headed back on court to resume play, fans booed loudly -- anger directed at the official.\n\nThe first point of the next game went Gauff's way, and spectators cheered wildly for her.\n\nBut about 10 minutes later, the match was over.\n\nGauff was scheduled to head back out on court with U.S. teammate Taylor Fritz for a first-round mixed doubles match later Tuesday. She also is competing in women's doubles with Jessica Pegula at these Olympics.\n\nOver the weekend, Gauff spoke about aiming to leave with three medals -- one from each of her events in Paris. That won't happen now.\n\n\"I want\" Gauff said Tuesday, \"to come home with something.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "clickondetroit.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WDIV"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@clickondetroit.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "howard_fendrich@clickondetroit.com", "name": "Howard Fendrich", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Veki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donna Veki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_tennis_match", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Types of tennis match"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Official (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkover", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Walkover"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Fritz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Fritz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Pegula", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Pegula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiebreaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tiebreaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racket_(sports_equipment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racket (sports equipment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bocce", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bocce", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://res.cloudinary.com/graham-media-group/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/c_thumb,w_700/v1/media/gmg/DENHY4KMWBBVBLHY2RCIHXLYSY.jpg?_a=DATAdtfiZAA0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770346", "eventUri": "eng-9770346", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

But also I had the ability to be aggressive,\" Gauff said about the matchup with Carle, someone she was familiar with from their days as junior players. \"So I think I was just trying to balance the mistakes and not let her win a lot of points off my racket.\"\n\nHer match was played at Court Suzanne Lenglen at the same time that, across the way at Court Philippe Chatrier, Novak Djokovic was beating Rafael Nadal 6-1, 6-4 in the 60th head-to-head matchup between two rivals with 46 Grand Slam titles between them.\n\nGauff said she was \"kind of sad\" that she missed the chance to watch a contest between two players who \"mean a lot\" to their sport.\n\nMen moving into the third round included Carlos Alcaraz, who is scheduled to team with Nadal in doubles for Spain on Tuesday and defeated Tallon Griekspoor of the Netherlands 6-1, 7-6 (3) in singles on Monday night. Alcaraz needed a medical timeout for treatment on a hip in the second set, then was a point from getting pushed to a third, but finished the job.\n\nAlcaraz won the French Open last month for his third Grand Slam title, then added a fourth at Wimbledon this month.\n\nOther winners were Casper Ruud of Norway and Stefanos Tsitsipas of Greece, who both have reached French Open finals.\n\nIn other action around the same facility used for the French Open, where Nadal won 14 of his 22 major championships, three-time major champion Angelique Kerber was a 6-4, 3-6, 6-4 winner against Jaqueline Adina Cristian of Romania, and Wimbledon champ Barbora Krejcikova of the Czech Republic and Wimbledon runner-up Jasmine Paolini of Italy advanced in straight sets.\n\nGauff's American teammates Danielle Collins and Emma Navarro both won. Collins eliminated 2018 Australian Open title winner Caroline Wozniacki 6-3, 3-6, 6-3.\n\nThe next opponent for Gauff will be Donna Vekic, a Croatian who was a semifinalist at Wimbledon a little more than two weeks ago and got past 2019 U.S. Open champion Bianca Andreescu of Canada 6-3, 6-4 on Monday.\n\nGauff vs. Vekic was scheduled for Tuesday, as was the first-round match for Gauff and Taylor Fritz in mixed doubles.\n\nGauff is hoping to win three medals at these Games -- in singles, doubles and mixed doubles. Since tennis returned to the Olympics in 1988, no player has ever left a single Games with medals from three events.\n\nOn Monday, Gauff was not at all concerned by the heat, which rose into the 80s Fahrenheit for the first time during the Paris Olympics.\n\nBeing from Florida means that sort of thing is not a big deal to Gauff, although she made some concessions, wearing ice-filled towels to cool off during changeovers and taking an ice bath after the match.\n\n\"I'm just trying my best to be preventative before maybe I feel fatigue and everything,\" Gauff said. \"Obviously, my last two matches, I went quick. So I'm just trying to think for the future, towards the end of the tournament.\"\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType":

A line judge initially called Vekic's shot out; Gauff did not keep the ball in play. Chair umpire Jaume Campistol thought Vekic's shot landed in and awarded her the point, giving her a service break and a 4-2 lead.\n\nGauff walked over to talk to the official and play was delayed for several minutes.\n\n\"I never argue these calls. But he called it out before I hit the ball,\" Gauff said to Campistol. \"It's not even a perception; it's the rules. I always have to advocate for myself.\"\n\nGauff, a 20-year-old from Florida, was seeded second in Paris and easily won her first two singles matches, dropping a total of just five games.\n\nBut her first Olympic singles tournament -- she is still in women's doubles and mixed doubles -- ended with a performance that was hardly her best on the hottest day of the Summer Games so far, with the heat rising above 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius).\n\nEven before the trouble over the umpiring decision, Gauff could not sustain a good start against Vekic, who was a semifinalist at Wimbledon this month.\n\nThe American led 4-1 and was a point from moving ahead 5-1 and serving for the opening set. But she couldn't close the deal, then wasted a couple of set points at 6-4 in the ensuing tiebreaker. Vekic surged to the end of that set, then maintained her level in the second.\n\nOne measure of Vekic's superiority on this afternoon: She finished with 33 winners to just nine for Gauff.\n\nBut the most memorable portion of the match was the second-set dispute.\n\nIt's not the first time Gauff has been upset by a call she thought was incorrect -- not even the first time in Court Philippe Chatrier, the main stadium used for the annual French Open Grand Slam tournament that was also the site Tuesday.\n\nDuring her loss to eventual champion Iga Swiatek in the French Open semifinals last month, a similar thing happened to Gauff.

The ball was ruled out by a line judge and Gauff did not try to respond to the return, but chair umpire Jaume Campistol gave Vekic the point, asserting that the ball landed within the line and was actually playable.\n\nA visibly upset Gauff, already trailing by a set, confronted Campistol and discussed the call for several minutes.\n\n\"I never argue these calls.

During the opening set, she had gotten off to an enticing 4-1 advantage early but collapsed when Vekic went on a 5-0 rally to close her out and claim the set.\n\n\"I'm not going to sit here and say one point affected the result today... because I was already on the losing side of things,\" Gauff noted.\n\nGauff is still very much alive on the doubles side of the Olympic bracket.

So what if she wound up with six double-faults and zero aces?\n\nSo what if it took nearly 1 1/2 hours for the reigning U.S. Open champion and No. 2-ranked Gauff to finish off an opponent who is ranked 85th, has never won a tour-level singles title and owns an 0-2 career record at Grand Slam tournaments?\n\n\"You can't argue with the scoreline, to be honest,\" the 20-year-old American said.\n\nSure can't.\n\nLook at what she's managed to do so far at her first Olympics: Not only is Gauff 3-0 across singles and women's doubles, where her partner is Jessica Pegula, but she has dropped a combined total of only nine games across six sets in those three matches.\n\n\"I knew that she was just going to probably try to out-rally me, which I feel like is one of my strengths. But also I had the ability to be aggressive,\" Gauff said about the matchup with Carle, someone she was familiar with from their days as junior players. \"So I think I was just trying to balance the mistakes and not let her win a lot of points off my racket.\"\n\nHer match was played at Court Suzanne Lenglen at the same time that, across the way at Court Philippe Chatrier, Novak Djokovic was beating Rafael Nadal 6-1, 6-4 in the 60th head-to-head matchup between two rivals with 46 Grand Slam titles between them.\n\nGauff said she was \"kind of sad\" that she missed the chance to watch a contest between two players who \"mean a lot\" to their sport.\n\nMen moving into the third round included Carlos Alcaraz, who defeated Tallon Griekspoor of the Netherlands 6-1, 7-6 (3) on Monday night. Alcaraz needed a medical timeout for treatment from a trainer for a groin muscle issue in the second set, then was a point from getting pushed to a third, but finished the job.\n\n\"It's a pain that I've been dealing with,\" Alcaraz said, mentioning that it bothered him during his run to the Wimbledon championship this month. \"I know what I have to do ... to deal with this pain.\"\n\nAlcaraz, a 21-year-old who also won the French Open in June for one of his four Grand Slam titles, is scheduled to team with Nadal in doubles for Spain on Tuesday against Griekspoor and Wesley Koolhof.\n\n\"I will try to recover as soon and as (best) as I can tonight,\" Alcaraz said, \"to be ... 100% tomorrow in my doubles.\"\n\nOther winners were Casper Ruud of Norway and Stefanos Tsitsipas of Greece, who both have reached French Open finals.\n\nIn other action around the same facility used for the French Open, where Nadal won 14 of his 22 major championships, three-time major champion Angelique Kerber was a 6-4, 3-6, 6-4 winner against Jaqueline Adina Cristian of Romania, and Wimbledon champ Barbora Krejcikova of the Czech Republic and Wimbledon runner-up Jasmine Paolini of Italy advanced in straight sets.\n\nGauff's American teammates Danielle Collins and Emma Navarro both won, but the fifth-seeded Pegula was eliminated from singles 4-6, 6-1, 6-3 by Tokyo Games bronze medalist Elina Svitolina of Ukraine in the day's last match. Collins eliminated 2018 Australian Open title winner Caroline Wozniacki 6-3, 3-6, 6-3.\n\nGauff, Collins and Navarro give the United States three women in the third round of Olympics singles for the first time since 2004, when Venus Williams, Lisa Raymond and Chanda Rubin did it at the Athens Games.\n\nThe next opponent for Gauff will be Donna Vekic, a Croatian who was a semifinalist at Wimbledon a little more than two weeks ago and got past 2019 U.S. Open champion Bianca Andreescu of Canada 6-3, 6-4 on Monday.\n\nGauff vs. Vekic was scheduled for Tuesday, as was the first-round match for Gauff and Taylor Fritz in mixed doubles.\n\nGauff is hoping to win three medals at these Games -- in singles, doubles and mixed doubles. Since tennis returned to the Olympics in 1988, no player has ever left a single Games with medals from three events.\n\nOn Monday, Gauff was not at all concerned by the heat, which rose into the 80s Fahrenheit for the first time during the Paris Olympics.\n\nBeing from Florida means that sort of thing is not a big deal to Gauff, although she made some concessions, wearing ice-filled towels to cool off during changeovers and taking an ice bath after the match.\n\n\"I'm just trying my best to be preventative before maybe I feel fatigue and everything,\" Gauff said. \"Obviously, my last two matches, I went quick. So I'm just trying to think for the future, towards the end of the tournament.\"", "source": {"uri": "recordherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Record Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

A line judge initially called Vekic's shot out; Gauff did not keep the ball in play. Chair umpire Jaume Campistol thought Vekic's shot landed in and awarded her the point, giving her a service break and a 4-2 lead.\n\nGauff walked over to talk to the official and play was delayed for several minutes.\n\nAlso Read | Ukraine vs Argentina Paris Olympics 2024 Free Live Streaming and Match Time in IST: How to Watch Free Live Telecast of UKR U-23 vs ARG U-23 on TV and Online Stream Details of Men's Football Match in India.\n\n\"I never argue these calls. But he called it out before I hit the ball,\" Gauff said to Campistol. \"It's not even a perception; it's the rules. I always have to advocate for myself.\"\n\nGauff, a 20-year-old from Florida, was seeded second in Paris and easily won her first two singles matches, dropping a total of just five games.\n\nBut her first Olympic singles tournament -- she is still in women's doubles and mixed doubles -- ended with a performance that was hardly her best on the hottest day of the Summer Games so far, with the heat rising above 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius).\n\nEven before the trouble over the umpiring decision, Gauff could not sustain a good start against Vekic, who was a semifinalist at Wimbledon this month.\n\nThe American led 4-1 and was a point from moving ahead 5-1 and serving for the opening set. But she couldn't close the deal, then wasted a couple of set points at 6-4 in the ensuing tiebreaker. Vekic surged to the end of that set, then maintained her level in the second.\n\nOne measure of Vekic's superiority on this afternoon: She finished with 33 winners to just nine for Gauff.\n\nBut the most memorable portion of the match was the second-set dispute.\n\nIt's not the first time Gauff has been upset by a call she thought was incorrect -- not even the first time in Court Philippe Chatrier, the main stadium used for the annual French Open Grand Slam tournament that was also the site Tuesday.\n\nDuring her loss to eventual champion Iga Swiatek in the French Open semifinals last month, a similar thing happened to Gauff. She argued. She also got nowhere with the chair umpire. After that match, Gauff called it \"almost ridiculous\" that tennis does not employ video replay technology at all events, the way many other sports do.\n\nShe alluded to that Swiatek match while talking to Campistol and a supervisor who joined the conversation on the court Tuesday.\n\n\"It always happens here at the French Open to me. Every time,\" Gauff said, holding a tennis ball in one hand and her racket in the other while pleading her case. \"This is like the fourth, five time it's happened this year.\"\n\nVekic did not get involved, staying at her end of the court and fiddling with her strings.\n\nWhen Gauff gave up and headed back on court to resume play, fans booed loudly -- anger directed at the official.\n\nThe first point of the next game went Gauff's way, and spectators cheered wildly for her.\n\nBut about 10 minutes later, the match was over.

So where, exactly, did it all go wrong for one of the potential Olympic stars?\n\nIt could be said that a wrong call by the umpire made her lose balance, but can a wrong call, one single point, make her collapse like a house of cards?\n\nVEKIC'S COMEBACK\n\nIt happened against a formidable and resilient Donna Vekic. The Croatian did not feel the pressure while Gauff's astounding record was adding a 4-1 and 5-2 in the first set. She came back, levelled 5-5 and 6-6, and ended up winning the tie-break 9-7, despite Gauff previously having two sets points. The last shot, out, already shown a stressed Gauff, who had let go a set that seemed won.\n\nKEY MOMENT\n\nBut the key moment was in the second set, when a ball was called out immediately before Gauff was about to hit it. Without video review, the umpire ruled out the judge call and, since Gauff's swing had not crossed the net, the point was given to Vekic.\n\nGauff couldn't believe it. She claimed she didn't hit the ball well because she heard the out call before. The umpire admitted she might be right, but that his decision was taken. Then Gauff said \"why does it always happen to me? On this court? I have to advocate for myself every time\".\n\nTEARS\n\nThe protest lasted more than a game. It took almost five minutes of arguments, with Gauff visibly emotional, and the match supervisor going down to the court. \"I never argue these calls but this is not fair! I feel like I'm being cheated\", she kept saying, in tears. The spectators were clearly supporting Gauff. But the decision stood, Gauff lost that game (break, 2-4) and she couldn't recover.\n\nThe game suddenly had a different atmosphere. Vekic was jeered and she, too, felt affected. \"It's not my fault!,\" she said to the public. She also needed some minutes to be back in her game and finish with a deserved 6-2.\n\nTIK-TOK PROTEST\n\nA day after the Opening Ceremony, Gauff complained on Tik-Tok about the living conditions of the Olympic Villa, as her post \"10 girls, 2 bathrooms\" went viral. \"All the tennis girls have now moved out, so there are 5 girls, 2 bathrooms now,\" she then added.\n\nWhile she still has chances in the doubles and the mixed doubles, the real dream was shattered too soon.\n\nGauff, a majestic champion, is still young and might have to learn to deal better with uphill conditions, even if some of them are unfair. She clearly had bad memories of Paris (very fresh memories) haunting her after what happened in Roland Garros one month ago. But in the mixed-zone, after cooling off, at least she admitted that even if that point was replayed, that wouldn't have meant that she'd won the game. It's a good restart after the storm.", "source": {"uri": "myjoyonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MyJoyOnline.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Veki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donna Veki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umpire_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Umpire (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clare_Wood", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clare Wood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Venus Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Tennis_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Tennis Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard-bearer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Standard-bearer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiebreaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tiebreaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_tennis_match", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Types of tennis match"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-31-111120.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770346", "eventUri": "eng-9770346", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-04-01", "dateEnd": "-05-02", "textStart": 1106, "textEnd": 1117}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "-05-05", "dateEnd": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 1160, "textEnd": 1171}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

So what if she only put 55% of her first serves in play? So what if she wound up with six double-faults and zero aces?\n\nSo what if it took nearly 1 1/2 hours for the reigning U.S. Open champion and No. 2-ranked Gauff to finish off an opponent who is ranked 85th, has never won a tour-level singles title and owns an 0-2 career record at Grand Slam tournaments?\n\n\"You can't argue with the scoreline, to be honest,\" the 20-year-old American said.\n\nSure can't.\n\nLook at what she's managed to do so far at her first Olympics: Not only is Gauff 3-0 across singles and women's doubles, where her partner is Jessica Pegula, but she has dropped a combined total of only nine games across six sets in those three matches.\n\n\"I knew that she was just going to probably try to out-rally me, which I feel like is one of my strengths. But also I had the ability to be aggressive,\" Gauff said about the matchup with Carle, someone she was familiar with from their days as junior players. \"So I think I was just trying to balance the mistakes and not let her win a lot of points off my racket.\"\n\nHer match was played at Court Suzanne Lenglen at the same time that, across the way at Court Philippe Chatrier, Novak Djokovic was beating Rafael Nadal 6-1, 6-4 in the 60th head-to-head matchup between two rivals with 46 Grand Slam titles between them.\n\nGauff said she was \"kind of sad\" that she missed the chance to watch a contest between two players who \"mean a lot\" to their sport.\n\nMen moving into the third round included Carlos Alcaraz, who defeated Tallon Griekspoor of the Netherlands 6-1, 7-6 (3) on Monday night. Alcaraz needed a medical timeout for treatment from a trainer for a groin muscle issue in the second set, then was a point from getting pushed to a third, but finished the job.\n\n\"It's a pain that I've been dealing with,\" Alcaraz said, mentioning that it bothered him during his run to the Wimbledon championship this month. \"I know what I have to do ... to deal with this pain.\"\n\nAlcaraz, a 21-year-old who also won the French Open in June for one of his four Grand Slam titles, is scheduled to team with Nadal in doubles for Spain on Tuesday against Griekspoor and Wesley Koolhof.\n\n\"I will try to recover as soon and as (best) as I can tonight,\" Alcaraz said, \"to be ... 100% tomorrow in my doubles.\"\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nOther winners were Casper Ruud of Norway and Stefanos Tsitsipas of Greece, who both have reached French Open finals.\n\nIn other action around the same facility used for the French Open, where Nadal won 14 of his 22 major championships, three-time major champion Angelique Kerber was a 6-4, 3-6, 6-4 winner against Jaqueline Adina Cristian of Romania, and Wimbledon champ Barbora Krejcikova of the Czech Republic and Wimbledon runner-up Jasmine Paolini of Italy advanced in straight sets.\n\nGauff's American teammates Danielle Collins and Emma Navarro both won. Collins eliminated 2018 Australian Open title winner Caroline Wozniacki 6-3, 3-6, 6-3.\n\nThe next opponent for Gauff will be Donna Vekic, a Croatian who was a semifinalist at Wimbledon a little more than two weeks ago and got past 2019 U.S. Open champion Bianca Andreescu of Canada 6-3, 6-4 on Monday.\n\nGauff vs. Vekic was scheduled for Tuesday, as was the first-round match for Gauff and Taylor Fritz in mixed doubles.\n\nGauff is hoping to win three medals at these Games -- in singles, doubles and mixed doubles.

However, the loss came in very controversial fashion.\n\nGauff was trailing in the second set 3-2 when she was facing a break point at 30-40. When the 20-year old stepped back in order to connect on a backhand shot, the linesperson ruled that the previous shot was out as she made contact with the ball.\n\nThe linesperson ended up awarding a point to Vekic, and Gauff was extremely displeased with the call. In fact, a five-minute argument unfolded in which Gauff pleaded her case and got extremely emotional.\n\nGauff could even be heard saying \"I feel like I'm getting cheated constantly in this game.\"\n\n\"I felt that they called it before I hit,\" Gauff said after the match. \"I don't think the ref disagreed. I think he just thought it didn't, like, affect my swing, which I felt like it did.\"\n\n\"I feel like in tennis, we should have a VAR system because these points are big deals,\" Gauff added. \"Usually, afterwards they apologize. It's kind of frustrating when the sorry doesn't help you once the match is over.\"\n\nFollowing the controversial point, Vekic managed to record break points and eventually took a 5-2 lead. Gauff was clearly rattled by the situation and never able to recover.\n\nGauff still has a chance to secure a gold medal in doubles and mixed doubles, but her Olympics singles journey is in the books.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_bengel@cbssports.com", "name": "Chris Bengel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Veki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donna Veki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBSSports.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBSSports.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getty_Images", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Getty Images"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_tennis_match", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Types of tennis match"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Spectrangle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Spectrangle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/07/30/8720fb48-34f5-47fb-b146-d63596a249d6/thumbnail/1200x675/ab3e16b08ed5dc06f29f847b67fdc545/coco-gauff-tears-olympics.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770346", "eventUri": "eng-9770346", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

After Vekic's ball was called out - Gauff returned that ball and it landed in the net. After a quick inspection, the umpire determined that Vekic's ball was in. But he didn't decide the point to be replayed - instead chair umpire Jaume Campistol directly awarded the point to the Croatian.\n\nGauff couldn't believe the call - and after breaking down in tears and getting extremely upset - she demanded the supervisor. When the supervisor arrived on the court, Gauff emotionally asked when umpires would stop \"cheating\" on her.\n\n\"I feel like I'm getting cheated constantly in this game. This is the 3rd time this happens to me this year,\" Gauff was heard telling the supervisor.\n\nAfter a very controversial call and dramatic situation, Gauff didn't win a game afterward as Vekic completed a 7-6 (7) 6-2 win.\n\nGauff also felt wronged by umpires during one of her 2023 US Open and 2024 Dubai matches.\n\n\"There have been multiple times this year where that happened to me where I feel like I always have to be an advocate for myself on the court. I feel like in tennis, we should have a VAR (Video Assistant Referee) system because these points are big deals. Usually, afterwards they apologize,\" Gauff said after the match, via The Athletic.\n\nThe 2023 US Open champion didn't want to say that she lost because of that situation but highlighted that it was an important moment.\n\n\"It's kind of frustrating when the sorry doesn't help you once the match is over. I can't say I would have won the match if I would have won that point. But being down a break...

After hitting a serve that Vekic returned close to the baseline while trailing 3-2 in the second, a line judge called the ball out right as Gauff was preparing to return the shot. But chair umpire Jaume Campistol believed the shot landed in, earning Vekic a massive service break and a 4-2 lead in the set.\n\nPlay was delayed for several minutes as Gauff argued with Campistol over the call, and the American flag bearer was in tears by the end of the exchange.\n\n\"I felt that they called it before I hit.

But Campistol overruled the line call, resulting in a point for Vekic. Rather than deuce, the game went to Vekic, putting her ahead by 4-2.\n\nGauff then argued that the point should have been replayed, saying that hearing the \"out\" call had affected her shot. Campistol didn't agree. The 20-year-old Gauff -- who faced a similarly tough situation during the French Open at Roland-Garros earlier this summer -- grew emotional as she asked for what she saw as a fair resolution.\n\n\"It always happens to me on this court,\" Gauff told the umpire, adding later, \"I feel like I've been cheated on constantly.\"\n\nThe match was an abrupt turnabout for Gauff. A U.S. flagbearer in Friday's opening ceremony, she mostly breezed her way through the tournament's first two rounds. Against Vekic, she had built a 4-1 lead in the first set.\n\nBut then Vekic, the Croatian who earlier this month took part in the longest women's semifinal ever at Wimbledon, got into the fight. She eventually pulled even with Gauff at 6 games apiece to force a tiebreaker, using her forehand and efficient net play to overcome 27 unforced errors in the first set.\n\nGauff has two more chances to win an Olympic medal in Paris: she's playing women's doubles and mixed doubles.

A line judge initially called Vekic's shot out; Gauff did not keep the ball in play. Chair umpire Jaume Campistol thought Vekic's shot landed in and awarded her the point, giving her a service break and a 4-2 lead.\n\nGauff walked over to talk to the official and play was delayed for several minutes.\n\n\"I never argue these calls. But he called it out before I hit the ball,\" Gauff said to Campistol. \"It\u00b4s not even a perception; it's the rules. I always have to advocate for myself.\"\n\nGauff, a 20-year-old from Florida, was seeded second in Paris and easily won her first two singles matches, dropping a total of just five games.\n\nCoco Gauff of United States gestures as she plays against Donna Vekic of Croatiathe during their women's singles third round match at the Roland Garros stadium, at the 2024 Summer Olympics, Tuesday, July 30, 2024, in Paris, France. (AP Photo/Andy Wong)\n\nBut her first Olympic singles tournament - she is still in women's doubles and mixed doubles - ended with a performance that was hardly her best on the hottest day of the Summer Games so far, with the heat rising above 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius).\n\nEven before the trouble over the umpiring decision, Gauff could not sustain a good start against Vekic, who was a semifinalist at Wimbledon this month.\n\nThe American led 4-1 and was a point from moving ahead 5-1 and serving for the opening set. But she couldn\u00b4t close the deal, then wasted a couple of set points at 6-4 in the ensuing tiebreaker. Vekic surged to the end of that set, then maintained her level in the second.\n\nOne measure of Vekic\u00b4s superiority on this afternoon: She finished with 33 winners to just nine for Gauff.\n\nBut the most memorable portion of the match was the second-set dispute.\n\nIt's not the first time Gauff has been upset by a call she thought was incorrect - not even the first time in Court Philippe Chatrier, the main stadium used for the annual French Open Grand Slam tournament that was also the site Tuesday.\n\nDuring her loss to eventual champion Iga Swiatek in the French Open semifinals last month, a similar thing happened to Gauff. She argued. She also got nowhere with the chair umpire. After that match, Gauff called it \"almost ridiculous\" that tennis does not employ video replay technology at all events, the way many other sports do.\n\nShe alluded to that Swiatek match while talking to Campistol and a supervisor who joined the conversation on the court Tuesday.\n\n\"It always happens here at the French Open to me. Every time,\" Gauff said, holding a tennis ball in one hand and her racket in the other while pleading her case. \"This is like the fourth, five time it's happened this year.\"\n\nVekic did not get involved, staying at her end of the court and fiddling with her strings.\n\nWhen Gauff gave up and headed back on court to resume play, fans booed loudly - anger directed at the official.\n\nThe first point of the next game went Gauff's way, and spectators cheered wildly for her.\n\nBut about 10 minutes later, the match was over.\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\nCoco Gauff of United States eyes on the ball as she plays against Donna Vekic of Croatiathe during their women's singles third round match at the Roland Garros stadium, at the 2024 Summer Olympics, Tuesday, July 30, 2024, in Paris, France.

But the 21st-ranked Croatian came out playing a very aggressive and courageous tennis, which led to a huge result.\n\n\"Emotional madness, I have no other words. Gauff plays amazing tennis all the time, especially on this surface which suits her better than me. This is my big success... Definitely in the Top 3 victories in my career. Coco on earth, but this is my biggest victory in my career,\" Vekic told Sportske Novosti after the match.\n\nToday, Vekic plays against Ukraine's Marta Kostyuk for a place in the semifinal in Paris.\n\nJust a few games before Vekic completed her win, a very controversial moment happened and a lengthy discussion ensued. With Vekic up by a set - leading 3-2 - and having a break point on Gauff's serve, one of the Croatian's balls was called out. Gauff returned that same ball and it didn't make it past the net.\n\nAfter checking the mark, chair umpire Jaume Campistol realized that Vekic's ball was actually in. But he didn't want to replay the point, instead he just awarded it to Vekic and that gave the Croatian a lead of a set and a break.\n\nGauff absolutely lost in those moments - and after an argument with Campistol - she had the supervisor come out. During her chat with the supervisor, the world No. 2 said that she feels \"cheated\" on in tennis constantly.\n\n\"This isn't fair. I feel like I'm getting cheated on constantly in this game. I constantly feel like that, and I have to argue. And then you guys apologize afterward. You guys say, 'I'm sorry,' and then what does that do for me in the match? It's not fair. Why am I on the bottom side of these calls?\" Gauff was heard saying on the court.\n\nFollowing her win, Vekic was asked to address the situation.\n\n\"It's hard for me to comment, I'll have to see what happened. During the match, I experienced this in a way that I won the game because the referee's call came very late. In the second game of the same set, she missed the serve and they didn't call it out. And what now? (laughs)\" Vekic said.\n\nAt one point, the crowd started booing Gauff because they wanted the match to continue. And after the argument was over and the clash continued, Vekic appeared to have lost her focus a bit and faced three consecutive break points on her serve. But not only that the Croatian managed to pull off that game, she also broke Gauff again in the eighth game to seal a 7-6 (7) 6-2 win.\n\n\"It was hard to keep focus on the game because the French are specific in their cheering and are extremely loud. But soon after that, they took my side again and helped me,\" Vekic said.\n\nMeanwhile, Gauff explained in her press what made her so frustrated on the court.\n\n\"There's been multiple times this year where that's happened to me -- where I felt like I always have to be an advocate for myself on the court. I felt that he called it before I hit, and I don't think the ref disagreed. I think he just thought it didn't affect my swing, which I felt like it did,\" Gauff said.\n\nGauff wasn't happy at all with the call that was made against her midway through the second set but didn't want to blame that on her loss.\n\n\"It's kind of frustrating when the sorry doesn't help you once the match is over. I can't say I would have won the match if I would have won that point. But being down a break... Maybe replaying that point can make a big difference in that game,\" Gauff added.\n\n\"But I'm not gonna sit here and say one point affected the result today, because I was already on the losing side of things before that point happened.\"", "source": {"uri": "tennisworldusa.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis World USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dzevad_mesic@tennisworldusa.org", "name": "Dzevad Mesic", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Veki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donna Veki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marta_Kostyuk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marta Kostyuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://www.tennisworldusa.org/world/media/image152049.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770346", "eventUri": "eng-9770346", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Usually afterward, they apologize. So it's kind of frustrating. The 'sorry' doesn't help you once the match is over,\" Gauff said, per the Associated Press. \"I can't say I would have won the match if I would have won that point.\"\n\nIn the second set, Gauff was serving down 3-2 (30-40) to Vekic. Gauff got her serve in, and Vekic returned a long one to the baseline. The linesperson initially ruled the ball out, and Gauff appeared to ease or check up after the call. She then hit the ball into the net.\n\nHowever, the chair umpire then issued a correction, calling the ball in. She then awarded the point to Vekic, giving her the set, the break and a 4-2 lead. Vekic then won the next two games for the victory.\n\n\"There's been multiple times this year where that's happened to me -- where I felt like I always have to be an advocate for myself on the court,\" Gauff said.\n\n\"I felt that he called it before I hit, and I don't think the ref disagreed,\" Gauff added. \"I think he just thought it didn't affect my swing, which I felt like it did.\"\n\nPer Matthew Futterman and Charlie Eccleshare of The Athletic, Olympic matches are ruled by the International Tennis Federation, and they cited a section in which cases like these are covered.\n\n\"If a chair umpire or line umpire calls 'Out' and then corrects the call to good, what is the correct decision?\" the rules read.\n\n\"Decision: The chair umpire must decide if the original 'Out' call was a hindrance to either player. If it was a hindrance, the point shall be replayed. If it was not a hindrance, the player who hit the ball wins the point.\"\n\nSo, in this case, the chair umpire apparently did not believe the out call was a hindrance to Gauff, who disagreed with the matter.\n\nUltimately, though, Vekic was the better player on this day, notably hitting 37 service winners go Gauff's 10. Gauff also had seven double faults to Vekic's three and zero aces to Vekic's five.\n\n\"I'm not going to sit here and say one point affected the result today,\" Gauff said, \"because I was already on the losing side of things.\"\n\nDespite the defeat, Gauff is still alive in Olympic competition in women's doubles (with Jessica Pegula) and mixed doubles (with Taylor Fritz).", "source": {"uri": "bleacherreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleacher Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_kasabian@bleacherreport.com", "name": "Paul Kasabian", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Veki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donna Veki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_at_the_2008_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_doubles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis at the 2008 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's doubles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Fritz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Fritz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Pegula", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Pegula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umpire_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Umpire (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Tennis_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Tennis Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Double_Disc_Court", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Double Disc Court", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bocce", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bocce", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Spectrangle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Spectrangle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/c_fill,g_faces,w_3800,h_2000,q_95/v1722371091/aa4iofetrazmfnwppign.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770346", "eventUri": "eng-9770346", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

An officiating decision she was sure was wrong. A chair umpire who wouldn't listen. Tears streaming down her cheeks.

That's also the main stadium for the French Open, reports the AP, where Gauff found herself in a nearly identical dispute over a call while being defeated by eventual champion Iga Swiatek in the semifinals last month.\n\nBy the time the disputed call happened two games from the end of the match, Gauff was way behind. She hit a serve and Vekic's return landed near the baseline. A line judge initially called Vekic's shot out; Gauff did not keep the ball in play. Chair umpire Jaume Campistol thought Vekic's shot landed in and awarded her the point, giving her a service break and a 4-2 lead. Gauff walked over to talk to the official and play was delayed for several minutes. \"I felt that he called it before I hit, and I don't think the ref disagreed,\" Gauff said afterward, renewing a call for video review to be used in tennis. \"I think he just thought it didn't affect my swing, which I felt like it did.\"\n\nOne measure of Vekic's superiority Tuesday afternoon: She finished with 33 winners to just nine for Gauff. \"I'm not going to sit here and say one point affected the result today,\" Gauff acknowledged, \"because I was already on the losing side of things.\" When Gauff gave up and headed back on court to resume play, fans booed loudly at the official. But about 10 minutes later, the match was over. Over the weekend, Gauff spoke about aiming to leave with three medals -- one from each of her events. That won't happen now. \"I want,\" Gauff said Tuesday, \"to come home with something.\" (More", "source": {"uri": "newser.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newser"}, "authors": [{"uri": "polly_davis_doig@newser.com", "name": "Polly Davis Doig", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Veki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donna Veki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Official (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkover", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Walkover"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://img1-azrcdn.newser.com/image/1549322-12-20240730101847.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770346", "eventUri": "eng-9770346", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

Despite numerous unforced errors and a low first-serve percentage, Gauff's aggressive play led to her victory. She aims for three medals in singles, doubles, and mixed doubles.\n\nCoco Gauff is making it look easy at the Paris Olympics so far, adding a 6-1, 6-1 victory over Maria Lourdes Carle of Argentina in the second round of singles Monday to her growing collection of lopsided results.\n\nSo what if Gauff had more than twice as many unforced errors, 26, as winners, 11? So what if she only put 55% of her first serves in play? So what if she wound up with six double-faults and zero aces? So what if it took nearly 1 1/2 hours for the reigning U.S. Open champion and No. 2-ranked Gauff to finish off an opponent who is ranked 85th, has never won a tour-level singles title and owns an 0-2 career record at Grand Slam tournament? \"You can't argue with the scoreline, to be honest,\" the 20-year-old American said.\n\nSure can't.\n\nLook at what she's managed to do so far at her first Olympics: Not only is Gauff 3-0 across singles and doubles, where her partner is Jessica Pegula, but she has dropped a combined total of only nine games across six sets in those three matches.\n\n\"I knew that she was just going to probably try to out-rally me, which I feel like is one of my strengths. But also I had the ability to be aggressive,\" Gauff said about the matchup with Carle, someone she was familiar with from their days as junior players. ''So I think I was just trying to balance the mistakes and not let her win a lot of points off my racket.\" Gauff is hoping to win three medals at her debut Games -- in singles, doubles and mixed doubles, where her partner is Taylor Fritz. Since tennis returned to the Olympics in 1988, no player has ever left a single Games with medals from each event.\n\nOn Monday, Gauff was not at all concerned by the heat, which rose into the 80s Fahrenheit for the first time during the Paris Games.\n\nBeing from Florida means that sort of thing is not a big deal, although she made some concessions, wearing ice-filled towels to cool off during changeovers and taking an ice bath after the match.\n\n\"I'm just trying my best to be preventative before maybe I feel fatigue and everything,\" Gauff said. ''Obviously, my last two matches, I went quick.

It was an emotional match owing to a shoddy call made by the umpire. For the third time this year, Gauff had to advocate for herself to the umpire, and this time she was left in tears.\n\nDuring the second set, Vekic returned Gauff's serve and the ball landed near the baseline. A line judge ruled the ball out, leading Gauff to return the ball into the net. The ball was actually in bounds, leading chair umpire Jaume Campistol to award a point to Vekic. His argument was that the \"out\" call from the line judge should not have affected Gauff's return.\n\nGauff objected to Campistol's call, eventually breaking into tears during the emotional argument. \"This isn't fair; he called it out before I hit the ball,\" Gauff argued.\n\nIt seemed that Campistol understood that he had made a poor call because he told Gauff, \"I know I'm wrong, but I cannot change my decision after your appeal.\" Eventually, a referee came in to act as a mediator.\n\n\"This isn't fair. I feel like I'm getting cheated on constantly in this game. I constantly feel like that, and I have to argue. And then you guys apologize afterwards, you guys say, 'I'm sorry,' and then what does that do for me in the match?\" Gauff said. The ref argued that it was \"not intentional,\" which Gauff scoffed at. \"It's not intentional?' It happens to me, it happens to Serena ... It is.\"\n\nThroughout the heated exchange, Gauff made reference to the difficulties she's had with umpires this year. In February, she was forced to challenge a bad call at the Dubai Tennis Championships -- instead of being awarded a point, the ump made her redo the play. In June, at the French Open, Gauff missed a return after her opponent's serve was ruled out (sound familiar?). The umpire overruled the call, compelling Gauff to argue her side once again.\n\n\"There are so many decisions that are made, and it sucks as a player to go back or [watch] online, and you see that you were completely right,\" Gauff said of the French Open call. \"And it's like, what does that give you in that moment?\"\n\nBack at the Olympics, Gauff argued that the whole sport of tennis had a fairness problem. \"You guys are not fair to me,\" she said. \"I hope that one day the game becomes fair, but it's not.\"", "source": {"uri": "thecut.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Cut"}, "authors": [{"uri": "olivia_craighead@thecut.com", "name": "Olivia Craighead", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Veki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donna Veki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umpire_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Umpire (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Official (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai_Tennis_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dubai Tennis Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/d50/b99/edecf34cb5c6edf471373cdfba713cc0a2-coco-gauff.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770346", "eventUri": "eng-9770346", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

But the 20-year-old's first Olympic singles tournament - she is still in women's doubles and mixed doubles - ended with a performance that was far from her best on the hottest day of the Paris Games so far, with the heat rising above 32C (90F) during her match.\n\nEven before the trouble over the umpiring decision, Gauff could not sustain a good start against Vekic, who was a semi-finalist at Wimbledon this month. Gauff led 4-1 and was a point from moving ahead 5-1 and serving for the opening set. But she couldn't close the deal, then wasted a couple of set points at 6-4 in the ensuing tiebreaker. Vekic surged to the end of that set, then maintained her level in the second. One measure of Vekic's superiority on this afternoon: She finished with 33 winners to just nine for Gauff.\n\nBut the most memorable portion of the match was the second-set dispute. It's not the first time Gauff has been upset by a call she thought was incorrect, and not the first time at Roland Garros, which hosts the French Open as well as this summer's Olympic tennis tournament.\n\nThere was a similar incident during Gauff's loss to eventual champion Iga Swiatek in the French Open semi-finals last month. After that match, Gauff called it \"almost ridiculous\" that tennis does not employ video replay technology at all events.\n\nShe alluded to the Swiatek match while talking to Campistol and a supervisor who joined the conversation on the court on Tuesday. \"It always happens here at the French Open to me. Every time,\" Gauff said. \"This is like the fourth, five time it's happened this year.\"\n\nWhen Gauff gave up and headed back on court to resume play, fans booed loudly - with their anger seemingly directed at the officials. The first point of the next game went Gauff's way, and spectators cheered wildly for her.

A line judge initially called Vekic's shot out; Gauff did not keep the ball in play. Chair umpire Jaume Campistol thought Vekic's shot landed in and awarded her the point, giving her a service break and a 4-2 lead.\n\nGauff walked over to talk to the official and play was delayed for several minutes.\n\n\"I never argue these calls. But he called it out before I hit the ball,\" Gauff said to Campistol. \"It's not even a perception; it's the rules. I always have to advocate for myself.\"\n\nGauff, a 20-year-old from Florida, was seeded second in Paris and easily won her first two singles matches, dropping a total of just five games.\n\nBut her first Olympic singles tournament -- she is still in women's doubles and mixed doubles -- ended with a performance that was hardly her best on the hottest day of the Summer Games so far, with the heat rising above 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius).\n\nEven before the trouble over the umpiring decision, Gauff could not sustain a good start against Vekic, who was a semifinalist at Wimbledon this month.\n\nThe American led 4-1 and was a point from moving ahead 5-1 and serving for the opening set. But she couldn't close the deal, then wasted a couple of set points at 6-4 in the ensuing tiebreaker. Vekic surged to the end of that set, then maintained her level in the second.\n\nOne measure of Vekic's superiority on this afternoon: She finished with 33 winners to just nine for Gauff.\n\nBut the most memorable portion of the match was the second-set dispute.\n\nIt's not the first time Gauff has been upset by a call she thought was incorrect -- not even the first time in Court Philippe Chatrier, the main stadium used for the annual French Open Grand Slam tournament that was also the site Tuesday.", "source": {"uri": "newindianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@newindianexpress.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Veki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donna Veki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Official (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umpire_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Umpire (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_tennis_match", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Types of tennis match"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkover", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Walkover"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bocce", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bocce", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/newindianexpress%2F2024-07%2F0fd56e79-dea2-4339-a4f5-0e09a8f653ec%2FCoco%20Gauff%2C%20Olympics.webp?rect=0%2C0%2C1440%2C756&w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770346", "eventUri": "eng-9770346", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

Our 2024 Olympics tennis odds series has our Vekic Gauff prediction and pick. Find out how to watch Vekic Gauff.\n\nCoco Gauff steamrolled through her Monday match at the Paris Olympics, beating Maria Carle 6-1 and 6-1. It was the quick, clean, easy match Gauff needed with her other commitments in women's doubles with Jessica Pegula and in mixed doubles with Taylor Fritz. Any player who comes to the Olympics in all three tennis disciplines needs to be efficient in the early rounds against clearly inferior players so that there's enough energy in the tank and enough time to rest for other matches. It's true that players who are contenders in singles don't need to practice a lot if they also compete in doubles. The doubles matches are essentially the practice sessions between the singles matches. Players don't have to cover nearly as much of the court, and they can work on their net game and their volleys. It's in the singles matches where tennis players can't get overextended. Getting roped into a three-hour battle in singles will leave a player too taxed for doubles. Accumulated matches are likely to catch up to a player as the tournament goes on, which will endanger any hopes of getting an Olympic medal. The last thing Coco Gauff needs is for her singles matches to leave her wiped out for a quarterfinal or semifinal. That's how dreams of an Olympic medal can turn into a wrenching fourth-place finish, with no medal at all, let alone no gold medal.\n\nGauff's singles journey continues against Donna Vekic, who is riding high and playing some of the best tennis of her life. Vekic reached her first major tournament semifinal a few weeks ago at Wimbledon. Vekic came very close to making the final but was edged out by Jasmine Paolini in a very close (10-8) tiebreaker.\n\nHere are the Donna Vekic-Coco Gauff 2024 Olympics Tennis odds, courtesy of FanDuel.\n\n2024 Olympics Tennis Odds: Donna Vekic-Coco Gauff Odds\n\nThe veteran just made her first Wimbledon semifinal. Even though that was grass and this Olympic tournament is on red clay, it remains that Vekic is hitting the ball as confidently as she ever has in her career. She feels great about her game. She is not likely to win outright, but if she loses 6-4, 6-3, she will cover the spread. She is certainly playing well enough to keep this match close.\n\nWhy Coco Gauff Could Cover The Spread\n\nGauff is playing Olympic doubles and knows she has to conserve energy. That focus on the need to play quick, efficient matches was evident when she lost only two of 14 games to Carle in a beatdown. The spread for that Carle match was 6.5 games. Gauff won by 10. She is getting one more game to work with, being favored by only 5.5 games here. She can win by six or more games, no problem.\n\nFinal Donna Vekic-Coco Gauff Prediction & Pick\n\nGauff will win, but Vekic might cover. Ultimately, the spread seems well-chosen, and we're not sure how this will break.

Gauff pulled up and sent the ball into the net.\n\nThe chair umpire then overturned the point because Vekic's ball had landed in, giving her the break of Gauff's serve to go up, 4-2. That prompted Gauff to appeal that the call had hindered the completion of her swing.\n\nAfterward, Gauff, who was the flagbearer for Team USA alongside LeBron James, said that she \"felt that they called it before I hit.\n\n\"I don't think the ref disagreed. I think he just thought it didn't, like, affect my swing, which I felt like it did.\n\n\"There have been multiple times this year where that happened to me where I feel like I always have to be an advocate for myself on the court. I feel like in tennis, we should have a VAR (Video Assistant Referee) system because these points are big deals. Usually, afterwards they apologize.\n\n\"It's kind of frustrating when the sorry doesn't help you once the match is over.\"\n\n\"It's not fair at all. You guys are not fair to me and I hope one day that the game becomes fair but it's not,\" Gauff said in an extended back and forth with the chair umpire and the supervisor.\n\nPlay continued with Gauff down a break and she fought back in the next Vekic service game, but Vekic saved multiple break points, and ultimately cruised to an impressive victory by breaking Gauff again in the final game.\n\nVekic, who recently reached the Wimbledon semifinals for her best result at a Grand Slam, played well throughout, controlling points with monster forehands and a lethal drop shot. Down 5-3 in the first set, Vekic broke Gauff at love to turn the match around. She won the first-set tiebreak, 9-7, and recovered another early break in the second set to stay on serve.\n\nGauff, having been up in the first set, refused to attribute the loss to the call. \"I can't say I would have won the match if I would have won that point. But being down a break...

A line judge initially called Vekic's shot out; Gauff did not keep the ball in play. Chair umpire Jaume Campistol thought Vekic's shot landed in and awarded her the point, giving her a service break and a 4-2 lead.\n\nGauff walked over to talk to the official and play was delayed for several minutes.\n\n\"I never argue these calls. But he called it out before I hit the ball,\" Gauff said to Campistol. \"It's not even a perception; it's the rules. I always have to advocate for myself.\"\n\nGauff, a 20-year-old from Florida, was seeded second in Paris and easily won her first two singles matches, dropping a total of just five games.\n\nBut her first Olympic singles tournament -- she is still in women's doubles and mixed doubles -- ended with a performance that was hardly her best on the hottest day of the Summer Games so far, with the heat rising above 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius).\n\nEven before the trouble over the umpiring decision, Gauff could not sustain a good start against Vekic, who was a semifinalist at Wimbledon this month.\n\nThe American led 4-1 and was a point from moving ahead 5-1 and serving for the opening set. But she couldn't close the deal, then wasted a couple of set points at 6-4 in the ensuing tiebreaker. Vekic surged to the end of that set, then maintained her level in the second.\n\nOne measure of Vekic's superiority on this afternoon: She finished with 33 winners to just nine for Gauff.\n\nBut the most memorable portion of the match was the second-set dispute.\n\nIt's not the first time Gauff has been upset by a call she thought was incorrect -- not even the first time in Court Philippe Chatrier, the main stadium used for the annual French Open Grand Slam tournament that was also the site Tuesday.\n\nDuring her loss to eventual champion Iga Swiatek in the French Open semifinals last month, a similar thing happened to Gauff. She argued. She also got nowhere with the chair umpire. After that match, Gauff called it \"almost ridiculous\" that tennis does not employ video replay technology at all events, the way many other sports do.\n\nShe alluded to that Swiatek match while talking to Campistol and a supervisor who joined the conversation on the court Tuesday.\n\n\"It always happens here at the French Open to me. Every time,\" Gauff said, holding a tennis ball in one hand and her racket in the other while pleading her case. \"This is like the fourth, five time it's happened this year.\"\n\nVekic did not get involved, staying at her end of the court and fiddling with her strings.\n\nWhen Gauff gave up and headed back on court to resume play, fans booed loudly -- anger directed at the official.\n\nThe first point of the next game went Gauff's way, and spectators cheered wildly for her.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press.

As the line judge made their call, Gauff returned the ball into the net. But when Vekic's shot was actually ruled inbounds, the leading chair umpire, Jaume Campistol, awarded Vekic the point.\n\n\"This isn't fair. He called it out before I hit the ball,\" Gauff argued to Campistol.\n\nAs tears fell down her cheeks, Gauff continued: \"I never argue these calls but you called it out before I hit the ball. It always happens to me on this court. It always happens to me at French Opens every time... I always have to advocate for myself every time.\"\n\nLater, Campistol responded by saying, \"I'm not saying I'm right, but I'm just saying the way I'm seeing it... I know I'm wrong but I cannot change my decision after your appeal.\"\n\nA referee came in to mediate the argument as Gauff explained why the call was wrong from her point of view.\n\n\"This isn't fair. I feel like I'm getting cheated on constantly in this game. I constantly feel like that, and I have to argue,\" Gauff said. \"And then you guys apologize afterward. You guys say, 'I'm sorry,' and then what does that do for me in the match? It's not fair. Why am I on the bottom side of these calls?\"\n\nThe referee claimed the call was \"not intentional\" as Gauff responded, \"It's not intentional?' It happens to me, it happens to Serena ... It is.\"\n\nDuring the argument, Gauff appeared to allude to issues she faced in competitions earlier this year. There was one bad call at the Dubai Tennis Championship in February, but also an incident that occurred at the French Open -- on the exact same court as her match with Vekic -- in June. During that match, a loss to eventual champion Iga Swiatek, Swiatek hit a serve that was called out just as Gauff was returning it. Gauff's shot landed out, but when Swiatek's serve was ruled in, she won the point.", "source": {"uri": "rollingstone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rolling Stone"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tomas_mier@rollingstone.com", "name": "Tom\u00e1s Mier", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Veki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donna Veki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Official (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/coco-gauff-ref-new.jpg?crop=0px%2C72px%2C1798px%2C1014px&resize=1600%2C900", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770346", "eventUri": "eng-9770346", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

So what if she only put 55% of her first serves in play? So what if she wound up with six double-faults and zero aces?\n\nSo what if it took nearly 1 1/2 hours for the reigning U.S. Open champion and No. 2-ranked Gauff to finish off an opponent who is ranked 85th, has never won a tour-level singles title and owns an 0-2 career record at Grand Slam tournaments?\n\n\"You can't argue with the scoreline, to be honest,\" the 20-year-old American said.\n\nSure can't.\n\nLook at what she's managed to do so far at her first Olympics: Not only is Gauff 3-0 across singles and women's doubles, where her partner is Jessica Pegula, but she has dropped a combined total of only nine games across six sets in those three matches.\n\n\"I knew that she was just going to probably try to out-rally me, which I feel like is one of my strengths. But also I had the ability to be aggressive,\" Gauff said about the matchup with Carle, someone she was familiar with from their days as junior players. \"So I think I was just trying to balance the mistakes and not let her win a lot of points off my racket.\"\n\nHer match was played at Court Suzanne Lenglen at the same time that, across the way at Court Philippe Chatrier, Novak Djokovic was beating Rafael Nadal 6-1, 6-4 in the 60th head-to-head matchup between two rivals with 46 Grand Slam titles between them.\n\nGauff said she was \"kind of sad\" that she missed the chance to watch a contest between two players who \"mean a lot\" to their sport.\n\nMen moving into the third round included Carlos Alcaraz, who defeated Tallon Griekspoor of the Netherlands 6-1, 7-6 (3) on Monday night. Alcaraz needed a medical timeout for treatment from a trainer for a groin muscle issue in the second set, then was a point from getting pushed to a third, but finished the job.\n\n\"It's a pain that I've been dealing with,\" Alcaraz said, mentioning that it bothered him during his run to the Wimbledon championship this month. \"I know what I have to do ... to deal with this pain.\"\n\nAlcaraz, a 21-year-old who also won the French Open in June for one of his four Grand Slam titles, is scheduled to team with Nadal in doubles for Spain on Tuesday against Griekspoor and Wesley Koolhof.\n\n\"I will try to recover as soon and as (best) as I can tonight,\" Alcaraz said, \"to be ... 100% tomorrow in my doubles.\"\n\nOther winners were Casper Ruud of Norway and Stefanos Tsitsipas of Greece, who both have reached French Open finals.\n\nIn other action around the same facility used for the French Open, where Nadal won 14 of his 22 major championships, three-time major champion Angelique Kerber was a 6-4, 3-6, 6-4 winner against Jaqueline Adina Cristian of Romania, and Wimbledon champ Barbora Krejcikova of the Czech Republic and Wimbledon runner-up Jasmine Paolini of Italy advanced in straight sets.\n\nGauff's American teammates Danielle Collins and Emma Navarro both won, but the fifth-seeded Pegula was eliminated from singles 4-6, 6-1, 6-3 by Tokyo Games bronze medalist Elina Svitolina of Ukraine in the day's last match. Collins eliminated 2018 Australian Open title winner Caroline Wozniacki 6-3, 3-6, 6-3.\n\nGauff, Collins and Navarro give the United States three women in the third round of Olympics singles for the first time since 2004, when Venus Williams, Lisa Raymond and Chanda Rubin did it at the Athens Games.\n\nThe next opponent for Gauff will be Donna Vekic, a Croatian who was a semifinalist at Wimbledon a little more than two weeks ago and got past 2019 U.S. Open champion Bianca Andreescu of Canada 6-3, 6-4 on Monday.\n\nGauff vs. Vekic was scheduled for today, as was the first-round match for Gauff and Taylor Fritz in mixed doubles.\n\nGauff is hoping to win three medals at these Games -- in singles, doubles and mixed doubles.

Vekic's forehand was on fire and she used it to land an impressive 11 winners, taking the tiebreak and the set.\n\nBut it was the second set that dismantled Gauff's game entirely.\n\nAt 3-2, Gauff was on service when Vekic returned a forehand shot that a line judge called \"out\" as Gauff was striking the ball.

But she couldn't close the deal, then wasted a couple of set points at 6-4 in the ensuing tiebreaker. Vekic surged to the end of that set, then maintained her level in the second.\n\nOne measure of Vekic's superiority on this afternoon: She finished with 33 winners to just nine for Gauff.\n\nBut the most memorable portion of the match was the second-set dispute.\n\nIt's not the first time Gauff has been upset by a call she thought was incorrect -- not even the first time in Court Philippe Chatrier, the main stadium used for the annual French Open Grand Slam tournament that was also the site Tuesday.\n\nDuring her loss to eventual champion Iga Swiatek in the French Open semifinals last month, a similar thing happened to Gauff. She argued. She also got nowhere with the chair umpire. After that match, Gauff called it \"almost ridiculous\" that tennis does not employ video replay technology at all events, the way many other sports do.\n\nShe alluded to that Swiatek match while talking to Campistol and a supervisor who joined the conversation on the court Tuesday.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"It always happens here at the French Open to me.

Coco Gauff of United States talks with an official during her match against Donna Vekic of Croatia. REUTERS/Edgar Su\n\nCoco Gauff, the No. 2 ranked women's tennis player in the world and defending US Open champion, was bounced from the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris on Tuesday, losing in straight sets to Donna Vekic of Croatia, 7-6(7), 6-2.\n\nIn the sweltering heat at Roland Garros -- the iconic home of the French Open -- the 20-year-old American let a 5-2 lead in the first set slip away as Vekic saved three set points and then took the tiebreak.\n\nThe second set saw Vekic break Gauff in more ways than one in the sixth game to take a 4-2 lead. On a breakpoint for Vekic, a return headed for the baseline toward Gauff was called out by the referee before the American could return it. It prompted Gauff to miss the shot but after a review, the ball was deemed to be in, awarding the point to Vekic.\n\nGauff argued for several minutes with the referee and the umpire and broke down into tears. Vekic went on to win the next two games and the match for the upset.\n\nNBC microphones could pick up Gauff saying, \"It always happens to me on this court. I have to advocate for myself every time.\"\n\n\"There's been multiple times this year where that's happened to me,\" Gauff said after the match. \"I felt like I always have to be an advocate for myself on the court. I felt that he called it before I hit, and I don't think the ref disagreed.

And, yeah, usually afterwards, they apologise, so it's kind of frustrating when the sorry doesn't help you once the match is over.\"\n\nGauff added: \"I can't say I would have won the match if I would have won that point but replaying that point can make a big difference in that game.\"\n\nThe American star had also argued with the chair umpire during her semi-final loss to Iga Swiatek at the French Open last month.\n\nAgain, the dispute centred on a line call.\n\n\"I have to advocate for myself all the time,\" Gauff, who played a starring role at the Games opening ceremony on Friday where she carried the US flag with basketball superstar LeBron James, told the umpire on Tuesday.\n\n\"I'm getting cheated in this game.

So what if she only put 55% of her first serves in play? So what if she wound up with six double-faults and zero aces?\n\nSo what if it took nearly 1 1/2 hours for the reigning U.S. Open champion and No. 2-ranked Gauff to finish off an opponent who is ranked 85th, has never won a tour-level singles title and owns an 0-2 career record at Grand Slam tournaments?\n\n\"You can't argue with the scoreline, to be honest,\" the 20-year-old American said.\n\nSure can't. Look at what she's managed to do so far at her first Olympics: Not only is Gauff 3-0 across singles and women's doubles, where her partner is Jessica Pegula, but she has dropped a combined total of only nine games across six sets in those three matches.\n\nPeople are also reading...

But also I had the ability to be aggressive,\" Gauff said about the matchup with Carle, someone she was familiar with from their days as junior players. \"So I think I was just trying to balance the mistakes and not let her win a lot of points off my racket.\"\n\nHer match was played at Court Suzanne Lenglen at the same time that, across the way at Court Philippe Chatrier, Novak Djokovic was beating Rafael Nadal 6-1, 6-4 in the 60th headto-head matchup between two rivals with 46 Grand Slam titles between them.\n\nGauff said she was \"kind of sad\" that she missed the chance to watch a contest between two players who \"mean a lot\" to their sport.\n\nMen moving into the third round included Carlos Alcaraz, who is scheduled to team with Nadal in doubles for Spain on Tuesday and defeated Tallon Griekspoor of the Netherlands 6-1, 7-6 (3) in singles on Monday night. Alcaraz needed a medical timeout for treatment on a hip in the second set, then was a point from getting pushed to a third, but finished the job.\n\nAlcaraz won the French Open last month for his third Grand Slam title, then added a fourth at Wimbledon this month.\n\nOther winners were Casper Ruud of Norway and Stefanos Tsitsipas of Greece, who both have reached French Open finals.\n\nIn other action around the same facility used for the French Open, where Nadal won 14 of his 22 major championships, threetime major champion Angelique Kerber was a 6-4, 3-6, 6-4 winner against Jaqueline Adina Cristian of Romania, and Wimbledon champ Barbora Krejcikova of the Czech Republic and Wimbledon runner-up Jasmine Paolini of Italy advanced in straight sets.\n\nGauff's American teammates Danielle Collins and Emma Navarro both won. Collins eliminated 2018 Australian Open title winner Caroline Wozniacki 6-3, 3-6, 6-3.\n\nThe next opponent for Gauff will be Donna Vekic, a Croatian who was a semifinalist at Wimbledon a little more than two weeks ago and got past 2019 U.S. Open champion Bianca Andreescu of Canada 6-3, 6-4 on Monday.\n\nGauff vs. Vekic was scheduled for Tuesday, as was the first round match for Gauff and Taylor Fritz in mixed doubles.\n\nGauff is hoping to win three medals at these Games -- in singles, doubles and mixed doubles. Since tennis returned to the Olympics in 1988, no player has ever left a single Games with medals from three events.\n\nOn Monday, Gauff was not at all concerned by the heat, which rose into the 80s Fahrenheit for the first time during the Paris Olympics.\n\nBeing from Florida means that sort of thing is not a big deal to Gauff, although she made some concessions, wearing ice-filled towels to cool off during changeovers and taking an ice bath after the match.\n\n\"I'm just trying my best to be preventative before maybe I feel fatigue and everything,\" Gauff said. \"Obviously, my last two matches, I went quick. So I'm just trying to think for the future, towards the end of the tournament.\"\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that

Because of the call, which typically ends a point, Gauff didn't finish her stroke properly, resulting in the ball hitting the net.

While she took full responsibility for her disappointing early elimination, she called out the chair umpire Jaume Campistol and called for more video replay in tennis following an intense and tearful on-court argument near the end of the match.\n\nGauff was battling for her life in the second set after Veki\u0107 came back from 5-1 to win the first. She hadn't been able to regain the calm strength she had displayed in the previous set, but what happened next sent her spiraling. She served the ball to Veki\u0107, and the return landed on the baseline. The line judge called the ball out at first, so Gauff didn't keep the ball in play. But the chair umpire disagreed and overruled the line judge, giving Veki\u0107 the point and a service break, making any comeback for Gauff even harder. Gauff walked over to Campistol and the pair argued for five minutes, with Gauff in tears, before the match resumed.\n\n\"I felt that he called it before I hit, and I don't think the ref disagreed,\" Gauff told the media following the match. \"I think he just thought it didn't affect my swing, which I felt like it did.\"\n\nVeki\u0107 was already ahead by several games when Gauff had the argument with the chair umpire. By that point, Gauff's game had already fallen apart, and she admitted that she didn't know whether the point going her way would have changed anything.\n\n\"I'm not going to sit here and say one point affected the result today,\" Gauff said, \"because I was already on the losing side of things.\"\n\nWhether she would have won or lost isn't the point of her comments or her anger on the court. It's about the rules of the sport being applied correctly to every player. And it's not the first time she's felt this way.\n\n\"It always happens here at the French Open to me. Every time,\" Gauff said to Campistol during the argument. \"This is like the fourth, fifth time it's happened this year.\"\n\nThere's proof this has happened to her at least one other time in the past three months alone. At the French Open in May, pretty much the same exact situation unfolded when she was playing Iga Swiatek in the semifinals. She lost that match at well.\n\nBut all is not lost for Gauff at the 2024 Olympics. She's out of singles, but she is playing mixed doubles with Taylor Fritz, who is also competing in men's singles. Gauff is also continuing her longtime pairing with Jessica Pegula, who lost her second-round singles match earlier this week. Gauff and Pegula are seeded No. 1 in women's doubles, and just recently won their first Grand Slam doubles title at the French Open.\n\nBetween her partnerships with Pegula and Fritz, it's possible Gauff could leave the game with at least one gold. It may not be in singles, but gold is still gold, no matter the event.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Veki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donna Veki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Official (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkover", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Walkover"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Fritz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Fritz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Pegula", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Pegula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_tennis_match", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Types of tennis match"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Nutrition", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Nutrition", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/tnzr018mcHZglBdfZLfrFw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NjY7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-07/b45c8b10-4e87-11ef-bf7f-2ad893172d7d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770346", "eventUri": "eng-9770346", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

She was a point away from winning the first set, but the match quickly turned against her.\n\nThe No. 2 seed became embroiled in a heated argument with chair umpire Jaume Campistol, which contributed to her eventual straight-sets defeat.\n\nThe turning point came late in the match when Gauff was two games from the end. A line call on her baseline was initially called out, but Campistol overruled the decision, giving Veki\u0107 a crucial break point.\n\nGauff argued that the call was made just before she hit the ball, affecting her stroke. She pleaded for the point to be replayed, stating, \"I never argue these calls. But he called it out before I hit the ball. It's not even a perception; it's the rules.\"\n\nThe debate paused the match for several minutes, with Gauff wiping away tears as the supervisor joined the discussion on the court. The crowd expressed their displeasure with boos and jeers.\n\nGauff later reflected on the incident, saying, \"There's been multiple times this year where that's happened to me -- where I felt like I always have to be an advocate for myself on the court.\" She renewed her call for the introduction of video review in tennis, similar to other professional sports.\n\nGauff emphasised that she believed the call impacted her swing. \"I felt that he called it before I hit, and I don't think the ref disagreed,\" she said. \"I think he just thought it didn't affect my swing, which I felt like it did.\"\n\nThe most emotional moment of the match occurred during the second set when Gauff broke down in tears during the argument with Campistol. Despite her efforts, the call stood, and play resumed to Gauff's detriment. She expressed her frustration with the situation, highlighting the need for technological support in tennis officiating.\n\n\"Usually, afterward, they apologise, so it's kind of frustrating when the sorry doesn't help you once the match is over,\" Gauff said.\n\nGauff, a prominent figure at the 2024 Paris Games and the female flag bearer for the United States during the opening ceremony, faced a disappointing end to her singles campaign. However, her Olympic journey is not over. She is set to compete in mixed doubles with US teammate Taylor Fritz and in women's doubles with Jessica Pegula.\n\nThe incident with Campistol has sparked discussions about the fairness and accuracy of officiating in tennis. Gauff's call for video review resonates with many who believe that technological advancements could help prevent such controversies in the future. The young athlete's composure and advocacy for fair play have garnered widespread support, underscoring her role as a significant voice in the sport.\n\nAs Gauff continues her pursuit of Olympic success in doubles, her experience serves as a reminder of the emotional and psychological challenges athletes face in high-stakes competitions. Despite the setback, her resilience and determination remain evident, reflecting the spirit of the Olympic Games. Gauff's journey, both on and off the court, continues to inspire fans and fellow athletes alike, highlighting the importance of fairness and integrity in sports.", "source": {"uri": "tribune.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Express Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Veki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donna Veki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_tennis_match", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Types of tennis match"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Professional sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Fritz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Fritz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Pegula", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Pegula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard-bearer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Standard-bearer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Coco1722362623-0/Coco1722362623-0.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770346", "eventUri": "eng-9770346", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

During a controversial call in the second set, the American star argued that she felt \"cheated constantly in this game.\"\n\nVekic won 7-6, 6-2 at France's famed Roland-Garros.. The momentum swung Vekic's way early in the second set. Vekic already was up 3-2 in the second and had a break point to go up 4-2. In the middle of a rally, Gauff was about to hit, but the linesman indicated Vekic's shot was out, then corrected the call. Gauff said she heard the out call, slowed down and hit the ball into the net.\n\nRather than replaying the point, as Gauff wanted, the chair awarded the point to Vekic, a budding star from Croatia. The umpire told Gauff: \"For me, the call didn't affect your shot.\"\n\nBut Coco Gauff didn't leave it there. She argued with the umpire for nearly five minutes. Then she asked for the supervisor.\n\n\"You have to understand, he called it out before I hit it,\" she told the supervisor. \"What's the rule?

But also I had the ability to be aggressive,\" Gauff said about the matchup with Carle, someone she was familiar with from their days as junior players. \"So I think I was just trying to balance the mistakes and not let her win a lot of points off my racket.\"\n\nGauff is hoping to win three medals at her debut Games -- in singles, doubles and mixed doubles, where her partner is Taylor Fritz. Since tennis returned to the Olympics in 1988, no player has ever left a single Games with medals from each event.\n\nOn Monday, Gauff was not at all concerned by the heat, which rose into the 80s Fahrenheit for the first time during the Paris Games.\n\nBeing from Florida means that sort of thing is not a big deal, although she made some concessions, wearing ice-filled towels to cool off during changeovers and taking an ice bath after the match.\n\n\"I'm just trying my best to be preventative before maybe I feel fatigue and everything,\" Gauff said. \"Obviously, my last two matches, I went quick. So I'm just trying to think for the future, towards the end of the tournament.\" (AP) AM\n\n(This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arjun_Babuta", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arjun Babuta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISSF_10_meter_air_rifle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ISSF 10 meter air rifle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_tennis_match", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Types of tennis match"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Pegula", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Pegula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohan_Bopanna", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rohan Bopanna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Fritz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Fritz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racket_(sports_equipment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racket (sports equipment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_syndication", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Broadcast syndication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://st1.latestly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/default-img-02.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770346", "eventUri": "eng-9770346", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-29", "textStart": 7, "textEnd": 13}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

A line judge initially called Vekic's shot out; Gauff did not keep the ball in play. Chair umpire Jaume Campistol thought Vekic's shot landed in and awarded her the point, giving her a service break and a 4-2 lead.\n\nShe then walked over to talk to the official, and play was delayed for several minutes.\n\n\"I never argue these calls. But he called it out before I hit the ball,\" Gauff said to Campistol. \"It's not even a perception; it's the rules. I always have to advocate for myself.\"\n\nGauff, a 20-year-old from Florida, was seeded second in Paris and easily won her first two singles matches, dropping a total of just five games.\n\nBut her first Olympic singles tournament - she is still in women's doubles and mixed doubles - ended with a performance that was hardly her best on the hottest day of the Summer Games so far, with the heat rising above 32 degrees celsius.\n\nEven before the trouble over the umpiring decision, Gauff could not sustain a good start against Vekic, who was a semifinalist at Wimbledon this month.

Gauff took a one-set lead after holding to love as she served for the opening frame.\n\nGauff won the final eight games of the match, coasting through the second set with no problems.

Stay strong in who you are, and what you want to communicate with the world.\n\n\"In those times that the world doubts you - of which there will be plenty - don't let it frustrate you, let it fuel you. No one can dim your light as long you believe in it. As you hoist that silver trophy at the U.S. Open, your fire will never be brighter. Let it illuminate your future.\n\n\"It's always been an honour to represent the United States. As a member of the U.S. Billie Jean King Cup team, you will rally for the red, white and blue throughout your career, a distinct privilege you will enjoy.\n\n\"While tennis is an individual sport, you relish the relationships with your teammates. You've been lucky enough that your on-court relationships have turned into off-court friendships. One of those notable friendships is with your idol, Serena Williams.\n\n\"Serena was once just a stranger printed on a poster hanging in your room, and now you still can't believe she's a friend and mentor. Her profound impact on tennis, what it means to be a champion and to break barriers is a legacy you hope to uphold and carry with you into your first Olympic Games.\"\n\nHer doubles partner Jessica

That is to say, during the third round defeat, there was an intense argument with the chair umpire, which some believe affected the outcome.\n\nTo note, when the score was 30-30 in the second set, during a crucial point, Gauff served the ball to the Croatian player, who returned a shot which landed out of bounds according to the line judge. However, the chair judge has the final say, and he had a different ruling, saying the ball was in.\n\nTo clarify, Gauff wasn't saying the call was right/wrong by the line judge, but rather making the point that umpire's ruling by saying \"out\" when she was in the process of swinging led her to not finishing her shot, meaning that the point should be replayed.\n\nThat is to say, this led to a back-and-forth between Gauff and the chair umpire, Jaume Campistol.\n\n\"I never argue these calls. But he called it out before I hit the ball,\" Gauff was heard saying to Campistol.\n\nThe 20-year-old was seen breaking down in tears over the matter during the match, as even the judge said \"maybe I was wrong.\"\n\n\"There's been multiple times this year where that's happened to me, where I felt like I always have to be an advocate for myself on the court,\" Gauff told reporters afterward.\n\n\"I feel like in tennis, we should have a VAR (Video Assistant Referee) system because these points are big deals,\" Gauff continuted. \"Usually, afterwards they apologize... It's kind of frustrating when the sorry doesn't help you once the match is over.\"\n\nAlthough it was just one point, in tennis every point matters and can shift the momentum to one player's way. In this case, Gauff went down 4-2 after this in a deciding third round.\n\n\"I can't say I would have won the match if I would have won that point. But being down a break... Maybe replaying that point can make a big difference in that game... But I'm not gonna sit here and say one point affected the result today, because I was already on the losing side of things before that point happened.\"\n\nAll in all, there has been much criticism for the umpires, but what almost everyone can agree on is that tennis needs a video review system, so this type of thing doesn't happen on the biggest stage.\n\nAfter the upset win, Veki? will now move on to her quarterfinal matchup which will take place Wednesday, July 31st.", "source": {"uri": "fanbuzz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FanBuzz - Sports News - NFL | NCAA | NBA |  WWE"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brandon_santomauro@fanbuzz.com", "name": "Brandon Santomauro", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Official (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Veki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donna Veki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flag of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umpire_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Umpire (baseball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Spectrangle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Spectrangle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://fanbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/07/IMG_3520.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770346", "eventUri": "eng-9770346", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 2500, "textEnd": 2509}], "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Coco Gauff experienced it first-hand during her third-round game against Donna Vekic in the Olympics.\n\nDuring the match, the umpire called a ball out before Gauff could return the ball. That caused the American to miss her shot. However, Gauff believed that the ball was in and that the missed call interfered with her attempt.\n\nGauff pleaded her case to the umpire, but to no avail. At one point, the American was heard saying, \"It always happens to me on this court,\" clearly frustrated with the umpire's decision.\n\nGauff was already having a tough match against Vekic, as the Serbian was dominating the American star. Just when Gauff felt like she could make a run, she was saddled by this incident. Her frustration at the moment is quite understandable.\n\nFans sympathized with Gauff and echoed their frustration at the umpire's costly decision.\n\nGauff's frustration eventually led to her being eliminated after two sets. Regardless, the American star still had a historic event. She was the flag-bearer for Team USA and made it to the third round in her first Olympics.\n\nHopefully, this will be a learning lesson for the young star.

So what if she only put 55% of her first serves in play? So what if she wound up with six double-faults and zero aces?\n\nSo what if it took nearly 1 1/2 hours for the reigning U.S. Open champion and No. 2-ranked Gauff to finish off an opponent who is ranked 85th, has never won a tour-level singles title and owns an 0-2 career record at Grand Slam tournament?\n\n\"You can\u00b4t argue with the scoreline, to be honest,\" the 20-year-old American said.\n\nSure can\u00b4t.\n\nLook at what she's managed to do so far at her first Olympics: Not only is Gauff 3-0 across singles and doubles, where her partner is Jessica Pegula, but she has dropped a combined total of only nine games across six sets in those three matches.\n\nCoco Gauff of the United States returns the ball against Maria Lourdes Carle of Argentina during the women's singles tennis competition at the Roland Garros Stadium at the 2024 Summer Olympics on Monday, July 29, 2024, in Paris, France.

But also I had the ability to be aggressive,\" Gauff said about the matchup with Carle, someone she was familiar with from their days as junior players. \"So I think I was just trying to balance the mistakes and not let her win a lot of points off my racket.\"\n\nGauff is hoping to win three medals at her debut Games - in singles, doubles and mixed doubles, where her partner is Taylor Fritz. Since tennis returned to the Olympics in 1988, no player has ever left a single Games with medals from each event.\n\nOn Monday, Gauff was not at all concerned by the heat, which rose into the 80s Fahrenheit for the first time during the Paris Games.\n\nBeing from Florida means that sort of thing is not a big deal, although she made some concessions, wearing ice-filled towels to cool off during changeovers and taking an ice bath after the match.\n\n\"I\u00b4m just trying my best to be preventative before maybe I feel fatigue and everything,\" Gauff said. \"Obviously, my last two matches, I went quick. So I\u00b4m just trying to think for the future, towards the end of the tournament.\"\n\nAP National Writer Jenna Fryer contributed.\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\nCoco Gauff of United States returns the ball against Maria Lourdes Carle of Argentina during the women's singles tennis competition at the at the Roland Garros stadium, at the 2024 Summer Olympics, Monday, July 29, 2024, in Paris, France.

As she retreated to hit a backhand, the linesperson made an out call before Gauff swung her racket and she immediately decelerated, causing a miss.\n\nBut the chair umpire saw it differently, overruling the out call and awarding the point to Vekic.\n\nA five-minute argument ensued in which Gauff called the tournament supervisor and appeared to be crying, while saying, \"I feel like I'm getting cheated constantly in this game.\"\n\nWhen the match ensued, Gauff had an opportunity to get it back on serve in the next game, getting to 0-40 on Vekic's serve. But Vekic managed to reel in the break points and stretch out to a 5-2 lead. A rattled Gauff was then easily broken, allowing Vekic - who recently made the Wimbledon semifinals - to advance.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Coco Gauff eliminated at Paris Olympics after controversial call", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_tennis_match", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Types of tennis match"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Veki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donna Veki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard-bearer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Standard-bearer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ifGaubCrEQr0bdqGbqyeEg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04OTQ7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/usa_today_sports_articles_558/cc15b91ef95effbf8cc7b469bc451901", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770346", "eventUri": "eng-9770346", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

A line judge initially called the shot out of bounds, but it was actually in. However, because of the \"out\" call, Gauff did not keep the ball in play and hit it into the net afterward.

Despite facing some challenges, including a higher number of unforced errors and a lower first-serve percentage, Gauff's aggressive strategy carried her through.\n\n\"I knew that she was just going to probably try to out-rally me, which I feel like is one of my strengths. But also I had the ability to be aggressive,\" Gauff said of her matchup with Carle, via ESPN News Services. The two players are familiar with each other from their junior days, which added an extra layer of strategy to the match. \"So I think I was just trying to balance the mistakes and not let her win a lot of points off my racket.\"\n\nGauff's win was marked by double the unforced errors (26) compared to winners (11), only landing 55% of her first serves, and finishing with six double faults and no aces. Gauff struggled to complete her match in nearly 1.5 hours against an opponent ranked 85th, who has never won a tour-level singles title and has a 0-2 career record in Grand Slam tournaments.\n\n\"You can't argue with the scoreline, to be honest,\" Gauff said.\n\nCoco Gauff soaking in first Olympic experience\n\nThe 20-year-old American's performance at her first Olympics has been notable. It's her first Olympic games after she had to drop out of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics after testing positive for COVID-19 on the eve of the games. She is 3-0 in Paris in both singles and women's doubles, where she partners with Jessica Pegula. Across these matches, Gauff has dropped only nine games in six sets.\n\nThe match against Carle took place on Court Suzanne Lenglen simultaneously with a high-profile clash between Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal on Court Philippe Chatrier. Gauff expressed a bit of disappointment at missing the opportunity to watch two of her sport's icons compete but appreciated the attendees at her match.\n\n\"Even at 6-1, 5-1, the crowd was still very much into the match, which normally isn't the case in most tournaments,\" she said, as reported by Peggy Shinn of Team USA. \"Everybody's trying to root for their player hard.\n\n\"Obviously, it'll suck if you lose, but I feel like there's a sense of pride, especially me being a first-time Olympian. It's one of the things I wanted to check off my list.

After powerhouses like Serena and Venus Williams, Gauff proved to be the breath of fresh air everyone needed, and we were so ready for it.\n\nFast forward a few months, Gauff became the flag-bearer for the 2024 Paris Olympic Games and set out to make history yet again. But, sadly to her fans, the 20-year-old was eliminated this morning after a match with Croatian player Donna Veki\u0107.\n\nAnd while Gauff's loss is disappointing in itself, one moment from the game has fans still riled up. In one play during the match, Gauff disputed a call with chair umpire Jaume Campistol. According to Gauff, the line judge called \"out\" before she hit it back to Veki\u0107. The ball then hit the next. Shortly after, the chair umpire called for a correction to the line judge's call, thus making Veki\u0107's shot in. In turn, Gauff lost the point and gave the breakpoint to her opponent.\n\nGauff then went up to the umpire to complain. \"I never argue these calls. But he called it out before I hit the ball,\" she said, becoming visibly upset, per People. \"It's not even a perception; it's the rules. I always have to advocate for myself.\"\n\n\"This isn't fair,\" she continued. At one point, Gauff moved away from the judge and almost broke down in tears before returning to the argument.\n\n\"I feel like I'm getting cheated on constantly in this game,\" she continued. \"I constantly feel like that. And then you guys apologize afterward, you say, 'I'm sorry,' and then what does that do for me in the match?\"\n\nAfter five minutes of back-and-forth, the game continued. The game ended at a 7-6, 6-2 win for the Croatian.\n\nIn the post-game interviews, Gauff explained that today's misunderstanding was just one example of a pattern she's been experiencing. \"There have been multiple times this year where that happened to me where I feel like I always have to be an advocate for myself on the court,\" she said, per The New York Times. \"I feel like in tennis, we should have a [Video Assistant Referee] system because these points are big deals. Usually, afterward, they apologize. It's kind of frustrating when the sorry doesn't help you once the match is over.\"\n\nAlong with Gauff, many viewers were understandably upset over the situation. \"Btw, Coco Gauff is 100% in the right there -- especially with the words that the umpire was saying ('it doesn't matter' if the line judge called it out first??),\" wrote one user on X. \"Frustrating in such a big moment.\"\n\n\"Coco's a fierce advocator, and still had the grace not to blame the umpire's call on her loss,\" echoed another Gauff fan. \"Onwards. also nobody talk to me today \ud83d\udda4.\"\n\nAmong the commenters, many linked Gauff's experience with Serena and Venus', who advocated for fairness and respect in Tennis throughout their careers. \"Perhaps, Serena or Venus will call her, and share their experiences,\" wrote one user on X.\n\nFamously, for instance, Serena had quite an unapologetic confrontation with umpire Carlos Ramos at the 2018 US Open final between her and Naomi Osaka. \"I have never cheated in my life,\" the multi-Grand Slam winner told the umpire, per Vox. \"You owe me an apology.\"\n\nSo while it's infuriating to see these unfair calls and frustrating situations still happening today, we hope these Tennis stars can lend a hand to Gauff at this time. If anything, we're sure Gauff got some of her fighting spirit watching them when she grew up.\n\n\"Serena was once just a stranger printed on a poster hanging in your room, and now you still can't believe she's a friend and mentor,\" Gauff once wrote to NBC Olympics about their friendship. \"Her profound impact on tennis, what it means to be a champion and to break barriers is a legacy you hope to uphold and carry with you into your first Olympic Games.\"\n\nLooks like the Williams sisters have created a legacy of being much more than just a good Tennis player.

Gauff set up in her full forehand ready position, able to prepare fully because of the speed of the ball.\n\nAs the ball bounced, extremely close to the line, a linesperson called Vekic's shot out as Gauff swung into the forehand.\n\nGauff then pulled up on her follow-through, sending the ball into the net.\n\nImmediately after the call, the chair umpire, Jaume Campistol, said \"correction,\" which is the word umpires use to overrule a call. This meant he judged the ball from Vekic to be in, and he awarded her the point because Gauff's follow-up shot had gone into the net. The point gave Vekic a break of serve at a decisive time in the match.\n\nThe ITF (International Tennis Federation) rules govern the Olympic tennis tournaments.\n\nRegarding the overruling of line calls, Case 7 is as follows:\n\n\"If a chair umpire or line umpire calls 'Out' and then corrects the call to good, what is the correct decision?\n\n\"Decision: The chair umpire must decide if the original 'Out' call was a hindrance to either player. If it was a hindrance, the point shall be replayed. If it was not a hindrance, the player who hit the ball wins the point.\"\n\nThe rule puts chair umpires in an impossible - and completely avoidable - position.\n\nWhy impossible?\n\nBecause umpires have to go inside the mind of a player and decide whether the out call hindered the swing of the player. In almost all cases, the answer would figure to be yes, since calls are made as soon as the ball bounces and generally before the racket makes contact with a ball. It's generally accepted that a loud yell while, or even before a player is hitting a ball is a disruption. It's why umpires are constantly saying \"quiet please.\"\n\nGauff argued about whether the call came before she hit the ball. Yet according to the rule, that doesn't even matter. The issue is whether the call disrupted her -- whether it was a \"hindrance,\" the rulebook says.\n\nShe said it caused her to pull up on her swing. The umpire said it did not.\n\nSo why was this avoidable?\n\nVideo line calls happen throughout top level tennis. The technology has been around for more than a decade. It became very widespread during the Covid-19 pandemic, when tennis wanted to limit the number of people close to the players. A computer never gets overruled, and does not incorrectly call a ball out in the middle of a player's backswing.\n\nImmediately following the overrule from the chair umpire, Gauff said \"(the linesperson) called it out before I hit it, so I went up on the ball.\" Pulling out of a full follow-through on her forehand, as she did, contributes to the trajectory of the shot. Gauff described the differences between the shots, motioning a full swing and an abbreviated swing to make her case.\n\nShe then broke down in tears, saying \"it always happens to me on this court.\" She was referring to a previous, similar incident against Iga Swiatek in the semifinal of this year's French Open. \"It always happens to me at French Opens, every time,\" she said. \"I always have to advocate for myself on this court, all the time.\"\n\n\"I feel like I'm getting cheated on constantly in this game,\" she added when speaking to tournament supervisor Clare Wood. \"It happens to me, it happened to Serena,\" referring to Serena Williams, who felt that umpire Carlos Ramos \"stole\" points from her during a U.S. Open final against Naomi Osaka in 2018, and was subjected to a litany of completely incorrect line calls in a match against Jennifer Capriati at the US Open in 2004. The calls during that 2004 match prompted an apology from the United States Tennis Association (USTA) and partly led to the introduction of Hawk-Eye video calls, which at the time were only used for TV viewers.\n\nBefore returning to the court to serve down 2-4, Gauff said: \"It's not fair at all. You guys are not fair to me and I hope one day that the game becomes fair but it's not.\"\n\nAs Gauff made her case to Campistol and Wood, she made references to previous rulings on tour that went beyond the French Open and the Olympics.\n\n\"This is the third time it happened (this year). It happened to me in Dubai, it happened to me here, and both times I was right. I have never argued calls and you know this, but this isn't fair. This isn't fair. I feel like I'm getting cheated on constantly in this game. I constantly feel like that, and I have to argue,\" she said.\n\nDuring her French Open semifinal defeat to Swiatek last month, a line judge erroneously called Swiatek's serve out in the second set. Gauff swung at her return, sending a backhand return a couple of feet wide. The chair umpire overruled the call on the serve but also ruled that the call had not affected Gauff's ability and opportunity to return the ball unhindered. So Swiatek got the point.\n\nA tearful Gauff approached chair umpire Aurelie Tourte, and during their exchange said that the crowd was \"booing because they know (she) is wrong.\"\n\nAfter the match, Gauff advocated for the use of video replays: \"I definitely think at this point it's almost ridiculous that we don't have it. Not just because that happened to me, but every sport has it.\n\n\"There are so many decisions that are made, and it sucks as a player to go back or online and you see that you were completely right, and it's, like, what does that give you in that moment?\"\n\nThe incident in Dubai that Gauff referred to came in a round-of-16 match against Karolina Pliskova back in February.\n\nOn that occasion, Gauff hit a first serve that was in and was returned into the net by Pliskova. The serve was erroneously overruled by the umpire, Pierre Bacchi. Gauff challenged the call and Hawk-Eye -- not present at the French Open -- showed the ball to be in.\n\nBut unlike when Gauff missed her return against Swiatek in similar circumstances and lost the point, this time the umpire deemed that Pliskova had been affected by the call, and so the point was replayed. A frustrated Gauff spoke to Bacchi for almost five minutes and requested to speak to the tour supervisor -- a request that wasn't granted.\n\nGauff steadied herself and won the match, saying afterwards that the incident \"fueled\" her victory. Against Swiatek, Gauff did eventually break in the game in question, but then lost five of the next six to succumb to defeat.\n\nOn Tuesday, Gauff lost the final two games after the disputed call, despite racing to 0-40 on Vekic's serve immediately after it happened.\n\nEarlier this month, David Haggerty, the president of the ITF, which organizes the Olympic tournament, said that the decision to not use video and computer line calling occurred during the initial planning stages for the tournament over the past three years.\n\nEver since video and computer line calling became a thing, clay-court tournaments have argued that the computer system is not as accurate as it is on a hardcourt since the lines slightly raised, because they are made of plastic and nailed into the court.\n\nHowever, in recent years, the designers of the system have corrected for that, and some clay-court tournaments, like the Masters 1000 in Madrid, do employ computer line calling. Haggerty said that shift occurred too late to make the change for the Olympic tournament.\n\nMost systems aren't 100 percent foolproof, and Hawk-Eye line calling is no exception. The bigger issue is whether the system is more accurate than a human, and no one makes the argument that the computer is worse than a human . The computer system is accurate to within roughly 3 millimeters. Humans judging balls that move at 150mph in some cases can't get close to that.\n\nIt's important to remember that there was someone on the other side of the net for all this. When serving at 4-2, Vekic paused for a long time before both her first and second serve, mouthing \"it's not my fault,\" between serves as the crowd booed her. She then went down 0-40, before saving three break points and winning the game in a highly charged moment for both players.\n\nAfter the match, Vekic said \"it's a very tricky situation.\n\n\"I personally thought the umpire a good decision because the call came quite late, but I will have to rewatch it,\" she said. \"It's tough to know in the moment. After that, with the crowd, it was not so easy. I lost my concentration for a couple of points, but I'm happy that I managed to come back in that game (to fight off the break points) because it was an important game.\"\n\nNicole Auerbach, James

Then, Gauff was also up by a break in the second set but then lost her lead after a very messy situation.\n\nWith Gauff facing a break point in the sixth game of the second set, Vekic's ball was called out - Gauff returned that same ball and it landed out. But after checking the mark, the call on Vekic's shot was overturned and called in. But instead of replaying the point, chair umpire Campistol awarded the point to Vekic - which instantly handed the Croatian a break and a 4-2 second-set lead.\n\nGauff wasn't happy about the call at all as she was 100 percent sure that she hit the ball after hearing Vekic's ball was called out. But the chair umpire stood by his call - and since the 20-year-old American felt incredibly wronged - started crying while demanding the supervisor to be called to the court.\n\nWhen the supervisor arrived, Gauff had some strong words: \"I feel like I'm getting cheated constantly in this game. This is the 3rd time this happens to me this year.\"\n\nAfter the incident, Vekic saved three consecutive break points in the seventh game before breaking Gauff again in the eighth game to seal the win. Vekic finished the match with 33 winners and 39 unforced errors.\n\nAlthough Vekic came out playing aggressively, Gauff was the one who had everything in control after opening an early 5-2 lead. But then, the second-seeded American didn't convert a set point on Vekic's serve in the eighth game and then got broken back when serving for the first set in the ninth game as Vekic managed to force a tie-break.\n\nAfter missing out on a set point and failing to serve out for the opener, Gauff also had two consecutive set points at 6-4 in the tie-break. But Vekic saved both of Gauff's consecutive set points before realizing her second set point to steal the opener from the 2023 US Open champion.\n\nJust like in the first set, Gauff was also the first to get a break in the second set. But then, Gauff suffered three breaks in a row and lost the next five games as Vekic went on to complete a two-set win.", "source": {"uri": "tennisworldusa.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis World USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dzevad_mesic@tennisworldusa.org", "name": "Dzevad Mesic", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Veki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donna Veki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Sakkari", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maria Sakkari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Official (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marta_Kostyuk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marta Kostyuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_scoring_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis scoring system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo_Golf", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Card_Games/Combining", "label": "dmoz/Games/Card Games/Combining", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://www.tennisworldusa.org/world/media/image152034.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770346", "eventUri": "eng-9770346", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Croatia's Donna Veki\u0107, defeated Gauff 7-6(7), 6-2 in the third round of competition in the Paris Olympics. However, the match was highlighted by a tearful argument between Gauff and the chair umpire.\n\n\"A line call on Gauff's baseline was initially deemed out, but Campistol overruled the decision and handed Veki\u0107 a crucial break point,\" wrote CNN Sports' George Ramsey. \"Play was then paused as the American vehemently argued that the point should be replayed as the call was made just before she hit the ball.\"\n\n\"Gauff to the Supervisor while crying. 'I feel like I'm getting cheated constantly in this game. This is the 3rd time this happens to me this year,'\" wrote Portuguese tennis reporter Jos\u00e9 Morgado on X.\n\nGauff's first-round victory over Australia's Ajla Tomljanovi\u0107 was a historic one. It made her the youngest American woman to win in Olympic singles since Venus Williams in 2000. She beat Argentina's Maria Lourdes Carle in the second round to set up Tuesday's match against Veki\u0107.\n\nGauff started off very strong in the third round against Veki\u0107. She took a commanding 4-1 lead in the opening set. However, a strong comeback by Veki\u0107 forced a tiebreak where she eventually took the lead. It was the first time in the tournament that Gauff had dropped a set.\n\nVeki\u0107 was able to carry her momentum from the first set comeback into the second set. The second set is also when the controversial call took place, and after that it did not take long for Veki\u0107 to seal the win.\n\n\"You guys are not fair to me and I hope that one day the game becomes fair, but it's not,\" Gauff said to the supervisor after an extensive argument with the chair umpire.\n\n\"There's been multiple times this year where that's happened to me -- where I felt like I always have to be an advocate for myself on the court,\" Gauff told reporters afterward.\n\nCourt Philippe Chatrieris the same site where the U.S. Open champion was eliminated in the French Open last month. Gauff found herself in a nearly identical dispute over a call while being defeated by eventual champion Iga Swiatek in the semifinals last month.\n\n\"I felt that he called it before I hit, and I don't think the ref disagreed. I think he just thought it didn't affect my swing, which I felt like it did,\" Gauff said after the match.\n\nGauff also suggested a solution for calls like this in the future.\n\n\"And I feel like in tennis, we should have a VR system because these points are big deals,\" Gauff said. \"Usually, afterwards, they apologize, so it's kind of frustrating when the sorry doesn't help you once the match is over.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to sit here and say one point affected the result today because I was already on the losing side of things before that point happened,\" she said.\n\nGauff, along with Los Angeles Lakers LeBron James, was chosen as flag bearers during the opening ceremonies this year.\n\n\"I just want to say thank you to my fellow team usa olympians/athletes for voting and choosing me for this incredible honor to be the flag bearer for the opening ceremony . Thank you so much. I am incredibly honored,\" she wrote on X.\n\nThe 20-year-old still has mixed and women's doubles competitions to come in Paris having won her opening match in the doubles format alongside Jessica Pegula on Saturday.\n\nGauff will play in the first round of mixed doubles alongside Taylor Fritz later in the day on July 30.

Along with overlaid text reading \"10 girls, two bathrooms #olympics,\" the video was paired with a sound compilation of clips from several movies including Ready or Not, Pearl, and Hereditary.\n\nAlthough the issue has already seen a partial resolution, it came at an added cost, leading some of the other American tennis players to move into a nearby hotel. The 2023 US Open champion noted in the comment section that because of this, there are now only five of them left living in the Olympic Village.\n\nDespite the close quarters, the Olympics have thus far been a great experience for Gauff, having served as one of the opening ceremony flag-bearers for Team USA alongside NBA superstar LeBron James. Not only that but she's also won a doubles match with Jessica Pegula, beating Australia's Ellen Perez and Daria Saville on Saturday. The following day she also beat Ajla Tomljanovi\u0107 in the opening round of the women's singles tournament.\n\nHowever, the tennis player did not advance and was later defeated during the third round at Court Philippe-Chatier by Wimbledon semi-finalist Donna Vekic after a disputed call led to Vekic's victory. At the time, Gauff cried as she argued with the chair umpire Jaume Campistol over a near-identical dispute to a previous incident two months ago that led to her defeat at the French Open to eventual champion Iga Swiatek.\n\n\"I never argue these calls but he called it out before I hit the ball. It always happens to me on this court!\" Gauff told the umpire. \"Call the supervisor. It always happens to me, every time. You understand that I always have to advocate for myself, all the time. I'm getting cheated in this game. You guys are not fair to me.\"\n\nAfter trailing during the second set, Gauff claimed that she missed her shot because a line official distracted her as he called a shot from Vekic as she was preparing to return the ball. When the call was overturned, it gave the Croatian tennis player the edge she needed to win the game.\n\nGauff later addressed the situation, calling for video reviews of games in the future.\n\n\"There's been multiple times this year where that's happened to me -- where I felt like I always have to be an advocate for myself on the court,\" she said. \"These points are big deals. Usually afterward, they apologize. So it's kind of frustrating. The 'Sorry' doesn't help you once the match is over. I can't say I would have won the match if I would have won that point.\"\n\nAlthough she's been eliminated from the women's singles competition, Gauff is still competing in women's doubles and mixed doubles.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [{"uri": "olivia_hebert@independent.co.uk", "name": "Olivia Hebert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Village", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Village"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daria_Saville", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daria Saville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Perez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ellen Perez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajla_Tomljanovi\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ajla Tomljanovi\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Veki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donna Veki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Pegula", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Pegula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_tennis_match", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Types of tennis match"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umpire_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Umpire (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/30/18/newFile-1.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770346", "eventUri": "eng-9770346", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Carle did make the American work to close out the one-set lead, holding three break points at 5-1 before Gauff finally converted her fourth set point.\n\nAt 5-1 in the second set, Gauff slammed a backhand crosscourt winner to earn her first match point, which she converted when Carle found the net with a forehand error. Gauff converted six of her eight break points on Monday, while only dropping serve once.\n\nIn the Round of 16, Gauff will have her first career meeting with No.13 seed Donna Vekic of Croatia. Vekic, who made the first Grand Slam semifinal of her career earlier this month at Wimbledon, defeated 2019 US Open champion Bianca Andreescu of Canada 6-3, 6-4 on Monday.\n\nNo.8 seed Danielle Collins and No.11 seed Emma Navarro each needed to go three sets on Monday, but they both joined their fellow American Gauff in the Round of 16.\n\nNinth-ranked Collins defeated former World No.1 Caroline Wozniacki of Denmark 6-3, 3-6, 6-3 in 2 hours and 12 minutes. Collins fought back from an early break down in the final set to collect the win.\n\nMaking her Olympic debut in her final year on tour, Collins won just over half the points returning Wozniacki's first serve on Monday, denying the 2018 Australian Open champion a chance for her first Olympic medal. Collins will now take on Colombia's Camila Osorio for a spot in the quarterfinals.\n\nNavarro battled back from a set down to hold off Bulgaria's Viktoriya Tomova 6-7(5), 6-4, 6-1 in nearly two-and-a-half hours on Monday. Navarro converted half of her 16 break points on the day.\n\nCurrently ranked a career-high No.15, Navarro will have a Round-of-16 clash with Zheng Qinwen of China, the No.6 seed and 2024 Australian Open finalist. Navarro is 2-6 against Top 10 players so far this year.", "source": {"uri": "wtatennis.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Women's Tennis Association"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_tennis_match", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Types of tennis match"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Veki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donna Veki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camila_Osorio", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Camila Osorio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zheng_Qinwen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zheng Qinwen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Navarro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emma Navarro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danielle_Collins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Danielle Collins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caroline_Wozniacki", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caroline Wozniacki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bianca_Andreescu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bianca Andreescu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktoriya_Tomova", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Viktoriya Tomova"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://photoresources.wtatennis.com/photo-resources/2024/07/29/93d2df56-29fa-4899-8e09-ff22b53dec6c/GettyImages-2163707725.jpg?width=1200&height=630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770346", "eventUri": "eng-9770346", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

The 20-year-old tennis sensation tearfully argued with an umpire over what she believed was a wrong call before eventually losing the matchup.\n\nTuesday morning (July 30), the USA flag bearer faced off against Donna Vekic of Croatia. In the contended scenario, she served the ball to Vekic, who returned the serve near the baseline. The line judge called the ball out and Gauff did not keep it in play. However, the chair umpire, Jaume Campistol, believed Vekic's return landed inside the boundaries, and awarded her the point, giving her a 4-2 lead in the process.\n\nGauff walked over to the official and was visibly emotional as she advocated on her behalf. \"I never argue these calls. But he called it out before I hit the ball,\" she told Campistol. \"It's not even a perception; it's the rules.\" Though Gauff was already losing, this officiating decision made her ability to come back even more of a mountain to climb.\n\nThe situation especially stung for Gauff because she experienced a similar scenario on the same court, Court Philippe Cartier, where she lost to Iga Swiatek in a semifinal matchup last month. This wasn't her first time arguing with a chair umpire either, as she did so when she won her first 2023 US Open match. \"There's been multiple times this year where that's happened to me -- where I felt like I always have to be an advocate for myself on the court,\" she said after her loss. \"I felt that he called it before I hit, and I don't think the ref disagreed. I think he just thought it didn't affect my swing, which I felt like it did.\"\n\nGauff acknowledged that she was already trailing and that one decision wasn't an entire determinant of the match's result, but it didn't help, either. \"These points are big deals,\" she said. \"Usually afterward, they apologize. So it's kind of frustrating. The 'sorry' doesn't help you once the match is over. I can't say I would have won the match if I would have won that point [...] I'm not going to sit here and say one point affected the result today because I was already on the losing side of things.\"\n\nHer initial goal was to leave Paris with three medals, but that is no more.

I think I was picking the right balls to be aggressive on and the positivity as well.\"\n\nGauff -- who is also competing in women's doubles with Jessica Pegula and mixed doubles with Taylor Fritz -- was asked if she was staying in the Olympic Village, where most athletes stay.\n\n\"I was going to move with some of the tennis athletes to our hotel, but I kept meeting all these amazing athletes staying in the village and Rafa's [Spanish tennis legend Rafael Nadal] staying in the village.

The No. 2 women's tennis player in the world is moving on to Round 3 after defeating Argentina's Maria Lourdes Carle 6-1, 6-1.\n\nThe score makes it look like it was easy for Gauff to defeat Carle, ranked No. 85 in the world, but it was a battle. To nail down the win, Gauff had to work harder than she did on Sunday against Ajla Tomljanovic. It took Gauff just 57 minutes to defeat Tomljanovic in straight sets. Against Carle, the first set alone took 46 minutes -- even though Carle only won one game. But Carle had the power to seriously challenge Gauff. The rallies were longer, stretching out the games.\n\nCarle gave Gauff a legitimate fight, even if the score doesn't show it. But Gauff's backhand was working well for her, and she was fearless at the net. Even when Carle kept pushing back, Gauff never lost her head, staying smooth and confident the entire time. And at just 20 years old.\n\nIt was a little odd, however, that NBC didn't think it was necessary to assign any commentators to this broadcast. Gauff isn't just the No. 2 player in the world, she's also the highest-ranked American tennis player of any gender at the Olympics.

Our Olympics tennis odds series has our Carle Gauff prediction and pick. Find out how to watch Carle Gauff.\n\nIga Swiatek is the clear favorite at the 2024 Olympics in women's singles. The reason is simple: The tournament is being played on red clay at Stade Roland Garros, the home of the French Open. Swiatek has won four of the last five French Opens and is the dominant No. 1 clay-court player in the world by a very, very large margin. Swiatek handled Coco Gauff rather easily and routinely in this year's French Open, much as she did in the 2022 French Open singles final. Given that Swiatek is Polish, \"Roland Garros\" has often been referred to as \"Poland Garros\" in recent years due to Swiatek's dominance.\n\nCoco Gauff might not be ready to beat Swiatek, but she certainly would love to give herself another chance to get at the World No. 1 in Paris. It would be for an Olympic gold medal. Gauff would be able to play with nothing to lose and clinch a silver medal for Team USA. Gauff's journey to what she hopes will be a gold medal match -- she is listed as the second choice to win this tournament, behind only Swiatek -- continues on Monday against Maria Carle of Argentina. Carle opened some eyes with a 6-0, 6-0 thrashing of German veteran Tatjana Maria in the first round. It might have been the case that Tatjana might have had a bad day at the office, but a double-bagel scoreline always gets noticed in the players' locker room. Carle will certainly carry a lot of confidence onto the court.\n\nHere are the Maria Carle-Coco Gauff 2024 Olympics Tennis odds, courtesy of FanDuel.\n\n2024 Olympics Tennis Odds: Maria Carle-Coco Gauff Odds\n\nTime: Approx. 7:30 a.m. ET / 4:30 a.m. PT -- could be 45 minutes later depending on length of previous match\n\nThe ability to win a 6-0, 6-0 match shows that Maria Carle is playing really well. The caliber of opponent matters, yes, but anytime a player steps onto the court and wins every game she plays, that's something to file away in the notebook. Coco Gauff might be playing a tougher opponent than most people realize. Just because most fans haven't heard of Maria Lourdes Carle, that doesn't mean she won't be ready for this challenge. The spread is 6.5 games, so if Carle loses 6-3, 6-3, she will cover the spread. That seems very reasonable as a scenario for this match.\n\nWhy Coco Gauff Could Cover The Spread\n\nGauff knows she is playing Olympic doubles and therefore will not be inclined to waste time. She knows she needs a quick match so that she will have full energy for doubles and can make a run at mutliple medals at the Paris Summer Olympics.\n\nFinal Maria Carle-Coco Gauff Prediction & Pick\n\nThis looks like a match which won't be close. Carle isn't in the same league as Gauff, and Coco will want to be efficient because she is also playing Olympic doubles. She does not need a long match.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_zemek@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Matthew Zemek", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatjana_Maria", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tatjana Maria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_tennis_match", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Types of tennis match"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Maria-Carle-vs-Coco-Gauff-2024-Olympics-Tennis-prediction.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770346", "eventUri": "eng-9770346", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

They are booing you because you are wrong,\" she told Tourte before stating she had \"the right to finish my swing.\" She was also reportedly heard telling Tourte, \"You should be ashamed\" and \"know the rules of the game.\"\n\nFollowing the June 6 loss, Gauff declared that the sport should implement a video review system, as it is one of the few professional sports to not have one.\n\n\"A lot of times the decisions are made by one person. In other sports there are usually multiple refs making a decision,\" she said after the match, per CNN. \"I know the U.S. Open brought some of it last year, I believe, I know we used it in our doubles at one point. I definitely think at this point it's almost ridiculous we don't have it. Not just speaking because that happened to me, but I just think every sport has it.\"\n\nGauff's recent loss isn't the end of her Paris Olympics journey. She and Taylor Fritz will compete in the first round of mixed doubles on Tuesday, followed by Gauff and Jessica Pegula' second round of women's doubles on Wednesday, July 31.\n\nAfter having to withdraw from the 2020 Tokyo Olympics after contracting COVID-19, Gauff made her Olympics debut in Paris. She also served as one of Team USA's opening ceremony flag bearers alongside basketball legend LeBron James.\n\n\"Not only am I here, playing my first Olympics, I have the honor to be the flag bearer, which is something I never thought in my lifetime,\" she said on Today earlier this month. \"I usually have goals, and I wouldn't say predict, but I believe I can do certain things. And I definitely would never have believed or predicted that I could do this.\"", "source": {"uri": "usmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Us Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paige_strout@usmagazine.com", "name": "Paige Strout", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Veki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donna Veki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umpire_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Umpire (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_tennis_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_singles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Table tennis at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's singles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Professional sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Mixed_doubles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Mixed doubles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_doubles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's doubles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_at_the_2008_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_doubles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis at the 2008 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's doubles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Fritz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Fritz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Pegula", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Pegula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard-bearer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Standard-bearer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Coco-Gauff-Cries-at-Umpire-Before-Olympics-Tennis-Singles-Loss-2.jpg?crop=178px%2C16px%2C1822px%2C955px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770346", "eventUri": "eng-9770346", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 149, "textEnd": 156}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 1170, "textEnd": 1176}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 1973, "textEnd": 1980}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Gauff argued her shot was compromised by the initial call.\n\n\"I have to advocate for myself all the time,\" a weeping Gauff, 20, said on court. \"I'm getting cheated in this game. You guys are not fair to me.\"\n\nLater, a more composed Gauff called for a video review system at Roland Garros to match those in place at other Grand Slam venues.\n\n\"I can't say I would have won the match if I would have won that point but, for sure, being not a break, whereas maybe replaying that point can make a big difference in that game,\" she said.\n\nVekic, ranked 21, briefly lost her composure, slipping to 0-40 on her own serve before recovering to hold, and she broke again to seal victory.\n\nThe Wimbledon semifinalist said the row over the line call was a \"tricky situation\".\n\n\"After that, the crowd, it was not so easy,\" she said. \"I lost my concentration for a couple of points, but I'm happy that I managed to come back in that game because it was an important game.\"\n\nGermany's defending men's champion Alexander Zverev coasted into the third round with a 6-3, 7-5 win over 39th-ranked Czech Tomas Machac.\n\nIn the women's draw, three-time Grand Slam champion Angelique Kerber of Germany progressed to the quarter-finals along with US eighth seed Danielle Collins and China's Zheng Qinwen.\n\nWomen's world number one Iga Swiatek targets a 24th straight win on the clay courts of Paris against China's Wang Xiyu in the evening session.\n\nNadal, a 14-time French Open champion, was swept off court by old rival Novak Djokovic in straight sets in the pair's 60th meeting on Monday.\n\nThe 38-year-old, immortalised in a statue at Roland Garros, has been plagued by injuries in recent years and is now 161st in the world.\n\nNadal said after his painful defeat to Djokovic that he would make a decision on his future after the Olympics.\n\nBut the Spaniard, who won singles gold at the 2008 Beijing Games and doubles gold in Rio in 2016, can

This weekend, after her first tennis event was rescheduled due to inclement weather, the tennis star took to TikTok to share an inside look at life in the Olympic Village.\n\nIn a seven-second video, Gauff showcased how chaotic the getting-ready process is among the 10 female athletes forced to share two bathrooms. Using a \"rage\" sound effect, Gauff jokingly seemed overwhelmed as she showcased the various women doing hair and makeup, and getting dressed in various corners of each room and bathroom.\n\n\"10 girls, two bathrooms #olympicvillage,\" Gauff captioned the video.\n\nThough getting ready may require a bit more patience, the 20-year-old athlete is enjoying the Olympic lifestyle. So much so that she opted to stay in the official village while some of her other teammates moved into hotels. Using the opportunity to network, connect and learn from the best, Gauff is reportedly happy to stay with the other athletes on-site.\n\n\"I mean, I had breakfast with Noah Lyles this morning, so hopefully some of his greatness can rub off of me. So that's why I'm in the village,\" she said, per People magazine. \"Just rubbing toes and I'm really trying to take everything in and learn from all the athletes that I am around. I'm a rookie compared to most of them, so I have a lot to learn.\"\n\nUnlike Gauff, some of her teammates decamped to hotels shortly after arriving in Paris. As Emma Navarro, a Team USA tennis star explained, living in the village was too much for her. According to the star, the decision came from the lack of sleep she experienced while in the communal housing.\n\nRecommended Stories\n\n\"Yeah, I stayed in there for three nights, I think, but I didn't sleep basically at all; I slept cumulatively six hours, so I had to move out and go to the hotel,\" Navarro told People magazine, confirming that Gauff is still in the Olympic house. \"It was an incredible experience just getting to be in the village. And we rode an elevator with Katie Ledecky and met Simone Biles and saw so many incredible athletes. So that's something I'll never forget.\"\n\nSo far, Gauff's Olympic debut has been nothing short of memorable. In addition to making a comeback after COVID interfered with her ability to compete in 2020, the 20-year-old tennis champion was chosen to be Team USA's female flag bearer during the opening ceremony alongside LeBron James. Emotional and shocked by the moment, Gauff was even more surprised to learn her family knew about the honor before her.\n\n\"They knew the news before me -- which, I thought I was gonna surprise them on the phone, and [my mom] was like, 'Yeah, I already knew,'\" Gauff told People. \"So I was like, 'Yeah, that's great.' But I'm glad that they'll be able to come and be here. I know they're excited.\"\n\nUltimately, the tennis star is embracing every moment of the 2024 Paris Olympics as she prepares to compete in women's singles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles, which add up to multiple matches a day.\n\n\"I just love winning; I love the vibes,\" she added. \"I probably won't be doing that much more longer, but I feel like if you're [in the] Olympics, I'm always going to try to push and do all three [events] until the wheels fall off.\"", "source": {"uri": "thegrio.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheGrio"}, "authors": [{"uri": "haniyah_philogene@thegrio.com", "name": "Haniyah Philogene", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Village", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Village"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Navarro", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emma Navarro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_at_the_2008_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_doubles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis at the 2008 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's doubles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_tennis_match", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Types of tennis match"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Carlos_Navarro_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juan Carlos Navarro (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Ledecky", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Katie Ledecky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://thegrio.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2164084595-e1722270796510.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770346", "eventUri": "eng-9770346", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

However, her singles run came to a controversial end in the third round on Tuesday.\n\nAccording to ESPN, during her match against Croatia's Donna Vekic, a disputed call led Gauff to challenge chair umpire Jaume Campistol. The incident came in the second set as Vekic had a crucial break point while leading 3-2. As Coco was returning a shot, the ball was called out in the middle of her hitting motion, disrupting her swing. The chair umpire then overruled the call and said it was in, giving Vekic the point and the game.\n\nThe world No. 2 argued that the point should've been replayed since her shot was interrupted. Campistol and a tournament supervisor disagreed, leading Coco to tearfully proclaim that \"It always happens here at the French Open to me. Every time.\" She's referencing a similar moment during her 2024 French Open semi-final match against eventual champion Iga Swiatek.\n\n\"There's been multiple times this year where that's happened to me -- where I felt like I always have to be an advocate for myself on the court,\" Gauff said after the match.\n\n\"I felt that he called it before I hit, and I don't think the ref disagreed,\" she continued. \"I think he just thought it didn't affect my swing, which I felt like it did.\"\n\nIn watching the point, there's no denying that the call came when the reigning US Open champion was in the middle of her shot. Usually, when a player's swing is disrupted by outside actions and the umpire feels they could've reasonably played the shot, the point is replayed. However, it's up to the umpire to decide if they had a chance to play the original point. Sometimes, they get it wrong.\n\nWhile Coco was right about the point being replayed, she acknowledged that she wasn't delivering her best tennis and this one moment wasn't the sole reason she eventually lost 7-6, 6-2 to Vekic.\n\n\"I'm not going to sit here and say one point affected the result today, because I was already on the losing side of things,\" she said.\n\nTennis players arguing with chair umpires isn't an unusual occurrence. It's part of the sport. Some stars have even made a whole career out of it. However, we've seen in the past with Coco, as well as Serena and Venus Williams, that when Black women challenge chair umpires, it's treated differently. They're called \"emotional,\" or the story is framed that they \"lost it.\" The Florida native was fighting for herself the way other players do, but the narrative is being presented as her \"melting down.\" It's definitely time for this part of the story to change.\n\nGauff now turns her full focus to mixed doubles, where she's partnered with the top ranked American man, Taylor Fritz, and women's doubles, where she's playing with her regular partner, Jessica Pegula.\n\n\"At the end of the day, if anything, doubles make you want to go out there more. You don't want to ruin someone else's chances based off your mentality,\" Gauff said. \"Taylor and I were talking about it earlier: A medal is a medal. I have two other events I can possibly do that in, so I'm just focused on that.\"\n\nTennis at the 2024 Paris Olympics is streaming on Peacock.", "source": {"uri": "theroot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Root"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Veki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donna Veki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_tennis_match", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Types of tennis match"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Fritz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Fritz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Pegula", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Pegula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williams_sisters", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Williams sisters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/87e14686048507248c03e3bf794b1f5b.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770346", "eventUri": "eng-9770346", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

As happened at the US Open, before she became champion, and during the semifinal against Iga Swiatek at Roland Garros last June 6, the young American had to deal with another nervous breakdown at the Olympic Games for what in her eyes was a serious error by the chair umpire.\n\nOn the important break point conceded to Donna Vekic in the central part of the second set, the Croatian's shot ended near the baseline and the line judge also called, while Gauff was about to make her shot. The umpire came down to check the mark and, judging the ball fair, directly awarded the point to Vekic, believing that Gauff had not been influenced by the call in question.\n\nGauff immediately reached the umpire and asked for the Supervisor to intervene to protest.

She made the final at Roland Garros in 2022, and just last month won the women's doubles trophy alongside Jessica Pegula. She doesn't just know the court, she knows how to be successful on it.\n\nTomljanovic, ranked No. 123 in the world, doesn't have the same love for clay as Gauff does. According to the broadcast, it's her least favorite surface. Despite that, she had a good showing in the first set, finding ways to break Gauff's rhythm and force a few errors. While Gauff won the set, Tomljanovic prevented Gauff, one of the most athletic and daring players on the women's tour, from utterly dominating her.\n\nThat did not carry over to the second set. Tomljanovic's game almost entirely collapsed, and Gauff took advantage. She absolutely feasted on Tomljanovic's errors and took advantage of her flagging speed. And with Gauff turning on the juice, the match was over in a flash. While it took her 34 minutes to win the first set, which had been fairly competitive, it took her just 23 minutes to bagel Tomljanovic and put the match to bed.\n\nIn the second round, Gauff will face Maria Lourdes Carle of Argentina.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajla_Tomljanovi\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ajla Tomljanovi\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_at_the_2008_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_doubles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis at the 2008 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's doubles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Pegula", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Pegula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagel_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bagel (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Women", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Women", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ytflmA_5JdQ1U_fQfURsHw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-07/ee03c4c0-4d0e-11ef-9b7f-5afeb317bcf2", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770346", "eventUri": "eng-9770346", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

Team USA's flagbearer Gauff is still active in all three disciplines this week: women's singles, women's doubles and mixed doubles.\n\nThis was the first professional meeting between Gauff and Carle, but they had faced off twice before during their successful junior careers. Gauff won both of those matches, in the 2017 Junior US Open semifinals and the Round of 16 at 2018 Junior Wimbledon.\n\nWorld No.2 Gauff maintained initial command in their rivalry on her way to a 5-0 lead on Monday. Carle did make the American work to close out the one-set lead, holding three break points at 5-1 before Gauff finally converted her fourth set point.\n\nAt 5-1 in the second set, Gauff slammed a backhand crosscourt winner to earn her first match point, which she converted when Carle found the net with a forehand error. Gauff converted six of her eight break points on Monday, while only dropping serve once.\n\nIn the Round of 16, Gauff will have her first career meeting with No.13 seed Donna Vekic of Croatia. Vekic, who made the first Grand Slam semifinal of her career earlier this month at Wimbledon, defeated 2019 US Open champion Bianca Andreescu of Canada 6-3, 6-4 on Monday.\n\nCollins, Navarro advance: No.8 seed Danielle Collins and No.11 seed Emma Navarro each needed to go three sets on Monday, but they both joined their fellow American Gauff in the Round of 16.\n\nNinth-ranked Collins defeated former World No.1 Caroline Wozniacki of Denmark 6-3, 3-6, 6-3 in 2 hours and 12 minutes. Collins fought back from an early break down in the final set to collect the win.\n\nMaking her Olympic debut in her final year on tour, Collins won just over half the points returning Wozniacki's first serve on Monday, denying the 2018 Australian Open champion a chance for her first Olympic medal. Collins will now take on Colombia's Camila Osorio for a spot in the quarterfinals.\n\nNavarro battled back from a set down to hold off Bulgaria's Viktoriya Tomova 6-7(5), 6-4, 6-1 in nearly two-and-a-half hours on Monday. Navarro converted half of her 16 break points on the day.\n\nCurrently ranked a career-high No.15, Navarro will have a Round-of-16 clash with Zheng Qinwen of China, the No.6 seed and 2024 Australian Open finalist. Navarro is 2-6 against Top 10 players so far this year.\n\nSvitolina takes down Pegula: But Team USA suffered its first loss of the singles competition in the evening session on Court Philippe Chatrier when former World No.3 Elina Svitolina of Ukraine ousted No.5 seed Jessica Pegula 4-6, 6-1, 6-3.\n\nSvitolina continues to excel at the Olympic Games, having won seven of her last eight singles matches at Olympiads. Svitolina won the bronze medal in singles at the 2021 Tokyo Games and is still in the hunt for another medal this time around.\n\nSvitolina will next face reigning Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova of the Czech Republic for a spot in the quarterfinals. No.9 seed Krejcikova defeated China's Wang Xinyu 6-3, 6-2 on Monday.\n\nKrejcikova beat Svitolina in their only previous meeting -- a 6-3, 6-2 victory at 2021 Roland Garros en route to her first Grand

It comes from a ton of hard work on and off the court, but Gauff says one of her superpowers is a sense of balance that came after years of striving for excellence in the sport to the partial detriment of other areas of her life.\n\n\"My grandmother, she's always like, 'There's more to life than this,'\" Gauff recalled to The New York Times. \"I can relax in these situations. It's just a tennis match. It's not the end of the world. There's so many people going through so many, like, uncomfortable situations. I mean, obviously being nervous is natural -- but for me to think that winning a tennis match or losing a tennis match is the end of the world, I think just kind of shows what kind of privilege I have.\"\n\nC'mon, you love her, don't you? Find out how much Coco Gauff is worth and how she got there with such a level head.\n\nRelated: Roger Federer's Net Worth\n\nHow did Coco Gauff become famous?\n\nBorn in Atlanta on March 13, 2004, Cori \"Coco\" Gauff began playing tennis when she was just 6 years old before moving with her family to Delray Beach, Florida, a year later to pursue further tennis training at the New Generation Tennis Academy.\n\nGauff's parents left their jobs to focus on her training. Her father, a former healthcare executive, became her coach, and her mother homeschooled her.\n\nBy the time Gauff was 10, she trained in France with Patrick Mouratoglou, who previously trained Serena Williams. In 2014, Gauff won the USTA Clay Court National 12-and-Under tournament when she was 10 years and three months old, becoming the youngest player in history to do so, per ESPN.\n\nGauff became the No. 1 junior tennis star in the world, and in 2017, became the youngest girls' singles finalist ever in the history of the U.S. Open. A year later, she won her first junior Grand Slam at the French Open and the junior doubles Grand Slam at the U.S. Open.\n\nGauff went pro in 2018 when she was just 14 years old, and at 15, upset none other than Venus Williams five times at Wimbledon. She competed in several more tournaments, including the U.S., Canadian, French, Miami, Italian and Australian Opens, for several years. She was selected to compete in the 2020 Olympics but had to withdraw after contracting COVID-19.\n\nIn August 2023, Gauff became the first teenager to win the Washington Open, and she followed a month later winning the U.S. Open -- becoming the first teenager to win since Serena Williams in 1999.\n\nIn 2024, Gauff ranked No. 2 in the world in tennis singles and was chosen as a Team USA flag bearer for the Paris Olympics opening ceremonies with LeBron James.\n\nRelated: LeBron James' Net Worth\n\nWhat is Coco Gauff's net worth in 2024?\n\nCoco Gauff's net worth in 2024 is estimated to be anywhere between $3.5 million and $21.7 million, depending on the source. Based on her career earnings and endorsements, the true number is likely somewhere between the two.\n\nRelated: Serena Williams' Net Worth\n\nHow does Coco make her money?\n\nAccording to Forbes, Gauff has won $6.7 million in tennis matches and tournaments, but the bulk of her wealth -- a reported $15 million -- comes from endorsements.\n\nHow much has Coco Gauff made in endorsements?\n\nGauff has raked in the cash with endorsement deals to become the highest-paid female athlete in the world in 2023: Tennis.com reported that she made $23 million that year alone, with $16 million coming from endorsements.\n\nRelated: Venus Williams on Work-Life Balance\n\nWho is Coco Gauff's sponsor?\n\nShe has several: The Palm Beach Post reports that Gauff has endorsements from Ray Ban and Meta (for their smart glasses), as well as Barilla, Baker Tilly, Beats by Dre, Bose, New Balance and UPS, to name a few.\n\nDoes Coco Gauff endorse New Balance?\n\nGauff is sponsored by New Balance, but the details of the deal are private. It's estimated that she makes at least $1 million annually from the sneaker brand.\n\nWhy is Coco Gauff sponsored by Barilla?\n\nUh, why not? That said, Barilla and Gauff have said their partnership is inspired by her interest in nutrition to fuel her on the court. Gauff's deal with Barilla is to help bring brand awareness to the pasta manufacturer's red lentil and chickpea pastas.\n\n\"Coco partnering with us on Barilla 'Serving Love' is our latest opportunity to delight fans with our chickpea and red lentil pastas, which are a good source of protein, made with just one ingredient and zero additives,\" Barilla marketing director Angela Cotter told Little Black Book Online. \"Because when love is pure, there's no need for extras -- in other words, zero equals love, just like in tennis. Add in the fact that protein is a fundamental food for athletes, choosing Coco for the Serving Love campaign felt like a natural fit.\"\n\nNext, Sports Trivia Questions and Answers", "source": {"uri":

Djokovic beats rival Nadal at the Paris Olympics in their 60th and likely last head-to-head matchup\n\nCoco Gauff suffered a shock elimination in her first singles match at the Paris Olympic Games, the third round of the competition, and she didn't take the defeat well, complaining that she was cheated by the umpire.\n\nThe American was one of the favourites for the competition but her journey was halted at the first hurdle, and her post-match breakdown will not do her any favours personally.\n\nDonna Vekic defeated the world no.2 in straight sets - 7-6(7), 6-2 - but the American was still adamant that a moment midway through the second set was the reason for her downfall.\n\nThe chair umpire called one of Vekic's shots out, before Gauff returned a shot that was also out. Gauff contested that the call influenced her shot and that the point should be replayed, but the umpire awarded the point to the Croatian.\n\nThis resulted in Vekic going 4-2 up in the second set, before eventually going on to win the set and the match comfortably.\n\nGauff was visibly affected, as she was in tears at the end of the game and remonstrating with the umpire over the perceived injustice.\n\n\"I feel like I'm getting cheated constantly in this game. This is the third time this happens to me this year,\" Gauff said after the game.\n\n\"It always happens to me on this court. Call the supervisor. It always happens to me, every time.

Gauff recently put a video on social media to give fans a sneak peek into the challenging life at the Olympics 2024.\n\nThe World No.2 is facing issues mainly because of being the 'only' American tennis player remaining in the village. Firstly, the cardboard mattresses do not give athletes like her the much-required comfort they need for rest and sleep. Gauff's co-athletes decided to move out of the village and opt for private accommodation as the condition of the quarters is apparently not up to the mark.\n\nIn order to resolve this issue, Gauff had to borrow a mattress topper from one of the archers of the American archery team. In a social media post (via New York Post), she also revealed that they were only provided 2 washrooms, which had to be shared amongst 10 athletes. So a lack of privacy there and perhaps, hygiene issues are challenges for top-level athletes.\n\nCurrently the most successful women's tennis player in the United States, Gauff has the highest chance of winning a medal for the country in the sport. In this case, her video about the difficulties being faced at the Paris 2024 is concerning and raises several questions for organizers.\n\nThe 20-year-old, who was also USA's flag bearer for the tournament along with basketball legend LeBron James, shared a video on her TikTok account where she showed everyone the chaotic conditions of the Village. In her video, it can be seen how her teammates tried to get ready and do their hair and makeup, amidst all the hustle and crowded space in their temporary accommodation.\n\nHowever, despite these challenges in the Village, the American No.1 has been killing it on the court in the tournament. She headed to a winning start in the Olympics in two events.\n\nAlongside Jessica Pegula, she beat the Australian duo of Ellen Perez and Daria Saville in the first round of the women's doubles on Saturday. Her singles campaign also kicked off with a victory after she defeated Australia's Ajla Tomljanovi\u0107 on the same day.\n\nGauff defeated France's M.L. Carl\u00e9 in the second round on Monday. She is awaiting her opponents for the third round in the singles and the second round of women's doubles. In mixed doubles, Gauff is paired up with the American men's No.1 player, Taylor Fritz.\n\nGauff has a fantastic opportunity to win as many as three medals for the United States in one Olympics edition, as long as the scheduling is in her favor.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nandini_rikhee@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Nandini Rikhee", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Archery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daria_Saville", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daria Saville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Perez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ellen Perez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Fritz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Fritz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajla_Tomljanovi\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ajla Tomljanovi\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Pegula", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Pegula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_tennis_match", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Types of tennis match"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/04/a5e075e0-untitled-design-36.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770346", "eventUri": "eng-9770346", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

Gauff got into an argument with the chair umpire close to the finish of that match over an officiating decision.\n\nEven after the two setbacks, Gauff still had something to play for in Paris, where she was one of the U.S. flag bearers during last week's opening ceremony and had hoped to head home with three medals. She was scheduled to play in mixed doubles with Taylor Fritz later Wednesday.\n\nGauff arrived in France as one of the biggest stars in her, or any, sport.\n\nThe 20-year-old from Florida won her first Grand Slam singles championship at the U.S. Open last September, and she collected her first major doubles title at the French Open in June -- although not with Pegula, who was out injured, but with Katerina Siniakova of the Czech Republic.\n\nGauff also has reached a singles final at the French Open, losing the trophy to Iga Swiatek in 2022. That major tournament is played each year at Roland Garros, the same clay-court facility being used to host Paris Games tennis matches.\n\nMuchova was the runner-up to Swiatek at the French Open last year and also made it to the semifinals at the U.S. Open before losing to Gauff in a match interrupted for 50 minutes by a climate protest.\n\nMuchova returned to action in June after missing 10 months because of surgery on her right wrist.\n\nWednesday's match was delayed because of rain right before Noskova served for the second set with the Czechs ahead 5-4. When play resumed, they took that set, then dominated the first-to-10, win-by-two match tiebreaker that is used in place of a traditional third set for all doubles matches at the Olympics.\n\nNoskova closed out the victory with a volley winner.\n\nHer biggest achievement to date came at the Australian Open in January, when she beat Swiatek in the third round. That made Noskova the first teenager to beat a No. 1-ranked woman at Melbourne Park since 1999.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_tennis_match", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Types of tennis match"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Pegula", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Pegula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Noskov\u00e1", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Linda Noskov\u00e1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karol\u00edna_Muchov\u00e1", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karol\u00edna Muchov\u00e1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Veki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donna Veki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiebreaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tiebreaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Fritz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Fritz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate\u0159ina_Siniakov\u00e1", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kate\u0159ina Siniakov\u00e1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Melbourne Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volley_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volley (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Arm_Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Arm Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/V4rtCkWsD.EHZMWeXfAbsQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/4828a07570cd9d462acf303ed3f584cf", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770346", "eventUri": "eng-9770346", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

According to the New York Post, Ms Gauff gave a 7-second tour of the American women's tennis players inside the $1.6 billion housing complex. \"10 girls, two bathrooms. #olympicvillage,\" the 20-year-old wrote in a TikTok video on Saturday.\n\nThe clip showed Team USA Olympians doing their hair and makeup and getting dressed across a few rooms throughout the hectic suite, the Post reported. In the comments section, when one user suggested the athletes should move to a hotel, Ms Gauff responded by saying that some had done that already. \"All the tennis girls moved to a hotel except me. So now just five girls, two bathrooms,\" she wrote.\n\nThe tennis star revealed that the rooms were meant for 8 people but were being shared by 10. The 20-year-old said that she even had to borrow a mattress topper from the US Archery team to counter the thin polyethylene mattresses. Ms Gauff also said she and her roommates kept the room \"very clean\" for the \"well-being of all of us.\"\n\nNotably, the video was shared a day after Ms Gauff shared flag-bearing duties with basketball star LeBron James. The New York Post reported that Team USA Basketball is not staying in the Olympic Village either.\n\n\"The last few times I've done the Olympics, we've spent our fair share in the Olympic Village and felt like a part of the group there,\" Team USA's Kevin Durant said. \"We stay outside of it, but we get our time right before the opening ceremony,\" he added.\n\nAlso Read | Astrologer Who Correctly Predicted Biden Exit Reveals Name Of Next US President\n\nMeanwhile, coming back to Coco Gauff, the 20-year-old made history by becoming the youngest and first tennis player to hoist \"Old Glory\".

I hope that one day the game becomes fair, but it's not.\"\n\nThose were the words of Coco Gauff - world No 2 and reigning US Open champion - after being dragged into a latest contentious line call controversy on Court Philippe Chatrier this summer.\n\nIn her Olympic women's singles round three tie on Tuesday, the second seed was at a crucial juncture of her match against Donna Vekic - down a set, and facing break point.\n\nThe Croatian hit a shot that was called long and in response, Gauff sprayed a groundstroke out of court - but the decision was overturned by umpire Jaume Campistol - and with that went a break of serve\n\nGauff was left incensed on the court, claiming the line call came before she hit her shot and debating heavily with Campistol and the tournament supervisor, ultimately to no avail.\n\n\"I never argue these calls. But he called it out before I hit the ball,\" Gauff protested.\n\n\"It's not even a perception; it's the rules. I always have to advocate for myself.\"\n\nThe US star never seemingly recovered from the incident and, despite holding three break points when play resumed, fell away in a 7-6(7), 6-2 triumph for her opponent.\n\nDebate has raged since about whether Gauff or Campistol was right - but that misses the point.\n\nUltimately, it doesn't matter who was right or wrong in this situation; either way, it was difficult to watch - and is something that should be entirely avoidable.\n\nTennis was ahead of the curve when it came to sports using technology, implementing hawkeye well before football introduced VAR or goal-line technology.\n\nSome events now use automatic line calling and that will become commonplace, but it is not always an option on clay.\n\nThe ex-tennis power couple targeting Paris 2024 gold - despite recent split\n\nRafael Nadal explains why he opted against following Novak Djokovic's Olympic village decision\n\nIn any event still reliant on calls from line judges or the umpire, there should be a video replay system available for umpires and players to double-check decisions such as this.\n\nThousands of fans watching this contest across all corners of the globe could see the replay of the incident, making it baffling that Gauff, Campistol and Vekic were unable to do so.\n\nThe replay suggests Gauff may have been wrong, and being able to see that clearly would have brought more clarity to the situation and could well have ended the debacle that ensued.\n\nIt is pretty immaterial whether she was wrong or right, though, as there is evident distrust from her and other players in similar situations.\n\nThe American was certainly in the right on the very same court during a similar situation in her French Open semi-final against Iga Swiatek back in June.\n\nGauff was again left in tears after a contentious call from Aurelie Tourte that day, and she is by far from the only player caught up in such a controversy.\n\nAlmost every player on the WTA and ATP has been caught up in a controversy such as this at one point in their career - which is not acceptable on any level.\n\n\"I feel like in tennis, we should have a VAR system because these points are big deals,\" said Gauff after the match.\n\n\"Usually, afterwards they apologize. It's kind of frustrating when the sorry doesn't help you once the match is over.\"\n\nShe is correct, and it is beyond belief that tennis officials have not yet come to the same conclusion.", "source": {"uri": "tennis365.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis365.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "oli_dickson_jefford@tennis365.com", "name": "Oli Dickson Jefford", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Veki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donna Veki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundstroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Groundstroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal-line_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goal-line technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_replay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instant replay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Tennis_Professionals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association of Tennis Professionals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Tennis_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's Tennis Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images.ps-aws.com/c?url=https%3A%2F%2Fd2me2qg8dfiw8u.cloudfront.net%2Fcontent%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F07%2F30141517%2FCoco-Gauff-Paris-2024.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770346", "eventUri": "eng-9770346", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

Vekic trailed 4-1 and 5-3 in the opening set, saving a set point on serve there, and later erased two chances for Gauff in the tiebreak to earn her second Top 10 win of the season and 14th of her career.\n\nVekic also earned a win over a player ranked in the world's Top 3 at the last Olympics, having defeated then-No.3 Aryna Sabakenka in Tokyo, but her win over Gauff marked a milestone: All of her previous Top 10 wins came on either hard courts or grass.\n\nHer win also matches the best-ever result for a Croatian woman at the Olympics, as Iva Majoli made the quarterfinals in 1996.\n\nKerber's farewell continues, into Paris Olympic quarterfinals\n\nAfter a tight opening set that lasted more than an hour, Gauff was the first player to break serve in the second set, but ultimately lost the last five games. Vekic's second service break came in controversial fashion. At 30-40, she hit a return deep to Gauff's forehand, which the American mishit into the net.

Trailing 2-3 in the second set and facing break point, Vekic's shot was initially called out mid-rally. It was immediately self-corrected and Gauff sent the ball into the net, with the point awarded to the world No. 21.\n\nThe American argued she was affected by an incorrect call and stormed to the umpire's chair.\n\n\"For me, the call didn't affect your shot,\" he responded. But a furious Gauff retorted: \"He called it out before I hit it. That's why I went up on the ball.\"\n\nThe 20 year-old continued to argue her point and the supervisor was called to the court. Commentator Miles Maclagan said: \"I think the umpire has made the correct call. I have sympathy for both because it happened so quickly and you're not necessarily looking for it either,\"\n\nSupervisor Clare Wood arrived and Gauff turned her attention to her: \"You have to understand, he called it out before I hit it,\" she continued.\n\n\"What's the rule? It's not even a millisecond, he called it when I hit the ball. I understand if it was the same time but it was before. It's not even a perception.\n\n\"I always have to advocate for myself. It happened to me in July, it happened to me here. This isn't fair. This isn't fair. I feel like I'm getting cheated on constantly in this game. I constantly feel like that and then I have to argue. No because I do and then you guys apologise after.\"\n\nAs Gauff vented her frustration, co-commentator Naomi Cavaday chimed in: \"Clare Wood just telling her to be careful here with the language she's using. Vekic is waiting. We don't have video review for the players to use for this. It is a judgement call.\n\n\"If Gauff had hit the ball into the court it would be a replay but because she missed the shot, the point has been awarded to her opponent because the call was wrong.\n\n\"Gauff's argument is that it impacted her shot and the call made her miss. When it happens on the baseline there is such little time between the bounce and your swing that the most likely situation is that the call has not impacted your swing because it's such a reaction, it's so quick, there's no time for it.\"\n\nThe atmosphere turned sour with boos echoing around Court Philippe-Chatrier as the match resumed, and Vekic was overheard reassuring the crowd: \"It's not my fault\".\n\nFollowing the heated exchange, the American failed to secure another game, leading to Vekic clinching a surprising victory with a score of 7-6(7) 6-2.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Veki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donna Veki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_commentator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports commentator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Maclagan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miles Maclagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clare_Wood", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clare Wood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Cavaday", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Naomi Cavaday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis court"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/article33358178.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_tennis-oly-paris-2024.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770346", "eventUri": "eng-9770346", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

Gauff argued her shot was compromised by the initial call.\n\n\"I have to advocate for myself all the time,\" said a weeping Gauff, 20. \"I'm getting cheated in this game.

time to adjust to the conditions because when we warmed up the roof was closed so it was completely different when we came out there,\" she said.\n\n\"The ball was flying a little bit more so it took me a couple of games but after that I think I played pretty well and it was a really tough match.\"\n\nNext up on Philippe-Chatrier was defending men's champion Alexander Zverev, who was taking on

after his painful defeat to Djokovic that he would make a decision on his future after the Olympics.\n\nBut the Spaniard, who won singles gold at the 2008 Beijing Games and doubles gold in Rio in 2016, can still collect a medal in the doubles alongside current French Open and Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz.\n\nThey take on Dutch pair Tallon Griekspoor and Wesley Koolhof.\n\nAnother player

Gauff humorously noted in the caption, \"10 girls, two bathrooms. #olympicvillage.\"\n\nThe Olympic Village, designed to host 14,250 athletes, has faced criticism from some athletes. The tight quarters and limited facilities led many of Gauff's teammates to opt for hotel accommodations.\n\nIn response to a suggestion on social media that the athletes should move to a hotel, Gauff confirmed that all of the other tennis players had already done so, leaving just her and a few others in the Village.\n\nGauff also commented on the basic quality of the living conditions, including the \"anti-sex\" cardboard beds that have been widely discussed.\n\nTo improve her comfort, she borrowed a mattress topper from the US Archery team. Despite these issues, Gauff emphasized the importance of maintaining cleanliness in their shared space for everyone's well-being.\n\nThe video, which has been viewed over 535,000 times, was posted shortly after Gauff shared the honor of carrying the American flag with basketball star LeBron James at the opening ceremony.\n\nHer role as flagbearer made her the youngest and the first tennis player to hold this prestigious position for Team USA. Notably, Team USA basketball, including James, also chose to stay outside the Olympic Village.", "source": {"uri": "marca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MARCA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Village", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Village"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard-bearer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Standard-bearer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flag of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Archery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/9f071825bb1ca19961ed0024ad3199f6/resize/1200/f/webp/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2024/01/22/17059213063081.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770346", "eventUri": "eng-9770346", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

Olympic debutant Gauff will now focus on mixed doubles and women's doubles.\n\nGauff refused to blame the dispute for her loss but insisted, with some justification, that the point should have been replayed because the line judge's initial shout of \"out\" impeded her stroke.\n\n\"I felt that he called it before I hit and I don't think the referee disagreed but he just thought it didn't affect my swing which I felt like it did,\" she told reporters.\n\n\"I mean, there's been multiple times this year where that happened to me, where I feel like I always have to be an advocate for myself on the court.\n\n\"I feel like in tennis we should have a VR (video review) because these points are big deals. Afterwards they apologise, but sorry doesn't help you once the match is over.\n\n\"But I'm not going to sit here and say one point effected the result today, I was already on the losing side of things.\"\n\nThe 28-year-old Vekic suffered a heart-breaking loss to Jasmine Paolini in the Wimbledon semi-finals but has bounced back impressively in Paris.\n\nShe said the atmosphere on the court was one of the best she had played in.\n\n\"It was very, very tough. When we practised this morning the roof was closed so it took me a couple of games to adjust (to the heat). The ball was flying a little bit,\" she said.\n\n\"The support has been unbelievable and I'm having a great time in the village so hopefully I can win one or two matches more.

Gauff argued her shot was compromised by the initial call.\n\n\"I have to advocate for myself all the time,\" a weeping Gauff, 20, said on court. \"I'm getting cheated in this game. You guys are not fair to me.\"\n\nLater, a more composed Gauff called for a video review system at Roland Garros to match those in place at other Grand Slam venues.\n\n\"I can't say I would have won the match if I would have won that point but, for sure, being not a break, whereas maybe replaying that point can make a big difference in that game,\" she said.\n\nVekic, ranked 21, briefly lost her composure, slipping to 0-40 on her own serve before recovering to hold, and she broke again to seal victory.\n\nThe Wimbledon semi-finalist said the row over the line call was a \"tricky situation\".\n\n\"After that, the crowd, it was not so easy,\" she said. \"I lost my concentration for a couple of points, but I'm happy that I managed to come back in that game because it was an important game.\"\n\nGermany's defending men's champion Alexander Zverev coasted into the third round with a 6-3, 7-5 win over 39th-ranked Czech Tomas Machac.\n\nIn the women's draw, three-time Grand

still collect a medal in the doubles alongside current French Open and Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz.\n\nThey take on Dutch pair Tallon Griekspoor and Wesley Koolhof.\n\nBritain's three-time Grand

However, 28-year-old Vekic mounted an impressive comeback, winning the tiebreak and dominating the second set. The match was played in extremely hot conditions, which added to the challenge for both players.\n\nTension picked up in the second set when Gauff disputed a line call that put her 4-2 down. The American player's protests to the umpire and supervisor were unsuccessful, and she was heard saying: \"I'm being cheated.\" Despite support from the crowd, Gauff could not regain her composure, and her game faltered.\n\nVekic's victory marks a significant achievement for Croatian tennis, as she becomes the first player from her country to reach the Olympic women's singles quarter-finals since Iva Majoli in 1996. The 13th seed will now look to continue her strong form in the next round.\n\nWhile Gauff's singles campaign has ended, she will now focus on the mixed doubles and women's doubles events.

Vekic trailed 4-1 and 5-3 in the opening set, saving a set point on serve there, and later erased two chances for Gauff in the tiebreak to earn her second Top 10 win of the season and 14th of her career.\n\nVekic also earned a win over a player ranked in the world's Top 3 at the last Olympics, having defeated then-No.3 Aryna Sabakenka in Tokyo, but her win over Gauff marked a milestone: All of her previous Top 10 wins came on either hard courts or grass.\n\nAfter a tight opening set that lasted more than an hour, Gauff was the first player to break serve in the second set, but ultimately lost the last five games. Vekic's second service break came in controversial fashion. At 30-40, she hit a return deep to Gauff's forehand, which the American mishit into the net. The shot was called out by the line umpire, who then immediately corrected the original call, and the point was awarded to Vekic.\n\nThe decision visibly upset Gauff, who nonetheless led 0-40 in the Croatian's subsequent service game.

He's very confident, and I think I could learn to be more confident, too,\" she says.\n\nGauff, who had the honor of being Team USA's female flagbearer during the opening ceremony, says she's met a ton of her sports heroes in the village, including Biles, Sha'Carri Richardson, Suni Lee, Kelsey Plum and A'ja Wilson.\n\n\"When I have kids I'll be like, 'Yeah, I met all these people, they're like my best friends,' \" Gauff says dryly.\n\nOutside the village, Gauff has a stacked schedule -- she's competing in women's singles, women's doubles and mixed doubles, meaning she's playing multiple matches a day. But after missing out on the 2020 Tokyo Olympics due to testing positive for COVID the day she was supposed to leave, Gauff is soaking it all in.\n\n\"I just love winning, I love the vibes. I probably won't be doing that much more longer, but I feel like if you're Olympics, I'm always going to try to push and do all three [events] until the wheels fall off.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Navarro", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emma Navarro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Village", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Village"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard-bearer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Standard-bearer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Ledecky", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Katie Ledecky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktoriya_Tomova", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viktoriya Tomova"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgaria", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bulgaria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bulgaria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Mixed_doubles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Mixed doubles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_tennis_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_singles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Table tennis at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's singles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_doubles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's doubles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sha'Carri_Richardson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sha'Carri Richardson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunisa_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunisa Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_at_the_2008_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_doubles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis at the 2008 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's doubles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A'ja_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "A'ja Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelsey_Plum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kelsey Plum"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/8eSRSPsrkMtt2MDZDKLSXA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/0fec65b32df5918436b509b520b38f10", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770346", "eventUri": "eng-9770346", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-28", "textStart": 321, "textEnd": 328, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-29", "textStart": 1059, "textEnd": 1066}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

Then, all of a sudden, she wasn't.\n\nHaving been a point away from taking the first set at Roland Garros, Gauff had to watch the contest slip away from her, eventually succumbing to a 7-6(7) 6-2 upset defeat on Court Philippe-Chatrier.\n\nThe most fraught moment of the match came midway through the second set when Gauff was reduced to tears during a heated exchange with chair umpire Jaume Campistol.\n\nA line call on Gauff's baseline was initially deemed out, but Campistol overruled the decision and handed Veki\u0107 a crucial break point. Play was then paused as the American vehemently argued that the point should be replayed as the call was made just before she hit the ball.\n\nThe supervisor also came onto the court and the ensuing debate lasted five minutes, with Gauff wiping tears away from her eyes. Boos and jeers came from the crowd when play was eventually resumed.\n\n\"There's been multiple times this year where that happened to me, where I feel like I always have to be an advocate for myself on the court,\" she later told reporters.\n\n\"And I feel like in tennis, we should have a VR [video review] system because these points are big deals. Usually, afterwards, they apologize, so it's kind of frustrating when the sorry doesn't help you once the match is over.\"\n\nGauff immediately created three break points the following game, but Veki\u0107 shut down the opening, saving the last point with an inch-perfect lob before taking a 4-2 lead in the second set.\n\nThe match was firmly in the Croatian's control from that point, and she closed out the contest to set up a quarterfinal meeting with either Greece's Maria Sakkari or Ukraine's Marta Kostyuk.\n\n\"Donna played well,\" said Gauff. \"She's been playing well throughout Wimbledon 'til now, so I knew it would be a tough match. I think I had a lot of chances in the first, and I felt like if I could clinch that set, it might have helped me in the momentum of the second.\"\n\nThe match was played in the baking midday sun with temperatures expected to reach 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 degrees Celsius) in Paris, though adding in the humidity, the heat index was 104 degrees F (40 degrees C) - easily the hottest day of the Olympics so far.\n\nOn Court Philippe-Chatrier, sun hats and hand-held fans were out in force, and an automated stadium announcement between games reminded spectators to drink water and take regular breaks from the heat.\n\nGauff collapse\n\nGauff, the world No. 2 and a strong pre-tournament contender to medal in the women's singles event, stormed into an early first-set lead, but after seeing a set point saved by Veki\u0107, she lost her break advantage when a forehand drifted wide.\n\nAs the set wore on, Veki\u0107 played the shot of the match at that point, pushing a smash back past her opponent. But Gauff responded in similar fashion the following game, returning a Veki\u0107 smash with a well-timed backhand while her opponent was stranded at the net.\n\nBoth players had set points in the tie-break, but it was Veki\u0107 who capitalized on the opportunity, raising her level when it mattered to take a one-set lead in more than an hour.\n\nVeki\u0107, a semifinalist at Wimbledon earlier this month, lost an early break with a double fault at the start of the second set, but she managed to take the next five games in a row and wrap up the victory in brutal conditions.\n\n\"It was very, very tough out there, the conditions, when we warmed up this morning and the roof was closed,\" Veki\u0107 told reporters. \"It took me a couple of games to adjust; it was very hot.

Did a friend recommend or forward this to you? If so, subscribe here. Have feedback? Leave your questions, comments and concerns through this brief reader survey! Now, here's Mike Sykes.\n\nGood morning, Winners! Welcome back to the Morning Win. Thanks for reading today. Here's your morning medal count as of 9:00 a.m. ET.\n\n-- United States: 20 (3 gold, 8 silver, 9 bronze)\n\n-- France: 16 (5 gold, 8 silver, 3 bronze)\n\n-- Japan: 12 (6 gold, 2 silver, 4 bronze)\n\n-- China: 12 (5 gold, 5 silver, 2 bronze)\n\n-- Korea: 10 (5 gold, 3 silver, 2 bronze)\n\nLet's talk about Katie Ledecky!\n\nCoco Gauff deserves better\n\nThe story of Coco Gauff's loss in straight sets (7-6, 6-2) to Donna Veki\u0107 won't be about the loss.\n\nInstead, it'll be about the argument between Gauff and yet another chair umpire after an erroneous call completely derailed what felt like might be a classic.\n\nREAD MORE: Fans rallied behind a teary-eyed Coco Gauff after a bad call ruined her match\n\nWith the second set at 2-3 and Veki\u0107 playing for a breakpoint, Gauff served the ball into Veki\u0107's forehand. Gauff prepared to hit a return but the line judge called the ball out as she swung. She seemed to pull up after the call and sent the ball into the net.\n\nThe umpire correctly overruled the line judge and ruled the ball in. But the judge also ruled that Gauff lost the point, which gave Veki\u0107 the break she needed to push the match to 4-2.\n\nThat's what caused Gauff's teary-eyed reaction. She felt cheated and it's hard to blame her.\n\nA call was made and Gauff reacted to it. The call was wrong, yes, but it disrupted play. The obvious solution was to replay the point, but instead, we got a heated argument between Gauff and the chair umpire that looked completely embarrassing for the sport.\n\nThis isn't the first time this has happened to Gauff. Just over a month ago at the French Open essentially the same thing happened in Gauff's match against Iga Swiatek. Back then, Gauff argued that tennis needs a replay system to prevent things like this from happening. She's arguing it again here and, honestly, she may be right. For these errors to continue to mar the sport repeatedly isn't the greatest look.\n\nYou know what also isn't the greatest look? Gauff's reaction here. Don't get me wrong. Understandably, she's upset about what keeps happening to her. Anyone would be.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with being an emotional player. We've seen plenty come through the sport and thrive. John McEnroe is the obvious one that comes to mind. Serena Williams got fiery at times on the court, too. But they were able to use that emotion and that fire to thrive.\n\nToday, it seemed, Gauff's emotions were a bit of a hindrance. That's Ok. Gauff is young. She'll learn and get better from this.\n\nLet's hope Roland Garros learns, too, and doesn't continuously allow things to go this far.\n\nKatie Ledecky is still better than everyone else\n\nHere's our daily word from Michelle Martinelli, who has boots on the ground in Paris for the Games. Today's subject is the unmatched brilliance of Katie Ledecky. The longer she goes, the better she is.\n\nNANTERRE, France -- Bonjour, les gagnants! On Day 4 of swimming at the Paris Olympics, Katie Ledecky is doing Katie Ledecky things, like crushing her 1,500-meter freestyle competition in her typically dominant fashion.\n\nThe longer the race, the better Ledecky is, and the 1,500 is her best event -- and one that was FINALLY added to the Olympic lineup at the 2021 Tokyo Games. (It took decades, but organizers finally corrected the absurdly antiquated and sexist thinking that limited the longest Olympic women's event to the 800 when men could swim the 1,500.)\n\nThe world record holder, Ledecky was the first women's 1,500 Olympic champion in Tokyo, setting the Olympic record by default. And after her prelims swim Tuesday, she certainly looks like she'll have no trouble defending her Olympic gold.\n\nLedecky qualified first while fellow American Katie Grimes didn't make the top-8 final, set for Wednesday afternoon Eastern time.\n\nOn a personal note, as a kid watching Olympic swimming, I remember being confused about why women couldn't swim the 1,500 when 10-year-old me could. So to finally see the event in Tokyo on TV and then in person Tuesday in Paris was really something special\n\n.This was my view of Ledecky cruising to the finish in prelims:\n\nThe 10-year-old inside me is crying.\n\n-- Michelle Martinelli \ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7\n\nDon't forget: The MLB trade deadline is today\n\nOlympic buzz has overtaken just about everything. But this might be a pretty important day for your favorite baseball team.\n\nWe've already seen a bit of movement so far. Jazz Chisholm Jr. is a Yankee. Randy Arozarena is a Mariner. There's plenty more to come with so many teams thinking they have a legitimate shot at winning down the stretch of the season. So many contending teams still have holes to fill.\n\nIf you need to play a little catchup, don't worry. We've got you covered.\n\n-- The basics of the MLB trade deadline\n\n-- Nine players who could be dealt at the trade deadline\n\n-- Three teams that should sell and two teams that should buy at the deadline\n\nQuick hits: Incredible surfing photos ... Meet Stephen Nedoroscik\n\n-- Our Mary Clarke put together this incredible gallery of surfing photos from day 3 of the Olympics\n\n-- Stephen Nedoroscik inspired so many memes after coming through in the clutch for U.S. Gymnastics on Monday. Meg Hall has more.\n\n-- Charles Curtis has more on theories that shallow pools are impacting the Olympic swimmers.\n\n-- James McCann somehow remained in the game for the Orioles after taking a fastball to the head. Tyler Netunno has more.\n\n-- Prince Grimes says Anthony Richardson's return to the Colts could disrupt the NFL\n\n-- Frederick Richard's parents are so delightful. Here's Cory Woodroof with more.\n\nThat's a wrap, folks. Thanks so much for reading. We appreciate you! Enjoy the Games. We out.

She's still alive in singles. She has also advanced in the women's doubles bracket with Jessica Pegula. Now she starts her mixed doubles path to what she hopes will be the medal podium. She plays mixed doubles with Taylor Fritz. This will be the first time Gauff and Fritz have played together. It will be fascinating to watch for tennis fans who have seen these players go about their business in singles on the pro tour. Gauff does not have an elite forehand, while Fritz is a relatively conventional American male player who relies on a serve and forehand to win points. American male tennis players over the past 15 years have been serve and forehand and very little else. It's why American tennis players haven't won a major championship since Andy Roddick at the 2003 U.S. Open. However, while Fritz hasn't reached a major semifinal (he came close at Wimbledon but lost to Lorenzo Musetti in the quarterfinals), he has become a solid top-20 player, which is certainly not bad. His serve and his forehand will balance out Gauff's lack of a crushing forehand in this match.\n\nNadia Podoroska is a name diehard tennis fans are aware of. Casual fans won't recall this, but tennis junkies will remember that she reached the 2020 French Open semifinals (during the pandemic, when the tournament was played in early October). She can play ball, especially on red clay. However, she hasn't done a whole lot on tour in the four years since that achievement. Can she summon up some magic alongside veteran doubles player Maximo Gonzalez? This is an intriguing contest on many levels.\n\nHere are the Gauff Fritz vs Podoroska Gonzalez 2024 Olympics tennis odds, courtesy of FanDuel.\n\nOlympics Tennis Odds: Gauff Fritz vs Podoroska Gonzalez Odds\n\nTime: Approx. 1 p.m. ET / 10 a.m. PT -- match could start 60 minutes earlier or later depending on previous matches\n\n*Watch Gauff Fritz vs Podoroska Gonzalez LIVE on fuboTV (click for a free trial)*\n\nWhy Gauff / Fritz Could Cover The Spread\n\nThough Gauff and Fritz are not an experienced doubles team, they are both very talented, and as noted above, they complement each other. Gauff is better at court coverage, Fritz better as a server. Gauff is better on her backhand wing, Fritz better on the forehand side. Podoroska and Gonzalez are smart tennis players, but they aren't the better athletes. Talent wins out here.\n\nWhy Podoroska / Gonzalez Could Cover The Spread\n\nGauff and Fritz, having never played together, might lack polished communication at net when trying to change spots on court and make quick-reaction plays. Podoroska and Gonzalez should be able to make those quick decisions and handle the more complicated points in the match. That could swing the outcome in their favor.\n\nFinal Gauff Fritz vs Podoroska Gonzalez Prediction & Pick\n\nDon't overthink this one. Gauff and Fritz should win in straights. They have a lot more high-end talent than their opponents.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_zemek@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Matthew Zemek", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadia_Podoroska", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nadia Podoroska"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Fritz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Fritz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\u00e1ximo_Gonz\u00e1lez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "M\u00e1ximo Gonz\u00e1lez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_tennis_match", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Types of tennis match"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Pegula", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Pegula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Musetti", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lorenzo Musetti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Roddick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andy Roddick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Coco-Gauff-Taylor-Fritz-vs-Nadia-Podoroska-Maximo-Gonzalez-2024-Olympics-Tennis-prediction-odds-pick.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770346", "eventUri": "eng-9770346", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

The French Catholic Church even said the festivities \"included scenes of derision and mockery of Christianity.\"\n\nDespite opening ceremony artistic director Thomas Jolly saying the imagery was meant to honor Dionysus, the Greek god of wine, the damage had already been done.\n\n\"To watch such an incredible event that's going to take place over the next two weeks and see the opening ceremonies complexly blasphemed and mock the Christian faith with their interpretation of the Last Supper was disgusting,\" actress Candace Cameron Bure said in a video posted via Instagram.\n\nKansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker also chimed in, quoting a Bible verse that said \"God is not mocked.\"\n\nFrench DJ Barbara Butch, who was at the center of the tableau in a gold headpiece, has been \"the target of an extremely violent campaign of cyber-harassment and defamation,\" Butch's lawyer Audrey Msellati claimed in a statement via Instagram on Monday, July 29.\n\nThe statement continued, \"She has been threatened with death, torture and rape and has also been the target of numerous anti-Semitic, homophobic, sexist and anti-grossophobic insults.\"\n\nAccording to Msellati, Butch, 43, is planning to file several complaints and \"intends to prosecute anyone who tries to intimidate her in the future.\"\n\nIt only took Stephen Nedoroscik 45 seconds to become a legend.\n\nThe 25-year-old Team USA gymnast, who excels at pommel horse, needed to execute his routine perfectly on Monday, July 29, to earn the American men their first team medal since 2008.\n\nNedoroscik did not let his team down. The Worcester, Massachusetts native was brilliant on the pommel horse, embraced by his coaches and teammates after leaving the mat. The squad took home bronze.\n\nBut it wasn't just the athletic achievement that made Stephen Nedoroscik into a national icon -- it was also the memes.\n\nNedoroscik, who his coach Syque Caesar calls \"quirky, funny, goofy\" and someone who \"dances to his own tune,\" was seen on camera before his routine wearing glasses, often with his eyes shut getting into the zone.\n\n\"Obsessed with this one guy on the US men's gymnastics team who looks like he's getting his phd in anthropology and his only job is pommel horse,\" one viewer wrote via X.\n\nNedoroscik was noticeably spectacle-less when he took the floor for his now-iconic routine. There's a simple reason for that.\n\n\"I don't need to see when I do pommel horse,\" he explained. \"It's all by feel.\"\n\nDuring her match against Donna Vekic on Tuesday, July 30, American tennis star Coco Gauff was overcome with emotion when a controversial call went against her.\n\nAfter a deep serve return from Vekic, 28, was initially called out by a line judge, chair umpire Jaume Campistol ruled the ball was in, rewarding the point and a crucial service break to Vekic. Gauff argued the point should have been replayed.\n\n\"I never argue these calls. But [the line judge] called it out before I hit the ball,\" Gauff said to Campistol. \"It's not even a perception; it's the rules.\"\n\nAfter wiping tears from her face, Gauff was not able to recover and lost the match in straight sets 7-6, 6-2.\n\n\"There's been multiple times this year where that happened to me, where I feel like I always have to be an advocate for myself on the court,\" Gauff told reporters.\n\nThe incident happened on the exact same court where Gauff ran into a similar issue during her semifinal match against Iga Swiatek at the French Open in June.\n\nAfter a disputed call on one of Swiatek's serves led to Gauff losing a point, Gauff called for a universal video review system.\n\n\"Tennis is the only sport where not only we don't have the VR system, but a lot of times the decisions are made by one person. In other sports there are usually multiple refs making a decision,\" Gauff said post-match.\n\nNot all heroes wear capes, and sometimes they're not wearing much of anything at all.\n\nBefore a women's 100m breaststroke heat on Sunday, July 28, American swimmer Emma Weber dropped her swim cap in the pool, which floated all the way down to the bottom.\n\nIn a moment's notice, a Speedo-clad man leapt into action to retrieve the cap from the depths of the water at Paris La Defense Arena, who the NBC Sports broadcast affectionately named \"Bob the Cap Catcher.\"\n\nAccording to an Olympics spokesperson, Bob was a lifeguard on duty who was dutifully called into action.\n\n\"As the lifeguards are the only people wearing swimwear, apart from the athletes, a request may be made to fetch an item at the bottom of the pool prior to the next race,\" the statement explained. \"In this case, the request was made to the lifeguard closest to the item.\"\n\nThe spokesperson also said Bob -- whose real name remains a mystery -- was refusing all media requests, hoping to keep the focus on the swimmers themselves.\n\nA true Olympic hero.\n\nVeteran TV broadcaster Bob Ballard was dropped by Eurosport after controversial comments he made Saturday, July 27, during the conclusion of the women's 4\u00d7100 meter freestyle relay.\n\nAfter the Australian team won gold, Ballard, 82, made a remark about their delay in exiting the pool deck at the Paris Aquatic Center.\n\n\"Well, the women just finishing off,\" Ballard said. You know what women are like, hanging around, doing their makeup.\"\n\nBallard's Eurosport cohost and former Olympian Lizzie Simmonds immediately criticized his comment on air.\n\n\"Outrageous, Bob,\" Simmons said. \"Some of the men are doing that as well.\"\n\nIn a statement posted via social media on Monday, July 29, Ballard said, \"The comments I made during the Australian freestyle relay victory ceremony on Saturday have caused some offense. It was never my intention to upset or belittle anyone and, if I did, I apologize. I am a massive advocate of women's sport.\"\n\nThe Kelces attended USA's field hockey game against Argentina on Saturday, July 27, where Jason donned a beret that he found at \"a souvenir shop.\"\n\nThe next day, Jason said he was \"officially a fan\" of women's rugby after meeting the American team and even competed against breakout star Ilona Maher in an arm wrestling contest.\n\nJason's presence rubbed off on the Team USA squad, who took home the bronze medal in dramatic fashion on Tuesday, July 30.\n\nWhile that was happening, though, Jason and Kylie were seen taking in Simone Biles and Team USA earning gold in the women's gymnastics team event.\n\nNot a bad Parisian getaway.\n\nBefore the official start of the Games on Tuesday, July 23, the sister-in-law of U.S. women's water polo player Maggie Steffens died in the Olympic Village.\n\nLulu Conner had traveled to Paris to see her husband's sister compete, but died after \"a medical emergency,\" according to the Associated Press. She was 26.\n\nIn an interview published by People on Monday, July 29, Steffens, 31, called Conner \"a light.\" Steffens added, \"She was somebody that brought joy to everybody she was with and to everything she did.\"\n\nOn Friday, July 26, Samoan boxing coach Lionel Elika Fatupaito died inside the Olympic Village. He was 60.\n\nThe Samoa Association of Sport and National Olympic Committee confirmed the tragedy, saying he died due to \"natural causes.\"\n\n\"Lionel was one of Samoa's top boxing coaches and a great believer in the Olympic ideal,\" SASNOC President Pauga Talalelei Pauga shared in the statement. \"Our thoughts and those of the entire Samoan sporting community are with Lionel's family, his boxers, and friends. He will be greatly missed.\"\n\nElika Fatupaito was at the game supporting Ato Plodzicki-Faoagali, who fought in his coach's absence on Sunday, July 28, ultimately falling to Belgian Victor Schelstraete in the round of 16.\n\nRyan Murphy -- the Team USA Olympic swimmer, not the TV producer -- was surprised with a celebratory sex reveal by his wife after taking home his seventh medal all-time.\n\nAfter Murphy, 29, earned bronze in the men's 100m backstroke on Monday, July 29, his wife, Bridget Konttinin, held up a sign that read, \"Ryan, it's a girl!\"\n\nMurphy eventually made his way over to Konttinin and gave her a kiss in front of his crowd of supporters.\n\n\"A night we'll never forget,\" Konttinin wrote via her Instagram Stories. \"I love you so much.\"\n\nBritish rugby player Amy Wilson-Hardy was pulled from competing in the Olympics after an investigation was launched into alleged racist behavior.\n\nAccording to The Independent, Wilson-Hardy, 32, was the subject of the investigation after a WhatsApp message was discovered of the athlete in blackface.\n\nIn a statement, Team Great Britain announced Wilson-Hardy left the team \"on medical grounds.\" She was replaced on the team by Abi Burton.\n\n\"We heard about [it] this morning, but for us, [it's about] focusing on the games, focusing on getting ourselves in the right place to be able to perform,\" team captain Emma Uren told reporters on Tuesday, July 30. \"Because we're off our phones, we don't know much about it. And we didn't get told much about it because we know that we need to focus on the tournament. So our heads are 100 percent there.\"\n\nWilson-Hardy has yet to comment on the investigation.\n\nIn the thick of qualifying on Sunday, July 28, the Team USA women's gymnastics team still found time to drop it like it was hot.\n\nThankfully, the moment was all caught on camera by NBC Sports. \"Anybody have more fun than Snoop? I don't think so,\" commentator Terry Gannon said.\n\nSnoop has been a mainstay in Paris throughout the Games, showing his love for Team USA at every turn. He's hit the pool with Michael Phelps, practiced with the American fencing team and even hopped on NBC to offer his own commentary.", "source": {"uri": "usmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

A line judge initially called the shot out of bounds, but it was actually in. However, because of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153out\u00e2\u20ac call, Gauff did not keep the ball in play and hit it into the net afterward. The chair umpire, Jaume Campistol, awarded Vekic the point because he believed the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153out\u00e2\u20ac call shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have affected Gauff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s swing.\n\nGauff was visibly upset and could be seen pleading her case to the umpire to the extent that the reigning U.S. Open champion was ultimately brought to tears over the unfair ruling.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153He called it out before I hit it so I went up on the ball,\u00e2\u20ac Gauff could be heard telling the ump on the broadcast. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fair, he called it out before I hit the ball\u00e2\u20ac| If he called it out before I hit it, it affects the swing.\u00e2\u20ac\u00c2\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I know I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m wrong, but I cannot change my decision after your appeal,\u00e2\u20ac the ump told Gauff at one point.\u00c2\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I never argue these calls,\u00e2\u20ac Gauff said through tears. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand, I have to always advocate for myself on this court all the time.\u00e2\u20ac\u00c2\n\nA referee was then brought onto the court to mediate the dispute.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fair,\u00e2\u20ac Gauff continued. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I feel like I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m getting cheated on constantly in this game. And then you guys apologize afterwards, you guys say, \u00e2\u20ac~I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sorry,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 but what does that do for me in the match?...It happens to me, it happens to Serena [Williams]...

In tennis, it was Coco Gauff left fuming over an officiating decision in a loss to Donna Vekic of Croatia.\n\nThere were no winners or losers in men's triathlon, which was as postponed because of concerns about the water quality in the Seine River amid a heat wave that made life difficult on some athletes and fans in Paris.\n\nSunisa Lee of United States in action on the balance beam.

Tears streaming down her cheeks. And, most disappointing of all, a loss, this time at the Paris Games.\n\nCoco Gauff of the United States talks with an official during her match against Donna Vekic of Croatia.

Photo by Edgar Su/ Reuters\n\n\"There's been multiple times this year where that's happened to me -- where I felt like I always have to be an advocate for myself on the court,\" Gauff said afterward, renewing a call for video review to be used in tennis, as it is in many other professional sports.\n\nGauff was the female flag bearer for the United States during the opening ceremony on Friday.\n\nCarlos Alcaraz of Spain and Rafael Nadal of Spain react during their match against Tallon Griekspoor of Netherlands and Wesley Koolhof of Netherlands. Photo by Claudia Greco/ Reuters\n\nAlso in tennis, Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz advanced into the doubles quarterfinals with a 6-4, 6-7 (2), 10-2 match tiebreaker victory over Tallon Griekspoor and Wesley Koolhof of the Netherlands.\n\nNo. 1-ranked Iga Swiatek defeated No. 52 Wang Xiyu of China 6-2, 6-4.\n\nTriathlon postponed\n\nThe men's triathlon scheduled for Tuesday was postponed because of concerns about the water quality in the Seine River.\n\nIt was rescheduled for Wednesday, when the women's competition is also slated to be held. But both will happen only if water tests show acceptable levels of E. coli and other bacteria. Friday is also planned as a backup date.\n\nThere is rain forecast Tuesday night through Thursday, which could complicate rescheduling because rain generally causes an increase in bacteria levels in the Seine, the long-polluted waterway that has gone through an expensive cleanup effort.\n\n\"It's disappointing that there's this negative aspect now with the delay,\" American triathlete Seth Rider said. \"But I hope we can have a triathlon and I can accomplish this dream that I've had since I was a little kid.\"\n\nHeat wave\n\nAfter enduring the rain in the opening ceremony, athletes now are having to deal with the heat.\n\nMost of France is under heat warnings, with temperatures in Paris hitting 36 degrees Celsius (97 Fahrenheit), the national weather agency said. Air conditioning is far less common in French homes, shops and restaurants than in places like the United States.\n\nThe heat was even worse in the south, including the region around the Mediterranean cities of Marseille and Nice that are hosting Olympic competitions like soccer and sailing. It was as hot as 41 C (105 F) in parts of southern France.\n\nBefore winning the gold Tuesday, Biles posted a video on Instagram while struggling with the lack of air conditioning.\n\n\"Don't come for me about my hair,\" Biles wrote on Instagram before the gymnastics team final. \"IT WAS DONE but bus has NO AC and it's like 9,000 degrees. Oh & a 45 minutes ride.\"", "source": {"uri": "pbs.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "PBS.org"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@pbs.org", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author",

Biles is competing after tweaking her left calf during qualifying. The five-woman US squad of Biles, Sunisa Lee, Jordan Chiles, Jade Carey and Hezly Rivera are heavily favored to return to the top of the medal stand after finishing second to Russia at the Tokyo Games three years ago. The Americans will be paired with Italy the runner-up to Biles during all-around qualifying.\n\nThe Latest: Simone Biles and Team USA are rolling toward gold in Olympics gymnastics finals\n\nPARIS (AP) -- Simone Biles and the U.S. women are leading the gymnastics team final at the 2024 Paris Olympics, building on a sizeable 3-point margin over Italy after two rotations.\n\nCoco Gauff loses an argument with the chair umpire and a match to Donna Vekic at the Paris Olympics\n\nPARIS (AP) -- Coco Gauff got into an extended argument with the chair umpire over a ruling during the reigning U.S. Open champion's 7-6 (7), 6-2 loss to Donna Vekic of Croatia in a Paris Olympics third-round singles match. Gauff already was trailing by a lot when the episode happened two games from the end of the match. Gauff hit a serve and Vekic's return landed near the baseline. A line judge initially called Vekic's shot out; Gauff did not keep the ball in play. Chair umpire Jaume Campistol thought Vekic's shot landed in and awarded her the point, giving her a service break and a 4-2 lead. Gauff walked over to talk to the official and play was delayed for several minutes.\n\nUS women win a first Olympic medal in rugby sevens with comeback victory over Australia\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France (AP) -- Alex Sedrick ran most of the length of the field to give the U.S. women a first Olympic rugby sevens medal with a stunning stoppage-time comeback win over Australia in the bronze-medal match. The 2016 champion Australians were leading 12-7 with seconds remaining and deep in U.S. territory. The ball went to Sedrick and she bumped off two tacklers before racing all the way to the other end to spark jubilation for the Americans. The Americans rushed onto the field to celebrate the 14-12 victory. The U.S. women reached the Olympic semifinals for the first time and lost to defending champion New Zealand.\n\nFrench police investigating abuse targeting Olympic opening ceremony DJ over 'Last Supper' scene\n\nPARIS (AP) -- A storm of outrage about the Paris Olympics' opening ceremony has taken a legal turn. French prosecutors on Tuesday ordered police to investigate complaints from a DJ and LGBTQ+ icon that she suffered a torrent of online threats and abuse after performing in contentious scenes at the Games' opening ceremony. A lawyer for DJ Barbara Butch told The Associated Press that she filed a formal legal complaint alleging online harassment, death threats, and insults. The lawyer said the complaint doesn't name any specific perpetrator or perpetrators of the alleged crimes. The Paris prosecutor's office confirmed that it received Butch's complaint and tasked a police unit that specializes in fighting hate crimes to investigate.\n\nMen's Olympic triathlon postponed in Paris over Seine water quality concerns\n\nPARIS (AP) -- Concerns about water quality in the Seine River led Paris Olympics organizers to postpone the men's triathlon. Officials on Tuesday say they hope the swimming portion of the race will be able to go forward in the long-polluted waterway Wednesday or in the coming days following an expensive cleanup effort. The women's competition also is scheduled for Wednesday, but both will only go forward if water tests show safe levels of E. coli and other bacteria in the river. However, storms or rain are forecast Tuesday night through Thursday, which could complicate efforts to reschedule the events. Rain generally causes bacteria levels in the Seine to rise.\n\nSophia Smith contributes to reborn US attack at the Olympics\n\nSophia Smith, along with Mallory Swanson and Trinity Rodman, are helping the United States reclaim its status as a team to be feared at the Olympics in France. Smith scored both of her goals in the team's 4-1 victory on Sunday over Germany that clinched the Americans a spot in the quarterfinals at their first major tournament under coach Emma Hayes. The United States' reputation has slipped a bit in recent years following the team's bronze medal in Tokyo and disappointment at the World Cup.\n\nAnother Chinese doping controversy pops up during Olympic swimming competition\n\nNANTERRE, France (AP) -- Another Chinese doping allegation has flared up at the Paris Games, angering some swimmers who say officials need to enforce drug-testing rules consistently. The New York Times reported Tuesday that two top Chinese swimmers -- one on the Olympic team -- tested positive for a banned drug in 2022 but were eventually cleared by Chinese officials. Anti-doping officials say the athletes were cleared because a Chinese investigation determined that they accidentally ate tainted beef.\n\nPatrick Willis' short but impactful career leads him to Hall of Fame\n\nSANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- From the day he stepped into the NFL until a foot injury forced him into retirement after eight brilliant seasons as a do-everything linebacker, Patrick Willis succeeded at the highest level. He won the AP Defensive Rookie of the Year in 2007, was a five first-team All-Pro, a seven-time Pro Bowler and a member of the All-Decade team for the 2010s. None of those lofty honors will match the one coming to Willis on Saturday night when he will be enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nRory McIlroy hoping Olympic gold can help fill a void of 10 years without silver major trophies\n\nSAINT-QUENTIN-EN-YVELINES, France (AP) -- Rory McIlroy was the center of attention as he began preparations for the Olympics. Only he wasn't at Le Golf National. He was spotted playing the Old Course at St. Andrews on Monday with a thousand or so spectators gathered around the 18th hole. McIlroy sees the Olympics as a chance to redeem himself from his last performance. That was a missed cut at the British Open, ending another year without a major. Can a gold fill the void of 10 years without a major? For now, he says it would be his biggest feat in 10 years.", "source": {"uri": "yakimaherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yakima Herald-Republic"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Biles is competing after tweaking her left calf during qualifying. The five-woman US squad of Biles, Sunisa Lee, Jordan Chiles, Jade Carey and Hezly Rivera are heavily favored to return to the top of the medal stand after finishing second to Russia at the Tokyo Games three years ago. The Americans will be paired with Italy the runner-up to Biles during all-around qualifying.\n\nThe Latest: Simone Biles and Team USA are rolling toward gold in Olympics gymnastics finals\n\nPARIS (AP) -- Simone Biles and the U.S. women are leading the gymnastics team final at the 2024 Paris Olympics, building on a sizeable 3-point margin over Italy after two rotations.\n\nCoco Gauff loses an argument with the chair umpire and a match to Donna Vekic at the Paris Olympics\n\nPARIS (AP) -- Coco Gauff got into an extended argument with the chair umpire over a ruling during the reigning U.S. Open champion's 7-6 (7), 6-2 loss to Donna Vekic of Croatia in a Paris Olympics third-round singles match. Gauff already was trailing by a lot when the episode happened two games from the end of the match. Gauff hit a serve and Vekic's return landed near the baseline. A line judge initially called Vekic's shot out; Gauff did not keep the ball in play. Chair umpire Jaume Campistol thought Vekic's shot landed in and awarded her the point, giving her a service break and a 4-2 lead. Gauff walked over to talk to the official and play was delayed for several minutes.\n\nFrench police investigating abuse targeting Olympic opening ceremony DJ over 'Last Supper' scene\n\nPARIS (AP) -- A storm of outrage about the Paris Olympics' opening ceremony has taken a legal turn. French prosecutors on Tuesday ordered police to investigate complaints from a DJ and LGBTQ+ icon that she suffered a torrent of online threats and abuse after performing in contentious scenes at the Games' opening ceremony. A lawyer for DJ Barbara Butch told The Associated Press that she filed a formal legal complaint alleging online harassment, death threats, and insults. The lawyer said the complaint doesn't name any specific perpetrator or perpetrators of the alleged crimes. The Paris prosecutor's office confirmed that it received Butch's complaint and tasked a police unit that specializes in fighting hate crimes to investigate.\n\nMen's Olympic triathlon postponed in Paris over Seine water quality concerns\n\nPARIS (AP) -- Concerns about water quality in the Seine River led Paris Olympics organizers to postpone the men's triathlon. Officials on Tuesday say they hope the swimming portion of the race will be able to go forward in the long-polluted waterway Wednesday or in the coming days following an expensive cleanup effort. The women's competition also is scheduled for Wednesday, but both will only go forward if water tests show safe levels of E. coli and other bacteria in the river. However, storms or rain are forecast Tuesday night through Thursday, which could complicate efforts to reschedule the events. Rain generally causes bacteria levels in the Seine to rise.\n\nSophia Smith contributes to reborn US attack at the Olympics\n\nSophia Smith, along with Mallory Swanson and Trinity Rodman, are helping the United States reclaim its status as a team to be feared at the Olympics in France. Smith scored both of her goals in the team's 4-1 victory on Sunday over Germany that clinched the Americans a spot in the quarterfinals at their first major tournament under coach Emma Hayes. The United States' reputation has slipped a bit in recent years following the team's bronze medal in Tokyo and disappointment at the World Cup.\n\nAnother Chinese doping controversy pops up during Olympic swimming competition\n\nNANTERRE, France (AP) -- Another Chinese doping allegation has flared up at the Paris Games, angering some swimmers who say officials need to enforce drug-testing rules consistently. The New York Times reported Tuesday that two top Chinese swimmers -- one on the Olympic team -- tested positive for a banned drug in 2022 but were eventually cleared by Chinese officials. Anti-doping officials say the athletes were cleared because a Chinese investigation determined that they accidentally ate tainted beef.\n\nPatrick Willis' short but impactful career leads him to Hall of Fame\n\nSANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- From the day he stepped into the NFL until a foot injury forced him into retirement after eight brilliant seasons as a do-everything linebacker, Patrick Willis succeeded at the highest level. He won the AP Defensive Rookie of the Year in 2007, was a five first-team All-Pro, a seven-time Pro Bowler and a member of the All-Decade team for the 2010s. None of those lofty honors will match the one coming to Willis on Saturday night when he will be enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nRory McIlroy hoping Olympic gold can help fill a void of 10 years without silver major trophies\n\nSAINT-QUENTIN-EN-YVELINES, France (AP) -- Rory McIlroy was the center of attention as he began preparations for the Olympics. Only he wasn't at Le Golf National. He was spotted playing the Old Course at St. Andrews on Monday with a thousand or so spectators gathered around the 18th hole. McIlroy sees the Olympics as a chance to redeem himself from his last performance. That was a missed cut at the British Open, ending another year without a major. Can a gold fill the void of 10 years without a major? For now, he says it would be his biggest feat in 10 years.\n\nOlympic swimming: Ledecky is fastest in heats of 1500; Marchand advances in 2 more races\n\nNANTERRE, France (AP) -- Katie Ledecky got started on what she hopes will be her first gold medal of the Paris Olympics, fastest in the heats of the 1,500-meter freestyle. Finishing more than a half-lap ahead of the closest swimmer in her heat, Ledecky posted a time of 15 minutes, 47.43 seconds. She'll have the prime lane for the final Wednesday. Ledecky is looking to earn her 12th Olympic medal. Coming off his dominating victory in the men's 400 individual medley, L\u00e9on Marchand of France is attempting a double in the 200 butterfly and 200 breaststroke, advancing to the semifinals in both

Gauff already was trailing by a lot when the episode happened two games from the end of the match. Gauff hit a serve and Vekic's return landed near the baseline. A line judge initially called Vekic's shot out; Gauff did not keep the ball in play. Chair umpire Jaume Campistol thought Vekic's shot landed in and awarded her the point, giving her a service break and a 4-2 lead. Gauff walked over to talk to the official and play was delayed for several minutes.\n\nFrench police investigating abuse targeting Olympic opening ceremony DJ over 'Last Supper' scene\n\nPARIS (AP) -- A storm of outrage about the Paris Olympics' opening ceremony has taken a legal turn. French prosecutors on Tuesday ordered police to investigate complaints from a DJ and LGBTQ+ icon that she suffered a torrent of online threats and abuse after performing in contentious scenes at the Games' opening ceremony. A lawyer for DJ Barbara Butch told The Associated Press that she filed a formal legal complaint alleging online harassment, death threats, and insults. The lawyer said the complaint doesn't name any specific perpetrator or perpetrators of the alleged crimes. The Paris prosecutor's office confirmed that it received Butch's complaint and tasked a police unit that specializes in fighting hate crimes to investigate.\n\nMen's Olympic triathlon postponed in Paris over Seine water quality concerns\n\nPARIS (AP) -- Concerns about water quality in the Seine River led Paris Olympics organizers to postpone the men's triathlon. Officials on Tuesday say they hope the swimming portion of the race will be able to go forward in the long-polluted waterway Wednesday or in the coming days following an expensive cleanup effort. The women's competition also is scheduled for Wednesday, but both will only go forward if water tests show safe levels of E. coli and other bacteria in the river. However, storms or rain are forecast Tuesday night through Thursday, which could complicate efforts to reschedule the events. Rain generally causes bacteria levels in the Seine to rise.\n\nSophia Smith contributes to reborn US attack at the Olympics\n\nSophia Smith, along with Mallory Swanson and Trinity Rodman, are helping the United States reclaim its status as a team to be feared at the Olympics in France. Smith scored both of her goals in the team's 4-1 victory on Sunday over Germany that clinched the Americans a spot in the quarterfinals at their first major tournament under coach Emma Hayes. The United States' reputation has slipped a bit in recent years following the team's bronze medal in Tokyo and disappointment at the World Cup.\n\nAnother Chinese doping controversy pops up during Olympic swimming competition\n\nNANTERRE, France (AP) -- Another Chinese doping allegation has flared up at the Paris Games, angering some swimmers who say officials need to enforce drug-testing rules consistently. The New York Times reported Tuesday that two top Chinese swimmers -- one on the Olympic team -- tested positive for a banned drug in 2022 but were eventually cleared by Chinese officials. Anti-doping officials say the athletes were cleared because a Chinese investigation determined that they accidentally ate tainted beef.\n\nPatrick Willis' short but impactful career leads him to Hall of Fame\n\nSANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- From the day he stepped into the NFL until a foot injury forced him into retirement after eight brilliant seasons as a do-everything linebacker, Patrick Willis succeeded at the highest level. He won the AP Defensive Rookie of the Year in 2007, was a five first-team All-Pro, a seven-time Pro Bowler and a member of the All-Decade team for the 2010s. None of those lofty honors will match the one coming to Willis on Saturday night when he will be enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nRory McIlroy hoping Olympic gold can help fill a void of 10 years without silver major trophies\n\nSAINT-QUENTIN-EN-YVELINES, France (AP) -- Rory McIlroy was the center of attention as he began preparations for the Olympics. Only he wasn't at Le Golf National. He was spotted playing the Old Course at St. Andrews on Monday with a thousand or so spectators gathered around the 18th hole. McIlroy sees the Olympics as a chance to redeem himself from his last performance. That was a missed cut at the British Open, ending another year without a major. Can a gold fill the void of 10 years without a major? For now, he says it would be his biggest feat in 10 years.\n\nOlympic swimming: Ledecky is fastest in heats of 1500; Marchand advances in 2 more races\n\nNANTERRE, France (AP) -- Katie Ledecky got started on what she hopes will be her first gold medal of the Paris Olympics, fastest in the heats of the 1,500-meter freestyle. Finishing more than a half-lap ahead of the closest swimmer in her heat, Ledecky posted a time of 15 minutes, 47.43 seconds. She'll have the prime lane for the final Wednesday.

French prosecutors on Tuesday ordered police to investigate complaints from a DJ and LGBTQ+ icon that she suffered a torrent of online threats and abuse after performing in contentious scenes at the Games' opening ceremony. A lawyer for DJ Barbara Butch told The Associated Press that she filed a formal legal complaint alleging online harassment, death threats, and insults.

Officials on Tuesday say they hope the swimming portion of the race will be able to go forward in the long-polluted waterway Wednesday or in the coming days following an expensive cleanup effort. The women's competition also is scheduled for Wednesday, but both will only go forward if water tests show safe levels of E. coli and other bacteria in the river.

Rain generally causes bacteria levels in the Seine to rise.\n\nSophia Smith contributes to reborn US attack at the Olympics\n\nSophia Smith, along with Mallory Swanson and Trinity Rodman, are helping the United States reclaim its status as a team to be feared at the Olympics in France.

The United States' reputation has slipped a bit in recent years following the team's bronze medal in Tokyo and disappointment at the World Cup.\n\nAnother Chinese doping controversy pops up during Olympic swimming competition\n\nNANTERRE, France (AP) -- Another Chinese doping allegation has flared up at the Paris Games, angering some swimmers who say officials need to enforce drug-testing rules consistently. The New York Times reported Tuesday that two top Chinese swimmers -- one on the Olympic team -- tested positive for a banned drug in 2022 but were eventually cleared by Chinese officials. Anti-doping officials say the athletes were cleared because a Chinese investigation determined that they accidentally ate tainted beef.\n\nPatrick Willis' short but impactful career leads him to Hall of Fame\n\nSANTA CLARA, Calif.

He won the AP Defensive Rookie of the Year in 2007, was a five first-team All-Pro, a seven-time Pro Bowler and a member of the All-Decade team for the 2010s.

Well, everyone except for Coco Gauff.\n\nIn a video posted to TikTok on Saturday, the 20-year-old tennis star highlighed the not-so-ideal living conditions at the Olympic Village. In the clip, Gauff gave a quick tour of their accommodations -- pointing out that 10 female athletes were sharing just two bathrooms. It looked like sheer chaos as all the women attempted to get dressed and do their hair and makeup in the overcrowded suite.\n\nOne user commented that the athletes should just move to a hotel instead, and Gauff said her teammates had already done so.\n\n\"All the tennis girls moved to a hotel except me,\" she replied. \"So now just five girls, two bathrooms.\"\n\nAnd the lack of space and privacy is hardly the only problem athletes face in Olympic Village. The beds -- in particular, their cardboard frames -- have long been a talking point even before teams embarked for Paris. And since athletes started arriving in the village, many have taken to social media to confirm the cardboard construction, debunk theories about the beds being \"anti-sex\" and, most recently, complain about the comfort of the mattresses themselves.\n\nSeveral members of Team USA, including Gauff, brought their own mattress toppers in an attempt to make the beds at least somewhat comfortable.\n\nRELATED: Paris Olympics Already Running Out Of Real Food After Trying To Push Plant-Based Foods On Athletes\n\nTeams that wanted to stay cool also had to bring their own air conditioners since Paris decided to \"go green\" for this year's event.\n\nOlympic Village spans across three cities north of Paris -- Saint-Denis, Saint Ouen, and L'\u00cele-Saint-Denis. The $1.6-billion housing complex was built to accommodate 14,250 Olympians over the 18-day event.\n\nAnd as we reported last week, it's never been a better time to be an Olympic surfer.

French prosecutors on Tuesday ordered police to investigate complaints from a DJ and LGBTQ+ icon that she suffered a torrent of online threats and abuse after performing in contentious scenes at the Games' opening ceremony. A lawyer for DJ Barbara Butch told The Associated Press that she filed a formal legal complaint alleging online harassment, death threats, and insults.

The women's competition also is scheduled for Wednesday, but both will only go forward if water tests show safe levels of E. coli and other bacteria in the river.

Her Round 3 competitor, Croatia's Donna Veki\u0107, defeated Gauff 7-6(7), 6-2. It is Veki\u0107, not Gauff, who will be continuing on to the quarterfinals for a chance to win an Olympic gold medal.\n\nIt was looking like Gauff was going to cruise to the next round early on after going up 4-1 in the opening set. But Veki\u0107 fought back and forced a tie-break before eventually going ahead.\n\nIt was the first time in the tournament that Gauff had dropped a set.\n\nThings didn't get better from there. She didn't have the same oomph she did in the first set, and then an argument with the chair umpire scrambled the match for good.\n\nAfter that, it didn't take long for Veki\u0107 to capture the win.\n\nGauff's first-round victory over Australia's Ajla Tomljanovi\u0107 made her the youngest American woman to win in Olympic singles since Venus Williams in 2000. She beat Argentina's Maria Lourdes Carle in the second round to set up Tuesday's match against Veki\u0107.\n\nIt's been quite an Olympics so far for the 20-year-old Gauff. After being named one of the two U.S. flag bearers at the Opening Ceremony along with NBA star LeBron James, she is now 3-0 in competition and is also winner of the Olympic pin game, thanks to Snoop Dogg.\n\nVeki\u0107 will next face the winner of the match between Marta Kostyuk and Maria Sakkari with a spot in the semifinals on the line.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sean_leahy@aol.com", "name": "Sean Leahy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Veki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donna Veki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_scoring_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis scoring system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Sakkari", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maria Sakkari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajla_Tomljanovi\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ajla Tomljanovi\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snoop_Dogg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snoop Dogg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Venus Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marta_Kostyuk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marta Kostyuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/E-mail", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/E-mail", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/G1R0HimofpPvAiTwRoSkYg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_yahoo_sports_800/502d8eb24155a857f502a4aec8504fef", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770346", "eventUri": "eng-9770346", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 108, "relevance": 1}

Gauff's TikTok video exposed the cramped nature of the room she was sharing with nine other women. Some athletes have departed the Olympic Village while other stars such as LeBron James opted to stay elsewhere from the beginning of the games.\n\nUSA's Coco Gauff has revealed why some athletes have opted to move out of Paris 2024's Olympic Village. She claimed to be the last member of America's women's tennis team to still be staying there, with her teammates deciding to book a hotel instead.\n\nThe Olympic Village is designed to home the participating athletes throughout the duration of the games, but with stars moving to accommodation elsewhere, the facilities in Paris have been called into question. Gauff posted a TikTok video showing the conditions in the room she is staying in with nine other women's athletes.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: The Olympic Village at Paris 2024 is a brand new facility which reportedly cost $1.6 billion.\n\nHer video came with the caption '10 girls, two bathrooms #olympicvillage' while showing the 20-year-old moving through the room in which other athletes were getting ready. It has led to questions surrounding the suitability of the facilities in Paris. Watch the video below:\n\nRelated How Team USA is Doing in the 2024 Paris Olympics\n\nLed by LeBron James, Stephen Curry, and Kevin Durant, Team USA is expected to bag its 17th Gold Medal in Olympics Basketball.\n\nAthletes Leave Olympic Village Gauff is the last remaining USA women's tennis player\n\nShortly after uploading the initial video, Gauff confirmed her Team USA teammates had moved out of the Olympic Village, as she noted: \"Well it's only 5 girls now so I have the room alone. My roommates are very chill. I love it.\" So, despite the controversy faced by the accommodation, the tennis player is enjoying herself.\n\nThe same can't be said of all athletes, as there has been plenty of talk about the uncomfortable cardboard beds in the rooms and a lack of general space. The latter can be seen in Gauff's clip - which has been viewed over 500,000 times - as everything appears to be very cramped.\n\nRelated Olympic Village Runs Out of Food\n\nAthletes in Paris saw high-protein items such as chicken and eggs rationed...\n\nTilly Kearns, the Australian water polo player, has publicly slammed the bed situation as she posted on social media: \"Already had a massage to undo the damage. My back is about to fall off.\" This came after Team Australia told their swimmers they could only spend 48 hours in the Olympic Village after their event. After which they would need to go home or find alternative accommodation. This decision didn't go down well with those impacted.\n\nSome Athletes Didn't Stay in Olympic Village LeBron James is among those to have found other accomodation\n\nGauff was handed the honour of being a flag bearer for Team USA at the opening ceremony. She did so alongside basketball superstar LeBron James. The LA Lakers star and the rest of the American basketball team decided to avoid staying in the Olympic Village altogether.\n\nDaniel Smith - Team USA's Olympic Village Director - previously stated that athletes would need to make their own plans if they opted against staying in the village. Smith said (per People): \"If a sport decides not to stay in [the village], they have to find their own arrangements in terms of where they're going to stay, and make their own hotel contracts.\"\n\nHe continued to add: \"A challenge with that is that basically you're outside of the bubble at that point and Paris 2024 won't provide you transportation from your specific hotel. All of the meals, all of those additional pieces that come along with logistics that athletes in the Village get, you stay out and all of that is on you.\"\n\nRelated Shocking Abandoned Olympics Venues From Over the Years\n\nPlaces such as Athens, Beijing, and Rio have seen massive stadiums and arenas get abandoned and left to rot after hosting the Olympics.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Village", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Village"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_polo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Water polo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Athens"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Athens"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/mixcollage-29-jul-2024-10-46-am-6082.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770346", "eventUri": "eng-9770346", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 107, "relevance": 1}

I love it,' she explained.\n\nAnother fan expressed concern about her comfort after it was revealed the athletes would be sleeping on beds made out of cardboard.\n\n'Archery team lended me a mattress topper,' she wrote.\n\nIt comes amid outcry after Australia's Olympic Committee angered swimmers by informing them they could only stay in the village for 48 hours following their events before being required to either fly home or find their own accommodation in Paris.\n\nMeanwhile, Aussie water polo player Tilly Kearns and her teammate Gabi Palm have publicly dragged the village's cardboard bed frames.\n\n'Already had a massage to undo the damage,' Kearns moaned via social media, as Palm chimed in, 'My back is about to fall off.'\n\nTeam USA's Olympic Village Director Daniel Smith previously told People that athletes can choose whether or not they want to stay in the Village.\n\nMany high-profile athletes, including LeBron James and Stephen Curry on the men's basketball team, are staying off-site in luxury digs.\n\n'If a sport decides not to stay in [the village], they have to find their own arrangements in terms of where they're going to stay, and make their own hotel contracts,' Smith said earlier this week.\n\n'A challenge with that is that basically you're outside of the bubble at that point and Paris 2024 won't provide you transportation from your specific hotel,' he added.\n\n'All of the meals, all of those additional pieces that come along with logistics that athletes in the Village get, you stay out and all of that is on you.'\n\nIt comes one day after Gauff stood alongside James as one of America's two flag bearers during the opening ceremony.\n\n'I never thought in a million years I would have the honor of carrying the American flag for Team USA in the opening ceremony,' the Grand Slam winner said in a statement.\n\n'I could not be more proud to lead my teammates with LeBron as we showcase our dedication and passion on the biggest stage there is.'",

(The video was accompanied by screaming sound effects drawn from the horror movies \"Pearl\" and \"Hereditary.\")\n\n\"I would go to a hotel,\" a TikTok user commented. Gauff's reply: \"all the tennis girls moved to a hotel except me. so now just 5 girls two bathrooms.\" She elaborated in another reply: \"well it's only 5 girls now so I have the room alone. roommates are very chill.\"\n\nIt was not clear exactly why the tennis players left the village.\n\nThe minimalist sleeping areas are a time-honored Olympic Village tradition. In recent interviews with NBC News, Olympians from years past said rooms tend to be small, defined in part by what gold medalist swimmer Mark Spitz characterized as a \"low-cost IKEA look.\"\n\nThis year, the bare-bones bedrooms were designed with an eye on climate consciousness and a relatively light carbon footprint. The athletes staying inside the village are dozing off on cardboard beds. No air conditioning systems were installed, though some athletes brought their own mobile AC units.\n\nIn a reply to Gauff's video, one TikTok user wanted to know how the 20-year-old tennis phenomenon was coping with all the cardboard. Gauff explained that she had it covered: \"archery team lended me a mattress topper.\"\n\nIn a comment on another TikTok user's post, Team USA women's gymnastics icon Simone Biles described the sleeping situation in blunt terms: \"the bed sucks...... BUT we are getting mattress toppers so hopefully it'll get better.\" Biles' reply was followed by the \"fingers crossed\" emoji.\n\nIn many cases, Olympic competitors enjoy all that life inside the village entails, from the 24/7 food service to the impromptu hangout sessions. \"I chose to stay in [the] village for the experience,\" Gauff explained in a reply on TikTok.\n\nBrian Boitano -- the gold medalist figure skater who competed at the 1984, 1988 and 1994 Games -- recently told NBC News that the close quarters fostered immediate social bonds. \"In Calgary, sharing that tiny apartment with seven guys -- we were such a tight unit, he said, \"and there was so much camaraderie.\"\n\nTeam USA, a spokesperson for the American tennis team, and the Paris 2024 organizing committee did not immediately reply to requests for comment Monday. In a video posted on YouTube two weeks ago, the Olympics said the \"sustainable beds are 100% made in France and will be fully recycled in France after the Games.\"\n\nGauff's tennis teammates were apparently not the only Paris competitors who left the official residential complex.\n\nSix members of South Korea's swimming squad departed and checked into a nearby hotel because they were concerned about delays on the buses that transport athletes from the village to their arenas, according to the Korea Times, an English-language newspaper.\n\n\"It usually takes about 40 to 45 minutes from the village to the arena, but it took us more than an hour and a half [on Thursday],\" South Korean swimmer Hwang Sun-woo told the newspaper. \"Windows were taped probably because they are worried about terrorist attacks. But something has to be done.\"\n\nHwang was quoted comparing the bus to a \"sauna\" because of the lack of air conditioning.\n\nThe South Korean national Olympic committee did not respond to a request for comment on the Korea Times article.\n\nOlympic competitors are not required to stay in the village. Michael Jordan and other members of the 1992 Dream Team -- the first U.S. Olympic basketball squad featuring professional players -- set up shop at the Ambassador Hotel during the 1992 Barcelona Games, for example.\n\nIt's a tradition subsequent men's basketball squads have followed.\n\n\"The last few times I've done the Olympics, we've spent our fair share in the Olympic Village and felt like a part of the group there,\" Kevin Durant, the Phoenix Suns player and a member of the U.S. men's national team, told USA Today. \"We stay outside of it, but we get our time right before the opening ceremony.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 5,

But just when it seemed that Andreescu was getting closer to forcing a decider, Vekic responded with back-to-back breaks in the eighth and 10th games to overturn the deficit and get the job done in two sets.\n\n\"In the first moment, I really thought she was going to retire. She let out such a scream that I thought she was going to die, but she continued to play normally. I actually lost my concentration after that, which should not have happened to me,\" Vekic told Croatian outlet Sportske Novosti.\n\n\"Then she started to slice more, which normally doesn't suit me. It took me a few games to adjust. And if I had lost that second set, I believe I would have returned to my normal game. Well, I'll be smarter the next time.\"\n\nBy beating Andreescu, recent Wimbledon semifinalist Vekic set up a round-of-16 meeting against No. 2 seed Coco Gauff.\n\n\"I have never played against Coco.

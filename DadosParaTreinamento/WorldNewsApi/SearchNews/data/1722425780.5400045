Noticing the poor kid\u2019s broken heart, a middle school science teacher invited him to go on the adventure of a lifetime. It changed his life. \u201cI was in seventh grade at the time, when our science teacher invited me to go to the Grand Canyon during spring break,\u201d said Mr. Furey. \u201cI was surprised because he only took eighth graders, but he asked my mother if I could go and she said, \u2018yes.\u2019 So, she drove me to REI, and we got everything on his list that I would need, like a backpack, hiking shoes, [and] a first aid kit.\u201d Mr. Furey, the science teacher, and three other boys spent the night at a hotel, and the next day they hiked 12 miles to the Havasupai Reservation campground in the Grand Canyon. For three days they hiked, played around Havasu Falls, and made new friends. \u201cWe were down there swimming and having a good time, and at one point I was by myself for a few minutes, and I felt an overwhelming sense that I was going to be taking people into the outdoors for years to come,\u201d he said. Many years later, Mr. Furey has led hundreds of people on hikes as a former staff member of the YMCA, a junior high school science teacher, vice principal, and now principal of Covenant Christian school and president of the Heritage Hiking Club. He leads beginner, moderate, and advanced hikes locally in Orange County, and throughout California, with longer hiking trips to Yosemite, Zion, the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone, and a future Alaska trip in 2025. \u201cWe lead beginner hikes early in the week to such places as Peters Canyon, Chino Hills-Gilman San Juan Peak Hills, a saunter through the Red Woods in Yorba Linda, and longer hikes on the weekends on the Powder Canyon hike, or to San Diego or Santa Barbara,\u201d he said. An avid teacher on nature and safety, Mr. Furey emphasized that no hiker is left behind. \u201cWe have a lead hiker who has a radio, a mid-sweep hiker, and a sweeper in the back of the line of hikers to watch over everyone. If someone is having trouble, we stop the group and give attention to any hiker who might be struggling with a loose backpack strap or in need of a little water.\u201d Generally, Heritage hikers take a 10-minute water break after each hour of hiking on the trails. To get the most enjoyment out of nature, Mr. Furey is adamant that hikers learn trail safety and etiquette. \u201cYou want to make sure you are prepared and have enough water,\u201d he says. \u201cYou need to be hydrating the day before the hike, the day of the hike, and after hiking. You want to make sure you bring enough trail snacks, a hearty lunch if we are going to be stopping for lunch, a layer or two of clothing in your backpack, a first aid kit, sunscreen, a hat, all the essentials.\u201d \u201cThe biggest mistake hikers make is they don\u2019t break in their boots, which can cause blisters on a hike, and they underestimate their hiking ability or the length of the trail,\u201d said Mr. Furey. In terms of trail etiquette, it is a must that you stay on the designated trail, learn to share the trail when there are horseback riders or bikers, and always hike out trash, never litter. As for great exercise, hiking is one of the most impactful and fun ways for anyone to stay healthy. \u201cWe can take any hiker no matter what level they\u2019re at, and advance them to the next level while they are hiking,\u201d Mr. Furey said. \u201cA non-hiker can become a beginner hiker. From a beginner hiker you can become a moderate hiker, from a moderate hiker you are able to tackle the hard hikes, and from the hard hike you are able to move towards the strenuous hikes.\u201d By strenuous, Mr. Furey means hiking Mt. San Antonio in the San Gabriel Mountains, or San Jacinto peak in Palm Springs. Walking around your own neighborhood is a wonderful way to begin or to condition yourself for a hike, he said. For the bigger hikes, Heritage Hiking Club offers conditioning hikes as more advanced hikers plan months ahead for trips to places like Zion or Yosemite. \u201cI actually would suggest that you map out miles with your car, park your car and walk,\u201d said Mr. Furey. \u201cYou can start with a two-mile route, then move to a four-mile route, then to a six-mile route and so on.\u201d However, and wherever you begin, just get moving. You could discover your own adventure of a lifetime!", "summary": "When Bill Furey was in sixth grade, his father died from cancer, leaving his mother to care for eight children.

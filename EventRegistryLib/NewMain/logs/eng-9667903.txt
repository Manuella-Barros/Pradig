Trump's trial in Washington, D.C., may not take place before the November election, even if the court rules he is not immune.\n\nA former Pennsylvania police officer is challenging the validity of obstruction charges brought against hundreds of people who took part in the violent assault on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Trump faces the same charge of obstructing an official proceeding.\n\nThe issue is whether a law meant to discourage tampering with documents sought in investigations can be used against the Capitol rioters.\n\nThere's a second abortion case on the docket this year: whether doctors can provide that medical procedure in emergencies in states that banned abortion after the court overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\nIn a case out of Idaho, the Biden administration says abortions must be allowed in emergencies where a woman's health is at serious risk.\n\nThe state argues that its strict abortion ban does allow abortions to save a woman's life, and doesn't need to expand exceptions for health risks.\n\nThe justices are weighing whether to uphold a federal law that seeks to protect domestic violence victims by keeping guns away from the people alleged to have abused them. An appeals court struck down a law that prohibits people under domestic violence restraining orders from possessing firearms.\n\nThat court found that the law violated the 2nd Amendment right to \"keep and bear arms\" following the Supreme Court's 2022 ruling that expanded gun rights and changed how courts are supposed to evaluate gun restrictions.\n\nThe most significant Supreme Court case in decades on homelessness centers on whether people can be banned from sleeping outdoors when shelter space is lacking.\n\nA San Francisco-based appeals court decision said that amounts to cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nLeaders from California and across the West say that the ruling makes it harder for them to regulate homeless encampments encroaching on sidewalks and other public places.\n\nAdvocates say it would criminalize homelessness just as rising costs have pushed the number of people without a permanent place to live to record levels.\n\nThe justices could overturn a 40-year-old decision that has been cited thousands of times in federal court cases and used to uphold regulations on the environment, public health, workplace safety and consumer protections.\n\nThe decision colloquially known as Chevron calls on judges to defer to federal regulators when the words of a statute are not crystal clear.\n\nThe decision has long been targeted by conservative and business interests who say Chevron robs judges of their authority and gives too much power to regulators.\n\nThree cases remain unresolved at the intersection of social media and government.\n\nTwo cases involve social media laws in Texas and Florida that would limit how Facebook, TikTok, X, YouTube and other social media platforms regulate content posted by their users. While the details vary, both laws aimed to address conservative complaints that the social media companies were liberal-leaning and censored users based on their viewpoints, especially on the political right.\n\nIn the third case, Republican-led states are suing the Biden administration over how far the federal government can go to combat controversial social media posts on topics including COVID-19 and election security. A federal appeals court sided with the states in finding that administration officials unconstitutionally coerced the platforms to limit conservative points of view.\n\nThe Supreme Court controls the fate of a nationwide settlement with OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma that would allocate billions of dollars to combat the opioid epidemic, but also provide a legal shield for members of the Sackler family who own the company. The settlement has been on hold since last summer after the Supreme Court agreed to weigh in.\n\nAir pollutionRepublican-led, energy-producing states and the steel industry want the court to put the Environmental Protection Agency's air pollution-fighting \"good neighbor\" plan on hold while legal challenges continue. The plan aims to protect downwind states that receive unwanted air pollution from other states.\n\nAnother important regulatory case could strip the SEC of a major tool in fighting securities fraud and have far-reaching effects on other regulatory agencies.\n\nThe court is being asked to rule that people facing civil fraud complaints have the right to a jury trial in federal court.", "source": {"uri": "baynews9.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectrum News Bay News 9"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructing_an_official_proceeding", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Obstructing an official proceeding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_immunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sovereign immunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_law_(common_law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil law (common law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Domestic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

Here's the list.", "body": "By Mark Sherman and Lindsay Whitehurst | The Associated Press * Published 57 seconds ago\n\nThe Supreme Court is headed into its final few weeks with about a third of the cases heard this year still undecided, including ones that could reshape the law on everything from guns to abortion to social media. The justices are also still weighing whether former President Donald Trump is immune from criminal prosecution in the election interference case against him, more than a month after hearing arguments.\n\nThe court heard 61 cases this term, and 19 remain unresolved.\n\nDonald Trump is arguing that former presidents are immune from prosecution for official acts they took in office and that the indictment he faces on charges of election interference must be dismissed.\n\nThe Supreme Court has previously ruled that former presidents can't be sued in civil cases for what they did in office, but it has never weighed in on criminal immunity.\n\nA former Pennsylvania police officer is challenging the validity of obstruction charges brought against hundreds of people who took part in the violent assault on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Trump faces the same charge of obstructing an official proceeding.\n\nThe issue is whether a law meant to discourage tampering with documents sought in investigations can be used against the Capitol rioters.\n\nThe state argues that its strict abortion ban does allow abortions to save a woman's life, and doesn't need to expand exceptions for health risks.\n\nGuns\n\nThe justices are weighing whether to uphold a federal law that seeks to protect domestic violence victims by keeping guns away from the people alleged to have abused them. An appeals court struck down a law that prohibits people under domestic violence restraining orders from possessing firearms. That court found that the law violated the 2nd Amendment right to \"keep and bear arms\" following the Supreme Court's 2022 ruling that expanded gun rights and changed how courts are supposed to evaluate gun restrictions.\n\nHomelessness\n\nThe most significant Supreme Court case in decades on homelessness centers on whether people can be banned from sleeping outdoors when shelter space is lacking.\n\nA San Francisco-based appeals court decision said that amounts to cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nLeaders from California and across the West say that the ruling makes it harder for them to regulate homeless encampments encroaching on sidewalks and other public places.\n\nAdvocates say it would criminalize homelessness just as rising costs have pushed the number of people without a permanent place to live to record levels.\n\nChevron\n\nThe justices could overturn a 40-year-old decision that has been cited thousands of times in federal court cases and used to uphold regulations on the environment, public health, workplace safety and consumer protections. The decision colloquially known as Chevron calls on judges to defer to federal regulators when the words of a statute are not crystal clear. The decision has long been targeted by conservative and business interests who say Chevron robs judges of their authority and gives too much power to regulators.\n\nTwo cases involve social media laws in Texas and Florida that would limit how Facebook, TikTok, X, YouTube and other social media platforms regulate content posted by their users. While the details vary, both laws aimed to address conservative complaints that the social media companies were liberal-leaning and censored users based on their viewpoints, especially on the political right.\n\nIn the third case, Republican-led states are suing the Biden administration over how far the federal government can go to combat controversial social media posts on topics including COVID-19 and election security. A federal appeals court sided with the states in finding that administration officials unconstitutionally coerced the platforms to limit conservative points of view.\n\nPurdue Pharma\n\nThe Supreme Court controls the fate of a nationwide settlement with OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma that would allocate billions of dollars to combat the opioid epidemic, but also provide a legal shield for members of the Sackler family who own the company. The settlement has been on hold since last summer after the Supreme Court agreed to weigh in.\n\nAir pollution\n\nRepublican-led, energy-producing states and the steel industry want the court to put the Environmental Protection Agency's air pollution-fighting \"good neighbor\" plan on hold while legal challenges continue. The plan aims to protect downwind states that receive unwanted air pollution from other states.\n\nSEC\n\nAnother important regulatory case could strip the SEC of a major tool in fighting securities fraud and have far-reaching effects on other regulatory agencies. The court is being asked to rule that people facing civil fraud complaints have the right to a jury trial in federal court.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC New

Wade. Public opinion of the court remains at record lows. Conservative Justice Samuel Alito, meanwhile, is facing sharp blowback over two controversial flags raised at his homes in Virginia and New Jersey.\n\nHere are some of the remaining cases to be decided before July.\n\nTrump claims 'absolute' immunity\n\nTrump's appeal for immunity from special counsel Jack Smith's election subversion charges landed at the Supreme Court late in the term and instantly overshadowed most of the docket.\n\nTrump argued that without immunity, presidents would be hamstrung in office, always fearful of being second guessed by a zealous prosecutor after leaving the White House. That position appeared to have some purchase on the conservative Supreme Court during oral arguments in April, though it didn't appear Trump would be able to get Smith's case tossed entirely.\n\nThe immunity case, appears likely to come down to whether Trump's post-election actions were \"official\" - that is, steps he was taking as president - or whether they were \"private,\" which would not likely receive immunity.\n\nAn appeals court in Washington sided against Trump.\n\nAbortion for health in emergencies\n\nThe Supreme Court will decide what happens when pregnant women show up to the hospital with medical emergencies in states that have strict bans on abortion. An Idaho law bars doctors from performing abortions unless the mother's life is at risk, but it makes no exception if that she would suffer long-term health consequences.\n\nThe Biden administration argues a federal law requires hospitals to perform abortions if the health of a mother is at stake, and an appeals court agreed.\n\nThe decision in Moyle v. US will place abortion access on the forefront again this summer just as Americans begin tuning into the presidential election.\n\nJanuary 6 rioters seek to shorten sentences\n\nA former Pennsylvania police officer who rioted at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, challenged federal obstruction charges filed against him in a case that could also affect Trump. The former president was charged with violating the same obstruction law for different reasons.\n\nThe case was filed by Joseph Fischer, who was charged with multiple crimes for pushing his way into the Capitol after attending Trump's rally outside the White House on January 6. Fischer's attorney told the justices that prosecutors went too far by charging his client with \"obstructing\" an official proceeding, a crime he said Congress intended to be used to prohibit the destruction of evidence.\n\nSome 350 rioters were charged with the crime, which can add up to 20 years to a prison sentence. Some of those charges have since been dropped as part of plea agreements.\n\nProsecutors say the charge should apply to the January 6 cases because the plain meaning of the words \"obstruct\" and \"official proceeding\" covers the attack that interrupted Congress' counting of ballots to certify Joe Biden's 2020 win. Critics say the law was intended to prevent evidence tampering before a trial or investigation.\n\nGuns for domestic abusers\n\nIn a significant Second Amendment case, the justices must weigh the constitutionality of a federal law that bars people who are the subject of domestic violence restraining orders from possessing guns.\n\nA Texas man, Zackey Rahimi, was indicted for violating that law following a series of shootings, including one in which police said he fired into the air at a Whataburger restaurant after a friend's credit card was declined.\n\nRahimi's lawyers say a Supreme Court decision two years ago in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen meant the domestic violence law cannot be squared with the Constitution because it has no historical analogue. A 6-3 majority in Bruen said gun regulations must be \"consistent with this nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation.\"\n\nAn appeals court in Louisiana sided with Rahimi.\n\nGovernment regulation of Facebook\n\nThe Supreme Court is confronting a series of cases at the intersection of the First Amendment and social media. Perhaps the most notable are two suits challenging laws enacted in Florida and Texas aimed at stopping social media giants like Facebook and X from throttling conservative views.\n\nThe state laws ban online platforms from removing posts that express opinions, such as political content. The Republican governors who signed the laws said they were needed to keep the social media platforms from discriminating against conservatives.\n\nTwo trade associations representing the social media companies sued, claiming they violated the First Amendment. One federal appeals court in Atlanta sided with the companies and against Florida. Another, in New Orleans, allowed the Texas law to take effect. The Supreme Court paused implementation of the Texas law in 2022.\n\nThe cases are Moody v. NetChoice and NetChoice v. Paxton.\n\nCleaning up online 'disinformation'\n\nThe justices must decide if the White House and federal agencies such as the FBI may urge social media platforms to take down content the government views as misinformation, or whether those efforts violate the First Amendment.\n\nBiden officials have for years tried to persuade social media platforms to take down posts featuring misinformation about vaccines, the Covid-19 pandemic and the 2020 election, among other things.\n\nRepublican officials in two states - Missouri and Louisiana - and five social media users sued over that practice in 2022, arguing the administration did far more than \"persuade\" the tech giants to take down a few deceptive items. The case is Murthy v. Missouri.\n\nGovernment regulations threatened\n\nA series of cases this term challenge the power of federal agencies to approve regulations - or enforce them. Among the most significant are two appeals filed by Atlantic herring fishermen. The captains are challenging a Department of Commerce regulation that requires them to pay the salary of federal observers they bring on board to monitor the catch and ensure the crew follows other fishing regulations.\n\nThe court is being asked to overturn a 1984 precedent - Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council - that required courts to give deference to federal agencies when creating regulations based on an ambiguous law. Conservatives have long sought to rein in regulatory authority, arguing Washington has too much control over industry.\n\nThe justices have been incrementally diminishing federal power for years, but the new case gives the court an opportunity to take a much broader stroke.\n\nCritics fear a ruling for the fishermen would threaten a vast swath of other federal regulations aimed at protecting the environment, public health and workplace safety. The cases are Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo and Relentless v. Department of Commerce. Lower courts sided with the government in both cases.\n\nAccess to abortion pill maintained\n\nIn another major abortion case, the Supreme Court upheld US Food and Drug Administration efforts to expand access to the abortion pill mifepristone.\n\nThe ruling was a significant setback for the anti-abortion movement in what was the first major Supreme Court case on reproductive rights since the conservative majority overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. By ruling that the anti-abortion doctors don't have standing to sue, the court left expanded access to the drug in place.\n\nAccess to mifepristone has become particularly important after the court overturned Roe and many states banned the procedure in clinical settings. Medication abortions account for nearly two-thirds of all abortions in the US, according to some estimates.\n\nThe appeal was filed by anti-abortion doctors who said their practices have been affected because they must treat women who had complications from the drug. The FDA and outside medical groups have stressed that mifepristone is safe.\n\nThe lead medical group in the suit, the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, was incorporated in Amarillo, Texas, months before it sued. The location allowed the group to choose a court where it was guaranteed to be assigned to conservative US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk. Now, the case is expected to return to Kacsmaryk's court.\n\nThough the decision was a win for abortion rights groups, it was not a total victory: Other groups are likely to sue over the same provisions. Three conservative states that intervened in the original lawsuit may attempt to revive it.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Wade. Public opinion of the court remains at record lows. ConservativeJustice Samuel Alito, meanwhile, is facing sharp blowback over two controversial flags raised at his homes in Virginia and New Jersey.\n\nHere are some of the remaining cases to be decided before July.\n\nTrump's appeal for immunity from special counsel Jack Smith's election subversion charges landed at the Supreme Court late in the term and instantly overshadowed most of the docket.\n\nTrump argued that without immunity, presidents would be hamstrung in office, always fearful of being second guessed by a zealous prosecutor after leaving the White House. That position appeared to have some purchase on the conservative Supreme Court during oral arguments in April, though it didn't appear Trump would be able to get Smith's case tossed entirely.\n\nThe immunity case, appears likely to come down to whether Trump's post-election actions were \"official\" - that is, steps he was taking as president - or whether they were \"private,\" which would not likely receive immunity.\n\nAn appeals court in Washington sided against Trump.\n\nThe Supreme Court will decide what happens when pregnant women show up to the hospital with medical emergencies in states that have strict bans on abortion. An Idaho law bars doctors from performing abortions unless the mother's life is at risk, but it makes no exception if that she would suffer long-term health consequences.\n\nThe Biden administration argues a federal law requires hospitals to perform abortions if the health of a mother is at stake,and an appeals court agreed.\n\nThe decision in Moyle v. US will place abortion access on the forefront again this summer just as Americans begin tuning into the presidential election.\n\nA former Pennsylvania police officer who rioted at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, challenged federal obstruction charges filed against him in a case that could also affect Trump. The former president was charged with violating the same obstruction law for different reasons.\n\nThe case was filed by Joseph Fischer, who was charged with multiple crimes for pushing his way into the Capitol after attending Trump's rally outside the White House on January 6. Fischer's attorney told the justices that prosecutors went too far by charging his client with \"obstructing\" an official proceeding, a crime he said Congress intended to be used to prohibit the destruction of evidence.\n\nSome 350 rioters were charged with the crime, which can add up to 20 years to a prison sentence. Some of those charges have since been dropped as part of plea agreements.\n\nProsecutors say the charge should apply to the January 6 cases because the plain meaning of the words \"obstruct\" and \"official proceeding\" covers the attack that interrupted Congress' counting of ballots to certify JoeBiden's 2020 win. Critics say the law was intended to prevent evidence tampering before a trial or investigation.\n\nIn a significant Second Amendment case, the justices must weigh the constitutionality of a federal law that bars people who are the subject of domestic violence restraining orders from possessing guns.\n\nA Texas man, Zackey Rahimi, was indicted for violating that law following a series of shootings, including one in which police said he fired into the air at a Whataburger restaurant after a friend's credit card was declined.\n\nRahimi's lawyers say a Supreme Court decision two years ago in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen meant the domestic violence law cannot be squared with the Constitution because it has no historical analogue. A 6-3 majority in Bruen said gun regulations must be \"consistent with this nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation.\"\n\nAn appeals court in Louisiana sided with Rahimi.\n\nThe Supreme Court is confronting a series of cases at the intersection of the First Amendment and social media. Perhaps the most notable are two suits challenging laws enacted in Florida and Texas aimed at stopping social media giants like Facebook and X from throttling conservative views.\n\nThe state laws ban online platforms from removing posts that express opinions, such as political content. The Republican governors who signed the laws said they were needed to keep the social media platforms from discriminating against conservatives.\n\nTwo trade associations representing the social media companies sued, claiming they violated the First Amendment. One federal appeals court in Atlanta sided with the companies and against Florida. Another, in New Orleans, allowed the Texas law to take effect. The Supreme Court paused implementation of the Texas law in 2022.\n\nThe cases are Moody v. NetChoice and NetChoice v. Paxton.\n\nThe justices must decide if the White House and federal agencies such as the FBI may urge social media platforms to take down content the government views as misinformation, or whether those efforts violate the First Amendment.\n\nBiden officials have for years tried to persuadesocial media platforms to take down posts featuring misinformation about vaccines, the Covid-19 pandemic and the 2020 election, among other things.\n\nRepublican officials in two states - Missouri and Louisiana - and five social media users sued over that practice in 2022, arguing the administration did far more than \"persuade\" the tech giants to take down a few deceptive items. The case is Murthy v. Missouri.\n\nA series of cases this term challenge the power of federal agencies to approve regulations - or enforce them. Among the most significant are two appeals filed by Atlantic herring fishermen. The captains are challenging a Department of Commerce regulation that requires them to pay the salary of federal observers they bring on board to monitor the catch and ensure the crew follows other fishing regulations.\n\nThe court is being asked to overturn a 1984 precedent - Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council - that required courts to give deference to federal agencies when creating regulations based on an ambiguous law. Conservatives have long sought to rein in regulatory authority, arguing Washington has too much control over industry.\n\nThe justices have been incrementally diminishing federal power for years, but the new case gives the court an opportunity to take a much broader stroke.\n\nCritics fear a ruling for the fishermen would threaten a vast swath of other federal regulations aimed at protecting the environment, public health and workplace safety. The cases are Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo and Relentless v. Department of Commerce. Lower courts sided with the government in both cases.\n\nIn another major abortion case, the Supreme Court upheld US Food and Drug Administration efforts to expand access to the abortion pill mifepristone.\n\nThe ruling was a significant setback for the anti-abortion movement in what was the first major Supreme Court case on reproductive rights since the conservative majority overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. By ruling that the anti-abortion doctors don't have standing to sue, the court left expanded access to the drug in place.\n\nAccess to mifepristone has become particularly important after the court overturned Roe and many states banned the procedure in clinical settings. Medication abortions account for nearly two-thirds of all abortions in the US, according to some estimates.\n\nThe appeal was filed by anti-abortion doctors who saidtheir practices have been affected because they must treat women who had complications from the drug. The FDA and outside medical groups have stressed that mifepristone is safe.\n\nThe lead medical group in the suit, the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, was incorporated in Amarillo, Texas, months before it sued. The location allowed the group to choose a court where it was guaranteed to be assigned to conservative US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk. Now, the case is expected to return to Kacsmaryk's court.\n\nThough the decision was a win for abortion rights groups, it was not a total victory: Other groups are likely to sue over the same provisions. Three conservative states that intervened in the original lawsuit may attempt to revive it.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Trump's trial in Washington, D.C., may not take place before the November election, even if the court rules he is not immune.\n\nJan. 6, 2021\n\nA former Pennsylvania police officer is challenging the validity of obstruction charges brought against hundreds of people who took part in the violent assault on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Trump faces the same charge of obstructing an official proceeding.\n\nThe issue is whether a law meant to discourage tampering with documents sought in investigations can be used against the Capitol rioters.\n\nEmergency abortion\n\nThere's a second abortion case on the docket this year: whether doctors can provide that medical procedure in emergencies in states that banned abortion after the court overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\nIn a case out of Idaho, the Biden administration says abortions must be allowed in emergencies where a woman's health is at serious risk.\n\nThe state argues that its strict abortion ban does allow abortions to save a woman's life, and doesn't need to expand exceptions for health risks.\n\nGuns\n\nThe justices are weighing whether to uphold a federal law that seeks to protect domestic violence victims by keeping guns away from the people alleged to have abused them. An appeals court struck down a law that prohibits people under domestic violence restraining orders from possessing firearms. That court found that the law violated the 2nd Amendment right to \"keep and bear arms\" following the Supreme Court's 2022 ruling that expanded gun rights and changed how courts are supposed to evaluate gun restrictions.\n\nHomelessness\n\nThe most significant Supreme Court case in decades on homelessness centers on whether people can be banned from sleeping outdoors when shelter space is lacking.\n\nA San Francisco-based appeals court decision said that amounts to cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nLeaders from California and across the West say that the ruling makes it harder for them to regulate homeless encampments encroaching on sidewalks and other public places.\n\nAdvocates say it would criminalize homelessness just as rising costs have pushed the number of people without a permanent place to live to record levels.\n\nChevron\n\nThe justices could overturn a 40-year-old decision that has been cited thousands of times in federal court cases and used to uphold regulations on the environment, public health, workplace safety and consumer protections. The decision colloquially known as Chevron calls on judges to defer to federal regulators when the words of a statute are not crystal clear. The decision has long been targeted by conservative and business interests who say Chevron robs judges of their authority and gives too much power to regulators.\n\nSocial media\n\nThree cases remain unresolved at the intersection of social media and government.\n\nTwo cases involve social media laws in Texas and Florida that would limit how Facebook, TikTok, X, YouTube and other social media platforms regulate content posted by their users. While the details vary, both laws aimed to address conservative complaints that the social media companies were liberal-leaning and censored users based on their viewpoints, especially on the political right.\n\nIn the third case, Republican-led states are suing the Biden administration over how far the federal government can go to combat controversial social media posts on topics including COVID-19 and election security. A federal appeals court sided with the states in finding that administration officials unconstitutionally coerced the platforms to limit conservative points of view.\n\nPurdue Pharma\n\nThe Supreme Court controls the fate of a nationwide settlement with OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma that would allocate billions of dollars to combat the opioid epidemic, but also provide a legal shield for members of the Sackler family who own the company. The settlement has been on hold since last summer after the Supreme Court agreed to weigh in.\n\nAir pollution\n\nRepublican-led, energy-producing states and the steel industry want the court to put the Environmental Protection Agency's air pollution-fighting \"good neighbor\" plan on hold while legal challenges continue. The plan aims to protect downwind states that receive unwanted air pollution from other states.\n\nSEC\n\nAnother important regulatory case could strip the SEC of a major tool in fighting securities fraud and have far-reaching effects on other regulatory agencies. The court is being asked to rule that people facing civil fraud complaints have the right to a jury trial in federal court.\n\n___\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the U.S. Supreme Court at https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court.", "source": {"uri": "winnipegfreepress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Winnipeg Free Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructing_an_official_proceeding", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Obstructing an official proceeding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_immunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sovereign immunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_law_(common_law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil law (common law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevron_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chevron Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Domestic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

Justices announced that Friday will be an order day, during which the court \"may announce opinions\" on cases before them, Newsweek reported.\n\nIf necessary, the court could extend the deadline to July to conclude all cases. Opinions are issued at 10 a.m. E.T. on opinion days.\n\nSo far this term, the court has heard more than 60 cases and issues decisions on legal issues including bump stocks and access to the abortion pill. There are about 20 unresolved cases.\n\nHere's a look at the Supreme Court's remaining crucial cases, spanning from guns to social media:\n\nThe Supreme Court is considering the extent of presidential immunity from criminal prosecution for actions taken during a former president's tenure.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has argued that former presidents are immune from prosecution for official acts in office and seeks dismissal of his federal election interference indictment.\n\nWhile the Supreme Court has previously ruled that ex-presidents can't be sued in civil cases for actions taken in office, it hasn't addressed criminal immunity.\n\nThe court's ruling will come as Trump's trial in Washington might not occur before the November election, even if he isn't deemed immune.\n\nJustices must still decide whether federal prosecutors can charge the defendants in the Jan. 6, 2021 riots at the U.S. Capitol with obstruction.\n\nA former Pennsylvania police officer is challenging the use of obstruction charges against hundreds of rioters, the same charge Trump faces for obstructing an official proceeding.\n\nThe key issue is whether a law aimed at preventing document tampering can be applied to the rioters.\n\nThe justices are also considering whether the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act overrides state laws prohibiting abortions, such as Idaho's Defense of Life Act.\n\nA second abortion case questions whether doctors can perform abortions in medical emergencies in states that banned abortions after the court overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that conferred a constitutional right to abortion.\n\nThe Biden administration argues abortions must be allowed in emergencies when a woman's health is at serious risk.\n\nIdaho contends its abortion ban allows procedures to save a woman's life without broader exceptions for health risks.\n\nThe justices are weighing whether to uphold a federal law that prevents people under domestic violence restraining orders from possessing firearms.\n\nAn appeals court struck down the law, ruling it is a violation of the Second Amendment, following a 2022 Supreme Court ruling that expanded gun rights.\n\nThree unresolved cases involve the government's regulation of social media.\n\nTwo cases involve Texas and Florida laws limiting how social media platforms like Facebook, TikTok, X and YouTube regulate user content, addressing conservative complaints of censorship.\n\nThe third case involves Republican-led states suing the Biden administration over its efforts to combat controversial social media posts on topics including COVID-19 and election security.\n\nA federal appeals court sided with the states, finding the administration unconstitutionally pressured the platforms to limit conservative viewpoints.\n\nJustices will also determine whether people can be banned from sleeping outdoors when homeless shelter space is lacking.\n\nA San Francisco-based appeals court ruled that such bans are cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nLeaders from California and across the West argue this makes regulating homeless encampments difficult, while advocates believe it would criminalize homelessness amid rising housing costs.\n\nJustices must still decide whether a regulatory case could limit the Securities and Exchange Commission's ability to fight securities fraud by ensuring that people facing civil fraud complaints have the right to a jury trial in federal court, impacting other regulatory agencies as well.", "source": {"uri": "newsnationnow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsNation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "taylor_delandro@newsnationnow.com", "name": "Taylor Delandro", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_immunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sovereign immunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NewsNation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NewsNation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bump_stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bump stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructing_an_official_proceeding", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Obstructing an official proceeding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

Trump faces the same charge of obstructing an official proceeding.\n\nThe issue is whether a law meant to discourage tampering with documents sought in investigations can be used against the Capitol rioters.\n\nAbortion opponents are trying to make it harder for pregnant women to obtain medication abortions. They want the Supreme Court to roll back changes made by the FDA that have made it easier to obtain mifepristone, one of the two drugs used in nearly two-thirds of abortions in the United States last year. Those include eliminating the need for in-person visits and allowing the drug to be mailed.\n\nMost Republican-led states have severely restricted or banned abortion since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. The high court's decision in this case will affect abortion even in states where it remains legal.\n\nThe justices are weighing whether to uphold a federal law that seeks to protect domestic violence victims by keeping guns away from the people alleged to have abused them. An appeals court struck down a law that prohibits people under domestic violence restraining orders from possessing firearms. That court found that the law violated the 2nd Amendment right to \"keep and bear arms\" following the Supreme Court's 2022 ruling that expanded gun rights and changed how courts are supposed to evaluate gun restrictions.\n\nThe most significant Supreme Court case in decades on homelessness centers on whether people can be banned from sleeping outdoors when shelter space is lacking.\n\nA San Francisco-based appeals court decision said that amounts to cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nLeaders from California and across the West say that the ruling makes it harder for them to regulate homeless encampments encroaching on sidewalks and other public places.\n\nAdvocates say it would criminalize homelessness just as rising costs have pushed the number of people without a permanent place to live to record levels.\n\nThere's a second abortion case on the docket this year: whether doctors can provide that medical procedure in emergencies in states that banned abortion after the court overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\nIn a case out of Idaho, the Biden administration says abortions must be allowed in emergencies where a woman's health is at serious risk.\n\nThe state argues that its strict abortion ban does allow abortions to save a woman's life, and doesn't need to expand exceptions for health risks.\n\nThe Trump administration banned bump stocks, a gun accessory that allows rapid fire like a machine gun, after they were used in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.\n\nThe ban is being challenged by a Texas gun shop owner who says the Justice Department was wrong to reverse course and declare them illegal machine guns after the 2017 Las Vegas massacre.\n\nThe Biden administration argues banning them after the shooting that left 60 people dead was the right call.\n\nThe justices could overturn a 40-year-old decision that has been cited thousands of times in federal court cases and used to uphold regulations on the environment, public health, workplace safety and consumer protections. The decision colloquially known as Chevron calls on judges to defer to federal regulators when the words of a statute are not crystal clear. The decision has long been targeted by conservative and business interests who say Chevron robs judges of their authority and gives too much power to regulators.\n\nThree cases remain unresolved at the intersection of social media and government.\n\nTwo cases involve social media laws in Texas and Florida that would limit how Facebook, TikTok, X, YouTube and other social media platforms regulate content posted by their users. While the details vary, both laws aimed to address conservative complaints that the social media companies were liberal-leaning and censored users based on their viewpoints, especially on the political right.\n\nIn the third case, Republican-led states are suing the Biden administration over how far the federal government can go to combat controversial social media posts on topics including COVID-19 and election security. A federal appeals court sided with the states in finding that administration officials unconstitutionally coerced the platforms to limit conservative points of view.\n\nThe Supreme Court controls the fate of a nationwide settlement with OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma that would allocate billions of dollars to combat the opioid epidemic, but also provide a legal shield for members of the Sackler family who own the company. The settlement has been on hold since last summer after the Supreme Court agreed to weigh in.\n\nA business-backed challenge to a tax on foreign income is being watched closely for what it might say about the fate of a wealth tax, an often discussed but never implemented tax on the wealthiest Americans.\n\nRepublican-led, energy-producing states and the steel industry want the court to put the Environmental Protection Agency's air pollution-fighting \"good neighbor\" plan on hold while legal challenges continue. The plan aims to protect downwind states that receive unwanted air pollution from other states.\n\nAnother important regulatory case could strip the SEC of a major tool in fighting securities fraud and have far-reaching effects on other regulatory agencies. The court is being asked to rule that people facing civil fraud complaints have the right to a jury trial in federal court.\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Given the current pace of opinions, the term could slip into early July, something that has not happened since the height of the pandemic.\n\nTrump has touted the three appointments he made that gave the court a supermajority of conservatives as one of his top accomplishments as president. But his campaign was circumspect last week when commenting on the court's decisions to strike down a ban on bump stocks imposed by his administration and to throw out a challenge to a widely used abortion pill.\n\nHere's a look at the major pending decisions.\n\nCan Trump be prosecuted for trying to steal 2020 election?\n\nThe biggest outstanding decision is whether criminal charges that Donald Trump tried to steal the 2020 election can go forward.\n\nCritics charge that the court has taken so long to decide the case that it will likely to be impossible for a trial to conclude before the November election - even if a majority rule Trump is not immune from prosecution.\n\nThat's particularly true if the court finds Trump has some immunity and requires the judge overseeing the trial to conduct additional proceedings to determine how that applies to the specific charges he faces. The high court could also say Trump must be given a chance to appeal that determination, which would further delay a trial.\n\nWhat charges can be brought against Jan. 6 defendants?\n\nAnother case deals with an obstruction charge wielded against one-fourth of the defendants in the Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021 - and against Trump.\n\nJoseph Fischer, a former police officer in central Pennsylvania, entered the Capitol and was charged with obstructing Congress, which was counting Electoral College votes that confirmed Biden won the election.\n\nThe issue is whether the law making obstruction a crime was meant to apply only to the destruction of documents rather than interrupting a public meeting.\n\nThe decision could have broad impact. About 350 out of the first 1,350 defendants from Jan. 6 were charged under the obstruction law.\n\nTwo of the four federal charges in Trump's election interference case fall under the obstruction law. He could potentially benefit if the justices overturn the law or restrict its application for interrupting Congress.\n\nAre emergency abortions allowed in states with strict bans?\n\nThe Biden administration challenged Idaho's strict abortion ban, arguing it conflicts with a federal law that requires hospitals provide stabilizing care.\n\nIdaho allows abortions to save the life - but not the health - of the mother.\n\nDoctors in Idaho say they can't treat women who might lose organs or their reproductive ability, have uncontrollable bleeding or suffer other serious health consequences without an abortion - unless her life is clearly in danger.\n\nThe decision will be the first time the court has weighed in on abortion bans passed since it overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.\n\nIs a law banning domestic abusers from having guns constitutional?\n\nAfter a Texas man, Zackey Rahimi, who was involved in five shootings pleaded guilty to the federal crime of possessing guns while subject to a restraining order, an appeals court threw out his conviction.\n\nThe New Orleans-based 5 U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals relied on the Supreme Court's blockbuster 2022 decision that gun regulations must be \"consistent with this nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation\" to survive court challenges.\n\nIf the Supreme Court rules that a law banning domestic abusers from owning guns is not consistent with past regulations so violates the 2 Amendment, it would be a continuation of the conservative court's expansion of gun rights even for potentially dangerous people.\n\nBut such a decision could also help the president's son, Hunter Biden, who was convicted this month of lying about his drug use when buying a revolver in 2018. Like Rahimi, Biden has argued the charge is unconstitutional under the Supreme Court's 2022 decision.\n\nCan social media content moderation be restricted?\n\nThe high court is considering a trio of cases about content moderation on social media that grew out of concerns from conservatives that their views were being stifled.\n\nIn one case, the court is deciding whether the Biden administration improperly leaned on social media platforms to remove postings on COVID-19, the 2020 elections and other issues that it considered disinformation.\n\nIn the other cases, the court is deciding if laws passed by Texas and Florida to limit the ability of powerful social media companies to moderate content are constitutional.\n\nTrade groups representing the nation's social media companies argue the laws violate the First Amendment and would make it impossible to keep sites free from objectionable or harmful content.\n\nCan a homeless person be penalized for sleeping outside?\n\nAs the nation struggles to respond to an affordable housing crises, the high court is deciding whether an Oregon city can bar people who are homeless from sleeping outside if shelter is not available.\n\nAn appeals court said the ban amounts to cruel and unusual punishment. But city officials say they're being forced to surrender their public spaces.\n\nA record number of Americans lack permanent housing and both Democratic and Republican leaders have complained past court rulings have hamstrung their ability to address homeless encampments that threaten health and public safety.\n\nAdvocates for the homeless saying fining or throwing in jail someone with no where else to go will not solve the problem.\n\nWill the federal government's regulatory powers be curtailed?\n\nA conservative court that's been increasingly skeptical of federal power could make it harder for agencies to issue regulations. The court is expected to weaken, and possibly overturn, a 40-year-old precedent that has guided how federal agencies protect the environment, workers, consumers and more.\n\nUnder what's known as the Chevron doctrine, courts have deferred to an agency's interpretation of a law if the statute isn't clear and the interpretation is reasonable.\n\nCritics say that's given the executive branch too much authority.\n\nDefenders of the doctrine say Congress cannot anticipate every circumstance when, for example, writing laws to protect the environment and subject matter experts at the agencies are needed to fill in the blanks.\n\nIn a separate case, the Supreme Court is deciding if the Biden administration can enforce a \"good neighbor\" plan to reduce smog-forming pollution while its legality is being challenged.\n\nWill a multi-billion-dollar settlement over opioid crisis survive?\n\nA high-profile bankruptcy settlement with the company that made oxycontin could be saved or scuttled by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe decision will have sweeping implications for states, which intend to use settlement money for drug treatment programs. It will also have big implications for the Sackler family, which made its fortune selling a drug that fueled the nation's opioid epidemic.\n\nThe vast majority of victims supported the settlement with Purdue Pharma, the company that marketed OxyContin as a less addictive painkiller than other opioids. But the Justice Department stepped into the case to question whether courts could shield the Sacklers from future civil lawsuits - a practice that has been used in major bankruptcies dealing with harms caused by asbestos and silicone breast implants.\n\nWhile the case deals with a technical question of bankruptcy law, there are wrenching stories not far below the surface involving Americans who had lost children, spouses and parents to a crisis that claimed about 80,000 lives in 2022.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_immunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sovereign immunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "High Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Idaho"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Idaho"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bump_stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bump stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_rule", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Majority rule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supermajority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Domestic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

Given the current pace of opinions, the term could slip into early July, something that has not happened since the height of the pandemic.\n\nAnd the opinions will be dropping in the lead up to the first presidential debate, on June 27, between Trump and President Joe Biden.\n\nBiden has already tried to make the Supreme Court a major issue in the campaign.\n\n\"The Supreme Court has never been as out of kilter as it is today,\" Biden said during a recent star-studded Hollywood fundraiser. \"I mean never.\"\n\nTrump has touted the three appointments he made that gave the court a supermajority of conservatives as one of his top accomplishments as president. But his campaign was circumspect last week when commenting on the court's decisions to strike down a ban on bump stocks imposed by his administration and to throw out a challenge to a widely used abortion pill.\n\nHere's a look at the major pending decisions.\n\nThe biggest outstanding decision is whether criminal charges that Trump tried to steal the 2020 election can go forward.\n\nCritics charge that the court has taken so long to decide the case that it will likely to be impossible for a trial to conclude before the November election even if a majority rule Trump is not immune from prosecution.\n\nThat's particularly true if the court finds Trump has some immunity and requires the judge overseeing the trial to conduct additional proceedings to determine how that applies to the specific charges Trump faces. The high court could also say Trump must be given a chance to appeal that determination, which would further delay a trial.\n\nAnother case deals with an obstruction charge wielded against one-fourth of the defendants in the Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021 - and against Trump.\n\nJoseph Fischer, a former police officer in central Pennsylvania, entered the Capitol and was charged with obstructing Congress, which was counting Electoral College votes that confirmed Biden won the election.\n\nThe issue is whether the law making obstruction a crime was meant to apply only to the destruction of documents rather than interrupting a public meeting.\n\nThe decision could have broad impact. About 350 out of the first 1,350 defendants from Jan. 6 were charged under the obstruction law.\n\nTwo of the four federal charges in Trump's election interference case fall under the obstruction law. He could potentially benefit if the justices overturn the law or restrict its application for interrupting Congress.\n\nThe Biden administration challenged Idaho's strict abortion ban, arguing it conflicts with a federal law that requires hospitals provide stabilizing care.\n\nIdaho allows abortions to save the life - but not the health - of the mother.\n\nDoctors in Idaho say they can't treat women who might lose organs or their reproductive ability, have uncontrollable bleeding or suffer other serious health consequences without an abortion - unless her life is clearly in danger.\n\nThe decision will be the first time the court has weighed in on abortion bans passed since it overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.\n\nAfter a Texas man, Zackey Rahimi, who was involved in five shootings pleaded guilty to the federal crime of possessing guns while subject to a restraining order, an appeals court threw out his conviction.\n\nThe New Orleans-based 5 U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals relied on the Supreme Court's blockbuster 2022 decision that gun regulations must be \"consistent with this nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation\" to survive court challenges.\n\nIf the Supreme Court rules that a law banning domestic abusers from owning guns is not consistent with past regulations so violates the 2 Amendment, it would be a continuation of the conservative court's expansion of gun rights even for potentially dangerous people.\n\nBut such a decision could also help the president's son, Hunter Biden, who was convicted this month of lying about his drug use when buying a revolver in 2018. Like Rahimi, Biden has argued the charge is unconstitutional under the Supreme Court's 2022 decision.\n\nThe high court is considering a trio of cases about content moderation on social media that grew out of concerns from conservatives that their views were being stifled.\n\nIn one case, the court is deciding whether the Biden administration improperly leaned on social media platforms to remove postings on COVID-19, the 2020 elections and other issues that it considered disinformation.\n\nIn the other cases, the court is deciding if laws passed by Texas and Florida to limit the ability of powerful social media companies to moderate content are constitutional.\n\nTrade groups representing the nation's social media companies argue the laws violate the First Amendment and would make it impossible to keep sites free from objectionable or harmful content.\n\nAs the nation struggles to respond to an affordable housing crises, the high court is deciding whether an Oregon city can bar people who are homeless from sleeping outside if shelter is not available.\n\nAn appeals court said the ban amounts to cruel and unusual punishment. But city officials say they're being forced to surrender their public spaces.\n\nA record number of Americans lack permanent housing and both Democratic and Republican leaders have complained past court rulings have hamstrung their ability to address homeless encampments that threaten health and public safety.\n\nAdvocates for the homeless saying fining or throwing in jail someone with no where else to go will not solve the problem.\n\nA conservative court that's been increasingly skeptical of federal power could make it harder for agencies to issue regulations. The court is expected to weaken, and possibly overturn, a 40-year-old precedent that has guided how federal agencies protect the environment, workers, consumers and more.\n\nUnder what's known as the Chevron doctrine, courts have deferred to an agency's interpretation of a law if the statute isn't clear and the interpretation is reasonable.\n\nCritics say that's given the executive branch too much authority.\n\nDefenders of the doctrine say Congress cannot anticipate every circumstance when, for example, writing laws to protect the environment and subject matter experts at the agencies are needed to fill in the blanks.\n\nIn a separate case, the Supreme Court is deciding if the Biden administration can enforce a \"good neighbor\" plan to reduce smog-forming pollution while its legality is being challenged.\n\nA high-profile bankruptcy settlement with the company that made oxycontin could be saved or scuttled by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe decision will have sweeping implications for states, which intend to use settlement money for drug treatment programs. It will also have big implications for the Sackler family, which made its fortune selling a drug that fueled the nation's opioid epidemic.\n\nThe vast majority of victims supported the settlement with Purdue Pharma, the company that marketed OxyContin as a less addictive painkiller than other opioids. But the Justice Department stepped into the case to question whether courts could shield the Sacklers from future civil lawsuits - a practice that has been used in major bankruptcies dealing with harms caused by asbestos and silicone breast implants.\n\nWhile the case deals with a technical question of bankruptcy law, there are wrenching stories not far below the surface involving Americans who had lost children, spouses and parents to a crisis that claimed about 80,000 lives in 2022.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "High Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Idaho"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Idaho"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bump_stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bump stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_immunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sovereign immunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_rule", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Majority rule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supermajority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

The high court is expected to issue more opinions on Friday.\n\nThe nation's top court has less than 20 rulings left to issue before they depart for summer break near the end of June. Rulings on hot-button issues like abortion rights, gun access and former President Donald Trump's criminal cases could have real implications for the 2024 presidential race, especially as President Biden and Trump prepare to face off in their first debate of the campaign next week on June 27.\n\nHere are some of the major cases the 6-3 conservative-majority court is expected to decide in the coming weeks. Check back with Yahoo News for updates as the rulings come in.\n\n\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 Presidential immunity for Trump\n\nCase: Trump v. United States\n\nNot yet decided\n\nCase argued: April 25, 2024\n\nThe issue: Whether a former president has sweeping immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts allegedly carried out while serving in the White House.\n\nWhat's at stake: The Supreme Court's decision will determine if special counsel Jack Smith's Jan. 6 criminal case against Trump will proceed in Washington, D.C. The former president currently faces election obstruction charges for his alleged efforts to overturn the results of Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election. The ruling will also affect two other criminal cases against Trump: a federal case related to his alleged mishandling of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago; and a case in Georgia stemming from his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in the state. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all charges related to the three criminal cases against him.\n\nRead more: Key takeaways from Supreme Court hearing on whether Trump has presidential immunity that shields him from criminal trials\n\n\u2696\ufe0f Obstruction charges for Jan. 6 defendants -- and Trump\n\nCase: Fischer v. United States\n\nNot yet decided\n\nCase argued: April 16, 2024\n\nThe issue: Whether U.S. prosecutors can use a federal law that makes it a crime to obstruct or impede an official proceeding to charge hundreds of Jan. 6 defendants. The official proceeding, U.S. prosecutors argue, was Congress's electoral vote to certify Joe Biden's victory on Jan. 6, 2021, which was interrupted by pro-Trump rioters.\n\nWhat's at stake: Hundreds of Jan. 6 defendants who have already been convicted and sentenced under the federal law in question -- the Sarbanes-Oxley Act -- would have to be resentenced. However, according to the New York Times, every Jan. 6 defendant currently charged under the obstruction statute is also facing charges for other crimes, meaning the Justice Department's cases won't be completely upended if the Supreme Court rules in favor of the defendants.\n\nTrump has also been charged with two counts of obstructing and conspiring to obstruct an official proceeding under this same federal law. If the Supreme Court rules in favor of plaintiff Joseph Fischer, Trump could try to dispute the charges against him in the federal Jan. 6 criminal case.\n\nRead more: How the Supreme Court could upend the DOJ's Jan. 6 case against Trump\n\n\ud83d\udceb\ud83e\ude7a Abortion pill access\n\nCases consolidated into one: FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine; Danco Laboratories, LLC v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine\n\nDecided: June 13, 2024\n\nCase argued: March 26, 2024\n\nThe ruling: In a 9-0 unanimous decision, the justices tossed out a lawsuit that challenged the Food and Drug Administration's guidelines allowing mifepristone, a widely used abortion drug, to be prescribed via telemedicine and accessed through the mail.\n\nWhat it means: If the Supreme Court would have ruled against the FDA, restrictions on mifepristone would have reverted back to what they were when the drug was approved in 2000. But since the Supreme Court tossed the case, prescriptions will still be allowed during the first 10 weeks of pregnancy and the medication can still be prescribed over telehealth visits and be delivered by mail in states that allow it. The ruling comes nearly two years after the Supreme Court overturned the federal right to an abortion established by Roe v. Wade. As a result of that historic decision, over a dozen states now have near-total abortion bans in place.\n\nRead the opinion here.\n\n\ud83c\udfe5 Abortion in health emergencies\n\nCases consolidated into one: Moyle v. United States; Idaho v. United States\n\nNot yet decided\n\nCase argued: April 24, 2024\n\nThe issue: Whether a federal law that requires Medicare-participating hospitals to provide abortions in certain medical emergencies overrides state law in places with near-total bans on abortion, including Idaho.\n\nWhat's at stake: If the justices rule in favor of the federal government, emergency rooms in over a dozen states with near-total abortion bans would have to provide abortion care if necessary to stabilize a patient in certain circumstances.\n\nRelated: Supreme Court to decide if states can ban one specific type of emergency care\n\n\u2753Gun access for alleged domestic abusers\n\nCase: United States v. Rahimi\n\nNot yet decided\n\nCase argued: Nov. 7, 2023\n\nThe issue: The justices will have to decide whether a federal law, which bans people under domestic-violence restraining orders from possessing guns, violates the Second Amendment. (The Second Amendment protects a person's right as a civilian to own a firearm.)\n\nWhat's at stake: Perpetrators of domestic violence could have their gun rights restored. The case will also test the limits of the Supreme Court's 2022 decision in New York State Rifle & Pistol Assoc. v. Bruen, which expanded gun rights. That ruling said that proposed gun laws have to be \"consistent\" with the historical tradition of firearm regulation, requiring the government to provide examples of obscure or defunct regulations.\n\nRead more: How SCOTUS's decision on a law disarming domestic abusers could impact you\n\n\u274c Ban on bump stocks\n\nCase: Garland v. Cargill\n\nDecided: June 14, 2024\n\nCase argued: Feb. 28, 2024\n\nThe ruling: In a 6-3 ruling, the court struck down a Trump-era ban on bump stocks, which are rifle attachments that increase the speed at which bullets are fired. Justice Clarence Thomas, who delivered the opinion, said that bump stocks do not make semiautomatic rifles into fully automatic machine guns. In her dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the majority opinion would have \"deadly consequences.\"\n\nWhat it means: The court found that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives overstepped its authority by enacting the ban on bump stocks when it determined that the devices were classified as machine guns. Civilians now have access to bump stocks again. In the aftermath of the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting that killed dozens of people, the ATF issued a rule that said rifles equipped with bump stocks should fall under the legal definition of machine guns, which have been banned since 1986. The Supreme Court decision did away with the bump stock ban, eradicating one of the few existing gun control measures in the U.S.\n\nRead the opinion here.\n\n\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f Social media and the First Amendment\n\nCases consolidated into one: NetChoice, LLC v. Paxton; Moody v. NetChoice, LLC\n\nNot yet decided\n\nCase argued: Feb. 26, 2024\n\nThe issue: Florida and Texas currently have laws in place that prohibit large social media companies from removing posts or accounts based on a specific political view. The justices will decide whether these laws violate the First Amendment rights of social media companies. (The First Amendment protects free speech.)\n\nWhat's at stake: The Republican governors who enacted the 2021 laws allege that Silicon Valley social media companies, like Facebook and X, constrict the reach of conservative viewpoints. The Supreme Court will essentially decide if editorial decisions made by tech giants are protected by free speech rights.\n\nMore background about the case: Supreme Court hears landmark cases on free speech and social media moderation in Texas, Florida\n\n\ud83d\udcf1 Social media and misinformation\n\nCase: Murthy v. Missouri\n\nNot yet decided\n\nCase argued: March 18, 2024\n\nThe issue: The justices will have to decide if the Biden administration violated the First Amendment when it urged major social media companies to take down what the government considers misinformation about the 2020 election and public health.\n\nWhat's at stake: This case will be a test for the Supreme Court to see how far federal officials can push social media platforms to censor certain kinds of content before such actions are seen as violating users' right to free speech.\n\nRead more about the case: Supreme Court hears arguments on whether the federal government can limit free speech on social media", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bump_stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bump stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_immunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sovereign immunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Law of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempts_to_overturn_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mifepristone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mifepristone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!

These include some major decisions like taking a call on Donald Trump's prosecution, gun rights, abortion access, social media content and much more.\n\nIt looks like the upcoming weeks will see some busy days for the Supreme Court as the highest judiciary body is currently sitting on multiple crucial decisions that are incredibly valuable to the current political scenario, as well as the future of the country in the coming years.\n\nAccording to a USA Today report, the coming days will see Supreme Court rulings around some major issues including gun rights, abortion, social media, federal regulatory authority and much more. Most importantly, the political sphere is closely observing the Supreme Court's ruling on whether former US President Donald Trump and his associates will be prosecuted for trying to change the course of the 2020 US Elections.\n\nUsually most pending cases are cleared off by the judicial authority within June but this time these decisions can even get delayed until July. Owing to the large magnitude of cases in the pending section, including some trivial ones involving policymaking and some political ones, these rulings can see a slight delay and all the pending cases can be dispensed hopefully by July, according to reports.\n\nThe biggest decision the Supreme Court has to take is whether Donald Trump should be prosecuted for 2020's incidents around the elections. There are other issues Trump has to face too, apart from this case but this one is surely a needle stuck right in the throat, indeed tough to wiggle through.\n\nMeanwhile, the US Supreme Court is also to take a call around multiple cases concerning content moderation on social media, with complaints arising that the voices of the people on social media re being stifled by the powerful social media companies.\n\nIn another instance, the Court will also decide whether Oregon city can penalize a person who is homeless, for sleeping outdoors, especially on the streets. Many activists and people from the region have deemed this decision as a very harsh one but the high court is yet to take a call on this.\n\nWho are the contestants in the US Presidential Elections?\n\nThe two primary contestants in the upcoming US Presidential Elections are Joe Biden and Donald. Biden is still serving as the US President while Trump has served as a former US President.\n\nCan a person be penalized in Oregon for sleeping on the streets?\n\nAccording to a new law passed in Oregon, homeless people sleeping on the street can be fined a hefty amount if found doing go.

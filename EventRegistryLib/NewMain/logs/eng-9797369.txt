Tom Craig (pictured), 28, was allegedly arrested on Tuesday night following a police swoop in the northern Pigalle area of the French capital.\n\nFranceInfo, a highly-respected public broadcaster, reported Craig 'was arrested while (allegedly) in possession of approximately one gram of cocaine'. Local prosecutors said Craig was spotted 'at the foot of a building in the ninth arrondissement', shortly after midnight.\n\nThe source told FranceInfo: 'The police arrested two men in the middle of a transaction.' The investigation was being carried out by the Narcotics Brigade of Paris police. In a statement, the Australia Olympic Committee said it 'has confirmed an Australian hockey team member is in custody after being arrested in Paris on August 6'.\n\n'No charges have been laid,' it said. 'The AOC is continuing to make enquiries and arrange support for the team member.' It's understood Craig was arrested just 15 minutes after leaving an Australian team function.\n\nThe unnamed seller was described as 17-year-old who was 'behaving like a dealer', said a prosecuting source. He was allegedly carrying seven vials of cocaine, 75 ecstacy tablets and three grams of Mephedrone. As the alleged dealer is legally a minor, he cannot be named.\n\nCraig was still in custody by late Wednesday morning. There was no initial comment from his legal counsel. Craig has represented Australia at hockey since he was a boy and was a member of the 2018 Commonwealth Games team, which won a gold medal.\n\nCraig's Olympic team, the Kookaburras - which won silver at the Tokyo Olympics, were eliminated from the Olympic quarterfinal earlier this week.\n\nUnder a French law introduced in 2020, people caught with less than five grams of cocaine can can face on-the-spot fines as low as \u20ac150 ($163 USD).\n\nThe recently-adopted law still allows those convicted of serious illicit drug use charges to spend up to a year behind bars. The rule was introduced to 'simplify the work of law enforcement officers' and reduce pressure on criminal courts.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

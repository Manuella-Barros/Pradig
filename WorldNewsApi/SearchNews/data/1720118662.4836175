{"id": 227478886, "title": "Ticked off! @lack of etiquette", "text": "Over the course of the last couple of weeks Orlando\u2019s city government has passed a regulation that all but closes the downtown parking lots at 11 p.m. making it harder for businesses to stay open much longer than that, and Hamburger Mary\u2019s on Church Street announced that it\u2019s closing because of declining business. When you factor in all of the other problems the core of downtown has been facing for so long, I have to wonder how long it\u2019ll be before Orlando changes its slogan from \u201cOrlando \u2013 The City Beautiful\u201d to something more fitting like \u201cOrlando \u2013 We Roll Up The Sidewalks From 11 p.m. to 7 a.m.\u201d I am ticked off that Spectrum only offers their internet assist program to new customers! It feels like they are punishing their loyal customers! They couldn\u2019t care less about the customers who are losing their ACP credit and could use some assistance! I am ticked off by the ignorant person who claims there are no pine trees in Pine Hills! Trust me, I have to rake up pine straw at least twice a year, there are pine trees in Pine Hills! Back in my day people were considerate and respectful. People practiced etiquette! Our parents taught us proper etiquette and we were raised to believe that etiquette was respect for others! My Father taught me that being late for an appointment was disrespectful behavior and that you are disrespecting the other person\u2019s time when you drag in late! I feel so disrespected by others who waste my time when they show up 30 minutes to an hour late and when they fail to call it makes a bad impression worse, then when their excuse is oversleeping that is like pouring salt on an open wound! I am ticked off by lack of etiquette! We need etiquette to come back in style and for people to stop wasting others time and disrespecting each other! The flip side How nice that some of the cartoonists set aside their usual levity on Memorial Day to honor those who died for our freedom. May our behavior as citizens be worthy of their sacrifice.", "summary": "See what upsets people and what occasionally makes them happy", "url": "https://www.orlandosentinel.com/2024/06/02/ticked-off-lack-of-etiquette-2/", "image": "https://www.orlandosentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/os-thumb-keyboard_6f2326.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-02 12:00:49", "author": "Ticked Off", "authors": ["Ticked Off"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.555}

PUNCH Metro gathered that several other persons sustained varying degrees of injury during both attacks. Sources in the areas who spoke to our correspondent on the condition of anonymity, because they were not permitted to do so, said several persons sustained varying degrees of injuries as the assailants suspected to be enforcing the Monday sit-at-home exercise shot indiscriminately into the air when they arrived. It was gathered that tragedy first struck in the industrial town of Nnewi when the gunmen arrived the community at about 11 am, killing a vigilante commander (name withheld). The sources said, \u201cThe gunmen arrived in three vehicles and went straight to a popular hotel at Nnewichi (name withheld). One of the persons in the hotel at the time they attacked was abducted by the gunmen. \u201cThe gunmen shot sporadically into the ground while the bullets were flying all around in the hotel\u2019s premises. Mobile phones and other valuables were collected from the victims the gunmen met in the hotel. \u201cThe vigilante commander who is popularly known as \u201cTallest\u201d after hearing about the incident, gave the hoodlums a hot chase. \u201cBut when the gunmen noticed that the vigilante commander was pursuing them, they shot at him at a point at Nnobi in Idemili South LGA of the state.\u201d Our source said the development forced many people who tried to brave the sit-at-home directive to quickly close their shops and run home. Similarly, the hoodlums, who were said to have also invaded the Nnobi community in a black Landcruiser jeep, opened fire on the vigilante operatives, leaving two of the security operatives, seriously injured. The eyewitnesses in the area narrated that the gunmen proceeded to a burial ceremony and also shot dead two other persons. They said, \u201cThey later drove to Afor Nnobi and shot dead three security personnel before getting to Ahuda where one other person was killed. The injured persons were rushed to a hospital in Nnewi(name withheld), where they are receiving medical attention. When our correspondent contacted the Police Public Relations Officer in Anambra State, Tochukwu Ikenga, he confirmed that there was an attack, but said he had yet to get the full details of what happened as of the time of filling this report. Ikenga, however, promised to update members of the public with the relevant information in due time.", "summary": "<p>A yet-to-be-confirmed number of persons were feared killed in the Nnewi community in Nnewi North Local Government Area as well as the Nnobi community in Idemili South LGA of Anambra State when gunmen invaded both communities on Monday.

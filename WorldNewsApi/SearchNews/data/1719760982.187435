{"id": 225041606, "title": "Biden Administration to Allow Cuba Private Sector Access to US Banking", "text": "The Biden administration announced regulatory changes on Tuesday that would allow Cuban private sector entrepreneurs to open bank accounts in the United States and remotely use them while in Cuba. The U.S. Treasury Department said that it has amended the Cuban Assets Control Regulations to promote internet freedom and boost private sector businesses in the Communist-ruled nation. \u201cWith this announcement, the administration is now fully implementing the May 2022 commitments to the Cuban people,\u201d a senior administration official told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cWe believe that the growth of an independent entrepreneurial private sector in Cuba is fully aligned with our values, is the best hope for generating economic development and employment in Cuba, and the growth of this sector is also consistent with the president\u2019s guidance to implement measures that will benefit the Cuban people while continuing to minimize resources to the Cuban government,\u201d the official added. The regulatory changes would allow Cuban entrepreneurs to use U.S.-based social media sites, video conferencing, e-gaming and e-learning platforms, web maps, and user authentication services. Cuban entrepreneurs are now able to open bank accounts in the United States and conduct authorized transactions, including through online payment sites, once they return to Cuba\u2014which they were unable to do previously. The department also authorized U.S. banks to process \u201cU-turn\u201d funds transfers, enabling them to move money for Cuban nationals, provided that neither the sender nor the recipient is subject to U.S. jurisdiction. The regulatory changes exclude Cuban government officials, such as the national assembly members, Cuban Communist Party members, Cuban military officers, or certain ministry and staff regime propagandists. \u201cFor a Cuban private sector business to qualify under this definition, its ownership cannot include such insiders,\u201d another senior U.S. administration official stated. \u201cI want to reiterate that our Cuba sanctions remain in place and the regulations continue to maintain restrictions on the Cuban government and its military, intelligence, and security services,\u201d the official added. Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar (R-Fla.), a Cuban American lawmaker from Miami, has voiced her criticism of the administration\u2019s move on the social media platform X. President Joe Biden has moved to reinstate the Cuba Family Reunification Parole Program, eliminate a $1,000 remittance cap, resume \u201ceducational travel\u201d to Cuba, and boost support for independent Cuban entrepreneurs.", "summary": "The United States has designated Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism.", "url": "https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/biden-administration-to-allow-cuba-private-sector-access-to-us-banking-5658697", "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/02/01/id5578814-US-flags-300x180.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:44:51", "author": "Aldgra Fredly", "authors": ["Aldgra Fredly"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.106}

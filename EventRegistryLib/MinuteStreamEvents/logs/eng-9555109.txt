He averaged 2.6 points and 2.3 rebounds in 31 appearances with 32 blocked shots.\n\nColbert, one of the first players to sign with new Wildcat coach Jerome Tang in 2022, scored a career-high 15 points with 17 rebounds in a March 2 game at Cincinnati. He also had 10 points and eight rebounds against North Alabama in December.\n\nThe 6-foot-3, 180-pound Jones was a four-star high school prospect out of Wasatch Academy in Utah last year and part of a highly touted 2023 Wildcat recruiting class along with guard Dai Dai Ames and forward Macaleab Rich.

His best 2023-24 performance came three games into the season when he scored 14 points with three assists in 19 minutes against South Dakota State.\n\nDuring his single season with the Wildcats, Jones was primarily a 3-point shooter, with 57 of his 68 field goal attempts and 17 of his 20 made baskets coming from beyond the arc.\n\nColbert and Jones were the third and fourth K-State transfers to find a new landing spot. Earlier, junior guard Cam Carter, the Wildcats' second-leading scorer with 14.6 points per game, signed with LSU, and backup guard Dorian Finister with Sam Houston State.\n\nMeanwhile, it was a rough recruiting week for Tang and his staff, which missed out on its top two portal targets. Rutgers center Clifford Omoruyi committed to Alabama and Arkansas guard Khalif Battle to Gonzaga, both after visiting Manhattan and listing the Wildcats as finalists.\n\nRelated: Kansas State basketball adds sharpshooting Villanova guard from transfer portal\n\nOn top of that, junior forward Arthur Kaluma cut ties with K-State by entering the portal after he already had declared for the NBA Draft with the option of returning. Kaluma was the team's third-leading scorer behind Tylor Perry, who graduated, and Carter, averaging 14.4 points and a team-best 7.0 rebounds.\n\nTang has signed four transfers along with a four-star high school recruit, but still has five scholarships to give to reach the 13-man roster limit. He said recently in a series of interviews that he had hoped to have most of his team in place by the first week of May.\n\nWith Kaluma's departure, three players remain from a 2023-24 Wildcat team that went 19-15 and lost to Iowa in the first round of the National Invitation Tournament. Forward David N'Guessan announced he is returning as a fifth-year super-senior after starting 21 games, averaging 7.8 points and 6.8 rebounds, but the other two are seldom-used freshmen forwards Rich and Taj Manning.\n\nThe newcomers so far for 2024-25 are former Michigan point guard Dug McDaniel, Chicago Illinois shooting guard CJ Jones, Villanova sharpshooter Brendan Hausen and Arkansas big man Baye Fall, along with high school guard David Castillo.\n\nRelated: Kansas State basketball is headed to the Big Apple in December for Big 12/Big East battle\n\nThe 5-11, 175-pound McDaniel averaged 16.3 points and 4.7 assists as a Michigan sophomore, and 6-5 wing Jones 11.4 points and 4.5 assists, also as a sophomore, at UIC. Hausen, at 6-4, 205 pounds, was a key reserve for Villanova in his sophomore season, contributing 6.2 points as a 38% 3-point shooter.\n\nAll three guards shot better than 36% from 3-point range, addressing a glaring need for the Wildcats.\n\nFall, a 6-11, 215-pounder from Senegal, appeared in nine games as a freshman at Arkansas, but comes with a big upside. He was a 2023 McDonald's All-American at Accelerated Schools in Denver.\n\nK-State's most immediate need is veteran help on the front line, where N'Guessan is the only experienced post player.\n\nArne Green is based in Salina and covers Kansas State University sports for the Gannett network.

He was at his best from 3-point range, where he made 17 shots as a reserve shooter. His best game occurred early on against South Dakota State when he scored a career-high 14 points and also sent out three assists. Later in the season, he delivered nine points in a road game against Kansas.\n\nHe will now look to build on those accomplishments and expand his role with the Horned Frogs.\n\nJones originally signed with K-State as a four-star recruit out of Denton, Texas. So this move will allow him to play closer to home.\n\nHe is the third outgoing K-State basketball transfer to find a new home. Cam Carter is transferring to LSU and Dorian Finister is heading to Sam Houston State.\n\nJerrell Colbert is still searching for a landing spot. So is Dai Dai Ames, though he recently took a recruiting visit to Virginia.\n\nOverall, it has been a busy off season for the Wildcats. Tang's team has lost 10 scholarship players from last year's squad, leaving K-State with David N'Guessan, Macaleab Rich and Taj Manning as returning players.\n\nTang has added four incoming transfers (Villanova guard Brendan Hausen, Michigan guard Dug McDaniel, Illinois-Chicago guard CJ Jones and Arkansas big man Baye Fall) to complement high school recruit David Castillo.\n\nThe Wildcats have

In his two seasons at Tampa, he averaged 22.1 points, 4.3 rebounds, 2.7 assists, and 1.3 steals and was named the Sunshine State Conference Freshman of the year.\n\nAfter establishing himself as a viable Division 1 prospect, Jones entered the transfer portal and ended up on the other side of the country, signing with Big West member Cal State Fullerton.\n\nJones made an instant impact at Fullerton, starting 32 games for the Titans and averaging 12.5 points, 2.2 assists, and 4 rebounds while being named Honorable Mention All-Big West. His 3-point shooting was particularly impressive, hitting 34/86 attempts (39%). He was also tied for the team lead in fouls drawn per 40 minutes and hit 106-135 attempts at the line (79%).\n\nLast season, Jones was the primary scorer for the Titans. He was \"used\" on 32.2% of Fullerton's attempts while on the court, good for 14th in the nation, and took 30.2% of their shots (second behind DJ Brewton). He continued to attack the rim, upping his fouls drawn per 40 minutes to a robust 6.6 (28th in the nation) while still cashing in from deep at a 39% clip. Not one to neglect his duties on the defensive end, he also led the Big West in steal percentage (3.7%). He averaged 22.2 points, 2.8 assists, and 4.4 rebounds, showcasing his well-rounded game.\n\nWhat Does He Bring to Kansas State?\n\nJones is a physical wing with a nice outside stroke. He's tough to defend in the half court when a defense is put in rotation because he abuses closeouts with pump fakes and drives to the rim, and he won't hesitate to let one fly from deep if the closeout is late. In transition he's a threat to both attack the rim or spot up outside the arc.\n\nHis ability to both shoot and drive makes a defender play him straight up. If a defender crowds him, he puts the ball on the court, drives, and draws contact. If a defender plays off, expecting a drive, he has a quick trigger and the height to get off shots without a ton of space.\n\nIf his game translates to this level of basketball, and I have no reason to believe it won't, his well-rounded offensive game paired with his aggressive defensive game should fit in nicely in Manhattan.\n\nPossible Stumbling Blocks?\n\nI keep writing pieces about how a \"player fits\" at K-State, but that's pretty tough when the cast of characters keeps changing. If everything remains in stasis, Jones should slot in on one of the wings either as a starter or key reserve, depending on how things shake out. He's an experienced hand and has played against top-level competition before, but it may take him a little while to adjust to not always having the ball like he did at Fullerton.\n\nThis is his second step up in class over his college career. Jones has played a ton of basketball and has something to prove at the high-major level. He's spent his career as a big fish in a small pond; how he adjusts to sharing the court with other big fish could tell the story. Coach Tang needs him as a part of the offense, not the entire offense.\n\nOverall\n\nThis is a nice under-the-radar get for Kansas State, and honestly, these are the types of transfers I like. Jones proved himself on a lower level over the last four seasons and now gets an opportunity to step up and see what he can do in one of (if not the) best conferences in the nation.\n\nHe joins

In his two seasons at Tampa, he averaged 22.1 points, 4.3 rebounds, 2.7 assists, and 1.3 steals and was named the Sunshine State Conference Freshman of the year.\n\nAfter establishing himself as a viable Division 1 prospect, Jones entered the transfer portal and ended up on the other side of the country, signing with Big West member Cal State Fullerton.\n\nJones made an instant impact at Fullerton, starting 32 games for the Titans and averaging 12.5 points, 2.2 assists, and 4 rebounds while being named Honorable Mention All-Big West. His 3-point shooting was particularly impressive, hitting 34/86 attempts (39%). He was also tied for the team lead in fouls drawn per 40 minutes and hit 106-135 attempts at the line (79%).\n\nLast season, Jones was the primary scorer for the Titans. He was \"used\" on 32.2% of Fullerton's attempts while on the court, good for 14th in the nation, and took 30.2% of their shots (second behind DJ Brewton). He continued to attack the rim, upping his fouls drawn per 40 minutes to a robust 6.6 (28th in the nation) while still cashing in from deep at a 39% clip. Not one to neglect his duties on the defensive end, he also led the Big West in steal percentage (3.7%). He averaged 22.2 points, 2.8 assists, and 4.4 rebounds, showcasing his well-rounded game.\n\nWhat Does He Bring to Kansas State?\n\nJones is a physical wing with a nice outside stroke. He's tough to defend in the half court when a defense is put in rotation because he abuses closeouts with pump fakes and drives to the rim, and he won't hesitate to let one fly from deep if the closeout is late. In transition he's a threat to both attack the rim or spot up outside the arc.\n\nHis ability to both shoot and drive makes a defender play him straight up. If a defender crowds him, he puts the ball on the court, drives, and draws contact. If a defender plays off, expecting a drive, he has a quick trigger and the height to get off shots without a ton of space.\n\nIf his game translates to this level of basketball, and I have no reason to believe it won't, his well-rounded offensive game paired with his aggressive defensive game should fit in nicely in Manhattan.\n\nPossible Stumbling Blocks?\n\nI keep writing pieces about how a \"player fits\" at K-State, but that's pretty tough when the cast of characters keeps changing. If everything remains in stasis, Jones should slot in on one of the wings either as a starter or key reserve, depending on how things shake out. He's an experienced hand and has played against top-level competition before, but it may take him a little while to adjust to not always having the ball like he did at Fullerton.\n\nThis is his second step up in class over his college career. Jones has played a ton of basketball and has something to prove at the high-major level. He's spent his career as a big fish in a small pond; how he adjusts to sharing the court with other big fish could tell the story.

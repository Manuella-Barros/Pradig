(NASDAQ: CORZ) (\"Core Scientific\" or the \"Company\"), one of the largest owners and operators of high-powered digital infrastructure for bitcoin mining and hosting services in North America, today announced the signing of a series of 12-year contracts with CoreWeave, the AI Hyperscaler.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreements, Core Scientific will deliver approximately 200 megawatts (\"MW\") of infrastructure to host CoreWeave's high-performance compute (\"HPC\") operations. Core Scientific will modify multiple existing, owned sites to host CoreWeave's NVIDIA GPUs. The site modifications are expected to commence early in the second half of 2024 and achieve operational status in the first half of 2025.\n\n\"Our new contracts with CoreWeave position us to transform our hosting business and our earnings power by capturing exciting growth opportunities in AI compute, one of today's most dynamic technology segments, while also maintaining our strong bitcoin mining franchise,\" said Adam Sullivan, Core Scientific's Chief Executive Officer. \"As demand for ready, high-power sites continues to outpace supply, we believe Core Scientific is well positioned to meet customer needs with a much shorter time to power than greenfield data center projects. Our expanding relationship with CoreWeave creates a pathway for Core Scientific to diversify our business model and balance our portfolio between bitcoin mining and alternative compute hosting, positioning us to maximize cash flow and minimize risk while maintaining our significant exposure to bitcoin's upside potential.\"\n\n\"The agreements announced today also provide CoreWeave with options over the next 60 to 90 days to further expand its hosting footprint with Core Scientific at additional select sites, and we are continuing discussions with other potential clients regarding additional HPC hosting contracts to capitalize on our significant pipeline of powered real estate. We are capitalizing on one of the largest high-power digital infrastructure portfolios that we will continually seek to expand to deliver significant, resilient and sustainable value for our shareholders,\" Mr. Sullivan added.\n\nPer the agreements, all capital investments required to modify Core Scientific's existing infrastructure into cutting-edge, application-specific data centers customized for dense HPC will be funded by CoreWeave. An estimated $300 million of the capital investments associated with Core Scientific-owned infrastructure will be credited against hosting payments at no more than 50% of monthly fees until fully repaid. The agreements with CoreWeave provide opportunities for two renewal terms of five years each. The agreements also provide optionality for further expansion with meaningful additional megawatts at other Core Scientific sites, potentially ranking Core Scientific as one of the largest data center operators in the United States.\n\nCore Scientific's agreements with CoreWeave complement its current business model with the addition of an expected stable, recurring, long-term and high margin revenue stream. Moving forward, the new HPC hosting contracts will increase Core Scientific's exposure to contracted, dollar-denominated revenue. Once the approximately 200 MW of HPC infrastructure is operational, the project is estimated to generate total cumulative revenue for Core Scientific of over $3.5 billion during the initial 12-year terms of the contracts. Estimated average annual revenue from the contracts is expected to be approximately $290 million. From revenue to gross margin, this is expected to enhance earnings power and drive shareholder value.\n\nFrom 2019 to 2022, Core Scientific hosted thousands of CoreWeave's GPUs in its data centers. In March of 2024, Core Scientific and CoreWeave entered a contract for HPC hosting at Core Scientific's new Austin data center, with Core Scientific delivering 16 MW of capacity more than 30 days ahead of schedule.\n\nWith its total of 1.2 gigawatts of contracted power, Core Scientific is able to deliver nearly 500 MW of HPC power to be used for alternative compute workloads based on geographic proximity to major cities and fiber lines.\n\nIn connection with this expansion of Core Scientific's HPC hosting strategy, Core Scientific intends to redeploy certain of its bitcoin mining capacity from designated HPC sites to other of its dedicated bitcoin mining sites to support business continuity and growth.\n\nAdvisors\n\nMoelis & Company LLC is acting as financial advisor to Core Scientific. Sidley Austin LLP is acting as legal advisor to Core Scientific.\n\nAbout Core Scientific\n\nCore Scientific is one of the largest owners and operators of high-powered digital infrastructure for bitcoin mining and hosting services in North America. Transforming energy into high value compute with superior efficiency at scale, we employ our own large fleet of computers (\"miners\") to earn bitcoin for our own account and provide hosting services for large bitcoin mining and high-performance computing customers at our eight operational data centers in Georgia (2), Kentucky (1), North Carolina (1), North Dakota (1) and Texas (3). We derive the majority of our revenue from earning bitcoin for our own account (\"self-mining\").

(NASDAQ: CORZ) (\"Core Scientific\" or the \"Company\"), one of the largest owners and operators of high-powered digital infrastructure for bitcoin mining and hosting services in North America, today announced the signing of a series of 12-year contracts with CoreWeave, the AI Hyperscaler.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreements, Core Scientific will deliver approximately 200 megawatts (\"MW\") of infrastructure to host CoreWeave's high-performance compute (\"HPC\") operations. Core Scientific will modify multiple existing, owned sites to host CoreWeave's NVIDIA GPUs. The site modifications are expected to commence early in the second half of 2024 and achieve operational status in the first half of 2025.\n\n\"Our new contracts with CoreWeave position us to transform our hosting business and our earnings power by capturing exciting growth opportunities in AI compute, one of today's most dynamic technology segments, while also maintaining our strong bitcoin mining franchise,\" said Adam Sullivan, Core Scientific's Chief Executive Officer. \"As demand for ready, high-power sites continues to outpace supply, we believe Core Scientific is well positioned to meet customer needs with a much shorter time to power than greenfield data center projects. Our expanding relationship with CoreWeave creates a pathway for Core Scientific to diversify our business model and balance our portfolio between bitcoin mining and alternative compute hosting, positioning us to maximize cash flow and minimize risk while maintaining our significant exposure to bitcoin's upside potential.\"\n\n\"The agreements announced today also provide CoreWeave with options over the next 60 to 90 days to further expand its hosting footprint with Core Scientific at additional select sites, and we are continuing discussions with other potential clients regarding additional HPC hosting contracts to capitalize on our significant pipeline of powered real estate. We are capitalizing on one of the largest high-power digital infrastructure portfolios that we will continually seek to expand to deliver significant, resilient and sustainable value for our shareholders,\" Mr. Sullivan added.\n\nPer the agreements, all capital investments required to modify Core Scientific's existing infrastructure into cutting-edge, application-specific data centers customized for dense HPC will be funded by CoreWeave. An estimated $300 million of the capital investments associated with Core Scientific-owned infrastructure will be credited against hosting payments at no more than 50% of monthly fees until fully repaid. The agreements with CoreWeave provide opportunities for two renewal terms of five years each. The agreements also provide optionality for further expansion with meaningful additional megawatts at other Core Scientific sites, potentially ranking Core Scientific as one of the largest data center operators in the United States.\n\nCore Scientific's agreements with CoreWeave complement its current business model with the addition of an expected stable, recurring, long-term and high margin revenue stream. Moving forward, the new HPC hosting contracts will increase Core Scientific's exposure to contracted, dollar-denominated revenue. Once the approximately 200 MW of HPC infrastructure is operational, the project is estimated to generate total cumulative revenue for Core Scientific of over $3.5 billion during the initial 12-year terms of the contracts. 1 Estimated average annual revenue from the contracts is expected to be approximately $290 million. From revenue to gross margin, this is expected to enhance earnings power and drive shareholder value.\n\nFrom 2019 to 2022, Core Scientific hosted thousands of CoreWeave's GPUs in its data centers. In March of 2024, Core Scientific and CoreWeave entered a contract for HPC hosting at Core Scientific's new Austin data center, with Core Scientific delivering 16 MW of capacity more than 30 days ahead of schedule.\n\nWith its total of 1.2 gigawatts of contracted power, Core Scientific is able to deliver nearly 500 MW of HPC power to be used for alternative compute workloads based on geographic proximity to major cities and fiber lines. 2\n\nIn connection with this expansion of Core Scientific's HPC hosting strategy, Core Scientific intends to redeploy certain of its bitcoin mining capacity from designated HPC sites to other of its dedicated bitcoin mining sites to support business continuity and growth.\n\nAdvisors\n\nMoelis & Company LLC is acting as financial advisor to Core Scientific. Sidley Austin LLP is acting as legal advisor to Core Scientific.\n\nAbout Core Scientific\n\nCore Scientific is one of the largest owners and operators of high-powered digital infrastructure for bitcoin mining and hosting services in North America. Transforming energy into high value compute with superior efficiency at scale, we employ our own large fleet of computers (\"miners\") to earn bitcoin for our own account and provide hosting services for large bitcoin mining and high-performance computing customers at our eight operational data centers in Georgia (2), Kentucky (1), North Carolina (1), North Dakota (1) and Texas (3). We derive the majority of our revenue from earning bitcoin for our own account (\"self-mining\").

The agreements with CoreWeave provide opportunities for two renewal terms of five years each. The agreements also provide optionality for further expansion with meaningful additional megawatts at other Core Scientific sites, potentially ranking Core Scientific as one of the largest data center operators in the United States.\n\nCore Scientific's agreements with CoreWeave complement its current business model with the addition of an expected stable, recurring, long-term and high margin revenue stream. Moving forward, the new HPC hosting contracts will increase Core Scientific's exposure to contracted, dollar-denominated revenue. Once the approximately 200 MW of HPC infrastructure is operational, the project is estimated to generate total cumulative revenue for Core Scientific of over $3.5 billion during the initial 12-year terms of the contracts. Estimated average annual revenue from the contracts is expected to be approximately $290 million. From revenue to gross margin, this is expected to enhance earnings power and drive shareholder value.\n\nFrom 2019 to 2022, Core Scientific hosted thousands of CoreWeave's GPUs in its data centers. In March of 2024, Core Scientific and CoreWeave entered a contract for HPC hosting at Core Scientific's new Austin data center, with Core Scientific delivering 16 MW of capacity more than 30 days ahead of schedule.\n\nWith its total of 1.2 gigawatts of contracted power, Core Scientific is able to deliver nearly 500 MW of HPC power to be used for alternative compute workloads based on geographic proximity to major cities and fiber lines.\n\nIn connection with this expansion of Core Scientific's HPC hosting strategy, Core Scientific intends to redeploy certain of its bitcoin mining capacity from designated HPC sites to other of its dedicated bitcoin mining sites to support business continuity and growth.\n\nAdvisors\n\nMoelis & Company LLC is acting as financial advisor to Core Scientific. Sidley Austin LLP is acting as legal advisor to Core Scientific.\n\nAbout Core Scientific\n\nCore Scientific is one of the largest owners and operators of high-powered digital infrastructure for bitcoin mining and hosting services in North America.

He highlighted that Core Scientific's ability to deliver power more quickly than greenfield data center projects positions the company to meet customer needs effectively. The partnership with CoreWeave allows Core Scientific to balance its portfolio between Bitcoin mining and alternative compute hosting, thereby maximizing cash flow and minimizing risk while maintaining significant exposure to Bitcoin's potential upside.\n\nThe agreement also includes options for CoreWeave to expand its hosting footprint with Core Scientific at additional sites over the next 60 to 90 days.

The partnership is expected to enhance Core Scientific's earnings power and drive shareholder value by increasing exposure to contracted, dollar-denominated revenue streams.\n\nThe announcement comes nearly five months after Core Scientific received court approval to exit bankruptcy, a move necessitated by financial challenges stemming from the decline in crypto prices and rising energy costs. Under Sullivan's leadership, the company has restructured its debt and pivoted towards more sustainable business avenues, including this strategic shift into AI and HPC hosting.\n\nPer Core Scientific, this diversification aligns with broader industry trends, as other crypto miners like Bit Digital, Iris Energy, and Hut 8 also explore AI infrastructure to boost profitability. The increasing demand for AI operations, driven by advancements such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, emphasizes the potential for higher returns compared to traditional Bitcoin mining alone.\n\nAs Core Scientific continues to expand its HPC hosting capabilities, it aims to deliver significant, resilient, and sustainable value for its shareholders, leveraging its extensive infrastructure and strategic partnerships to navigate the evolving digital landscape.", "source": {"uri": "cryptorank.io", "dataType": "news", "title": "CryptoRank"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "High-performance computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supercomputer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Investment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Mining", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Mining", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Employment/Staffing_Services", "label": "dmoz/Science/Employment/Staffing Services", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Methods_and_Techniques/Scientific_Method", "label": "dmoz/Science/Methods and Techniques/Scientific Method", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Organizations/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Science/Organizations/Associations", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/core-scientific.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622202", "eventUri": "eng-9622202", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 230, "relevance": 1}

Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.\n\nCore Scientific has entered into a significant 12-year agreement with CoreWeave, an AI hyperscaler backed by Nvidia, to provide approximately 200 megawatts (MW) of infrastructure for high-performance computing (HPC) services. This strategic move is expected to generate over $3.5 billion in total cumulative revenue for Core Scientific during the initial contract term, with an estimated average annual revenue of around $290 million.\n\nThe agreement marks a pivotal shift for Core Scientific, traditionally known for its bitcoin mining operations, as it diversifies into the rapidly growing AI data center space. Core Scientific will modify multiple existing sites to host CoreWeave's NVIDIA GPUs, with site modifications commencing in the second half of 2024 and operations expected to begin in the first half of 2025. CoreWeave will fund all capital investments required for these modifications, estimated at $300 million, which will be credited against hosting payments until fully repaid.\n\nAdam Sullivan, CEO of Core Scientific, emphasized the strategic benefits of this partnership, noting that the demand for high-power sites continues to outpace supply. He highlighted that Core Scientific's ability to deliver power more quickly than greenfield data center projects positions the company to meet customer needs effectively. The partnership with CoreWeave allows Core Scientific to balance its portfolio between Bitcoin mining and alternative compute hosting, thereby maximizing cash flow and minimizing risk while maintaining significant exposure to Bitcoin's potential upside.\n\nThe agreement also includes options for CoreWeave to expand its hosting footprint with Core Scientific at additional sites over the next 60 to 90 days. This expansion is part of Core Scientific's broader strategy to capitalize on its extensive high-power digital infrastructure portfolio, which includes 1.2 gigawatts of contracted power, with nearly 500 MW allocated for HPC workloads.\n\nThis deal builds on a history of successful collaboration between Core Scientific and CoreWeave, dating back to 2019. Earlier this year, Core Scientific delivered 16 MW of HPC hosting capacity to CoreWeave ahead of schedule at its new Austin data center. The partnership is expected to enhance Core Scientific's earnings power and drive shareholder value by increasing exposure to contracted, dollar-denominated revenue streams.\n\nThe announcement comes nearly five months after Core Scientific received court approval to exit bankruptcy, a move necessitated by financial challenges stemming from the decline in crypto prices and rising energy costs. Under Sullivan's leadership, the company has restructured its debt and pivoted towards more sustainable business avenues, including this strategic shift into AI and HPC hosting.\n\nPer Core Scientific, this diversification aligns with broader industry trends, as other crypto miners like Bit Digital, Iris Energy, and Hut 8 also explore AI infrastructure to boost profitability. The increasing demand for AI operations, driven by advancements such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, emphasizes the potential for higher returns compared to traditional Bitcoin mining alone.\n\nAs Core Scientific continues to expand its HPC hosting capabilities, it aims to deliver significant, resilient, and sustainable value for its shareholders, leveraging its extensive infrastructure and strategic partnerships to navigate the evolving digital landscape.", "source": {"uri": "cryptoslate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CryptoSlate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "liam_akiba_wright@cryptoslate.com", "name": "Liam Akiba Wright", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "High-performance computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supercomputer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Investment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Mining", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Mining", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Employment/Staffing_Services", "label": "dmoz/Science/Employment/Staffing Services", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Methods_and_Techniques/Scientific_Method", "label": "dmoz/Science/Methods and Techniques/Scientific Method", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Organizations/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Science/Organizations/Associations", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/core-scientific.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622202", "eventUri": "eng-9622202", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 226, "relevance": 1}

This shift comes amid challenges associated with the latest Bitcoin halving.\n\nOn June 3, Core Scientific announced a landmark $3.5 billion deal with AI cloud provider CoreWeave. The agreement involves Core Scientific supplying an additional 200 megawatts (MW) of infrastructure to support CoreWeave's high-performance computing (HPC) operations. This partnership is projected to generate over $3.5 billion in revenue over a 12-year period, with an estimated annual revenue of approximately $290 million.\n\nThe infrastructure dedicated to CoreWeave represents about 18% of Core Scientific's total operational capacity. As of April 2024, Core Scientific boasted 745 MW of operational infrastructure, with an additional 372 MW of partially constructed infrastructure at two Texas data centers. This contract with CoreWeave builds on a previous agreement from March 2024, where Core Scientific provided up to 16 MW for AI and HPC operations.\n\nCoreWeave, originally known as Atlantic Crypto, was founded in 2017 by Michael Intrator, Brian Venturo, and Brannin McBee. Despite having no prior experience in the cloud sector, the founders leveraged their backgrounds in trading energy futures to build a robust AI and cloud computing business. In May 2024, CoreWeave secured a $7.5 billion debt facility from investors including Blackstone, Magnetar, and Coatue, valuing the company at $19 billion.\n\nThe partnership comes at a critical time for Core Scientific, which is navigating the effects of the fourth Bitcoin halving. The halving event on April 20, 2024, reduced miner rewards from 6.25 BTC per block to 3.125 BTC, applying financial pressure on mining operations. With Bitcoin prices not spiking significantly post-halving, firms like Core Scientific are exploring alternative revenue streams to sustain operations.\n\nAdam Sullivan, CEO of Core Scientific, highlighted the strategic benefits of the partnership, stating, \"Our expanding relationship with CoreWeave creates a pathway for Core Scientific to diversify our business model and balance our portfolio between Bitcoin mining and alternative compute hosting. This positions us to maximize cash flow and minimize risk while maintaining our significant exposure to Bitcoin's upside potential.\"\n\nThis announcement follows Core Scientific's emergence from bankruptcy in January 2024, which concluded a 13-month restructuring process.

Later in December, it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, citing insufficiency in meeting debt repayments on leased equipment.", "source": {"uri": "cryptobriefing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Crypto Briefing"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vivian_nguyen@cryptobriefing.com", "name": "Vivian Nguyen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "High-performance computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blockchain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_asset", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Digital asset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Business model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_11,_Title_11,_United_States_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Mining", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Mining", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling/Tools_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling/Tools and Equipment", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Employment/Staffing_Services", "label": "dmoz/Science/Employment/Staffing Services", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Methods_and_Techniques/Scientific_Method", "label": "dmoz/Science/Methods and Techniques/Scientific Method", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://static.cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/04061405/img-LGTjkCCLxqCigie1nOROD18B-800x457.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622202", "eventUri": "eng-9622202", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.\n\nCore Scientific (CORZ) has rejected an \"unsolicited\" $1 billion buyout offer from CoreWeave, deeming it significantly undervalued and not in the best interests of its shareholders. The proposal, which offered $5.75 per share, came shortly after the two companies signed a series of 12-year contracts for Core Scientific to provide 200 megawatts of infrastructure to support CoreWeave's high-performance computing (HPC) AI services.\n\nPer Core Scientific, the board, in consultation with independent financial and legal advisors, concluded that the proposal did not reflect the company's growth prospects and long-term value-creation potential. It also made a point to clarify the offer was \"unsolicited\" by using the term in the title of its press release.\n\nCore Scientific intends to work on executing the previously announced contracts with CoreWeave, which are expected to generate over $3.5 billion in cumulative revenue. The agreements marked a strategic shift for Core Scientific, traditionally known for its bitcoin mining operations, as it diversifies into the AI data center space.\n\nCORZ shares were trading at around $4.84 before the partnership announcement and subsequently rose to around $7.15. The CoreWeave offer at $5.75 per share is well above Core Scientific's share price before the partnership announcement but lower than current prices, indicating the board believes its share price is not overinflated due to its new deal.\n\nCoreWeave will fund all capital investments required for the infrastructure modifications, estimated at $300 million, which will be credited against hosting payments until fully repaid. This partnership is anticipated to generate an average annual revenue of approximately $290 million, enhancing Core Scientific's earnings power and driving shareholder value.\n\nThe company's decision to reject the buyout offer emphasizes its confidence in its Bitcoin mining and the strategic benefits of the CoreWeave partnership alone. CEO Adam Sullivan highlighted that the demand for high-power sites continues to outpace supply, positioning Core Scientific to meet customer needs more effectively than greenfield data center projects. The partnership allows Core Scientific to balance its portfolio between Bitcoin mining and alternative compute hosting, maximizing cash flow and minimizing risk while maintaining significant exposure to Bitcoin's potential upside.\n\nCore Scientific's shift towards AI infrastructure coincides with the recent Bitcoin halving event, which reduced miner rewards and pressured mining firms to find alternative revenue sources. The company's financial recovery, following a 13-month bankruptcy restructuring process, has been bolstered by a substantial increase in Bitcoin prices and hash rates. Core Scientific's shares, which resumed trading on the Nasdaq in January, have seen significant gains, reflecting investor confidence in the company's strategic direction.\n\nThe partnership with CoreWeave builds on a history of successful collaboration between the two firms, dating back to 2019. Earlier this year, Core Scientific delivered 16 MW of HPC hosting capacity to CoreWeave ahead of schedule at its new Austin data center. The ongoing collaboration illustrates the strategic importance of AI and cloud computing in Core Scientific's future plans.", "source": {"uri": "cryptoslate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CryptoSlate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "liam_akiba_wright@cryptoslate.com", "name": "Liam Akiba Wright", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "High-performance computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Investment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hash function"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_flow", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cash flow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Mining", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Mining", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Employment/Staffing_Services", "label": "dmoz/Science/Employment/Staffing Services", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Methods_and_Techniques/Scientific_Method", "label": "dmoz/Science/Methods and Techniques/Scientific Method", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling/Consulting", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 52}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/core-scientific-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622202", "eventUri": "eng-9622202", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

(NASDAQ: CORZ) (\"Core Scientific\" or the \"Company\"), one of the largest owners and operators of high-powered digital infrastructure for bitcoin mining and hosting services in North America, today confirmed that it received an unsolicited non-binding proposal from CoreWeave on June 3, 2024 to acquire all of the outstanding shares of the Company on a fully diluted basis for $5.75 per share in cash. This unsolicited proposal immediately followed Core Scientific and CoreWeave entering into a series of 12-year contracts for Core Scientific to provide approximately 200 MW of infrastructure to host CoreWeave's high-performance compute (\"HPC\") services.\n\nThe Company's Board of Directors (the \"Board\"), in consultation with its independent financial and legal advisors, carefully reviewed the proposal. The Board has evaluated the Company's growth prospects and near- and long-term value creation potential, including in connection with both the previously announced CoreWeave agreements and the proposal. The Board determined that the CoreWeave proposal significantly undervalues the Company and is not in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.\n\nCore Scientific continues to focus on capitalizing on its valuable portfolio of high-power digital infrastructure to expand its HPC hosting business, including through the execution of the recently announced contracted projects with CoreWeave. With greater than 300 MW of additional HPC capacity available, the Company is pursuing potential future transactions with CoreWeave or other HPC customers, while maintaining its strong bitcoin mining franchise. The Company believes that the predictable, recurring revenue from HPC hosting will balance the variability of its bitcoin mining business, while also producing steady cash flows that will strengthen Core Scientific's earnings power and provide greater financial strength and optionality.\n\nCore Scientific shareholders do not need to take any action at this time.\n\nMoelis & Company LLC is acting as financial advisor to Core Scientific.

Shares of Core Scientific climbed above the offering price in early trading on Tuesday, jumping as much as 37% to $6.70.\n\nThe companies announced late Monday they signed a series of 12-year contracts under which Core Scientific will deliver about 200 megawatts of infrastructure to host CoreWeave's operations. Core Scientific is among the Bitcoin miners trying to take advantage of a shortage in data center space and large amounts of power amid the AI boom to expand beyond crypto.\n\nCoreWeave's offer represents a 55% premium to Core Scientific's three-month volume-weighted average price as of May 31, the person said, asking not to be identified discussing confidential information.\n\nCore Scientific closed at $4.87 in New York on Monday, giving the company a market value of about $866 million.\n\nRepresentatives for CoreWeave and Core Scientific declined to comment.\n\nThe hosting agreement is one of the largest for a crypto miner. The contracts with CoreWeave are estimated to generate $3.5 billion in revenue, making the crypto miner a sizable infrastructure provider even among traditional data centers. Core Scientific has already provided such services to CoreWeave, which was also a crypto mining company, since 2019.\n\nCore Scientific is among the top mining companies by computing power. With its total of 1.2 gigawatts of contracted power, the miner is able to deliver nearly 500 megawatts of HPC power to be used for alternative compute workloads based on geographic proximity to major cities and fiber lines, according to its statement on Tuesday. That would put the company among the largest data center operators in the US.\n\nCoreWeave last month raised $8.6 billion in funding that included a $1.1 billion preferred equity deal that gave the startup a $19.1 billion valuation. It separately raised $7.5 billion in debt.

This significant proposal has resulted in Core Scientific's (CORZ) shares surging by up to 40% in pre-market trading. The deal is part of a larger 200-megawatt (MW) artificial intelligence (AI) collaboration between the two companies.\n\nThe offer from CoreWeave represents a 55% premium to Core Scientific's three-month average weighted share price as of May 31. This valuation places the Austin, Texas-based miner at just over $1 billion, based on its 178 million shares outstanding. This development marks a notable turnaround for Core Scientific, which emerged from bankruptcy earlier this year after enduring the challenges of a severe crypto winter.\n\nCoreWeave's all-cash offer underscores its commitment to expanding its footprint in the cryptocurrency and AI sectors. The cloud computing company has also entered into a 12-year agreement with Core Scientific to host AI-related services. This partnership involves approximately $300 million in capital investments, with options to further increase capacity. This strategic move not only benefits CoreWeave but also positions Core Scientific to leverage cutting-edge AI technologies in its mining operations.\n\nThe agreement between CoreWeave and Core Scientific is part of a broader trend of mergers and acquisitions within the bitcoin mining industry. Recently, Riot Platforms (RIOT) made a hostile bid to acquire its peer Bitfarms (BITF). Such moves indicate a consolidation phase in the sector, driven by the need for scale, efficiency, and competitive advantage in mining operations. As the industry matures, strategic partnerships and acquisitions are becoming essential for companies to remain competitive.\n\nIn May, CoreWeave raised $1.1 billion in new funding from investors, including Coatue Management and Magnetar Capital. This substantial financial backing underscores the company's robust position and its strategic intent to seize opportunities in the AI and cryptocurrency domains. The influx of capital provides CoreWeave with the resources needed to pursue aggressive growth strategies and make significant investments in promising ventures like Core Scientific.\n\nThe proposed acquisition and partnership with CoreWeave could significantly bolster Core Scientific's operational capabilities and market position. By integrating AI services, Core Scientific can enhance its mining efficiency, explore new revenue streams, and potentially lead innovations in the mining sector. The capital infusion from CoreWeave will also provide the necessary resources for technological upgrades and expansion, allowing Core Scientific to capitalize on emerging opportunities in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe collaboration with CoreWeave brings several strategic benefits. Firstly, the partnership allows access to advanced AI technologies, which can optimize mining operations, reduce costs, and increase profitability. Secondly, the financial support from CoreWeave ensures the necessary capital to invest in state-of-the-art mining equipment and infrastructure. This will enable the company to scale its operations and enhance its competitive edge in the market.\n\nThe acquisition of Core Scientific by CoreWeave is likely to have broader implications for the cryptocurrency mining industry. As more companies recognize the value of integrating AI technologies into their operations, similar partnerships and acquisitions may become more common. This trend could lead to increased efficiency, reduced energy consumption, and greater overall profitability for the industry. Furthermore, the consolidation of mining companies could result in a more stable and resilient market, capable of weathering future fluctuations in cryptocurrency prices.\n\nThe offer by CoreWeave to acquire Core Scientific represents a pivotal moment for both companies. For Core Scientific, it offers a pathway to recovery and growth post-bankruptcy. For CoreWeave, it is an opportunity to strengthen its presence in the bitcoin mining and AI sectors. As mergers and acquisitions continue to shape the landscape of the cryptocurrency industry, this deal could set a precedent for future transactions. The partnership promises to drive innovation, enhance efficiency, and create new opportunities for both companies, positioning them at the forefront of the evolving cryptocurrency market.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information provided in this article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.

The offer, valued at $5.75 per share, was made public earlier this week but needed to be deemed insufficient by Core Scientific's board.\n\nSubsequently, the firm recently issued a statement claiming that the proposal \"substantially undervalues the company and is not in the best interest of the company and its shareholders.\"\n\nThe rejection comes after the two companies signed a deal to improve CoreWeave's high-performance computing capabilities that are estimated to produce around $3. 5 billion in revenue.\n\nHowever, the partnership between Core Scientific and CoreWeave is still there with recently signed 12-year contracts. Based on these agreements, Core Scientific is expected to offer around 200 megawatts of capacity to CoreWeave thus increasing the company's capacity in AI applications. After the announcement of these deals, the stock of Core Scientific jumped 40% earlier this week which is an indication of the market's confidence in the strategic partnership.\n\nThis financial strategy is made at a time when the AI and cryptocurrency industries are rapidly developing and changing. Moreover, as reported by Coingape, yesterday, Nvidia, as a result of its AI technology managed to surpass Apple to become the second most valued public company in the US. Core Scientific has a major advantage in terms of infrastructure for high-performance computing, and that speaks a lot about the potential of the company which is not limited to the mining of cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe refusal of the company to accept the takeover bid could be as a result of the company preparing to position itself about the value and operations in the competitive market. Concurrently, Core Scientific's stock remained stable at around $7.74 in pre-market trading despite the takeover offer, a 7.55% surge in the last day.\n\nRead Also: Pro-Bitcoin El Salvador President Foresees Donald Trump's Victory In US 2024 Elections", "source": {"uri": "coingape.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Coingape"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kelvin_munene_murithi@coingape.com", "name": "Kelvin Munene Murithi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Venture capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "High-performance computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeover", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Takeover"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Competition (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Salvador", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "El Salvador"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "El Salvador"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling/Mineral_Exploration_and_Extraction", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling/Mineral Exploration and Extraction", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Information_Technology/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Information Technology/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Employment/Staffing_Services", "label": "dmoz/Science/Employment/Staffing Services", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Methods_and_Techniques/Scientific_Method", "label": "dmoz/Science/Methods and Techniques/Scientific Method", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Bitcoin-mining-6-e1653307843986-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622202", "eventUri": "eng-9622202", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

CoreWeave was valued at $19 billion in a funding round last month. Core SciWntific will deliver about 200 megawatts of infrastructure to CoreWeave's operations.\n\nCore Scientific, which emerged from bankruptcy in January, has been mining a mix of digital assets since 2017. The company began to diversify into other services in 2019.\n\n\"The best way to think about bitcoin mining facilities is that we are essentially power shells to the data center industry,\" Core Scientific CEO Adam Sullivan told CNBC.\n\nSullivan jumped into the role of CEO while the company was still in the throes of bankruptcy, which resulted from the collapse of bitcoin in 2022. Since then, the former investment banker has settled debts with angry lenders and further beefed up the company's non-bitcoin business as it reentered the public market.", "source": {"uri": "cnbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNBC"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mackenzie_sigalos@cnbc.com", "name": "MacKenzie Sigalos", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_asset", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Digital asset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Mining", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Mining", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling/Mineral_Exploration_and_Extraction", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling/Mineral Exploration and Extraction", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling/Associations", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling/Consulting", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107138478-1666310703122-V100_00_10_22Still007.jpg?v=1698347814&w=1920&h=1080", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622202", "eventUri": "eng-9622202", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

(NASDAQ: CORZ) (\"Core Scientific\" or the \"Company\"), one of the largest owners and operators of high-powered digital infrastructure for bitcoin mining and hosting services in North America, today confirmed that it received an unsolicited non-binding proposal from CoreWeave on June 3, 2024 to acquire all of the outstanding shares of the Company on a fully diluted basis for $5.75 per share in cash. This unsolicited proposal immediately followed Core Scientific and CoreWeave entering into a series of 12-year contracts for Core Scientific to provide approximately 200 MW of infrastructure to host CoreWeave's high-performance compute (\"HPC\") services.\n\nThe Company's Board of Directors (the \"Board\"), in consultation with its independent financial and legal advisors, carefully reviewed the proposal. The Board has evaluated the Company's growth prospects and near- and long-term value creation potential, including in connection with both the previously announced CoreWeave agreements and the proposal. The Board determined that the CoreWeave proposal significantly undervalues the Company and is not in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.\n\nCore Scientific continues to focus on capitalizing on its valuable portfolio of high-power digital infrastructure to expand its HPC hosting business, including through the execution of the recently announced contracted projects with CoreWeave. With greater than 300 MW of additional HPC capacity available, the Company is pursuing potential future transactions with CoreWeave or other HPC customers, while maintaining its strong bitcoin mining franchise. The Company believes that the predictable, recurring revenue from HPC hosting will balance the variability of its bitcoin mining business, while also producing steady cash flows that will strengthen Core Scientific's earnings power and provide greater financial strength and optionality.\n\nCore Scientific shareholders do not need to take any action at this time.\n\nMoelis & Company LLC is acting as financial advisor to Core Scientific. Sidley Austin LLP is acting as legal advisor to Core Scientific.\n\nAbout Core Scientific\n\nCore Scientific is one of the largest owners and operators of high-powered digital infrastructure for bitcoin mining and hosting services in North America. Transforming energy into high value compute with superior efficiency at scale, we employ our own large fleet of computers (\"miners\") to earn bitcoin for our own account and provide hosting services for large bitcoin mining and high-performance computing customers at our eight operational data centers in Georgia (2), Kentucky (1), North Carolina (1), North Dakota (1) and Texas (3).

Since then, the former investment banker has settled debts with angry lenders and further beefed up the company's non-bitcoin business as it reentered the public market.\n\nThough Core is up more than 40% since relisting earlier this year, its market capitalization of around $865 million is significantly lower than its valuation of $4.3 billion in July 2021.\n\nDemand for AI compute and infrastructure surged after OpenAI unveiled ChatGPT in Nov. 2022, setting off a rush of investment in AI models and startups. Meanwhile, Core Scientific and other miners like Bit Digital, Hive, Hut 8, and TeraWulf have been looking to bolster their revenue streams after the so-called bitcoin halving in April cut rewards paid out to bitcoin miners by 50%.\n\nMany have been retrofitting their massive facilities to meet the needs of the market.\n\n\"Bitcoin miners, often stationed in energy-secure and energy-intensive data centers, find these facilities ideal for AI operations as well,\" said James Butterfill, head of research at digital asset firm CoinShares.\n\nButterfill said the the overlap is leading to a competition for rack space between bitcoin mining and AI activities. While AI operations require up to 20 times the capital expenditure of bitcoin mining, they're more profitable, according to a report from CoinShares.\n\n\"The introduction of AI activities leads to increased depreciation and amortization, which can enhance gross profit margins,\" Butterfill said.\n\nAccording to CoinShares, Bit Digital derives 27% of its revenue from AI. Hut 8 generates 6% of sales from AI, and Hive, which has data centers in Canada and Sweden, gets 4% of its revenue from these services.\n\nHut 8 said in its first-quarter earnings report that it had purchased its first batch of 1,000 Nvidia GPUs and secured a customer agreement with a venture-backed AI cloud platform as part of its expansion into new technologies offering higher returns.\n\n\"We finalized commercial agreements for our new AI vertical under a GPU-as-a-service model, including a customer agreement which provides for fixed infrastructure payments plus revenue sharing,\" said Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot.\n\nGenoot added that the company expects to begin generating revenue in the second half of the year at an annual rate of about $20 million.\n\nBit Digital had 251 servers actively generating revenue from its first AI contract as of the end of April, and the company said it earned about $4.1 million of revenue from the operation that month.\n\nIris Energy expects to generate between $14 million and $17 million in annual revenue from its AI cloud services. Core Scientific's expanded arrangement with CoreWeave is expected to produce annual revenue of $290 million.\n\n\"While we intend to remain one of the largest and most productive bitcoin miners, we expect to have a diversified business model and more predictable cash flows,\" Sullivan said.\n\nBitcoin's volatility has made mining a challenging business.\n\nThough bitcoin is currently up more than 150% in the past year to around $69,000, the bear market of 2022 sent many miners into bankruptcy or forced them to shutter altogether.\n\nPivoting to AI isn't as simple as repurposing existing infrastructure and machines, because high-performance computing (HPC) data center requirements are different, as are the needs of the data network.\n\n\"Besides transformers, substations, and some switch gear nearly all infrastructure miners currently have would need to be bulldozed and built from the ground up to accommodate HPC,\" Needham analysts wrote in a report on May 30.\n\nThe rigs used to mine bitcoin are called Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). They're built specifically for crypto mining and can't be used to do other things.\n\nNeedham estimates that HPC data centers run at $8 million to $10 million per megawatt in capex, excluding GPUs, whereas bitcoin mining sites typically operate at $300,000 to $800,000 per megawatt in capex, not including ASICs.\n\nCore's Sullivan says there's a lot of synergy between the two businesses.\n\n\"One of the most exciting parts about the bitcoin mining business is we have access to large amounts of power across the United States with access to fiber lines,\" he said.\n\nBeyond its partnership with CoreWeave, Core Scientific has also announced that over the next three to four years, it's working to convert 500 megawatts of its bitcoin mining infrastructure across the country to HPC data centers.\n\nSullivan said the retrofit is manageable because the company owns and controls all of its data center infrastructure.\n\n\"There are components that we have to purchase to retrofit for HPC, but it is things that we can easily acquire,\" he said.\n\nIn the next one to two years, Needham analysts estimate that large publicly traded bitcoin miners are expected to more than double power capacity, including both their mining and HPC business expansion plans.\n\nClean energy is a popular choice because it's the cheapest power source in many markets. Miners at scale compete in a low-margin industry, where their only variable cost is typically energy, so they're incentivized to migrate to the world's cheapest sources of power. An industry report estimates the bitcoin network is 54.5% powered by sustainable electricity.\n\nThe Electric Power Research Institute estimates that data centers could take up to 9% of the country's total electricity consumption by 2030, up from around 4% in 2023. Tapping into nuclear energy is seen by many as the answer to meeting that demand.\n\nTerawulf powers its mining sites with nuclear energy, and is looking to get into machine learning. So far, the firm has two megawatts dedicated to HPC capacity, though it has plans to transition its energy infrastructure toward AI and HPC.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman told CNBC last year that he's a big believer in nuclear when it comes to serving the needs of AI workloads.\n\n\"I don't see a way for us to get there without nuclear,\" Altman said. \"I mean, maybe we could get there just with solar and storage. But from my vantage point, I feel like this is the most likely and the best way to get there.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcnewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC New York"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mackenzie_sigalos@nbcnewyork.com", "name": "MacKenzie Sigalos", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hut_8", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hut 8"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_asset", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Digital asset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_expenditure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capital expenditure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_banking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Investment banking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supercomputer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Venture capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Mining", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Mining", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling/Mineral_Exploration_and_Extraction", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling/Mineral Exploration and Extraction", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling/Associations", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling/Consulting", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2024/01/107138478-1666310703122-V100_00_10_22Still007.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622202", "eventUri": "eng-9622202", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-30", "textStart": 4953, "textEnd": 4959}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Miners like Core Scientific have diversified into artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) fields.\n\nTraining AI models requires massive infrastructure and a power supply. Gaint Bitcoin Miners such as Core Scientific can handle the enormous workload needed to integrate the technology.\n\nCore Scientific has announced a monumental twelve-year deal with CoreWeave, a cloud-based AI firm backed by private equity firms and Nvidia. This agreement strengthens the existing partnership between the two giants to secure over $3.5 billion in revenue.\n\nAccording to the contract terms, Core Scientific will provide 200MW of power to accommodate CoreWeave's High-Performance Computer (HPC). The Bitcoin miner plans to modify its sites for data purposes in the second half of 2024 and begin operations in the first half of 2025.\n\nReacting to the latest developments, Core Scientific CEO Adam Sullivan said the alliance positions Core Scientific at an advantage in transforming its hosting business.\n\nIt will also boost Core Scientific's earning power by unlocking massive opportunities in AI computing. Sullivan also stated that Core Scientific will maintain a strong Bitcoin mining franchise.\n\nA CNBC report reveals that Core Scientific has quietly been venturing into artificial intelligence for five years. The company overcame bankruptcy and began to diversify in 2019. Adam Sullivan believes that Bitcoin mining facilities are the power shells of the data center industry.\n\nBesides Core Scientific, top Bitcoin miners such as Hut 8, Hive, TerraWulf, and Bit Digital seek new methods to boost revenue. This ripple effect from the Bitcoin halving slashed miners' rewards.\n\nFor instance, TerraWulf, which uses nuclear energy to power its mining operations, now seeks to diversify into machine learning.\n\nCurrently, the firm has two megawatts set aside for HPC capacity. It also plans to smoothly transition its energy infrastructure towards artificial intelligence and HPC. OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman revealed to CNBC last year that he firmly believes in nuclear power for AI purposes.\n\nAltman says nuclear power is the best way to achieve the required energy to power AI. Although storing solar power could help, Altman believes nuclear remains the best energy source.\n\nAlso, Hut 8 reports profitable returns in the first quarter of 2024. According to the report, the company realized a revenue of $51.7 million.\n\nThese reports prove that most Bitcoin miners have the resources to delve into the vast world of artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, a report from the Electric Power Research Institute shows the impact of data centers on national electricity.

On Monday, Core Scientific signed a 12-year deal with cloud AI firm CoreWeave to host the company's high-performance computing (HPC) operations.\n\nAlso Read: Senator Ted Cruz Buys 3 Bitcoin Miners, Launches Operations\n\nThis partnership builds on a previous agreement from 2019 between Core Scientific and the Nvidia-backed AI company. Under this arrangement, the miner will provide 200 megawatts to host CoreWeave HPC operations in its data centers.\n\nCore Scientific CEO Adam Sullivan stated that the agreement allows the company to diversify its business and meet the growing demand for energy-intensive data centers. This move is particularly significant for the miner, which recently emerged from bankruptcy and is projected to generate up to $3.5 billion throughout the contract.\n\nCoreWeave will pay for upgrades to the data centers, enabling them to host GPUs, which is expected to cost $300 million. It also has the option to increase its hosting footprint with the miner.\n\nSullivan said:\n\n\"Our expanding relationship with CoreWeave creates a pathway for Core Scientific to diversify our business model and balance our portfolio between Bitcoin mining and alternative compute hosting, positioning us to maximize cash flow and minimize risk while maintaining our significant exposure to Bitcoin's upside potential.\"\n\nMarket analysts believe this deal sets a precedent for other miners, as AI and BTC mining require energy-intensive infrastructures. James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, reportedly noted that incorporating AI operations can improve miners' profit margins because their data centers are well-suited for AI technology.\n\nAlready, several miners -- including BitDigital, Hive, and Hut8 -- have begun incorporating AI operations into their facilities and have started to generate returns for their services.\n\nBitcoin miners' shift towards AI comes amid declining revenues. Despite an initial surge in earnings following the introduction of the Runes protocol, available data shows a significant drop due to decreased network activity and the impact of Bitcoin's halving event. The halving event decreased mining rewards to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC on April 20.\n\nZero Hedge reported that Bitcoin miner revenues were down 50.1% in May, while the volume of BTC sent to exchanges rose by 20.9%. According to Glassnode, this transaction increase has pushed miners' BTC balances to a new low of 1.8 million BTC -- the lowest since 2021.", "source": {"uri": "cryptorank.io", "dataType": "news", "title": "CryptoRank"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "High-performance computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Cruz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ted Cruz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Business model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Communication protocol"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Geology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Geology", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Mining", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Mining", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling/Mineral_Exploration_and_Extraction", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling/Mineral Exploration and Extraction", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling/Associations", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://cryptorank.io/static/logo.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622202", "eventUri": "eng-9622202", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-20", "textStart": 2282, "textEnd": 2290}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

(NASDAQ:CORZ), a Bitcoin mining company, announced a 12-year deal with cloud provider CoreWeave to provide infrastructure for AI use cases. This agreement is expected to generate more than $3.5 billion in revenue over the contract period.\n\nCoreWeave, backed by AI chip giant Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), rents out graphics processing units (GPUs), essential for training and running AI models. Core Scientific will provide about 200 megawatts of infrastructure to support CoreWeave's operations.\n\nCore Scientific, which emerged from bankruptcy in January, has been mining a mix of digital assets since 2017. The company began diversifying into other services in 2019.\n\nWhy It Matters: Core Scientific's AI push follows similar move by another well-known Bitcoin mining firm, Bitdeer Technologies Group (NASDAQ:BTDR), which partnered with Nvidia to offer AI cloud computing services\n\nThe pivot towards AI by Bitcoin miners was triggered by the halving event in April, which halved the new issuance of Bitcoin. This event, designed to counter inflation, has historically preceded a significant surge in Bitcoin's price. Miners began turning to AI to mitigate the impact of the halving event.\n\nOther miners like Bit Digital, Hive, Hut 8, and TeraWulf are also looking to bolster their revenue streams after the Bitcoin halving in April cut rewards paid out to miners by 50%. Many are retrofitting their facilities to meet the needs of the AI market.\n\nAccording to CoinShares, Bit Digital derives 27% of its revenue from AI. Hut 8 generates 6% of sales from AI, and Hive, which has data centers in Canada and Sweden, gets 4% of its revenue from these services.\n\nPrice Action: The shares of Core Scientific closed 2.53% higher at $4.87 during Monday's regular trading session, according to data from Benzinga Pro. Bitcoin was exchanging hands at $69,192.81, up 1.32% in the last 24 hours.\n\nRead Next: DOG*GO*TO*THE*MOON, A Bitcoin-Based Memecoin Outperformed The Broader Market With 25% Gain -- Floki Spikes As Well\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of Benzinga Neuro and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.", "source": {"uri": "uk.investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_asset", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Digital asset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hut_8", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hut 8"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Action game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling/Mineral_Exploration_and_Extraction", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling/Mineral Exploration and Extraction", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/d7302451e500b3ceb333ee9981186da7_L.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622202", "eventUri": "eng-9622202", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

(Nasdaq: CORZ) (\"Core Scientific\" or \"the Company\"), one of the largest owners and operators of high-powered digital infrastructure for bitcoin mining and hosting services in North America, today released unaudited production and operations updates for May 2024.\n\n\"We continue to execute well in our strong bitcoin mining business while also leveraging our valuable portfolio of high-power digital infrastructure to expand our hosting business, as demonstrated by our recent announcement of new, long-term hosting contracts for 200 megawatts of HPC infrastructure with CoreWeave, the AI Hyperscaler,\" said Adam Sullivan, Core Scientific's Chief Executive Officer. \"These contracts represent one of the largest AI hosting agreements to date, and they will strengthen our earnings power with an estimated $3.5 billion in cumulative revenue over their 12-year terms.\"\n\n\"Our discussions with potential clients to modify an additional 300 megawatts of our high-power infrastructure for HPC hosting continue, representing an even greater source of revenue by capitalizing on strong market demand. Supported by powerful industry tailwinds across AI compute, we are excited about the meaningful opportunities ahead to maximize the value of our digital infrastructure portfolio to deliver on our business objectives and create sustainable shareholder value,\" added Mr. Sullivan.\n\nAs of month-end, the Company operated approximately 219,000 bitcoin miners for both self-mining and hosting, representing a total energized hash rate of 26.1 EH/s at its seven data centers in Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, North Dakota and Texas. The Company also hosted customer-owned GPUs for high-performance computing at a separate 16MW data center in Texas.\n\nSelf-Mining\n\nCore Scientific earned 447 bitcoin in May from its owned fleet of miners. As of month end, the Company operated approximately 173,000 owned bitcoin miners, representing approximately 79% of the bitcoin miners operating in its data centers and a total energized hash rate of 20.4 EH/s.\n\nHosting Services\n\nIn addition to its self-mining fleet, Core Scientific provided data center hosting services, technology and operating support for approximately 46,000 hosted, customer-owned bitcoin miners, representing approximately 21% of the bitcoin miners operating in the Company's data centers as of May 31, 2024. Customer-owned bitcoin miners earned an estimated 128 bitcoin in May, including bitcoin rewards paid to the Company pursuant to proceeds sharing agreements.\n\nGrid Support\n\nIn May, the Company implemented its post-halving strategy to maximize profitability by curtailing portions of its fleet based on miner efficiency, hash price and power prices. This strategy reduced the consumption of power at its data centers on several occasions and delivered 26,328 megawatt hours to local grid partners\n\nMiner Deployments\n\nPrior generation miners replaced by new S21s deployed earlier this year continue to operate at Core Scientific's Calvert City, KY and Pecos, TX data centers. A change in mining economics may result in these prior generation miners being removed and stored, thereby decreasing the Company's total operational infrastructure and hash rate.\n\nUpcoming Events and Conferences\n\nCore Scientific Investor and Analyst Event, June 12, 2024\n\nCore Scientific is one of the largest owners and operators of high-powered digital infrastructure for bitcoin mining and hosting services in North America. Transforming energy into high value compute with superior efficiency at scale, we employ our own large fleet of computers (\"miners\") to earn bitcoin for our own account and provide hosting services for large bitcoin mining and high-performance computing customers at our eight operational data centers in Georgia (2), Kentucky (1), North Carolina (1), North Dakota (1) and Texas (3). We derive the majority of our revenue from earning bitcoin for our own account (\"self-mining\").

The deal is expected to generate $3.5 billion in revenue, roughly $290 million annually, for Core Scientific.\n\nIn a separate move, CoreWeave offered to acquire Core Scientific for $5.75 per share, valuing the company at $1.6 billion, or nearly $2 million per MW of power capacity. In comparison, the 14 listed mining operators currently trade between $680,000 and $8.4 million per MW.\n\nJPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) suggests this deal may set a new valuation floor and indicate that the race for power capacity is intensifying, leading to additional stock price increases or consolidation in the coming months.\n\nNews of the deal and the acquisition offer sparked a rally in the market, with the 14 U.S.-listed operators followed by JPMorgan adding $1.6 billion in market cap, an increase of 9%. This also fueled speculation and debate about whether other mining operators might also become acquisition targets. Additionally, the deal has validated Iris Energy's own high-performance computing pilot efforts, which are rated overweight by JPMorgan.\n\n\"This is the largest HPC hosting agreement announcement to date and highlights alternative and potentially more accretive use cases for mining facilities,\" JPMorgan stated. \"We think this deal potentially raises the valuation floor for sub-scale mining operators, as a new class of buyers, namely Hyperscalers, has emerged,\" the report added.\n\nSuch deals, which shift power capacity away from miners, could rationalize the Bitcoin network by easing network difficulty and improving the profit profile of remaining operators.\n\nThe U.S. currently generates 1,300GW of electricity, with an additional 500GW of capacity under development. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission estimates that U.S. data centers will require 21GW of power in 2024 and 35GW by 2030, consuming up to 9% of all U.S. electricity generation by then.\n\nThe Electric Power Research Institute estimates that AI applications account for 10% to 20% of data center electricity consumption today, with this proportion expected to grow as AI models are more energy-intensive than traditional data retrieval, streaming, and communication applications. For example, ChatGPT queries require 10 times the electrical demands of traditional Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) searches.\n\nWith immediate power access in relatively short supply, Hyperscalers and AI firms are exploring alternatives, including leasing power or datacenter capacity from, or outright acquiring, bitcoin miners. JPMorgan estimates that U.S.-listed miners alone draw up to 5GW of power and have access to another 2.5GW through power purchase agreements, making them attractive targets. Some operators are feeling the financial pinch from the recent block reward halving, which cut industry revenues in half, and are actively exploring exit strategies.\n\nHigh performance computing (HPC) has been a hot topic among miners recently. To date, a handful of U.S. operators have announced pilot HPC programs, including IREN, Core Scientific (CORZ), and Terawulf (WULF).\n\n\"This Core Scientific news is most relevant and potentially impactful to IREN, which was early to embrace HPC, trades at just $1.5M per MW of capacity, and has a track record of delivering data centers on time and operating them with high uptime,\" JPMorgan stated.", "source": {"uri": "uk.investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPMorgan_Chase", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "JPMorgan Chase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "High-performance computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Energy_Regulatory_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Energy Regulatory Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supercomputer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_Power_Research_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric Power Research Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_energy_consumption", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric energy consumption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_purchase_agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Power purchase agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electricity generation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Geology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Geology", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Substation_and_Transmission", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Substation and Transmission", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling/Mineral_Exploration_and_Extraction", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling/Mineral Exploration and Extraction", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/LYNXMPEE420N1_L.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622202", "eventUri": "eng-9622202", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

On Tuesday, shares of Core Scientific (CORZ) surged higher after cloud computing firm CoreWeave signed a 200 megawatts (MW) artificial intelligence deal with the bitcoin miner, and was also reported to have made an offer to buy the company in an all-cash deal. Meanwhile, another large bitcoin miner, Riot Platforms (RIOT), made a hostile offer to buy out peer Bitfarms (BITF) last month.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin Halving Is Poised to Unleash Darwinism on Miners\n\nThe deal with CoreWeave validates and may accelerate the mining sector's involvement in high-performance computing (HPC), JPMorgan said in the report.

New facilities being built are quickly filling up: About 83% of data-center capacity under construction has already been leased in advance, with AI companies and cloud-service providers driving the demand, according to a March report by commercial real-estate firm CBRE Group.\n\nThe search for any and all available data-center space is leading many in AI to a slew of crypto-mining companies, which already sit on the necessary resources and are looking for more-profitable uses for them. The tidal wave of demand was on display this week as Core Scientific announced a partnership with AI startup CoreWeave that will generate about $3.5 billion in revenue over 12 years -- news that was quickly overshadowed by a Bloomberg report that CoreWeave made an offer to buy Core Scientific outright for about $1 billion.\n\n\"We view the opportunity in AI today to be one where we can convert existing infrastructure we own to host clients who are looking to install very large arrays of GPUs for their clients that are ultimately AI clients,\" Core Scientific Chief Executive Officer Adam Sullivan said in an interview before the news of CoreWeave's offer broke. He declined to comment on the takeover report on Tuesday.\n\nThe crypto miner has identified about 500-megawatts worth of data-center capacity that can be converted into facilities to power AI, which is \"the largest installment of these GPUs dedicated to AI possibly in the entire world,\" Sullivan said. To put that capacity in perspective: It's enough electricity to run hundreds of thousands of homes for a year.\n\nIt's no wonder, then, that CoreWeave would be interested in simply buying the entire Austin, Texas-based company. And the reactions in the stock market -- including a 22% jump in shares of miner TeraWulf Inc. on Tuesday -- suggest investors are betting on more good news for the sector.\n\nOne of the key challenges to building out data centers is providing the energy needed to run them. It's a complicated process that often includes building substations that enable data centers to draw electricity from a power grid, and construction of the facilities typically takes at least a few years to finish.\n\nIf a data-center developer can secure a power source with a two-year time advantage relative to a competitor, the developer would be willing to pay about a 101% premium to power prices, assuming a six-year economic life of the GPUs, according to an estimate from Morgan Stanley. Even assuming a 10-year economic life for the chips, the analysts estimated a 61% premium.\n\nData Center Conversions\n\nOne way to get a head start is simply to convert existing data centers dedicated to mining, an energy-intensive process in which specialized computers solve mathematical puzzles to validate encrypted transactions on the blockchain in return for compensation in the form of Bitcoin or other crypto tokens. An April update to the Bitcoin blockchain software, which cut the rewards paid to miners in half, makes the proposition especially attractive now.\n\nA data center that can be converted quickly is valued significantly higher than it is in its role as a mining facility, the Morgan Stanley report said. The firm's analysts identified more than seven gigawatts of sites that could be retrofitted among the top 21 public crypto-mining companies, which collectively only contribute about one-quarter of the computing power involved in mining Bitcoin.\n\nWhile some crypto miners trying to ride the AI boom are hunting for more convertible data centers and readily available power to rent out to AI firms, some are taking a more direct approach by purchasing specialized hardware and selling computing power directly to AI clients. Northern Data AG, Bit Digital Inc., Iris Energy, Hive Digital Technologies Ltd. and Hut 8 Corp. have purchased hundreds of millions of dollars worth of the Nvidia chips that have been in high demand, as so-called data-center hyperscalers such as Google and Amazon buy up much of the inventory.\n\nThese companies previously ran GPU-based mining operations alongside Bitcoin mining, which uses a different type of technology. They tend to have expertise in operating higher-tier data centers that are suitable for high-performance computing, and often have pre-existing relationships with either Nvidia or wholesalers of the chips since they were already big purchasers of GPUs in previous crypto bull runs.\n\nNvidia Cards\n\n\"Maintaining those relationships and working well with those partners is just as important as working well with Nvidia,\" said Rosanne Kincaid-Smith, group chief operating officer at crypto miner Northern Data, which has a stockpile of GPUs previously used for Ethereum mining.\n\nFrankfurt-based Northern Data is running one of the largest AI clusters in the world. Backed by Tether Holdings, issuer of the Tether stablecoin and one of the most-profitable crypto firms, Northern Data has purchased more than $800 million worth of Nvidia equipment including the H100 chips that are now in high-demand for generative AI applications. About 70% of the German crypto miner's operation, including A100 chips that are predecessors to H100, was used for mining the cryptocurrency Ether until that token's blockchain underwent a major software update that rendered the chips useless for that purpose. The miner will deploy 20,000 H100s by the end of the summer, making it a major computing power provider for AI companies in Europe.\n\nCoreWeave, which was a crypto miner itself before turning into an AI upstart, is a success story that Northern Data is aspiring to emulate. New Jersey-based CoreWeave is considering an initial public offering after raising billions of dollars from recent funding rounds to reach a valuation of $19 billion. Northern Data has also been mulling an initial public offering of its cloud computing unit Taiga since it unveiled a financing package to buy more chips and boost its generative AI offerings.\n\n\"They are also about six months ahead of us, so I would love to pick up this conversation in six to nine months and do another comparison,\" Kincaid-Smith said. \"We very much plan to compete.\"\n\nIt all adds to an unexpectedly exciting time to be in the data-center business, a once sleepy corner of the tech plumbing world that is now captivating the attention of major players from Silicon Valley to Wall Street.\n\n\"I have been in this digital infrastructure or the data-center business for 20 plus years,\" said Brown, the Core Scientific executive. \"I haven't seen this rate of growth.\"", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score":

A year ago, Nvidia took a $100mn stake that valued it at $2bn.\n\nThe jump in price highlights how CoreWeave has become another beneficiary of the booming demand for AI chips that propelled Nvidia to a $2.8tn valuation and boosted the stocks of the chipmaker's other partners such as Dell and Supermicro. Now the company is looking to put that capital to use by building facilities in the UK and Europe.\n\nCoreWeave rents out access to its coveted stash of Nvidia chips, including the in-demand H100 and the forthcoming B200, that run inside its data centres. Its facilities were designed to accommodate the particular requirements of high-performance computing, from high-speed networking between clusters of AI chips to liquid-cooled servers, said Michael Intrator, its chief executive.\n\nCoreWeave investors, including hedge fund Magnetar Capital, Blackstone and Coatue, are betting that soaring demand for specialised AI services will reshape the $500bn cloud computing market, despite the tens of billions that Big Tech companies are spending on their own data centres.\n\n\"The way that the cloud is going to be used for the next generation is very different than how the cloud was used in its inception 20 years ago,\" said Intrator, calling the company the Tesla to Big Tech's Ford.\n\nIntrator said it was \"incredibly hard\" pitching to its earliest lenders, who had to become \"experts in a field that they didn't know anything about, to the point where they could lend billions of dollars and take it to their investment committee to propose a new asset class\", such as using Nvidia's graphics processing units as collateral.\n\nCoreWeave had long since pivoted away from cryptocurrencies when the release of Microsoft-backed OpenAI's ChatGPT in November 2022 unleashed a huge wave of demand for AI computing.\n\nSeizing its opportunity, the company quickly scaled up its financing efforts.\n\nIt raised more than $420mn in the first half of 2023 in equity, then another $2.3bn in debt financing a few months later. Some existing shareholders sold $642mn worth of stock to Fidelity and others in December. Then last month it struck two more deals to raise $7.5bn in debt and $1.1bn in equity.\n\nCoreWeave needed the funding to \"be able to scale large enough that we could support anybody who wanted to participate in the AI boom\", said Intrator, no matter how many thousands of chips they need.\n\nNow CoreWeave has its sights on rapid expansion in Europe. It revealed plans on Wednesday to invest $2.2bn to build three data centres in Norway, Sweden and Spain by the end of next year. It has recently committed $1.3bn for two facilities in the UK, where it is basing its European headquarters.\n\nTo grow more quickly in the US, CoreWeave this week announced a partnership with Core Scientific, a bitcoin miner, to repurpose several of its data centres to host its GPUs. Bloomberg reported on Tuesday that CoreWeave has also offered to buy Core Scientific outright for more than $1bn. The companies have not commented on the report.\n\nLike Amazon Web Services or Microsoft's Azure, CoreWeave offers an alternative to companies buying and maintaining their own servers, offering flexible access to computing power.\n\nBut unlike AWS, which was founded in 2006 and can host an almost endless range of applications and data, CoreWeave's data centre serves a specific niche of clients with extremely high-performance computing demands, from AI and drug researchers to media groups.\n\nDespite its reliance on Nvidia's GPUs for the core of its service, Intrator argues there is a \"misunderstanding\" about CoreWeave's relationship with the world's most valuable chipmaker. \"Nvidia is not giving us access to GPUs because they have some vested interest in us or because we have some advantageous access.\"\n\nIts competitive edge was more than just having the right chips, Intrator said. For instance, CoreWeave had developed software that automatically manages and maintains clusters of GPUs.\n\nHe bats off questions about whether prospective investors were concerned about backing a business that had raised capital from Nvidia, only to spend a significant portion of those funds on that company's products.\n\n\"It's such a crap narrative,\" he said. \"Nvidia invested $100mn. We've [raised] $12bn in debt and equity. It's an inconsequential amount of money in the relative scale of the amount of infrastructure we're buying.\"\n\nNvidia also denies that companies it has invested in get preferential access to its new products. \"We don't help anybody jump the queue,\" Mohamed Siddeek, head of Nvidia's venture arm NVentures, told the Financial Times last year.\n\nNonetheless, Intrator said that having Nvidia examine CoreWeave's business and agree to invest was \"an incredibly powerful tool\" when it came to raising capital.\n\n\"There's an awful lot of questions that I'm able to answer based on the fact

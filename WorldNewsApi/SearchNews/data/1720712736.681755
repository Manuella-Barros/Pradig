After a decade in the council, O\u2019Donnell is set to fall to Rathmullan native Pauric McGarvey, also an Independent candidate. \u201cWe are still going to leave here with our heads held high,\u201d O\u2019Donnell tells in the count centre. He thanked the electorate who gave him more than 1,300 first preference votes and hundreds more in the preferences. \u201cWe are going to be beat here by a short head but unfortunately it\u2019s just not going to fall our way today,\u201d O\u2019Donnell admitted. Despite the shock, O\u2019Donnell is immensely proud of his team and is already refocusing on other priorities \u2013 his family and his business affairs. \u201cIt\u2019s going to put no big void in my life because I\u2019m a busy man, I\u2019m going to step up to the plate now and become busier,\u201d he said. O\u2019Donnell adds that he\u2019ll be tying in with Cllr McGarvey to ensure his voters are represented. \u201cNo better man could have got the seat,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said. On whether he\u2019ll return to politics remains to be seen. \u201cWe\u2019ll bounce back, a week is a long time in politics, we\u2019ll see what happens going into the future,\u201d he said.", "summary": "<p>MILFORD: A disappointed John O\u2019Donnell said that he and his team will bounce back after a defeat in the Milford&#8230;</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.donegaldaily.com/2024/06/09/election-2024-watch-john-odonnell-defeated-but-determined-to-bounce-back/\">Election 2024: Watch &#8211; John O&#8217;Donnell defeated but determined to bounce back</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.donegaldaily.com\">Donegal Daily</a>.</p>", "url": "https://www.donegaldaily.com/2024/06/09/election-2024-watch-john-odonnell-defeated-but-determined-to-bounce-back/", "image": "https://www.donegaldaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_42155-scaled.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:46:58", "author": "Rachel McLaughlin", "authors": ["Rachel McLaughlin"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": 0.146}

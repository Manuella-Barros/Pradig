{"id": 231227436, "title": "Corrie star Mollie Gallagher, 26, reveals life-changing health diagnosis in frank statement", "text": "Coronation Street star Mollie Gallagher has candidly opened up to her fans after being diagnosed with ADHD. Mollie revealed on her Instagram that she had been diagnosed with ADHD after believing she had the condition \"for years\". After being dealt the news from doctors, the 26-year-old soap actress says she is \"finally happy\" as everything in her life is starting to \"make sense now.\" The TV star took to her page to repost a clip from the ADHD Chatter Podcast's episode with author Kat Brown, where the journalist discusses the condition that affects people's behaviour. Mollie wrote alongside the clip: \u201cI\u2019ve just recently been diagnosed after knowing for years and I\u2019m just finally happy that everything makes sense now.\u201d ADHD can often go unnoticed particularly among adults, as some symptoms are less obvious than others. According to the NHS website, common symptoms include extreme restlessness, impulsiveness, and difficulty focusing or prioritising tasks. Mollie isn't the first celeb to speak out about her ADHD. Some well-known faces who have been diagnosed with the condition include Sam Thompson, Loose Women's Nadia Sawalha, and TV presenter Emma Watson. King of the Jungle and Made In Chelsea star Sam previously opened up about being diagnosed with two neurological conditions, ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) and autism aged 30. Actress Mollie is known for playing Nina Lucas on the ITV soap. She was first introduced in November 2019, arriving on the cobbles as Roy Cropper's (who is played by David Neilson) long-lost niece. She has since been at the centre of powerful storylines - including the horrific unprovoked attack on her character after she was targeted by bullies due to her appearance. Last year, Mollie swapped the cobbles for the rank, as she took part in the 2023 series of Dancing on Ice. She quickly praised her musician boyfriend Dan Myers for supporting her throughout the process, as she said: \"Dan is absolutely loving all my outfits. He\u2019s excited to be a part of it.\" Mollie had always dreamt of a showbiz career - and was grateful to have landed a stint on the cherished ITV soap. She gushed: \u201cIt\u2019s probably one of the things I am most proud of, being a working class actress on a working class soap. I was lucky enough to get a full scholarship to drama school.\" Follow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads.", "summary": "Coronation Street star Mollie Gallagher has opened up about her ADHD diagnosis, and told her followers that &quot;everything makes sense now&quot;", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/corrie-star-mollie-gallagher-26-32987944", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32988025.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Mollie.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 12:53:37", "author": "Ayaan Ali,Ayaan-Ali", "authors": ["Ayaan Ali", "Ayaan-Ali"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": 0.406}

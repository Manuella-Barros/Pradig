It was probably the first time I had the attention span to watch a five-set match. I'd say when I was younger, I probably wasn't as interested in watching tennis or watching some tennis matches. But that final really grabbed me.\n\nWhat are your first memories of playing Wimbledon?\n\nI got an opportunity to practise for a week at Wimbledon before playing Queen's last year. It was a great experience for me, seeing the site kind of empty. Then when I got back from playing the tournament in Mallorca, the site was full, the tournament was getting started, it was a completely different feel.\n\nWhat were your early thoughts about the aura of the venue?\n\nI always think it's cool when you're able to see two sides of the tournament. The more closed-off side, which feels exclusive, like no one else is there. I quite like that as well, the week before. You can walk around and it is chill and you really get to see the site.\n\nThen when match day is there, you see the sea of people, ready and excited to watch the tennis. I think that is the coolest part for me and the buzz you get at Wimbledon is the best.\n\nWhat is your favourite Wimbledon tradition and why?\n\nI love the all-white clothing. I think it's great when tournaments are unique and have their own thing. I think Wimbledon does a great job of that. Obviously, they're the one Grand Slam that's still on grass.\n\nThree of the Grand Slams used to be on grass. Now two of them have gone away from it. We still have one Grass-Court major. The all-white makes Wimbledon unique and traditional and really in touch with our tennis ancestors. I really enjoy it.\n\nYour dad, Bryan, reached the fourth round at Wimbledon in 1994. Have you talked to him about that experience and seen any footage of him playing at Wimbledon?\n\nI think it was really cool because there's not a lot of tape that I've seen of my dad playing, but you can find a few of his matches for that year at Wimbledon. They are the matches that I've watched. Obviously he was playing at a really, really high level that week, so it was cool to kind of see some of his top-end tennis and speak to him about it after.\n\nWhat is your favourite thing about playing on grass?\n\nI think there are a lot of things to learn on grass. I didn't start playing on grass until so late in my tennis development and kind of developing a game style having never played on grass before. There's a bunch of things to learn and develop that have to do with movement, play style and things that I think that I'm learning and growing every single day. The journey just continues for me after a good start.\n\nI think that it's a surface where I could do really well and have some great success. But I haven't done anything yet. I haven't proved myself on the surface yet.", "source": {"uri": "atptour.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ATP Tour"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Shelton_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ben Shelton (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Shelton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bryan Shelton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomaz_Bellucci", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thomaz Bellucci"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallorca", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mallorca"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Clocks_and_Watches", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Clocks and Watches", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://www.atptour.com/-/media/images/news/2024/06/28/09/04/shelton-my-wimbledon-2024.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9693206", "eventUri": "eng-9693206", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

Additionally, the event's location in the affluent suburb of Wimbledon could enhance this perception.\"\n\nDr. Blagrove notes that the allure of Wimbledon also lies in its unique blend of tradition and pageantry. She explained, \"From the pristine grass courts to the strawberries and cream, Wimbledon exudes a sense of elegance and timelessness that could appeal to those who value heritage and sophistication.\"\n\nFor those choosing to watch Wimbledon over the Euros, Dr. Blagrove suggests that this preference may reflect other psychological and social tendencies. She said, \"Preferring Wimbledon over the Euros could simply indicate a preference for individual sports over team sports, a desire for a more refined viewing experience, or greater appreciation of the cultural and historical aspects of the event.\n\n\"It might also suggest a tendency to value elements of tennis, for example, precision, strategy, and the sartorial elegance associated with tennis.\"\n\nDr. Blagrove emphasizes that these preferences are neither inherently good nor bad but could provide interesting insights into individual personality traits, social influences or your sense of identity. \"Whether you're captivated by the drama of a football match or the finesse of a tennis rally, your sports preference could say something about what you find engaging and enjoyable,\" she said.\n\nAs Wimbledon commences, Dr. Blagrove encourages sports enthusiasts to embrace their preferences and enjoy each event's unique experiences. She concluded, \"Ultimately, both Wimbledon and the Euros bring people together, create memorable moments, and celebrate the spirit of competition.\"", "source": {"uri": "phys.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Phys.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Warwick", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Warwick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychologist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychologist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_class", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Upper class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Centre Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strawberry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strawberry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Team sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drama"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2021/tennis-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9693206", "eventUri": "eng-9693206", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

And what's with that peculiar pineapple perched atop the trophy?\n\nThis year, RadioTimes.com is your guide to these delightful mysteries. Buckle up as we unravel the eccentricities of Wimbledon 2024, ensuring you're the trivia champion of your next tennis watch party.\n\nCan Wimbledon players go to the toilet during a match?\n\nWimbledon rules permit players to \"request permission to leave the court for a reasonable time for a toilet break\", but this must be taken during a set break and cannot be used for any other purpose.\n\nMale and female players are allowed two toilet breaks per match, while doubles teams must share their allocated number of breaks.\n\nThe rulebook also states \"the nearest assigned bathroom should be used\" and that a line judge must accompany the player to ensure they \"do not use the break for any other purpose\".\n\nWhy are Wimbledon tennis balls kept in the fridge?\n\nDon't you hate it when you're searching for that jar of mayo at the back of the fridge and you can't see past the Wimbledon tennis balls spilling out?\n\nThroughout history, fridges have been deployed at the side of courts to maintain the consistency of bounce in every ball while they're waiting to be used.\n\nThe 53,000 balls used at the tournament will be kept at 20 degrees until it's their time to shine.\n\nHow loudly do Wimbledon players grunt?\n\nMaria Sharapova would commonly tip over 100 decibels on court, while Monica Seles and Jimmy Connors were the earliest known pioneers of 'The Grunt'.\n\nHow much will strawberries and cream cost at Wimbledon?\n\nA portion of 10 strawberries (minimum) and a lashing of cream will set you back \u00a32.50 at the Championships, a price that has been frozen for the last 13 years. Take that, inflation!\n\nThe strawberries are always Grade 1 from farms in Kent, and they are picked at 4:00am on the day they are sold and scoffed at Wimbledon.\n\nMore than 166,000 portions were sold during the two-week 2018 tournament - but wait, why are we eating them at Wimbledon?\n\nWhy do people eat strawberries and cream at Wimbledon?\n\nThe delicious snack was served to 200 punters at the 1877 Championships and the tradition is still going strong more than 140 years later.\n\nBut the origin story of strawberries and cream allegedly dates back to 1509, when Thomas Wolsey - a powerful figure around the time of King Henry XIII - served up the treat to guests at a banquet.\n\nWolsey's own palace also boasted tennis courts, where staff would be deployed to bring strawberries and cream to guests. A simple luxury fit for a king.\n\nWhat length is the grass on Centre Court?\n\nThe first cut in preparation for the Championships shaves the lawn down to 25mm, before the winter sees another reduction down to around 13mm.\n\nHowever, this figure can only be reached without trimming off more than a third of the original length at a time, to avoid weakening the individual grass blades.\n\nThe surfaces are then cut by 1mm per week from approximately nine weeks before the tournament, down to the optimum playing height of 8mm.\n\nIn the four weeks leading up to the tournament, the grass is mowed every day to ensure the 8mm length is adhered to. Think about that next time you mow the lawn!\n\nIn 2015, the going rate for two weeks work at the tournament was \u00a3200 per ball boy or girl, and they were also allowed to keep the snazzy Ralph Lauren tennis uniforms worn during the Championships.\n\nLocal school headmasters are asked to select their best and brightest, and 700 applicants are narrowed down to around 250 hard-working, unsung heroes.\n\nWhy do players wear white at Wimbledon?\n\nThe original reason for cracking out the tennis whites was to prevent sweat patches prominently showing through - a disaster for the social elite types back in the day.\n\nThe tradition stuck and a fresh set of rules in 2014 stated that only \"a single trim of colour\" no wider than 10mm is allowed on the neckline, sleeves or even underwear.\n\nThis is a rule the All England Club takes seriously - Roger Federer's trainers were banned from the tournament in 2013 because the soles were orange.\n\nAre tennis balls yellow or green?\n\nWhen it comes to the colour of tennis balls, we're inclined to fall in line with whatever Roger Federer thinks.\n\n\"They're yellow, right?\" said Federer in 2018. Who are we to argue?\n\nHow long does it take to close the Centre Court roof?\n\nThe roof itself is a speedy mover, switching from open to closed (and vice versa) in just 10 minutes.\n\nHowever, a 45-minute stoppage may be required while the air-conditioning system acclimatises the arena to become an indoor venue.\n\nWhat is inside a tennis ball?\n\nA kinder egg toy? Strawberries and cream? Pimm's? A total vacuum? A wormhole?\n\nNah, it's just air inside a tennis ball. Or nitrogen, for those who want to inflate tennis balls for longer.\n\nWhat TFL zone is Wimbledon in?\n\nWimbledon sits in Zone 3. More than 12 million people pile through the barriers each year, with many heading to The Championships.\n\nWhy is there a pineapple on top of the Wimbledon trophy?\n\nYou've never noticed before, have you? Legitimately, nobody really knows.\n\nIn 2017, a spokesperson for the Wimbledon Museum told Express.co.uk that the origin story of the immortalised golden fruit contains \"very few facts\", though one reasonable explanation is that pineapples were once a rarity, a sign of honour and wealth in society.\n\nWhat is love?\n\nHaddaway didn't know the answer back in 1993 and almost three decades later we're still struggling to find the answer...\n\nWhen a player doesn't have a point in a game, yet their opponent has scored, you'll hear \"15-love\" despite the scoreboard displaying 15-0.\n\nThe Oxford Dictionary recognised the phrase 'for love' as \"without stakes being wagered\" and that could result in 'love' replacing 'zero/nothing'.\n\nA French myth suggests love came from l'ouef, the word for egg, and that a zero on the scoreboard resembles an egg.

The South London neighbourhood is already awash with purple, white and green ahead of the world's most famous tennis tournament starting on Monday (July 1).\n\nIn what is anticipated to be Andy Murray's final year playing Wimbledon, if he's fit enough to play his first round match on Tuesday (July 2) or join up with brother Jamie in the doubles, local businesses are going above and beyond by adorning their windows with strawberries, rackets and balls. Mariana Walsh, who has lived in Wimbledon for a few years, said: \"I know some people don't like it because it gets crowded but we enjoy the vibes, the party atmosphere.\n\n\"Sometimes when the sun is out it reminds me of being on holiday. We are planning to go, it creates this feeling of belonging. I don't even know how to describe it. In the evening it will be crazy as all the youngsters will be out. The pub down the road, there will be live music. It's like a festival.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Wimbledon's iconic strawberries and cream prices and rules for bringing your own drinks\n\nAnother resident, Debbie Knight, added: \"I love it, I think it's great. It's really buzzy and busy, everyone seems to be excited and make a bit more of an effort.\"\n\nWhile many households embrace being in the spotlight of living next to, and attending, tennis' most famous venue- formally known as the All England Club - just how busy Wimbledon becomes isn't for everyone, with some families taking the opportunity to escape for two weeks. Susan Cusack, an avid member of the Save Wimbledon Park Campaign Group, said: \"A lot of locals rent out their houses and move away, but I like the buzz and I will be going to Wimbledon.\"\n\nPubs and local shops expect big profits and increased footfall, with some even being able to extend their venues to keep up with demand. Phillip Daly, manager of the Dog and Fox Hotel & Pub, told MyLondon they've added two new bars, an additional outdoor kitchen, and a new seafood menu on the back of yearly successes of being a destination for people attending the tennis.\n\nHe said: \"Wimbledon is what? The biggest sports event that has the most spectators coming from abroad so yeah, it's great. It's great to have that many people and be busy, busy, busy. It's a great boost for us and the economy. Pubs have been having a hard time of it lately so it's a welcome change.\"\n\nThe manager of a nearby card shop, Steffania Janes, echoed this sentiment, saying: \"There is an increase in footfall in this store, in any of the stores.

That is not a bad result for someone who is meant to be struggling on grass,\" said Robson, speaking to Tennis365 at a Play Your Way To Wimbledon event.\n\n\"He has been working on coming forward a bit more and a little like Iga (Swiatek), he has learned to flatten his shots out a little more on this surface.\n\n\"Given the fact he has hardly lost any matches this year, he is going to have a lot of confidence coming into Wimbledon.\n\nSinner could face Carlos Alcaraz in what would be a blockbuster semi-final showdown, with Robson convinced the defending Wimbledon champion will be at his best despite an early defeat in the Queen's Club warm-up event against Britain's Jack Draper.\n\n\"He was probably so shattered from Paris as there is such a quick turnaround from Paris and he managed to squeeze in a cheeky trip to Ibiza to celebrate, so he probably won't worry too much about the defeat at Queen's,\" continued Robson.\n\n\"Carlos will have got enough practice in at Wimbledon, so I don't have any worries about him when the tournament starts. The extra week without matches might do him some good.\n\n\"The great thing about Carlos is he excites us every time we see him. You always see something new with him.\n\n\"You are sat watching in the side of the court and you think he can just do anything. He is unbelievably athletic and just enjoys it so much. You can't but enjoy it with him when you watch him from the side of the court.\"\n\nDraper's win over Alcaraz confirmed the young Brit will be a player to watch at Wimbledon, with Robson backing the player seeded for the first time at Wimbledon to shine.\n\n\"Jack looks amazing and I'm so excited to see what he can do at Wimbledon,\" added Robson, who won an Olympic silver medal alongside Andy Murray in the mixed doubles at the 2012 London Olympic Games, that were held at Wimbledon.\n\n\"I was so gutted for Jack when he couldn't play in the grass court events last year as it is so clearly his best surface.\n\n\"All of us have been waiting for an ATP Tour title from him for a while now and he played so smart in the final against Matteo Berrettini in Stuttgart.\n\n\"Then he backed it up by beating Alcaraz at Queen's, so I'm very, very excited for him heading into Wimbledon.\n\n\"Everyone has been saying for so long that Jack Draper is going to be the next big thing in British tennis and now it looks like he will be.\n\n\"You forget how much time he has missed so far in his career due to injuries. That has meant he hasn't been able to put the hours in on court compared to other players his age, so he has always been playing catch up.\n\n\"Now he is getting a chance to have a run of matches and we can see what it is going for him.\n\n\"He has been working so hard on the physical side of things gave him extra motivation to put in a seriously good block of work ahead of this season and we are seeing the results now.\n\n\"Travelling with a fitness trainer and a physio is all part of Jack's approach now and he appears to be keeping on top of the physical issues that have held him back in the past.\"", "source": {"uri": "tennis365.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis365.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kevin_palmer@tennis365.com", "name": "Kevin Palmer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halle_(Saale)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Halle (Saale)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Halle (Saale)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_England_Lawn_Tennis_and_Croquet_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Draper_(tennis)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jack Draper (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Queen's Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matteo_Berrettini", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matteo Berrettini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andy Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuttgart", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stuttgart"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Stuttgart"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://images.ps-aws.com/c?url=https%3A%2F%2Fd2me2qg8dfiw8u.cloudfront.net%2Fcontent%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F06%2F29003649%2FLaura-Robson-on-Jannik-Sinner.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9693206", "eventUri": "eng-9693206", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

Meanwhile, in a BBC interview, Jack admitted that to be a professional tennis player, \"you have to be a bit nuts\".\n\nThe tennis star, who enters the Wimbledon tournament ranked as one of the top 30 players in the world, has been drawn against Sweden's Elias Ymer, ranked 206, in the first round, which starts on Monday.\n\nJack showed a precocious tennis talent from an early age, surprising his mother by hitting a ball against the garage door when he was aged just one.\n\nA left-handed player despite doing everything else with his right, he was three when he started tennis coaching with his mum's toddler group at Sutton Tennis and Squash Club.\n\nBy the time Jack was five he was being coached by Justin Sherring at Weybridge Tennis Academy, who would visit his young prot\u00e9g\u00e9 twice a week at Parkside School for tennis lessons.\n\nAssistant head Alex Gainer remembers a magical moment during the school's \"Road to Wimbledon\" tournament, where an eight-year-old Jack outplayed an opponent who was five years older.\n\n\"The whole school and all the teachers [were] watching this one titanic match,\" he said.\n\n\"No one went back to class, everyone finished the game off properly - it was an amazing moment for the school and people to remember, when Jack beat that older boy and he could go on to do good things.\"\n\nJack's success at tennis is very much a family affair.\n\nNicky Draper, herself a junior tennis champion, helps with her son's accounts and his older brother Ben is his manager.\n\nHis maternal grandmother, Brenda, introduced the family to tennis, while grandfather Chris describes himself as \"obsessed\" with Jack's progress. Even Ozzie the dog helps out, according to the family.\n\n\"It's really nice to have people who you love - and you know they have your back at every turn - around you on a day-to-day basis,\" Jack said.\n\n\"That's what keeps the feet on the ground, that's what keeps you motivated and ultimately keeps you sane in the sport.\"\n\nHe added that \"part of the reason I've got to this stage is that I've been fortunate enough to have an older brother I was able to hit with and compete against - have that sibling rivalry.\n\n\"I remember when we were younger the only time we played against each other, he beat me and that just killed me, even though he's four years older than me.\"\n\nJack describes himself as \"calm\" and \"genuine\", adding with a chuckle, \"I think I've always been a good boy\".\n\n\"If you asked the people around me they'd probably say, I'm a little bit nuts. In all honesty, being a professional athlete, especially being a tennis player, you have to be a bit nuts,\" he said.\n\nWhen Jack plays at Wimbledon, he'll be followed closely by aspiring young players attending the schools in Surrey from which he is an alumni.\n\nAlex Balls, deputy head at Reed's School in Cobham, said: \"I think Jack on his day is good enough to beat anyone.

(Perhaps it's because the British Royal Family is invited -- Kate Middleton is a patron of the Lawn Tennis Association -- or because it's the world's first official lawn tennis tournament, founded in 1877.\n\nThe famously strict dress code wasn't enacted until 1963; Wimbledon Championship Entry Conditions clarified the rule to mean \"almost entirely white\" in 1995 and amended it in 2023 to allow female players to wear dark-colored undershorts.\n\n\"Both Grand Slam and WTA rules stipulate recognized tennis attire,\" the official Wimbledon website states. \"Decision on the day as to whether clothing/players' turnout is suitable at discretion of Referee.\"\n\nIn comparison, spectators' dress code is more flexible (that is, if you aren't sitting in the Royal Box). Attendees, though, must uphold a level of etiquette from the stands when game is in play and on the Championship Grounds in general.\n\nAhead of Wimbledon's start -- which streams live on the Tennis Channel from July 1 to July 14 -- read on to learn about the etiquette, rules and guidelines players and spectators must follow!\n\nRelated: Unique Rules You Didn't Know US Open Players and Spectators Must Follow\n\nAll players, both male and female, must be at least 14 years old to compete in Wimbledon. According to the WTA Handbook, \"A player who has not yet reached the date of her 14th birthday may not participate in any Professional Tennis Tournament.\"\n\nThe \"Age Eligibility Rule\" (AER) was first introduced by the Women's Tennis Association Tour more than two decades ago to \"prevent budding tennis stars from crashing and burning,\" an article on Wimbledon's website explains.\n\nThe age rule was adopted in 1995 in response to Jennifer Capriati, a teenage tennis phenomenon who struggled with the pressure of competition at such a young age. (Coco Gauff, who also burst onto the scene at age 13, is a recent star who was restricted by the rule.)\n\n\"The age rule prevents girls aged 13 or younger from competing in professional tournaments, the Olympics and the Fed Cup,\" the article states. Players who are 14 years old are allowed to compete, but are restricted on the number of tournaments they are allowed to enter in a year until they turn 18.\n\n(One workaround: Young players who win tournaments can be rewarded with so-called \"merited increases\" of tournament allowances.)\n\nRelated: The Best Celebrity Reactions from Wimbledon 2023\n\nWhile age restrictions are placed on players, spectators of all ages are welcome to the Wimbledon Grounds. However, a minimum age requirement must be met to enter the courts.\n\nChildren under age 16 must be supervised by a legal guardian who is 18 years or older. Ticketed attendees between ages five and 15 are allowed entry to all courts, while those under age five are not permitted entry into the show courts.\n\nAs simple as it sounds, there are a number of technicalities within the \"wear white\" rule that the competitors playing in Wimbledon must follow. The rule, in fact, refers to all clothing worn on the courts for both practice and matches.\n\nThe clothes themselves must be \"suitable tennis attire\" that is \"almost entirely white,\" the official Wimbledon site reads. \"This applies from the point at which the player enters the court surround.\" (Cream and off-white are not acceptable!)\n\nA single trim of color around the neckline and around sleeve cuffs is permissible as long as it isn't thicker than one centimeter. Any solid mass or panel of coloring is prohibited (the measurement guideline goes for patterns that contain color, too).\n\nSkirts, shorts, tracksuit bottoms, hats, headbands, wristbands and socks must be completely white (allowing for the one cm. of trim). This also goes for sneakers and laces!\n\nUndergarments that are visible under clothing were previously required to be completely white in case of transparency under sweaty clothes; however, in November 2022, an exception was made for female players.\n\nThe amendment states women can now \"wear solid, mid/dark-colored undershorts provided they are no longer than their shorts or skirt.\" The rule was changed to make players who are having their period more comfortable during play.\n\nAhead of Wimbledon 2023, Gauff said the move will \"relieve a lot of stress for me and other girls.\"\n\nRelated: Will Kate Middleton Hand Out Trophies at Wimbledon amid Cancer Treatment? Organizers Are Hopeful\n\nThough there is no rule about colors of clothing for spectators, many do choose to wear white since the tradition is what makes the prestigious tennis tournament so distinct.\n\nWhile there isn't an enforced dress code, spectators should think \"smart casual\" when choosing an outfit. Women typically opt for sundresses or jumpsuits, while men usually sport their best summer suits and panama hats.\n\nHowever, should you be so lucky to nab an invite to sit in one of the 80 velvet-covered seats in the Royal Box -- alongside the likes of Princess Kate, her husband Prince William and their family -- there is a strict dress code. According to the Wimbledon website, attendees are expected to dress \"smart,\" with jackets and ties required for men and hats discouraged for women (as it can obstruct others' view).\n\nThere are no exceptions for celebrities, either! Formula 1 superstar Sir Lewis Hamilton was denied entry into the Royal Box during Wimbledon 2023 because he wasn't wearing a suit and tie. A spokesman for Hamilton said he missed the men's final \"due to an unfortunate misunderstanding of the dress code.\"\n\nSince 1988, the Wimbledon Championships have been the only Grand Slam played on grass, another element that makes this tennis tournament notably distinct from the rest. Therefore, players must wear grass court shoes (reminiscent of cleat-like footwear).\n\nShoes, too, must adhere to the Grand Slam rules. In addition to being predominantly white, shoes with pimples around the outside of the toes are not permitted. Plus, foxing around the toes must be smooth.\n\nAs tempting as it may be to cheer on your favorite player as they're about to serve, spectators must refrain from shouting to avoid distracting the players. Once the point has been played, those in the stands can react, within reaosn.\n\n\"The use of any anti-social, aggressive, annoying (including but not limited to making excess noise on any court when a match is in play) or dangerous behavior, foul, abusive or racist language or obscene gestures\" are a few \"forbidden\" guidelines listed in the Wimbledon Code of Conduct Guide.\n\nTo further reduce distractions, Wimbledon's official 2024 Ticket Holder Handbook lists cell phone rules attendees should abide by while watching matches. \"Switch your phone to silent around the courts and please ensure your flash is disabled,\" it reads.\n\nRelated: Coco Gauff Talks 'Finding a Balance' with Boyfriend and Family amid Busy Tennis Schedule (Exclusive)\n\nJust as ticket holders are to uphold a certain level of etiquette during matches, the players are expected to do the same. The All-England Club Lawn Tennis Club emphasizes good sportsmanship and respect for everyone involved in the Grand Slam.\n\n\"Players and their accredited support team members shall at all times conduct themselves in a sportsmanlike manner and give due regard to the authority of officials and the rights of opponents, spectators and others,\" it states.\n\nOut of respect for the players on the court and surrounding spectators, there are appropriate times when ticket holders should leave their seats during the tournament. According to the official Wimbledon 2024 handbook, spectators should \"enter or leave a court at the change of ends or between matches.\"\n\nHawk-Eye Live, optical line-calling technology introduced to aid in determining whether a ball is ruled in or out, is used at Wimbledon. \"When mistakes are getting made in important moments, then obviously as a player you don't want that,\" Andy Murray told the New York Times.\n\nPlayers have the right to challenge a line call by requesting a review, though they have a limited number of calls each match. The technology largely benefits those who are watching the broadcast, but the players and the chair umpire ultimately must rely on the line judge.\n\nThe official Wimbledon website lists a number of prohibited items visitors must abide by when attending The Grounds. Among them include selfie sticks (or equivalents), oversized hats, wheeled footwear, clothing bearing political statements and large flags to name a few.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiquette", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Etiquette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dress code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Tennis_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's Tennis Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Catherine, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_Channel", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis Channel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Capriati", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Capriati"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawn_Tennis_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawn Tennis Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skirt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Skirt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shorts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shorts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwear", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Underwear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Jean_King_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Billie Jean King Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sneakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neckline", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neckline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cuff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headband", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Headband"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracksuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tracksuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Hamilton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andy Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton,_Ontario", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamilton, Ontario"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hamilton, Ontario"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/5nrgM6JftfDdZMfDMBn5wA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/b439e5203c50363ef799e7ff3b636cc2", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9693206", "eventUri": "eng-9693206", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "dateEnd": "2024-07-14", "textStart": 1439, "textEnd": 1456}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

After she'd won her fourth Grand Slam title and her third French Open, while still just 22 years old. Last month those numbers flipped up to five Grand Slam titles and four French Opens at 23 -- but it's the flirtation with weirdness in late 2023 that is most vital right now as July fades into view and the lawns of SW19 in London emerge from under cover.\n\nAs the tennis season wound down, Swiatek had every reason to stick with the formula that had delivered her to the top of the mountain. Instead, she floated the idea of spending part of her off-season training -- on grass.\n\nShe would not play another grass-court tournament for nearly eight months. Tennis spends the first three months of the season on hard courts. The Australian Open, a classic hard-court event, was a little more than six weeks away.\n\nNone of this stopped visions of tennis on the sport's ultimate grass, at Wimbledon's All England Club, dancing through her mind.\n\n\"I had these ideas,\" Swiatek said last month as she sat next to the French Open trophy in Paris.\n\n(Her coach had told her that these ideas were terrible.)\n\nThen came the flex. \"If I would lose here earlier, maybe I would be able to play two more weeks on grass, and then be a better grass player.\"\n\nAh, the champion's lament -- and in Swiatek's case a very specific one. She's a wondrous player; a generational talent who could quit tomorrow and walk into the Hall of Fame. But the Pole, like so many who have come before her, knows that her career will remain incomplete unless she wins Wimbledon.\n\nIt's a cruel joke that modern tennis has played on everyone.\n\nTake the most mythical tournament on the calendar, the one that all truly great players believe they need to win to solidify that greatness -- and keep it on the quirkiest surface, one that basically no one spends any significant time on growing up, and that takes up slightly more than a month of the tour calendar with little time to prepare for -- that for so many matters more than any other.\n\nAnd if you don't win... Well, no one who enters with a legitimate chance really wants to talk about that possibility.\n\nThis is how it is for Swiatek, and for Jannik Sinner, the 22-year-old world No 1 from Italy and the reigning Australian Open champion. That's all well and good kid, but can you win in the sport's cradle, even though the tennis that happens at Wimbledon bears only a passing resemblance to the tennis that happens the rest of the year?\n\nNo one said life was fair on or off the tennis court.\n\nSinner is doing his darndest to make it happen, winning the warmup tournament in Halle this month to get the feel of grass back in his knees and hands.\n\nAfter winning the French Open, Swiatek prioritized rest.\n\n\"I just want to do normal stuff, like clean up the house,\" Swiatek said in the hours after winning in Paris. Grass remained way down on her priority list. She just wanted to have a home routine \"like making myself breakfast\".\n\nOther sports don't do this. Championships are championships, regardless of location.\n\nSure, every golfer wants to win The Masters, but there are plenty of great players who haven't, players who have won the other major championships in the sport, who (Greg Norman aside) don't lie awake at night feeling tortured, or judged as lesser people, because they don't have that particular trophy on their resume.\n\nIt's more a pity than a professional failing.\n\nAlso, other than the azaleas, golf at Augusta National really does look like golf everywhere else. No one has ever not played golf for eight weeks ahead of The Masters to prepare specifically for the style of golf that Augusta requires, in the way that some tennis players will skip the clay season to focus on trying to win on the grass of Wimbledon.\n\n(Casper Ruud, a clay aficionado, does the opposite. He spends grass season at concerts and on boats, then appears at Wimbledon with the right shoes and a dream.)\n\nIvan Lendl, who won basically everything else, was a dirt dodger. Wimbledon was his great white whale. He never won it, which still gets mentioned almost as often as his eight Grand Slam titles. Both Andy Murray and Roger Federer have done the same late in their careers as well, so they could give themselves the best chance to win where they most wanted to. Carlos Alcaraz, the defending champion, grew up playing on red clay, in a country whose tennis champions are synonymous with the French Open. Yet just days after he had won at Roland Garros for the the first time, he left no doubt about his priorities.\n\n\"I really want to win every title that I go, and I think Wimbledon is even more special.\"\n\nBrad Gilbert, the former player who now coaches Coco Gauff, was living a nice life in California last year, commentating on Grand Slams, coaching promising college players and other people with big bank accounts who could afford him. He even taught Zendaya and her minions in Challengers how to play before they started filming the movie.\n\nAs a coach, Gilbert had been to the mountaintop, helping Andre Agassi and Andy Roddick win Grand Slams and join the No. 1 club. But something gnawed at him.\n\nGilbert had never watched one of his players win Wimbledon from the coaches' box. He craved one more shot to guide a player who might give him that chance to win in the place he called \"the cathedral of tennis\". \"I get so excited every year as I go through the gates,\" Gilbert said in a text message the other day.\n\nThen Team Gauff called last summer -- incidentally while he was at Wimbledon, calling matches for ESPN. She had just lost a tough first round match to Sofia Kenin, and had yet to get past the fourth round at the All England Club. But when it comes to winning on grass, a 125 m.p.h. serve is a pretty good place to start. Gauff, second seed this year, has a favorable draw at the tournament, and she's already sorted out her own white whale by winning the US Open last year.\n\nHow did this happen? How did one tournament played on what is now the oddball tennis surface come to mean so much more than everything else? How did Wimbledon become a kind of force of tennis nature, an idea, and a state of being as much as sports competition?\n\nHere is what Rod Laver, four-time champion, wrote in his 1971 memoir, The Education of a Tennis Player:\n\n\"The actor on Broadway, the singer at La Scala, [and] the dancer at the Bolshoi Theater understand what the tennis player at Wimbledon feels.\"\n\nAnd this:\n\n\"My love for tennis goes to my depths but when the time comes that I can't play the Centre Court at Wimbledon, something vital will have gone out of that love.\"\n\nLaver, it's worth noting, has very nice things to say about the center court at the Australian Open that bears his name, Rod Laver Arena. But not that nice.\n\nCliff Drysdale, the former player and longtime commentator, said Wimbledon was always the place players strived to be at their best even before the era of modern professional tennis that began in 1968 -- but this was for very utilitarian reasons. In the 1950s and 1960s, before there was a computer that ranked players, most of the tournament directors from across the world would gather at Wimbledon to figure out whom to invite to their tournaments.\n\n\"They were just looking for attractive players,\" Drysdale said -- players who could play well and had the kind of flair that would sell tickets in New Jersey or Basel or wherever tennis might be happening during the next year.\n\nThat didn't happen at the other Grand Slams played on grass. Australia was so far from everything else that plenty of players skipped it. The event that was then called the U.S. National Championships took place on what Drysdale described as \"mediocre grass\" at the West Side Tennis Club in New York City. Roland Garros had plenty of prestige but was more of a clay court championship.\n\nAnd so Wimbledon, the oldest of the big tournaments, became the place where if you played well and impressed a handful of tournament directors, they would offer to cover your expenses and pay you $500 under the table to come to their events.\n\nA good showing at Wimbledon set up the rest of the year, or even your life. It also set itself apart with certain perks players did not receive elsewhere. The club picked up players for their matches in Bentleys. There were masseurs in the locker rooms.\n\nOver time, even with the advent of prize money and with the help of some crafty marketing by the sports impresario and agent Mark McCormack, the founder of IMG, Wimbledon became a kind of Holy Grail.\n\nAsh Barty, the Australian former world No 1, used to refer to it as \"the dream\". Her home slam, the Australian Open, was merely \"the goal\". Barty won Wimbledon in 2021 for the first and only time, then won the Australian Open the following January.\n\nShe quit tennis, as world No. 1, two months later.\n\nNick Kyrgios, another Australian, said he would have retired had he beaten Novak Djokovic in the final in 2022; Ons Jabeur, a finalist the past two years, put an image of the Wimbledon trophy on her lock screen on her phone that same year, and had she won the 2023 final against Marketa Vondrousova she would have stopped playing tennis indefinitely and tried to have a baby.\n\nShe lost the final. She kept playing. Having a baby is on hold for now.\n\nWimbledon is also the tournament that made Novak Djokovic want to become a tennis player, with his earliest tennis memory (outside of playing) being watching the Wimbledon final as a small boy in early 1990s Serbia. Its pull remains so strong that he became desperate to rush back from his surgery on June 5, even if that meant a higher risk of another injury that could jeopardize the Olympic Games and the U.S. Open, where he is the defending champion.\n\n\"It is Wimbledon, the tournament that always has been a dream tournament for me when I was a kid,\" he said Saturday. \"The thought of me missing Wimbledon was just not correct.\"\n\nDjokovic eats a few blades of Centre Court grass every time he wins. He's won seven times. That's a lot of grass.\n\nAs for Sinner? \"Grass season is different,\" the Italian said before he left Paris after his semi-final loss at Roland Garros.\n\n\"The preparation is different. You use different muscles.\"\n\nSinner lost in straight sets to Djokovic in the Wimbledon semi-finals last year but said he felt far more comfortable in that match than when he played Djokovic in the quarter-finals in 2022 and lost in five sets after having taken the lead.\n\n\"We see how it goes,\" Sinner said.\n\nIt appears to be going well. Sinner spent last week playing like an action hero, diving into shots and rolling across the grass like Jason Bourne with a tennis racket, then springing to his feet to chase down the next ball.\n\nAbout that grass -- the stuff that helps make Wimbledon the perfectly manicured tennis Shangri-La, where every flower appears set just so and the court feels different under foot than it does at the other grass-court events.\n\nThat's because it is. It's different now than it once was, players and coaches say. Slower than in days of yore, when grass-court tennis was far more prevalent and serving and volleying was so essential for winning. Gavin MacMillan, a coach who specializes in biomechanics and works with Aryna Sabalenka, visited earlier this month with the reigning Australian Open champion and two-time Wimbledon semi-finalist. He said he couldn't believe how slow the courts were.\n\n\"It's like they've turned a grass court into a clay court,\" MacMillan said. Early reports from the tournament, however, are that some of that old speed is renewed. Players and fans alike will have to wait and see what happens come July 1, with the first drop of a Slazenger ball onto the turf.\n\nAny slowness will be music to the ears of Swiatek, a clay court savant whose topspin forehand -- which requires an intricate grip and swing motion -- doesn't work as well off the lower bounce on grass. She lost in the third round in 2022 and then in the quarter-finals last year, but those experiences don't remain in a capsule, she said. Each one builds on the next, as though the Wimbledon of now is itself a grass-court training session for the Wimbledon that will come next year.\n\n\"Every year it's easier for me to adapt to grass,\" Swiatek said. \"I felt like last year I could adapt quicker.\"\n\nAfter winning five Grand Slams in five years, maybe now she will get the one that really, really matters to her. The champion's lament.\n\n(Top photos: Hulton-Deutsch Collection/Corbis; Shi Tang / Getty Images; Design: Eamonn Dalton for The Athletic)", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news",

One of the biggest sporting events in the world and the most prestigious of tennis' four grand slam events, Wimbledon attracts a global audience of more than 50 million people. American tennis great John McEnroe, who won three singles titles and five doubles titles at the event has said: \"There's a certain beauty and majesty to Wimbledon.\"\n\nThere's also a lot of money spent. In 2023, 54 million people watched and streamed the tournament and another 532,651 attended in-person. This generated a record revenue of \u00a3350.1 million (US$442.6 million), and a record operating profit of \u00a381.2 million (US$102.6 million). Leading brands and companies from around the world line-up to sponsor partner with Wimbledon.\n\nHere is game, set, match: three stocks to buy, as they could see a Wimbledon boost.\n\nAmer Sports (NYSE:AS) held its initial public offering in New York in January of this year. The Helsinki, Finland-based company has been a going concern since 1950 and went public at a valuation of $8.7 billion. Since its market debut, AS stock has traded sideways and is down 3% on the year. However, if there's a sporting event that could drive Amer Sports share price higher, it is Wimbledon.\n\nThat's because Amer Sports main product is Wilson tennis rackets. Its main endorsement deal is with tennis legend and 20-time grand slam champion Roger Federer. Look for heavy advertising of Amer Sports' tennis rackets during the British tournament. In addition to its tennis rackets, Amer also makes Arc'teryx running shoes and Atomic skis. But the company is most closely associated with Wilson-branded tennis rackets.\n\nThe biggest sponsor of Wimbledon is British bank Barclays (NYSE:BCS). While the lender has never disclosed the value of its sponsorship, it has been reported as \u00a320 million (US$25 million) annually. Barclays is the official bank of the Wimbledon tournament and this year became the tournament's official Parks and Participation Partner. Like Amer Sports, Barclays heavily advertises and promotes its sponsorship of Wimbledon as the grand slam event is broadcast worldwide.\n\nAs with Amer Sports, Barclays and its stock could use a lift from Wimbledon. The British lender is in the midst of a strategic operational overhaul after reporting a net loss of \u00a3111 million (US$14o million) at the end of last year. The operational overhaul includes cost cuts, asset sales and a reorganization of its business divisions. Going forward, the bank will be divided into five operating divisions, separating the corporate and investment banking sides.\n\nBCS stock is up over 35% this year but has only gained 40% over the last five years.\n\nLike Barclays, clothing retailer Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL) has been a major long-term partner of the Wimbledon tennis tournament. The company has designed the outfits worn by Wimbledon's on-court officials since 2006. Additionally, Ralph Lauren launches an exclusively designed Wimbledon clothing collection each summer and operates a flagship store within the Wimbledon Village at the All England Lawn Tennis Club.\n\nThis is all to say that Ralph Lauren gets great exposure during Wimbledon. The company's association with tennis makes sense given the sport's wealthy atmosphere and reputation for preppy attire. Ralph Lauren this summer is set to get more attention than usual from its ties to sports as it is also designing Team USA's uniforms for the upcoming Summer Olympics being held in Paris, France July 26 to August 11. RL stock has been on an upswing lately, having gained over 40% over the last 12 months.", "source": {"uri": "investorplace.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "InvestorPlace"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joel_baglole@investorplace.com", "name": "Joel Baglole", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amer_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amer Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racket_(sports_equipment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Racket (sports equipment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Initial public offering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barclays", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Barclays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McEnroe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John McEnroe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sneakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc'teryx", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arc'teryx"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ski", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roger Federer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsinki", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Helsinki"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Helsinki"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Finland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Lauren", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ralph Lauren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_England_Lawn_Tennis_and_Croquet_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_banking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Investment banking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Retail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon,_London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon, London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon, London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://investorplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sports-stocks.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9693206", "eventUri": "eng-9693206", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-26", "dateEnd": "2024-08-11", "textStart": 3531, "textEnd": 3551}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-14", "textStart": 72, "textEnd": 79}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

Draper has overtaken Cam Norrie to become British No.1 and is seeded 28th at Wimbledon following a strong run of form.\n\nHe won his first ATP title on June 16 by beating Matteo Berrettini in the Stuttgart final and he rubber-stamped his credentials with a stunning win over Carlos Alcaraz at Queen's Club on June 20. Draper has long been touted for the top after taking a set off Novak Djokovic at Wimbledon in 2020 and, having overcome his injury struggles of 2023, Robson is excited about what he can do over the next few weeks.\n\n\"I feel like I've been talking about Jack for years and years from when he was 15,\" Robson told Mirror Sport while speaking on behalf of the Vodafone Play Your Way to Wimbledon campaign. \"When I first saw him play I was like 'this kid is going to be so good'. He's got so many weapons to his game, he works so hard on the physicality of things, because he used to get so many injuries and struggled to play consistently across the ATP Tour.\n\n\"Now he's doing that, the results are going to come because he's a great player. He's been someone that everyone thinks will be in the top 10 in no time because you still look at him and think there's a world of improvement in the next few years as he gets stronger.\n\n\"He won his first [ATP] title last week [at Stuttgart]. He'd played in a couple of finals before, so he was always knocking on the door. Grass is an amazing surface for him because he's got the massive lefty serve and the lefty forehand.\n\n\"I am so excited for Jack but I think it's always going to be tougher going into a best-of-five situation for him because in the past that's where he's lost a bit of confidence in himself, when his body has started to feel a bit sore.\"\n\nDraper faces Swedish qualifier Elias Ymer in the first round, but taking the mantle of Britain's biggest hope at Wimbledon is not easy, given the expectation and scrutiny that comes with the tag. But world No.1 and Wimbledon's defending champion Alcaraz said his \"mentality is a bit better\" after being beaten at Queen's and Robson thinks he has the attitude to cope.\n\n\"He was a great junior, he's had years of getting to this level, it's not been a quick journey for him at all. He's played a lot of Challengers in his life, won a lot of smaller tournaments and then it's been slow and steady progress in the rankings.\n\n\"He's going to be seeded at Wimbledon and it really feels like he's earned that spot because he's been showing up and delivering results week-in, week-out. I think he'll be fine with the pressure. He's so happy with the No.1 British spot and he knows he's got to work hard to keep it with the others chasing him.

Ahead of this year's Wimbledon, ATPTour.com sat down with Medvedev to chat about his favourite memories at The Championships.\n\nWhat is your first memory of watching Wimbledon?\n\nIt would be Sharapova winning Wimbledon. I do not remember the year [2004], but I was really young. And she won it when she was like 17 or 18. So that was a huge story. I'm not even sure if she was seeded, and I think she beat Serena. I was too young, I don't remember exactly, but it was huge. I remember watching it. It was fun.\n\nWhat is your first memory of playing Wimbledon?\n\nPlaying Wimbledon as a junior. It was my first main draw of a junior Slam. The emotions that I had would not compare to right now, they were higher because I was more tired. I was more stressed. I had more adrenaline. Now, I'm kind of used to what I'm doing. At the time, it was something huge for me to be there, to see all the pros close to me, practising, getting ready for their match. It was an unbelievable feeling and I still remember how you arrive, you go on the court. I won the first match. I lost second round and there were big, big emotions.\n\nWhat is your favourite Wimbledon tradition and why?\n\nStrawberries are really good at Wimbledon, so I would say that's definitely up there as one of my favorites. It's very good. Strawberries are healthy if you don't exaggerate and they're really, really tasty, so that's good. I think they don't have as many [traditions] as we tend to think but all of them are pretty good and I feel like have their meaning, like strawberries.\n\nDo you have a favourite court outside of Centre Court?\n\nCourt No. 1 for me because I don't think I ever lost there. For whatever reason, I play pretty good there. It was my first win after being two sets to love down against Cilic. Last year I only played on this court and I think on Court No. 2 once. I played only on these courts last year until semi-finals, so I love it.\n\nWhat is the greatest moment you have had at Wimbledon?\n\nI haven't won it and since I want to do better than semi-finals, it would be beating Wawrinka. It was my first Grand Slam victory and beating Stan, who just came after final of Roland Garros, that was a huge, huge win for me, huge emotions and part of my tennis journey. That was the first win where I [was like], 'Okay, I can beat even guys like Stan' and that was pretty big for me.\"", "source": {"uri": "atptour.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ATP Tour"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Medvedev", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Daniil Medvedev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Tennis_Professionals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association of Tennis Professionals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_England_Lawn_Tennis_and_Croquet_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Centre Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Real", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Real", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.atptour.com/-/media/images/news/2024/06/27/20/36/medvedev--my-wimbledon-2024.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9693206", "eventUri": "eng-9693206", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

No thanks, we'll stick to boys and girls says Wimbledon", "body": "Change comes slowly at the All England Club, which will not follow the other Grand Slams by scrapping the gender-specific titles\n\nThe slogan for this year's Wimbledon is \"Always like never before\", a nod to the All England Club's annual balancing act in modernising while maintaining some of the traditions it holds so proud. But while the club and the tournament are expanding all the time, with the proposed development on the grounds of the old golf club across the road expected to be approved later this summer, some things stay the same.\n\nUnlike the other three Grand Slams - the Australian Open, French Open and the US Open - Wimbledon persists in using the gender-specific terms ball \"boys\" and \"girls\". The US Open, which uses people of all ages for the role, calls them \"ball crew\" while it's \"ballkids\" in Melbourne and Paris. The All England Club, which is proud of having what it feels are the best ball boys and girls in the business, said on Saturday that there are no plans to change their titles.\n\nWimbledon has not been afraid to change over the years, with modernisation including the building of a roof over the two main courts. The Centre Court roof was installed in 2009 and the new No 1 Court opened in 2019. However, like a ship turning around, Wimbledon tends to be agonisingly slow to enact change, sometimes only doing so when criticised.\n\nWimbledon was the last of the four Grand Slams, along with the French, to award equal prize money for women and men, in 2007, which only came about after Venus Williams wrote an open letter in the Times the previous year, asking for them to catch up with the times. \"The message I like to convey to women and girls across the globe is that there is no glass ceiling,\" Williams wrote. \"My fear is that Wimbledon is loudly and clearly sending the opposite message.\"\n\nAfter a New York Times article in 2018, Wimbledon stopped the practice of referring to players on court as Mr, Miss or Mrs the following year. And it's only two years since they finally removed the \"Mrs\" before female cham\u00adpions' names on the honour roll in the clubhouse. Another rule that shows no sign of changing is the one concerning players' clothing. While Wimbledon introduced a new rule in 2023 allowing women to wear coloured undershorts, the players still have to wear \"almost entirely white\".", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "simon_cambers@theguardian.com", "name": "Simon Cambers", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_England_Lawn_Tennis_and_Croquet_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_boy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ball boy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Centre Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Venus Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Melbourne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Melbourne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/Clubs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6aba0132646f113917be960414b2870f5dd9ecf/0_62_5352_3212/master/5352.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=ad22d8fb379516371b12815582b9f847", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9693206", "eventUri": "eng-9693206", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

(Perhaps it's because the British Royal Family is invited -- Kate Middleton is a patron of the Lawn Tennis Association -- or because it's the world's first official lawn tennis tournament, founded in 1877.\n\nThe famously strict dress code wasn't enacted until 1963; Wimbledon Championship Entry Conditions clarified the rule to mean \"almost entirely white\" in 1995 and amended it in 2023 to allow female players to wear dark-colored undershorts.\n\n\"Both Grand Slam and WTA rules stipulate recognized tennis attire,\" the official Wimbledon website states. \"Decision on the day as to whether clothing/players' turnout is suitable at discretion of Referee.\"\n\nIn comparison, spectators' dress code is more flexible (that is, if you aren't sitting in the Royal Box). Attendees, though, must uphold a level of etiquette from the stands when game is in play and on the Championship Grounds in general.\n\nAhead of Wimbledon's start -- which streams live on the Tennis Channel from July 1 to July 14 -- read on to learn about the etiquette, rules and guidelines players and spectators must follow!\n\nAll players, both male and female, must be at least 14 years old to compete in Wimbledon. According to the WTA Handbook, \"A player who has not yet reached the date of her 14th birthday may not participate in any Professional Tennis Tournament.\"\n\nThe \"Age Eligibility Rule\" (AER) was first introduced by the Women's Tennis Association Tour more than two decades ago to \"prevent budding tennis stars from crashing and burning,\" an article on Wimbledon's website explains.\n\nThe age rule was adopted in 1995 in response to Jennifer Capriati, a teenage tennis phenomenon who struggled with the pressure of competition at such a young age. (Coco Gauff, who also burst onto the scene at age 13, is a recent star who was restricted by the rule.)\n\n\"The age rule prevents girls aged 13 or younger from competing in professional tournaments, the Olympics and the Fed Cup,\" the article states. Players who are 14 years old are allowed to compete, but are restricted on the number of tournaments they are allowed to enter in a year until they turn 18.\n\n(One workaround: Young players who win tournaments can be rewarded with so-called \"merited increases\" of tournament allowances.)\n\nWhile age restrictions are placed on players, spectators of all ages are welcome to the Wimbledon Grounds. However, a minimum age requirement must be met to enter the courts.\n\nChildren under age 16 must be supervised by a legal guardian who is 18 years or older. Ticketed attendees between ages five and 15 are allowed entry to all courts, while those under age five are not permitted entry into the show courts.\n\nAs simple as it sounds, there are a number of technicalities within the \"wear white\" rule that the competitors playing in Wimbledon must follow. The rule, in fact, refers to all clothing worn on the courts for both practice and matches.\n\nThe clothes themselves must be \"suitable tennis attire\" that is \"almost entirely white,\" the official Wimbledon site reads. \"This applies from the point at which the player enters the court surround.\" (Cream and off-white are not acceptable!)\n\nA single trim of color around the neckline and around sleeve cuffs is permissible as long as it isn't thicker than one centimeter. Any solid mass or panel of coloring is prohibited (the measurement guideline goes for patterns that contain color, too).\n\nSkirts, shorts, tracksuit bottoms, hats, headbands, wristbands and socks must be completely white (allowing for the one cm. of trim). This also goes for sneakers and laces!\n\nUndergarments that are visible under clothing were previously required to be completely white in case of transparency under sweaty clothes; however, in November 2022, an exception was made for female players.\n\nThe amendment states women can now \"wear solid, mid/dark-colored undershorts provided they are no longer than their shorts or skirt.\" The rule was changed to make players who are having their period more comfortable during play.\n\nAhead of Wimbledon 2023, Gauff said the move will \"relieve a lot of stress for me and other girls.\"\n\nThough there is no rule about colors of clothing for spectators, many do choose to wear white since the tradition is what makes the prestigious tennis tournament so distinct.\n\nWhile there isn't an enforced dress code, spectators should think \"smart casual\" when choosing an outfit. Women typically opt for sundresses or jumpsuits, while men usually sport their best summer suits and panama hats.\n\nHowever, should you be so lucky to nab an invite to sit in one of the 80 velvet-covered seats in the Royal Box -- alongside the likes of Princess Kate, her husband Prince William and their family -- there is a strict dress code. According to the Wimbledon website, attendees are expected to dress \"smart,\" with jackets and ties required for men and hats discouraged for women (as it can obstruct others' view).\n\nThere are no exceptions for celebrities, either! Formula 1 superstar Sir Lewis Hamilton was denied entry into the Royal Box during Wimbledon 2023 because he wasn't wearing a suit and tie. A spokesman for Hamilton said he missed the men's final \"due to an unfortunate misunderstanding of the dress code.\"\n\nSince 1988, the Wimbledon Championships have been the only Grand Slam played on grass, another element that makes this tennis tournament notably distinct from the rest. Therefore, players must wear grass court shoes (reminiscent of cleat-like footwear).\n\nShoes, too, must adhere to the Grand Slam rules. In addition to being predominantly white, shoes with pimples around the outside of the toes are not permitted. Plus, foxing around the toes must be smooth.\n\nAs tempting as it may be to cheer on your favorite player as they're about to serve, spectators must refrain from shouting to avoid distracting the players. Once the point has been played, those in the stands can react, within reaosn.\n\n\"The use of any anti-social, aggressive, annoying (including but not limited to making excess noise on any court when a match is in play) or dangerous behavior, foul, abusive or racist language or obscene gestures\" are a few \"forbidden\" guidelines listed in the Wimbledon Code of Conduct Guide.\n\nTo further reduce distractions, Wimbledon's official 2024 Ticket Holder Handbook lists cell phone rules attendees should abide by while watching matches. \"Switch your phone to silent around the courts and please ensure your flash is disabled,\" it reads.\n\nJust as ticket holders are to uphold a certain level of etiquette during matches, the players are expected to do the same. The All-England Club Lawn Tennis Club emphasizes good sportsmanship and respect for everyone involved in the Grand Slam.\n\n\"Players and their accredited support team members shall at all times conduct themselves in a sportsmanlike manner and give due regard to the authority of officials and the rights of opponents, spectators and others,\" it states.\n\nOut of respect for the players on the court and surrounding spectators, there are appropriate times when ticket holders should leave their seats during the tournament. According to the official Wimbledon 2024 handbook, spectators should \"enter or leave a court at the change of ends or between matches.\"\n\nHawk-Eye Live, optical line-calling technology introduced to aid in determining whether a ball is ruled in or out, is used at Wimbledon. \"When mistakes are getting made in important moments, then obviously as a player you don't want that,\" Andy Murray told the New York Times.\n\nPlayers have the right to challenge a line call by requesting a review, though they have a limited number of calls each match. The technology largely benefits those who are watching the broadcast, but the players and the chair umpire ultimately must rely on the line judge.\n\nThe official Wimbledon website lists a number of prohibited items visitors must abide by when attending The Grounds. Among them include selfie sticks (or equivalents), oversized hats, wheeled footwear, clothing bearing political statements and large flags to name a few.", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiquette", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Etiquette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dress code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Tennis_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's Tennis Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catherine, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_Channel", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis Channel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Capriati", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Capriati"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawn_Tennis_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawn Tennis Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skirt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Skirt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shorts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shorts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwear", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Underwear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Jean_King_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Billie Jean King Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sneakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neckline", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neckline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cuff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headband", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Headband"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracksuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tracksuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Hamilton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andy Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton,_Ontario", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamilton, Ontario"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hamilton, Ontario"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://people.com/thmb/v7YEGp9RSRgDpAXYr4t2ZKNJzxA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(697x162:699x164)/Cori-Gauff-returns-against-Slovakias-Magdalena-Rybarikova-during-Wimbledon-Championships-062824-79a7ccab15c3456a9d3f2b0a97453cb4.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9693206", "eventUri": "eng-9693206", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "dateEnd": "2024-07-14", "textStart": 1325, "textEnd": 1342}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

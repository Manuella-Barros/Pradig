The president's lackluster display onstage has called into question whether he is the right presidential candidate to help the party defeat Trump. After a lengthy meeting between House Democrats earlier on Tuesday, the answer is still unclear and there is no consensus.\n\n\"Insiders we spoke with over the weekend said they expected a 'deluge' of Democratic congressional defections by Monday,\" Cook Political Report Editor-in-Chief Amy Walter said in her analysis. \"As of Tuesday morning, those desertions have amounted to no more than a trickle.

That possibility looks remote as of this writing.\n\n\"We can't wave away the uncertainty of this moment, but we can try to soberly assess where things stand today, and where they are likely to go from here,\" Walter continued.\n\nTrump widened his lead over Biden by 6 percentage points nationwide following the first presidential debate of the cycle. In a poll from June 30 to July 2, the former president's lead narrowed to an average of 4 points across Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan, Arizona, Wisconsin, and Nevada.\n\nAccording to Cook Political Report, Trump has over a 3-point lead in Arizona, Georgia, and Nevada and Biden has less than a percentage point lead in Wisconsin and Michigan. In Pennsylvania, Trump holds a 0.7-point lead.\n\nWalter noted that given the narrow margins across the electorate, even a 2-point shift has significant implications for the presidential race.\n\n\"For example, if Trump were to win the national popular vote by three points, it would be a seven-point improvement from his 2020 showing,\" Walter wrote. \"In other words, any state or district that Biden carried by eight points or less would be competitive.\"\n\nDemocratic lawmakers, pundits, and strategists have sounded the alarm over whether Biden is the party's best path forward to retaking the House, maintaining a majority in the Senate, and keeping the White House. Leaving the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee headquarters today, several House Democrats declined to offer any insight into whether the Democratic conference is solidly behind behind.\n\nOne member, Rep. Glenn Ivey (D-MD), said there is a time limit on how long disunity within the caucus can last.\n\n\"I think it's gotta wrap up by the convention,\" Ivey said. \"But, you know, hopefully, we'll be able to sort of nail this topic down sooner rather than later.\"\n\nAs Walter noted in her analysis, Democrats were hoping the debate at the end of June would give the party a chance to highlight Trump's misgivings and Biden's administrative record. Since then, Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill have found a moment of relief as eyes and ears are locked in on Democrats over the state of Biden's candidacy.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nSome Democrats have argued this rhetoric and calls from colleagues for Biden to step down will only weaken the president and the party further.\n\n\"We do need to turn the attention back to Trump,\" Rep. Jared Huffman (D-CA) said. \"And it's important, I mean, there comes a time where the family conversation has to refocus on winning.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news",

As it stands right now, Trump has a 3.3-point lead in the RealClearPolitics national average.\n\nThe Electoral College, however, is a different story. While Trump generally had the lead in the battleground states, his lead was sometimes razor-thin. For example, Trump and Biden were tied in Wisconsin before the debate. Now, Trump has a 2.2-point lead in the RCP average for the state -- his highest lead during the campaign. Biden's position has become worse all around, and a new update from the Cook Political Report is absolutely devastating for Biden.\n\n\"The notion that the presidential [race] is a Toss Up was a stretch even before the debate,\" Dave Wasserman of the Cook Political Report wrote in a post on X/Twitter. \"Today, Trump has a clear advantage over Biden and a much more plausible path to 270 Electoral votes.\"\n\nRelated: Trump Made His First Misstep in Weeks\n\n\"That leaves three states in the 'toss up' column: Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin,\" Amy Walter explains in the report. \"At present, Pennsylvania is the most vulnerable to a flip toward Trump. Biden has trailed in polling there since the spring by anywhere from 2-3 points. Since the debate, however, public and private polling has shown Trump opening up a bigger lead.\"\n\nShe added, \"But we want to see some more post-debate polling in the battleground states before we shift these three midwestern states.\"\n\nThat shift could be inevitable. Some polls put Trump's lead in Pennsylvania, a must-win state, by double-digits.\n\nDuring an appearance on Jen Psaki's MSNBC show, Walter also pointed out that there has been a significant shift of six points toward Republicans since 2020. This shift has put more states that were once close or leaning Democrat into play for the upcoming elections.\n\nBased on the Cook Political Report's assessment, Trump now has 268 electoral votes in his column, compared to Biden's 226, once again creating the scenario where Biden would have to win Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin to get to 270, while Trump would only have to win one of them.

Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, all of which Trump is presently leading in.\n\nOn top of that, there's terrific news in Pennsylvania since the debate.\n\nPrivate polling from Democrat and Republican sources revealed that former President Donald Trump has extended his lead in Pennsylvania from 4 percentage points to 10 over President Joe Biden following their June 27 debate in Atlanta.\n\nCook is waiting for more polling before they do any moves on Pennsylvania, Michigan, or Wisconsin from \"toss-up.\"\n\nCook Political's Amy Walter also explains how the environment has shifted six points

And he's trying to prove that he has the fortitude to defeat Trump.\n\nThe debate was a major setback for Biden, who at 81 is the oldest president in the nation's history. His halting delivery and stumbling answers at the showdown in Atlanta sparked widespread panic in the Democratic Party and a rising tide of public and private calls from within his own party for him to step aside as its 2024 standard-bearer.\n\nBIDEN TELLS CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS THAT CALLING FOR HIM TO DROP OUT 'ONLY HELPS TRUMP AND HURTS US'\n\nSince the debate, seven House Democrats have publicly called on Biden to end his re-election bid, and a growing number of both House and Senate Democrats have publicly and privately warned that the president will lose to Trump in November.\n\nBut Biden, at rallies and fundraising events since the debate, has repeatedly emphasized that he's staying in the race.\n\nIn a letter sent to congressional Democrats on Monday as they returned from the July 4th holiday recess, the president reiterated that he's \"firmly committed to staying in this race\" and argued that \"the question of how to move forward has been well-aired for over a week now. And it is time for it to end. We have one job. And that is to beat Donald Trump.\"\n\n\"Any weakening of resolve or lack of clarity about the task ahead only helps Trump and hurts us,\" the president added. \"It is time to come together, move forward as a unified party, and defeat Donald Trump.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWalter, in her analysis on the ratings switch, wrote that \"plenty of nervous down-ballot Democrats and donors are hoping that team Biden, confronted with worsening poll numbers and an aggressively antagonistic press corps, will see the writing on the wall and gracefully announce his exit from the contest. That possibility looks remote as of this writing.\"\n\nThe move by the Cook Report is the second major shift by a leading nonpartisan political handicapper in the wake of the debate.\n\nLarry Sabato's Crystal Ball last week moved Michigan from \"Leans Democrat\" to \"Toss-up.\" Additionally, Minnesota was shifted from \"Likely Democrat\" to \"Leans Democrat.\"\n\n\"President Biden's debate performance was so bad that it has forced us to reassess some of our assumptions about the race,\" Sabato Crystal Ball forecaster Kyle Kondik wrote in explaining the shift of the two states.

Rishi Kumar told CNN host Laura Coates Tuesday night that Democrats could suffer losses in House and Senate races if Biden remains on the ticket.\n\n\"If Biden ends up running, potentially the Democrats could lose the Senate, the House, and the White House and it's going to be a bloodbath,\" Kumar told Coates. \"Blue states that we have held for many decades might potentially turn red. Trump is doing well when he runs against Biden in those states and then the swing states, the battleground states, they are looking terrible.\"\n\nWATCH:\n\n\"So at this point, all the polling indicates that Trump is going to win,\" Kumar continued.\n\nThe Cook Political Report, a leading nonpartisan campaign monitor, moved Arizona, Georgia, and Nevada from \"toss-up\" to \"lean Republican\" in an update that also saw Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District, Minnesota, and New Hampshire from \"likely Democratic\" to \"lean Democratic\" since the July 27 debate. An Ipsos poll released July 2 showed that only former First Lady Michelle Obama could beat former President Trump.\n\nKumar said that Democrats needed to find \"the best\" alternative to Biden to challenge Trump in the November election.\n\n\"We need to send the best and the brightest out there to run against Trump,\" Kumar said. \"He's beatable, but we need to send somebody who has the energy of a commander-in-chief. Here in Silicon Valley, we have had great leaders and companies thrive because of good leaders.\"\n\n\"At this point, it's debatable if Biden can lead our nation,\" Kumar continued. \"Carrying the nuclear football is a huge deal and we're not sure right now that Biden is going to be able to do his job.\"\n\nTrump leads Biden by 5.4% in Arizona, 4% in Georgia, 0.6% in Michigan, 5.2% in Nevada, 5.8% in North Carolina, 5.3% in Pennsylvania and 2.2% in Wisconsin in head-to-head matchups, according to averages of polls by RealClearPolling.

That's his line when ABC News' George Stephanopoulos interviewed him, and it only exacerbated the ongoing issues with the president, his messaging, and his overall re-election effort. It's simply false, much like the lie that got blown up recently about his trip to the neurologist -- a narrative that has gone through more surgeries than a transgender person. Yet, it's the president's deep denial that anything is wrong and that his June 27 debate with Donald Trump, universally seen as a disaster, would pass.\n\nIt hasn't. Biden admits he was terrible but didn't lose because Trump didn't gain ground. Yes and no on that front -- by losing supporters, Joe, that's Trump's gain. And the national polls aren't the best gauge either. I understand this camp uses it because it's the only good news this campaign can ship off to donors. Even in those polls, Biden is trailing Trump. Biden was already losing to the former president pre-debate in the battleground states. It's even worse now. Amy Walter of the Cook Political Report did a deep dive into the main swing states and found what we've already known -- that Biden is heading toward an Electoral College wipeout if these numbers hold. In short, six key states have become more Trump-friendly, but Biden thinks he can still win with one-third of brain capacity.\n\nWisconsin is the only state where things seem close between the two candidates, whereas Pennsylvania should induce extreme panic among Biden staffers. It's the state most likely to flip out of the must-win trio, including Michigan and Wisconsin. Biden must sweep. One loss and the game is over. With Pennsylvania gone, it's truly over. Trump added to his lead over Biden by between four and ten points based on private polling by Democrats and Republicans.\n\nWalter added that the spotlight on Trump's woes has been severely reduced due to the recent Supreme Court rulings on immunity and the January 6 charges concerning obstruction of an official proceeding via the Fischer decision. Biden now will be subjected to constant and aggressive reporting about his health, one where Democrats in down-ballot races may be getting a taste of what Republicans went through when the media chased down GOP lawmakers for comments about Trump's social media activity. Democrats will be haggled about Biden's mental fitness and whether he should drop out:\n\nThe week before the June 27 debate, according to the RealClearPolitics two-way national average, Biden trailed Trump by just over a point. Today, Trump leads the national vote by three points.\n\nPost-debate, there's been only one public nonpartisan survey of battleground states released. The Bloomberg News/Morning Consult tracking poll of those six battleground states plus North Carolina, found Trump ahead of Biden by two points, 47% to 45%, \"the smallest gap since the poll began last October.\"\n\nHowever, private polling from both Democratic and Republican sources finds Trump gaining a bit of ground -- or holding steady -- in the battleground states. In one set of surveys shared with me, Trump expanded his lead in Pennsylvania from four points to 10 points. A just-released AARP poll in Wisconsin found Trump ahead of Biden by five points, 50%-45%. Wisconsin has been one of the few states where Biden has managed to keep the race very close.\n\nIt's also true that the concerns being expressed by the so-called 'elite' class have been baked in with many voters. Biden's anemic job approval rating isn't just about his performance on policies like inflation or immigration; much of it is driven by worries about his age and stamina. And yet, many of those frustrated voters (a.k.a. \"Meh\" voters) were supporting Biden pre-debate and have not necessarily flocked to Trump post-debate.\n\nHowever, given our closely divided electorate, even a small two-point shift is significant. For example, if Trump were to win the national popular vote by three points, it would be a seven-point improvement from his 2020 showing. In other words, any state or district that Biden carried by eight points or less would be competitive.\n\nAs such, it's hard to justify keeping states that Biden carried by less than eight points, like Minnesota, New Hampshire and Nebraska's 2nd District, in Likely Democrat. They now move to Lean Democrat.\n\nIt's also clear that Trump's outside-the-margin leads in states like Arizona, Georgia and Nevada are currently safe, leading us to move all three from Toss Up to Lean Republican.\n\nThat leaves three states in the Toss Up column: Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. At present, Pennsylvania is the most vulnerable to a flip toward Trump. Biden has trailed in polling there since the spring by anywhere from 2-3 points. Since the debate, however, public and private polling has shown Trump opening up a bigger lead. Pennsylvania is also the only state in which Trump's SuperPAC, MAGA Inc., has spent substantially on advertising. According to data from AdImpact, between January and May, the SuperPAC has spent over $10 million on advertising in the state.\n\nWalter on voter enthusiasm:\n\nFor months now, polls have shown Republicans with an enthusiasm advantage. In addition, the Cook Political Report's May Swing State Project poll, conducted by BSG and GS Strategies, found that 18% of Biden's 2020 voters in the seven key battleground states were uncommitted to him this time around.\n\nOne thing that set the uncommitted voters apart from Biden loyalists was the fact that they don't think this election matters all that much. While 83% of Biden loyalists say this will be \"more important than other elections in their lifetime,\" just 56% of defectors feel similarly. Moreover, just 58% of these potential defectors think it is \"very important\" that they vote this year, compared to 85% of committed Biden voters.\n\nThe Biden team has argued that though these voters may be disengaged now, once they are made aware of the high-stakes of this election, they will ultimately turnout for the president. However, Biden's weak debate performance calls into question whether he can effectively deliver that message to these already disenfranchised and skeptical voters.\n\nWalter also said that Harris isn't a riskier bet than Biden, but there are no advantages to her taking the top spot on the ticket either. There's nothing to suggest that she's a better candidate. Like Joe, she's also unpopular and tends to wither when under the spotlight for too long. This woman's campaign faded before Tom Steyer's in the 2020 primaries. She's not well-liked by voters, and she's been a trainwreck in public events. Also, like Biden, she cannot deviate from the script or talking points. Trump's main goal: getting Biden's former supporters to stay home on Election Day:\n\nNational polls taken in the wake of the June 27 debate suggest that unaffiliated voters haven't flocked en masse to Trump, but they've defected from Biden. Meanwhile, partisans have barely moved. In other words, Trump's ceiling remains somewhat firm. But, Trump is still running stronger than he was in 2020 with traditionally Democratic constituencies like Black and Latino voters. He doesn't need to move many of these voters into his camp to flip those Sun Belt states back into the red column. Moreover, Trump doesn't need to win over disappointed or disillusioned anti-Trump voters; he just needs them to stay home.\n\nHence, why has the former president allowed the Democrats to do all the heavy lifting when it comes to ripping apart Biden and creating fractures within the base over the fallout from the June 27 debate? This discipline is a new development, one that Democrats probably weren't expecting and are finding frustrating since the former president is offering no relief to the beleaguered leftist party. So, on both counts, Biden is wrong and looks absurd when saying that Trump didn't gain anything and that this race is a toss-up. We're looking at a very good night for Republicans if this holds. Biden may want to stop talking about the debate and move on. Sorry, there are too many questions about your fitness, especially since you and your staff can't explain these trips to a neurologist specializing in Parkinson's Disease.", "source": {"uri":

But those efforts have done little to slow his tumbling poll numbers, which on Tuesday prompted the nonpartisan Cook Political Report to move three swing states -- Arizona, Georgia, and Nevada -- into the \"Lean Republican\" column.\n\nWhile Biden has repeatedly characterized the polls, which overestimated the Democratic nominee's support in 2020, as inaccurate, many Democratic officials have told reporters that they are waiting to see more post-debate surveys and Biden's performance at a Thursday press conference before deciding where they stand on his candidacy. Seven Democratic lawmakers have already made public calls for Biden to withdraw from the race, with others, like Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., raising serious concerns without saying explicitly that he has to go.\n\n\"Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election, and maybe win it by a landslide, and take with him the Senate and the House,\" Bennet told CNN's Kaitlan Collins on Tuesday. \"So for me, this isn't a question about polling. It's not a question about politics. It's a moral question about the future of our country.\"\n\n\"The White House, in the time since that disastrous debate, I think, has done nothing to really demonstrate that they have a plan to win this election,\" he continued.\n\nBennett made his comments just a few hours after House and Senate Democrats discussed Biden's troubled candidacy in their respective caucus meetings, disbanding with plenty of worry but little sense of clarity. One Democrat in the room told reporters that the meeting felt like a \"funeral\" for Biden, with lawmakers \"moving through the stages of grief.\" Many Democrats privately believe that Biden should withdraw to avert electoral disaster for the party, but the president's stubborn refusal has led them to believe that there is little they can do.\n\n\"Whether or not I have concerns is besides the point. He is going to be our nominee and we all have to support him,\" said Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., the lead Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee who reportedly said in a meeting on Sunday that it was time for Biden to step aside.\n\nBiden still retains public support from lawmakers across both Democratic caucuses, from party stalwarts and longtime supporters like Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., to progressive \"Squad\" member Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.\n\n\"He is our nominee, he is not leaving this race, he is in this race, and I support him,\" Ocasio-Cortez told reporters. \"Now what I think is critically important right now is that we focus on what it takes to win in November, because he is running against Donald Trump, who is a man with 34 felony convictions, that has committed 34 felony crimes, and not a single Republican has asked for Donald Trump to not be the nominee.\"\n\nThe Biden campaign has touted the positive response he has received from members of the Congressional Black Caucus and Black voters at campaign stops, even though some pre-debate polls show that he is performing worse with Black voters than any recent Democratic candidate, and that a plurality of Democratic voters, and up to three-quarters of all registered voters, now think Biden should step aside. Biden also trails Trump in most swing state polling averages, including Arizona, Georgia and Nevada -- which the Cook Political Report now rates as favoring Trump -- as well as the \"Blue wall\" states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, with the latter most at risk of slipping away next, per the report.\n\nBiden, presenting himself as the best candidate to defeat Trump in 2024, has been warning Americans of the dangers that Trump poses to American democracy and the well-being of its citizens. But it is precisely the high stakes of the election that has fueled calls for him to step aside for the good of the country, or for Democratic voters and officials to thwart his reported plans to run out the clock until the Democratic National Convention.\n\n\"They need to tell him that his defiance threatens to hand victory to Mr. Trump. They need to tell him that he is embarrassing himself and endangering his legacy. He needs to hear, plain and clear, that he is no longer an effective spokesman for his own priorities,\" wrote the New York Times Editorial Board in an op-ed published Monday. \"The party needs a candidate who can stand up to Mr. Trump. It needs a nominee who can present Americans with a compelling alternative to Mr. Trump's bleak vision for America.\"\n\nPotential Democratic replacements, such as Vice President Kamala Harris, have a mixed-to-positive showing in polls that compare their standing to Biden's, but some political analysts have stressed that unlike Biden, his would-be replacements have room to boost their name recognition and energy to bring the case against Trump on the campaign trail. Others are wary that they might not bring the salvation that some Democrats are hoping for.\n\nHarris \"is not a riskier bet than Biden,\" wrote Cook Political Report's Amy Walter, but \"there's no guarantee she'll be a stronger one.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type":

So when they post their most current analysis of shifts in voter tendencies, it's typically worth paying attention. This week they delivered some additional bad news for Joe Biden and the Democrats. There is indeed some movement afoot among American voters and it's almost all heading in the same direction, particularly in the swing states. They have moved Arizona, Georgia, and Nevada from their \"toss-up\" category to \"lean Republican.\" Additionally, New Hampshire, Minnesota, and Nebraska have shifted from \"likely Democrat\" to \"lean Democrat.\" (Daily Caller)\n\nThe Cook Political Report on Tuesday updated its projections for key swing states in the 2024 presidential race following June's debate, and the changes signal that President Joe Biden may be in trouble.\n\nOne of America's leading nonpartisan election and campaign watchers, Cook Political Report's updates show that key jurisdictions -- including crucial swing states like Georgia, Arizona and Nevada -- are currently breaking for former President Donald Trump with about four months to go until Election Day. Cook's updates reflect that some voters are leaving Biden behind in the wake of the president's lackluster and disjointed performance at the June 27 debate against Trump, which has spurred significant questions about Biden's mental acuity and ability to serve as president.\n\nTuesday's updates included shifting Arizona, Georgia and Nevada from \"toss up\" states to \"lean Republican.\" Elsewhere in the country, New Hampshire, Minnesota and Nebraska's second district have all moved from \"likely Democrat\" to \"lean Democrat.\"\n\nBefore breaking this down a bit more, it's worth taking a quick look at the Cook Political Report's history of accuracy. They have analyzed more than 10,000 elections dating back to 1984. Across that span of time, they haven't hit 100% accuracy, but they aren't far from it. In every district and state where they rated a race \"Solid D\" or \"Solid R,\" the candidate from that party won. Their success rate for \"Likely\" ratings for either party has come at a margin of more than 200 to 1. Even in the \"Lean\" category, they called races successfully for Republicans 444 out of 463 times. With Democrats, they nailed it 470 out of 512 times. In the \"Toss-up\" category, they split almost exactly down the middle. That's not too shabby.\n\nAssuming nothing else changes significantly between now and November (a big assumption to be sure), Donald Trump's prospects in Arizona, Georgia, and Nevada have improved considerably. Joe Biden carried all three of those states narrowly in 2020. The sand is currently pouring out of Joe Biden's electoral college egg timer and the Democrats don't seem to be coming up with a roadmap to change that.\n\nOn the other hand, we can look at New Hampshire, Minnesota, and Nebraska and conclude that Biden can still carry them, if by a smaller margin, at least based on Cook's analysis. We've actually seen some polls in all of those states showing Trump holding a slight lead or at least in a tie, but that's not the entirety of the story. Even in the states that Biden eventually carries, if Trump can cut down his margin of victory, that will eat further into Biden's popular vote count. If Donald Trump winds up winning this election - while it remains far too soon to begin counting chickens right now - the Democrats would love to be able to return to their old talking point about how the popular vote is the real indicator of the country's preferences. But if Trump can manage to carry both the electoral and popular votes, no matter how small the margin may be, that talking point evaporates like dew on the grass on a warm summer day. It would be more of a symbolic victory, but an important one nonetheless.\n\nOf course, we can't conclude this analysis without including one crucial caveat. Joe Biden could still flip the script and announce that he's dropping out of the race or his party might possibly find a way to give him the boot. If we wind up with a new Democratic candidate, the entire picture could be flipped on its head in a matter of days. This will still be a tight race, no matter who the Democrats wind up running, so Republicans need to remain diligent and run up the vote as much as humanly possible.", "source": {"uri": "hotair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotAir"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jazz_shaw@hotair.com", "name": "Jazz Shaw", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cook_Political_Report_with_Amy_Walter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-partisan_democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Non-partisan democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook_County,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cook County, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cook County, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Election Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Electoral College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sand"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/182/fbbd34b3-4e65-4357-b219-b8ebb2e306a3.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720019", "eventUri": "eng-9720019", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 1414, "textEnd": 1421}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

(Kyle Mazza/Anadolu via Getty Images)\n\nPresident Joe Biden and his campaign, struggling to contain the fallout over his disastrous debate performance, have been nailing down Democratic support on Capitol Hill despite calls for him to step aside for a more viable nominee. But those efforts have done little to slow his tumbling poll numbers, which on Tuesday prompted the nonpartisan Cook Political Report to move three swing states -- Arizona, Georgia, and Nevada -- into the \"Lean Republican\" column.\n\nWhile Biden has repeatedly characterized the polls, which overestimated the Democratic nominee's support in 2020, as inaccurate, many Democratic officials have told reporters that they are waiting to see more post-debate surveys and Biden's performance at a Thursday press conference before deciding where they stand on his candidacy. Seven Democratic lawmakers have already made public calls for Biden to withdraw from the race, with others, like Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., raising serious concerns without saying explicitly that he has to go.\n\n\"Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election, and maybe win it by a landslide, and take with him the Senate and the House,\" Bennet told CNN's Kaitlan Collins on Tuesday. \"So for me, this isn't a question about polling. It's not a question about politics. It's a moral question about the future of our country.\"\n\n\"The White House, in the time since that disastrous debate, I think, has done nothing to really demonstrate that they have a plan to win this election,\" he continued.\n\nBennett made his comments just a few hours after House and Senate Democrats discussed Biden's troubled candidacy in their respective caucus meetings, disbanding with plenty of worry but little sense of clarity. One Democrat in the room told reporters that the meeting felt like a \"funeral\" for Biden, with lawmakers \"moving through the stages of grief.\" Many Democrats privately believe that Biden should withdraw to avert electoral disaster for the party, but the president's stubborn refusal has led them to believe that there is little they can do.\n\n\"Whether or not I have concerns is besides the point. He is going to be our nominee and we all have to support him,\" said Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., the lead Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee who reportedly said in a meeting on Sunday that it was time for Biden to step aside.\n\nBiden still retains public support from lawmakers across both Democratic caucuses, from party stalwarts and longtime supporters like Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., to progressive \"Squad\" member Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.\n\n\"He is our nominee, he is not leaving this race, he is in this race, and I support him,\" Ocasio-Cortez told reporters. \"Now what I think is critically important right now is that we focus on what it takes to win in November, because he is running against Donald Trump, who is a man with 34 felony convictions, that has committed 34 felony crimes, and not a single Republican has asked for Donald Trump to not be the nominee.\"\n\nThe Biden campaign has touted the positive response he has received from members of the Congressional Black Caucus and Black voters at campaign stops, even though some pre-debate polls show that he is performing worse with Black voters than any recent Democratic candidate, and that a plurality of Democratic voters, and up to three-quarters of all registered voters, now think Biden should step aside. Biden also trails Trump in most swing state polling averages, including Arizona, Georgia and Nevada -- which the Cook Political Report now rates as favoring Trump -- as well as the \"Blue wall\" states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, with the latter most at risk of slipping away next, per the report.\n\nBiden, presenting himself as the best candidate to defeat Trump in 2024, has been warning Americans of the dangers that Trump poses to American democracy and the well-being of its citizens. But it is precisely the high stakes of the election that has fueled calls for him to step aside for the good of the country, or for Democratic voters and officials to thwart his reported plans to run out the clock until the Democratic National Convention.\n\n\"They need to tell him that his defiance threatens to hand victory to Mr. Trump. They need to tell him that he is embarrassing himself and endangering his legacy. He needs to hear, plain and clear, that he is no longer an effective spokesman for his own priorities,\" wrote the New York Times Editorial Board in an op-ed published Monday. \"The party needs a candidate who can stand up to Mr. Trump. It needs a nominee who can present Americans with a compelling alternative to Mr. Trump's bleak vision for America.\"\n\nPotential Democratic replacements, such as Vice President Kamala Harris, have a mixed-to-positive showing in polls that compare their standing to Biden's, but some political analysts have stressed that unlike Biden, his would-be replacements have room to boost their name recognition and energy to bring the case against Trump on the campaign trail. Others are wary that they might not bring the salvation that some Democrats are hoping for.\n\nHarris \"is not a riskier bet than Biden,\" wrote Cook Political Report's Amy Walter, but \"there's no guarantee she'll be a stronger one.\"", "source": {"uri": "salon.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Salon.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type":

To put it bluntly, things did not go well for either Biden supporters or those who think it's past time for a change.\n\nA few members voiced their strong opinions, demonstrating that the rifts in the party are going to make it difficult for Democrats to unite behind whatever strategy they decide to pursue.\n\n\"It's the stupidest thing I've ever seen,\" said Biden-backer Rep. Juan Vargas (D-Calif.). Vargas, a member of the pro-Biden Hispanic Caucus, called the president's detractors a \"circular firing squad.\"\n\nThere appear to be more Democrats wanting to stick with Biden than want to remove him. But if many more polls like the AARP survey from Wisconsin show how badly the president is losing, even Biden's most enthusiastic supporters on Capitol Hill will have to reevaluate their position.\n\nWisconsin is one of Biden's \"blue wall\" Midwestern states. Along with Pennsylvania and Michigan, they constitute \"must-have\" electoral votes if Biden expects to win re-election. The AARP poll shows Donald Trump defeating Biden by a 50-45 spread. The latest Morning Consult poll has Trump up seven points in Pennsylvania. A loss in either one of those states in November would all but doom Biden's re-election chances.\n\nIf the polls keep pointing to a disaster for Biden and if the down-ballot Democratic candidates also show weakness, self-preservation on the Hill will take over, and the president's support among lawmakers will evaporate.\n\nNo Democratic member of Congress will fall on their sword for Joe Biden.\n\nAs if that poll news wasn't bad enough. the respected Cook Political Report moved six states away from Biden and toward Trump.\n\nPolitico:\n\nThe Cook Political Report yesterday moved six states away from Joe Biden and toward Donald Trump: Arizona, Georgia and Nevada have gone from Toss Up to Lean Republican; Minnesota, New Hampshire and Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District have gone from Likely Democratic to Lean Democratic.\n\nThis morning, Cook analyst David Wasserman writes that \"Biden's post-debate dip represents the biggest polling shift of the year,\" with Trump leading Biden 47%-44% in their new national polling average. \"Trump's current numbers among Black and Latino voters are incompatible with any plausible Democratic victory scenario,\" he adds.\n\nYou can add New York to the \"toss-up\" category according to New York Democrats.\n\n\"Elected officials, union leaders, and political consultants are panicking over polls showing a steady erosion of Biden's support in a state he won by 23 points four years ago,\" Politico reports.\n\nBut as I wrote yesterday, few Democrats are publicly deserting Biden, and there appears to be strong support among key constituencies like the Black and Hispanic Caucuses.\n\nBiden supporters cowed While House Democrats into submission -- for the moment -- and Senate Democrats have been largely silent on the issue of forcing Biden out. As long as their focus remains on defeating Trump, the Biden competency issue will remain relatively dormant.\n\nAxios:\n\n\"I would describe it as a constructive conversation, and we're focused on defeating Trump,\" Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisc.) said.\n\nBaldwin, who has said her constituents are concerned about Biden, said Tuesday's discussion did not change her perspective.\n\n\"It was certainly consensus on this critical point that we need to defeat Donald Trump,\" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), who has thrown his support behind Biden.\n\nReality check: What Democrats did not say is that they are united behind Biden as the nominee.\n\nInstead, it looks like Democrats remain divided. This, despite a number of them saying this week that they need to come to a consensus sooner rather than later.\n\nThe Democrats' strategy at this point appears to be to attack Trump, keep Biden away from the media as much as possible, and cross their fingers that the American people will hate Trump more than they're worried about Biden's degenerating mental state.", "source": {"uri":

None of them were earth-shattering, but taken together, they once again painted a picture of a race slipping that's away from Joe Biden and the Democrats. Cook's top analyst shifted Arizona, Georgia and Nevada into 'lean Republican' territory -- hardly a shocker for anyone who's been looking at polling for months -- and nudged Minnesota and New Hampshire from 'likely Democrat' to 'lean Democrat.' She did the same for Nebraska's Second Congressional District, which is relevant due to the state's proportional allocation of electoral votes, based on House districts. Six changes, all away from Biden:\n\nWalter mentioned internal polling she's been privy to that shows Trump's lead in the crucial battleground of Pennsylvania ballooning from a modest four points to up to ten points. If even close to accurate, that would be a five-alarm fire for Democrats. Respected left-leaning elections analyst Dave Wasserman tweeted, \"the notion that the presidential is a Toss Up was a stretch even before the debate. Today, Trump has a clear advantage over Biden and a much more plausible path to 270 Electoral votes.\" Many Democrats who were complicit in the Big Lie over Biden's condition have been frantically insisting since last month's debate that Biden withdraw from the race. He has steadfastly refused, publicly painting such demands as anti-democracy (he won the nearly-uncontested primaries running away) and aiding and abetting Trump. Many members of his party fell in line after that admonition, but others have not, with the Cook forecast spooking many of them anew. As I've been saying since the debate, if the ruling party has any hope of swapping out its incumbent and presumptive nominee for someone else, three conditions would have to be met:\n\nThat unanimity is still proving quite elusive, and Biden appears totally unwilling to cooperate in such a scheme. But the middle condition feels closer to being met: A growing consensus is that if it's not Biden, it would have to be the Vice President, Kamala Harris. Some observers are floating the fantasy of a 'flash primary,' but that seems supremely unrealistic. It would very likely be Kamala. Are Democrats more confident about that scenario? They arguably shouldn't be:\n\nOf all the hypothetical match-ups tested, Biden performs best against Trump in this data set. Maybe they'll still decide that while any course of action is risky, the riskiest is staying the course with Biden. Perhaps Harris could perform better, as her polling may be more fluid, considering that she'd need to be rolled out to the country, etc. But at least as a starting point, at least based on this poll (also reflected in other data, but contradicted in other surveys), Harris may not represent an improvement over Biden. The media would puff her up to a breathtaking degree, but her record also includes major landmines that could alienate average voters. Setting aside her bizarre communications struggles, she ran on the left end of the spectrum in her disastrously failed 2019 presidential bid that never survived into 2020. They may determine that making a change for the sake of doing something would be too difficult, especially if the president is adamantly resisting. They may reach the opposite conclusion, however, and that doing anything else may be preferable to the trajectory they're on:\n\nPresident Joe Biden has a new problem: a competitive race in deep blue New York. Elected officials, union leaders and political consultants are panicking over polls showing a steady erosion of Biden's support in a state he won by 23 points four years ago. They're so worried they've been trying to convince the Biden team to pour resources into New York to shore up his campaign and boost Democrats running in a half-dozen swing districts that could determine control of the House...The warning signs are impossible to ignore and have been building over the past year. Two private polls conducted in a swing New York House district and reviewed by POLITICO -- one in September and another in March -- found former President Donald Trump leading Biden there by 1 point, a virtual tie. And public polls over the last four months found Biden's lead had winnowed to just 8 points across New York -- an unusually narrow gap in a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans 2 to 1. \"We're still acting like this is a one-party state, which for pretty much 20, 25 years it has been,\" Democratic Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine said. \"I truly believe we're a battleground state now.\"\n\nThat could be hyperbole, but it's not a quote Democrats want to be contemplating with less than four months left until the general election. I'll leave you with another factor in this race that looks to be working to Trump's advantage, regardless of the Democratic nominee:", "source": {"uri": "townhall.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

There is a 4% drop in independents favoring Biden, with no increase for Trump.\n\nThat indicates independents could be choosing not to vote, or are instead voting for third-party candidates such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Biden's loss in support appears to emanate from his debate performance on June 27, which confirmed voters' age-related concerns of him.\n\nThe polling shift between the two candidates, with Trump leading 47% to 44% among all voters, is \"driven almost entirely by independent voters.\" Independent voters are considered a critical voting group and are generally more easily swayed than Republicans and Democrats. Both candidates will be fighting for the independent vote, and according to the poll, Biden is losing.\n\nDave Wasserman, who wrote on the poll, said that \"Biden's post-debate dip represents the biggest polling shift we've seen all year.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Wasserman, a senior editor and elections analyst for CPR, said, \"The notion that the presidential is a Toss Up was a stretch even before the debate. Today, Trump has a clear advantage over Biden and a much more plausible path to 270 Electoral votes.\"\n\nBecause of Trump's growing electoral advantage, Democrats have called for Biden to step down and make way for a new Democratic nominee.

One Democratic official told the outlet the campaign has been too complacent about the state of New York.\n\n\"We're still acting like this is a one-party state, which for pretty much 20, 25 years it has been,\" Democratic Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine told the outlet. \"I truly believe we're a battleground state now.\"\n\nThe report suggests officials are concerned about Biden's lead in New York dropping, specifically in key House districts. A poll conducted by Siena College in June, prior to Biden's disastrous June 27 debate against Trump, showed Biden only leading in the Empire State, 47%-39%.\n\nWhile the state, which has not voted Republican in a presidential race since 1984, is still far from being competitive at the top of the ticket, Biden's free fall since the debate could hurt key races in the state, which could decide control of the House of Representatives in January.\n\nRepublicans were able to win control of the House in 2022 largely thanks to a strong performance in New York after underperforming in most states across the country. In the November election, three Republican House seats in New York are rated as \"toss-up\" contests by the Cook Political Report, while two other seats, one held by a Democrat and one held by a Republican, are rated as \"lean Democratic.\"\n\nWith the stakes of the race, Politico reports that Democrats in the Empire State want the Biden campaign to help shore up the state and avoid it from slipping down the ballot.\n\nThe fallout from the debate last month has seen Trump, who was already leading Biden in most polls nationally and in swing states, increase his lead and cause panic for Democrats over states he could move into contention.\n\nThe Cook Political Report moved six state ratings toward Trump on Tuesday, including moving Georgia, Nevada, and Arizona, from \"toss up\" to \"lean Republican.\" Other changes included moving Minnesota, New Hampshire, and Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District from \"likely Democratic\" to \"lean Democratic.\"\n\nOne of the chief concerns for Democrats in swing states and swing districts has been the down-ballot effect of a free-falling Biden campaign. Some vulnerable Democrats have distanced themselves from Biden, such as Reps. Jared Golden (D-ME) and Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (D-WA) who proclaim Trump will likely win in November, while others like Rep. Angie Craig (D-MN) have called on Biden to step aside.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nRep. Ritchie Torres (D-NY), who has been outspoken about his concern over Biden's candidacy but has not called on him to step aside, said in a statement Wednesday that there \"must be a serious reckoning with the down-ballot effect of whomever we nominate.\"\n\n\"An unsentimental analysis of the cold hard numbers, which have no personal feelings or political loyalties, should inform what we decide and whom we nominate. If we're going to choose a particular path, we should be clear-eyed about its consequences.

Rishi Kumar told CNN host Laura Coates Tuesday night that Democrats could suffer losses in House and Senate races if Biden remains on the ticket. (RELATED: 'That Is The End Of It': Former Clinton Pollster Says Dems Would 'Commit Suicide' By Trying To Replace Biden)\n\n\"If Biden ends up running, potentially the Democrats could lose the Senate, the House and the White House and it's going to be a bloodbath,\" Kumar told Coates. \"Blue states that we have held for many decades might potentially turn red. Trump is doing well when he runs against Biden in those states and then the swing states, the battleground states, they are looking terrible.\"\n\n\"So at this point, all the polling indicates that Trump is going to win,\" Kumar continued.\n\nThe Cook Political Report, a leading nonpartisan and campaign monitor, moved Arizona, Georgia and Nevada from \"toss-up\" to \"lean Republican\" in an update that also saw Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District, Minnesota and New Hampshire from \"likely Democratic\" to \"lean Democratic\" since the July 27 debate. An Ipsos poll released July 2 showed that only former First Lady Michelle Obama could beat former President Trump.\n\nKumar said that Democrats needed to find \"the best\" alternative to Biden to challenge Trump in the November election.\n\n\"We need to send the best and the brightest out there to run against Trump,\" Kumar said. \"He's beatable, but we need to send somebody who has the energy of a commander-in-chief. Here in Silicon Valley we have had great leaders and companies thrive because of good leaders.\"\n\n\"At this point, it's debatable if Biden can lead our nation,\" Kumar continued. \"Carrying the nuclear football is a huge deal and we're not sure right now that Biden is going to be able to do his job.\"\n\nTrump leads Biden by 5.4% in Arizona, 4% in Georgia, 0.6% in Michigan, 5.2% in Nevada, 5.8% in North Carolina, 5.3% in Pennsylvania and 2.2% in Wisconsin in head-to-head matchups, according to averages of polls by RealClearPolling. Biden carried six of those states in 2020, with Trump winning North Carolina.\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declined to answer questions from Morning Joe co-host Willie Geist about whether she wanted President Biden to continue his campaign.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

'Look at the polling. Look at the polling. It's still a toss-up.' And what's so concerning about some of the polling you just mentioned, including from Fox, including from the Cook Political Report, is that the polls are moving away from Joe Biden, and the campaign has spent a lot of time attacking Democratic lawmakers like my former boss, Seth Moulton, like, Democratic pundits like myself, people out there asking questions instead of spending all that time trying to figure out how to turn this campaign around,\" Harf said.\n\nBIDEN RESISTS MOUNTING PRESSURE TO STEP ASIDE\n\n\"I think that there's a lot of frustration that they are trying to turn the page and say, 'We're not having this conversation about the debate anymore,' but the problem, Bill, is that voters are having that conversation,\" she continued. \"It's not just pundits, it's not just members of Congress.\"\n\nMany Democrats have called on Biden to step out of the 2024 race since his debate against Trump, despite the fact he has vowed to continue his candidacy amid significant age-related concerns.\n\nSeveral House Democrats have called on Biden to drop out, including Rep. Lloyd Doggett, Rep. Ra\u00fal Grijalva, Rep. Seth Moulton, Rep. Mike Quigley, Rep. Angie Craig, Rep. Adam Smith and Rep. Mikie Sherrill.\n\nMeanwhile, Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet became the first Democrat in the Senate to voice concerns about the future of Biden's campaign. He told CNN's Kaitlin Collins Trump could win with a \"landslide\" victory since the \"disastrous\" debate.\n\n\"Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election, and maybe win it by a landslide, and take with him the Senate and the House,\" he said. \"So for me, this isn't a question about polling. It's not a question about politics. It's a moral question about the future of our country.\"\n\n\"The White House, in the time since that disastrous debate, I think, has done nothing to really demonstrate that they have a plan to win this election,\" Bennet continued.\n\nThis comes after congressional Democrats met for a closed-door meeting to reportedly discuss their private concerns about Biden on Tuesday, as internal party divisions continue to fuel concerns about the president's political future.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bailee_hill@foxnews.com",

It could contribute to the very cynicism that has allowed Trumpism to fester and flourish over the last decade.\n\nThroughout his disgraceful, destructive political career, Trump has cast Washington as a swamp, populated by out-of-touch elites whose purported ideals are merely a front for personal ambition. American institutions are not the infrastructure of democracy, in Trump's telling, but black boxes through which the people really running the country exercise their power, indifferent and unaccountable to the will of the people. These accusations are bad-faith and self-serving, not to mention more appropriately leveled at the party Trump leads, which currently exerts itself mostly through the six unelected partisans it has put on the Supreme Court. But Trump, aided by a GOP that has coalesced around him, has conditioned a significant segment of the American electorate to excuse and more often cheer this political nihilism: In a world where everything is bullshit and everyone is out for themselves, after all, you might as well focus on winning \"so much,\" as Trump memorably put it in 2016, that \"you may even get tired of winning.\"\n\nBiden ran in 2020 not just against Trump but against the disillusionment he and his movement feed on. The country was coming off a term of endless chaos and corruption, and was still in the throes of a pandemic that laid bare the limits of Trump's zero-sum politics. In what he described as a \"winter of peril and possibility,\" Biden vowed in his inauguration speech to \"restore the soul and secure the future of America\" by marshaling the power and wisdom of the institutions Trump sought to destroy. \"America has to be better than this,\" he said as he assumed the presidency. \"It is a time for boldness, for there is so much to do.\"\n\nBiden fulfilled many of the promises he made in that address. But he has not been able exorcize the MAGA movement from our politics, and it is threatening now to come back even stronger: The right-wing has set out its Project 2025 wishlist, and Trump -- who holds a commanding lead in polls -- is appears ready to make that Christian nationalist nightmare, as well as his own personal \"retribution\" fantasies, a reality. Worse yet, where Biden once met the moment, he now seems to be shrinking from it: dismissing unfavorable polls and media coverage as fake or biased; misrepresenting legitimate skepticism of his candidacy as \"elite\" backstabbing; and substituting that \"boldness\" of vision with something more like \"save your breath and get on board,\" as David Axelrod summed it up the other day. \"It's me or Trump.\"\n\nThat choice is stark, even after last month's debate raised serious questions about Biden's age and acuity: His reelection would at the very least keep democracy on life support, while Trump's would mean a return to the chaos and then some. Still, it's one thing to ask that people hold their nose as they vote; it's another to ask them to cover their eyes and ears -- and that's what Biden and his allies are doing right now, to the peril of the nation in November and beyond.\n\nNone of this is to suggest an equivalence between Biden and Trump or the parties they lead. Trump is a grave danger to the country, and defeating him is, as Biden put it in a letter Monday, the \"one job\" they have before them in November. But that effort is being seriously undermined by the votive-candle politics that has taken hold in some corners of the Democratic party, which sometimes seems to be arguing not just that Biden remains the most likely candidate to defeat Trump, but that there is nothing at all to worry about except for the \"elites\" persecuting him over a single bad debate.\n\nOf course, if anything, the elites have been late to the game on this: For months, voters have been saying in polls that they regard Biden as too old to run again and that they would prefer him to make way for someone else. Yes, Democrats overwhelmingly checked Biden's name on primary ballots this year, as he and his surrogates have been eager to point out. But there was no serious primary to speak of, and no real stress test of his candidacy to reveal the weaknesses that were laid bare on the debate stage with Trump. After that dismal performance, a CNN poll found that three-quarters of voters felt Democrats would have a better shot at winning with a candidate other than Biden at the top of the ticket -- and they're probably right, based on subsequent survey results. He trails his predecessor in national polls, and is deeper underwater in the swing states he needs to retain the presidency. In Wisconsin, for instance, Biden is behind five points in a new poll -- even though Senator Tammy Baldwin, the incumbent Democrat in the state, enjoys a decisive lead over her Republican opponent in the survey.\n\nPeople seem to want to vote for Democrats, whose policies on abortion and a range of other issues are broadly popular with the public. They just seem less than enthusiastic about voting for Biden, to the point where Vice President Kamala Harris and even Hillary Clinton -- whose failed, overconfident 2016 campaign gave us Trump in the first place -- are both polling better than the current party leader and his opponent.\n\n\"The notion that the presidential is a Toss Up was a stretch even before the debate,\" as the elections analyst Dave Wasserman noted Tuesday. \"Today, Trump has a clear advantage over Biden and a much more plausible path to 270 Electoral votes.\" On Tuesday, Cook Political Report moved its ratings in the battlegrounds of Arizona, Georgia, and Nevada -- all of which Biden won in 2020 -- from toss-ups to \"lean Republican,\" and regards firmer Democratic territory like New Hampshire and Minnesota as being in play for Trump.", "source": {"uri": "vanityfair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vanity Fair"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conde_nast@vanityfair.com", "name": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "type":

Republican contender Donald Trump is gaining ground in key swing states and may threaten to take states once considered to be safe for Democrats, despite Biden's resolve to stay in the contest and beat the former president once again. According to 'Cook Political Report', Biden's base has further eroded and he is losing the survey polls post-debate. Its Editor-in-Chief Amy Walter wrote in an article that the post-debate polling would further move Minnesota, New Hampshire and Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District from \"Likely Democratic\" to \"Lean Democratic.\" It also moved Nevada, Arizona and Georgia from \"Tossup\" to \"Lean Republican.\"\n\nThough there have been limited opinion polls after the presidential debate, it is believed that the debate shifted 2 percentage points of support from Biden to Trump. Three states remain in the \"Tossup\" category, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. According to the report, Donald Trump has polled strongly in Pennsylvania and took a small lead over Biden. It is too early to draw any conclusion, but they drop a hint at the voters' mood.\n\nAlso Read: Found Season 2: When and where you can watch the new chapter? Release date & time\n\nAfter the June 27 debate, the two candidates remain neck and neck in national polling, but Trump currently leads Biden by 1.3 percentage points in The Hill/Decision Desk HQ average of polls.\n\nIn an opinion poll conducted by 'The New York Times' and Siena College, the former president leads the incumbent 49 percent to 43 percent among likely voters nationally. It shows a three-point swing toward the Republicans before the debate.\n\nAccording to this poll, 74% of potential voters view Joe Biden as too old for the job, up five percentage points since the debate. Similarly, concerns about the president's age have increased by eight percentage points among Democrats after the debate. The number of independent voters who said they felt that way rose to 79%.\n\nWhich are the six states that have shown a shift in support base after the presidential debate?\n\nMinnesota, New Hampshire and Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District moved from \"Likely Democratic\" to \"Lean Democratic post-debate.\" The debate also moved Nevada, Arizona and Georgia from \"Tossup\" to \"Lean Republican.\"\n\nWhat are the findings of the poll conducted by 'The New York Times' and Siena College?\n\nIn an opinion poll conducted by 'The New York Times' and Siena College, the former president leads the incumbent 49 percent to 43 percent among likely voters nationally.

Since then, several Democratic lawmakers have called for Biden to step aside in favor of someone who can better articulate the party platform and provide a more robust figure for voters to rally around and support in the general election against Trump.\n\nNot surprisingly, over the past two weeks, Trump has remained uncharacteristically quiet and subdued. From his point of view, there is no need to disturb the internal bickering and conflicts among Democrats, when he can just let them self-destruct in a manner that weakens Biden (and anyone who takes his place for the nomination).\n\nA poor performance in one debate should not disqualify Biden from continuing his campaign, no matter how weak he appeared. What should be most disturbing for the incumbent president, though, is the public debate that is consuming the attention between his supporters and detractors. The longer such debates continue, the better positioned Trump will be to win back the White House in November. Party conflict and squabbling does not win over moderates and undecided voters.\n\nBiden has many supporters. Yet the White House will not be won in blue strongholds like California and New York. It will be won by the margins in battleground states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, and Wisconsin.\n\nIn 2016, less than 110,000 votes in three states (Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania) gave Trump the White House over Hillary Clinton. In 2020, less than 50,000 votes in three states (Georgia, Wisconsin, and Arizona) gave Biden the White House over Trump. There is every reason to believe that the outcome in 2024 will be similarly determined by a handful of closely contested states that will only be revealed after the fact.\n\nPundits on the left recognize that there are risks in Biden stepping aside at such a late date, less than four months before Election Day.\n\nAnalytically, two of the 13 Keys to the White House would flip against the Democrats (Key 3: incumbency; and Key 2: contested nomination), giving Republicans yet another push forward. How a Trump victory would trickle down to Senate, House and local races remains to be seen, but it's something that most certainly should concern all Democrats running for office this fall.\n\nThe biggest question for Democrats is who would be best suited to take the nomination. Numerous names have been put forward, including Vice President Kamala Harris, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, to name just a few. Even Michelle Obama has been discussed as a possible candidate, although she has indicated no desire to enter this or any other race. Accepting the nomination at this late date would be a challenge for anyone, which makes a strong case for keeping Biden as the nominee.\n\nYet it is not analytics or opinion, but voters that determine who will win the election.\n\nTrump is in a uniquely favorable position. All he needs to do is stay in the shadows, allowing conflicts among Democrats to create the perception of confusion that may push a few voters over to him in some key states.\n\nOf course, Trump's time will come. His legal problems will once again become a focal point of discussion as the campaigns winds toward the finish line. The recent Supreme Court ruling may give him immunity from certain charges against him; it does not, however, change the actions he took, even if there are no legal consequences associated with them.\n\nBoth Biden and Trump are flawed candidates. Replacing Biden has tremendous risk for the Democrats. Sticking with Trump has its own set of risks for Republicans, given his high floor and low ceiling of support.\n\nThe scenario that serves the best interests of the country is that both Biden and Trump be replaced by more capable and acceptable candidates. Replacing Biden would be a first step toward achieving this. Replacing Trump appears far less likely, but with legal landmines awaiting him, anything is possible.\n\nIn a nation with nearly $35 trillion of national debt held by the federal government -- or over $100,000 for every person -- and out of control year-over-year budget deficits, perhaps it is time for our elected officials to do what they are elected do to: serve the interests of the people who put them into power. Indeed, putting country over party would be a good first step to achieve this. And the best way to demonstrate this priority is to nominate two new candidates for president.\n\nSheldon H.

Sign up here to get stories like this delivered to your inbox.\n\nPerhaps the most galling aspect of being president is how quickly voters forget. Moments of fleeting happiness -- the fake victory over the Taliban, the real death of Osama bin Laden -- never last very long. But the upside of Americans' constant rewriting of collective memory is that bad memories don't linger either.\n\nThat's the optimistic outlook that President Joe Biden's allies are taking as they approach the two-week mark after a disastrous debate that raised serious questions about the president's mental acuity and cognitive abilities. With Democrats openly discouraged and unable to force Biden's hand, there's a good chance that the energy of next week's GOP nominating convention in Milwaukee will resemble a UFC fight more than a C-SPAN audience. This collective bullying won't do Democrats any favors because it will likely only redouble Biden's determination not to be forced.\n\nInside and out, Biden's top advisers see the fallout from the move as hypersensitivity on the part of Washington politicians and pundits, most of whom seem to have forgotten that it's only July. Voting doesn't start until September, and there will be two nominating conventions and the Olympics to change the narrative among the electorate. And they point to perhaps the most notorious campaign moment of this century to make that point: the infamous Access Hollywood tape and audio of Donald Trump bragging about sexual assault.\n\nPublished in the month following Election Day 2016, many assumed the scandal would be force Trump decided to step down. Instead, he simply gave up and voters followed his lead. On Election Day, he won.winner more than 64% of white working-class voters, 62% of white men and 47% of white women.\n\nSome members of Biden's team are now pointing out that Access Hollywood episode, which actually caused Trump's poll numbers to drop by less than a percentage point for less than three weeks; the tape aired on October 7, 2016, and he was back to his normal polling position by October 25, according to the 538-vote poll average archive.\n\nThe analogy is of course imperfect. But it corresponds to other moments that evaporate. US and World NewsAs Olivier Knox pointed out to me the day after the on-stage collapse in Atlanta, Barack Obama's poll numbers bump after the death of Bin Laden lasted just six weeks in 2011. Moreover, when Trump contracted Covid-19 and had to be flown to Walter Reed in 2020, his poll numbers soaked again, by less than a percentage point.\n\nThis is how those immersed in Biden's world reassure themselves, and the boss, that things that seem huge to political junkies rarely reach the pop generation. The word got out of Atlanta in real time as the debate continued: A 90-minute mistake would not define the choice voters face in November. Besides, they had time. And while Biden's poll numbers have fallen, it doesn't seem as bad as the collapse in poll numbers that many had predicted.\n\nStill, Cook's nonpartisan political report released Tuesday moved Arizona, Georgia and Nevada have flipped from Democratic to Republican strongholds. Analysts have also flipped Minnesota, New Hampshire and a remote congressional district in Nebraska from Democratic to Democratic strongholds. polls If Biden had held firm, others would have down 6 points in some places like Georgia and nationallyFor the survey of potential voters, it was a three-point survey. swing in less than two weeks.\n\nAll of this could prove temporary, Biden supporters say.\n\nTrump's candidacy provides Democrats with plenty of reasons to wince, but there's an interesting lesson to be learned: Nothing lasts forever, not even a disastrous performance that has sparked much grumbling in Democratic circles. Further evidence: 51 percent of voters say they are now approve Trump's performance while president, a record he never achieved while in office.\n\nBiden's team is counting on such a fickle electorate and hoping that the endless repetition of his admittedly terrible answers will not continue.\n\n\"They think they can handle it, and so do I,\" said one lawmaker who heard the Access Hollywood He is a close ally of the White House. \"Joe Biden is the only person who has beaten Donald Trump. Why trade him, even for someone as promising as the vice president?\"\n\nThe main drawback of the 2016 polls is this: Trump's return to his previous levels still puts him behind Hillary Clinton in just about every way. Trump's victory seems to have fallen out of the blue. This time, Trump is ahead of Biden in every key state, and Biden has yet to crack the 50% mark in any of them.\n\nBiden, meanwhile, remains a very unwelcome presence on the ticket, let alone as a leader. As TIMEs' Nik Popli reports from Capitol Hill, there is a reluctant acceptance that Biden is likely their nominee, whether they like it or not. After a handful of House Democrats publicly urged Biden to drop out of the race, former Speaker Nancy Pelosi may have reignited the issue Wednesday morning by suggesting that Joe in the morning \"Biden should reconsider his position. We all encourage him to make that decision because time is running out,\" Pelosi said, as if Biden had not already made his position abundantly clear for over a week.\n\nBiden appears to be taking a page from his predecessor: Fake it until you make it. Trump pretended there was no crisis until there isn't. Biden is trying to reassure voters that he's ready to do something for another four years, a challenge made more acute by each passing day, an ambivalence that's on display. He told ABC News: Georges Stephanopolous that he knew he had a bad night but also sparked a low-light firestorm over whether he had used his best work in a response. (Official ABC News transcript, edited at the request of the Joe team, he concluded that he had used \"good\" as work in a sentence that didn't become much clearer with the change.)\n\nAdditionally, no Democrat actually thinks Biden has a good chance of retiring. A YouGov poll watch 72% of Democrats believe they are obligated to stick with Biden, whether they like it or not. Biden is banking on Democrats forgetting by Election Day that they ever had doubts about his candidacy. Given how others have played the wait-and-see game, this is not an irrational game, and it is clear that much forgetting is already underway.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news",

We've had two weeks since Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance. Normally, a debate sustains a news cycle for a few days. But Biden's performance was so bad, his obvious mental decline so apparent, that the media just can't let it go.\n\nTo be fair, we on the right have not let it go since his basement campaign in 2020. But the media has suddenly had their eyes opened and the veil lifted. They see now what they were too un-curious to see before: Biden is a man in decline.\n\nThe problem for the Democrats is that, when it comes to seeking another candidate, time is up. The ideal time was during the primary, when they could have found an acceptable challenger to the president, or encouraged Kamala Harris to run as his successor while persuading him to secure his legacy by being a one-and-done president. That time has long since passed, and now that the primaries are over and Biden has a ton of delegates and millions of Democratic voters under his belt, they can't pull a fast one and replace him. The party fighting the so-called \"threat to democracy\" can't go in and undermine the democratic process now.\n\nThe only chance they have is for Biden to step aside himself, doing so voluntarily and with grace. It is an option that is clearly off the table, considering his letter to Congressional Democrats earlier this week. But, as it stands, Biden is the only person who can remove Biden at this point. And even if he were to do so, there are a myriad of problems with that decision. For one thing, if Kamala doesn't succeed him then his millions in campaign cash can't be used by whoever the Democratic candidate is. For another, no one has a built-in national organization that is ready to go.\n\nIt's too late to replace Biden. There is no hope for Gavin Newsome or Michelle Obama or Gretchen Whitmer or even Hillary Clinton. There is no hope at all. The news cycle ends with no resolution for Joe Biden. Trump will soon name his running mate, which will take over the news cycle until the Republican National Convention. The RNC will then be the focus of the news cycle. And then you have the pre-Democratic National Convention, where Biden will be nominated ahead of the main convention (due to the rules the DNC had to adopt because of election law in Ohio). There is no time left to change the news cycle in Biden's favor.\n\nThis leads to a look at the polling and the current projections from several election models. As the kids might say, **TRIGGER WARNING** for any Democrats who might read this. You will not be happy.\n\nJust about every major model shows Trump winning. Not only that, but several models that include some states being toss-ups still show Trump winning. At that point, he's just running up the score.\n\nAnd Cook Political Report, which includes toss-up states and doesn't show Trump winning, but shows him a lot closer than Joe Biden:\n\nSo, again, the Cook Political Report is Joe Biden's best-case scenario, and he's behind Trump with 44 outstanding electoral votes from toss-up states. Not only is it too late to replace him, it might be too late to beat Trump. It is no wonder at all that the Democrats are in a panic right now as they realize they will lose once again to Trump.\n\nOf course, this is all a snapshot of the current moment, and it's all simply a projection of November based on the current situation. Things could absolutely change between now and election day, which is less than four months away. But still... these numbers are brutal for Biden, and the worst part is he is probably not aware of it. That tight inner circle protecting him from all the bad things in the world is very likely protecting him from this. They have him convinced the polling is wrong, that he's actually winning, and that everyone is picking on him and underestimating him.\n\nThey have him living inside a fairy tale while the world crumbles around him.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_cunningham@redstate.com", "name": "Joe Cunningham", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Primary election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gretchen_Whitmer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gretchen Whitmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michelle Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Electoral College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook_County,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cook County, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cook County, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/187/c1041ce4-e487-47c9-b1bb-2fac66b9ab6b.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720019", "eventUri": "eng-9720019", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

Amid fallout over the debate, the Biden campaign in internal messaging has pointed to tight polling against Trump to argue the race remains \"steady.\"\n\nFormer President Trump leads Biden in The Hill/Decision Desk HQ's average of national polls, garnering 44.4 percent to Biden's 43.1 percent. A national poll from Emerson College released Tuesday also found Trump leading Biden by 3 points, with Trump earning 46 percent to Biden's 43 percent among registered voters.\n\nNational and battleground polls released after the debate have done little to calm fears among many Democrats over whether the race is actually close, with multiple Democratic senators over the past day voicing deep concerns about a rout in November. Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) told CNN he believes Biden will lose and cost Democrats control of Congress.\n\nABC News' George Stephanopoulos noted Biden lagging in polls compared to Trump in an interview with the president last week. When the president was questioned about if polling would result in him not trying for a second term in the White House, he responded, \"Not when you're running against a pathological liar.\"\n\nDespite continued pushback from Biden and his allies against him leaving the 2024 race, an increasing number of Democratic lawmakers have publicly stated their concern about the viability of his candidacy or have outright called on him to step out of the race.\n\nThe Hill has reached out to the Biden campaign for comment.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tara_suter@thehill.com", "name": "Tara Suter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Bedingfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kate Bedingfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Communications_Director", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House Communications Director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_Desk_HQ", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Decision Desk HQ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerson_College", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emerson College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bennet", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Bennet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hill_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Hill (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephanopoulos", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Stephanopoulos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/bedingfieldkate_033122ap-patrick-semansky_comms.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720019", "eventUri": "eng-9720019", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

In such a scenario, a political analyst has offered a glimmer of hope. He said that Biden's victory in three key swing states will ensure his return to the White House. There is always light at the end of the tunnel. In Joe Biden's case, a victory in three key swing states will be sufficient to ensure his return to the White House. This is according to John Ellis who is a political analyst. This has been reported by the Daily Express. This may renew Biden's campaign amidst a sense of despondency which had gripped the Democrats after the first presidential debate. There are also concerns pertaining to Biden's health. These concerns have prompted many of the legislators who have called on Biden to stand down and pave the way for another candidate from the Democrats to contest the upcoming presidential election.\n\nJohn Ellis who is a well- known political analyst and founder of News Items said that there is only way in which Biden can beat Trump in the upcoming election. He added that if the election is about inflation, immigration and Biden's health concerns; Trump's victory is assured. On the other hand, if the issue is about abortion rights and Trump's views on the topic, Biden may win easily.\n\nAlso Read: France runs risk of economic meltdown after high earners looking at fleeing country over wealth taxes\n\nHe added that Biden is presently disadvantaged as the main electoral issue is that of his health and questions being raised regarding his continuation in office. Under these conditions, he can only win the election if he is able to convincingly win three critical swing states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\n\nPresently, Biden is trailing in many of these swing states. According to the poll conducted by the Emerson College which has been sponsored by the Democrats, Biden is trailing behind Trump by at least four percentage point in six key swing states of Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Arizona, Wisconsin and Nevada.\n\nIn other national surveys, Biden is trailing behind Trump by six percentage points. The first presidential debate was disastrous for Biden. There are growing calls for his ouster from the ballot. There have been various calls to replace him on ballot box.\n\nIs Michelle Obama planning to contest the upcoming presidential election?\n\nVarious national surveys which reflected a hypothetical competition between Trump and Michelle Obama reveals that the former first lady is leading by 11% against the former president. However, she has refused to contest the election.\n\nWho are the other probably Democratic Party candidates to replace Biden, if he decides to step down?\n\nJoe Biden has still not decided to step down as the official presidential nominee of the party.

The support still enjoyed by a former Secretary of State has emerged as a surprise to many. There might be some good news for the Democrats as a new national survey commissioned by them as found that President Biden has improved his performance. He is now trailing behind Trump by just one percentage point as compared to Trump's six percentage point lead, a few weeks back. There are still concerns pertaining to his health with many of the respondents to the poll conducted by Bendixen and Amandi saying that they would seek to have him stepping down due to health concerns. The poll also gauged the mood of the respondents on other potential presidential nominees of the Democratic party. The findings are surprising to many observers.\n\nOver 61% of the respondents felt that Biden did not have the mental capacity and stamina to serve another four-year term in office. In comparison, only 29% supported Biden on this point. Over 86% of the voters either watched the first presidential debate fully or bits and pieces of it.\n\nAlso Read: Will Jill Biden counsel Joe Biden to pull out of race for White House? Know in detail\n\nOn his continuation as the Democratic Party's presidential nominee, only 33% said that he should continue whereas 52% said that he should step down.\n\nTrump is leading Biden by one percentage. While 43% of them supported Trump, Biden found the support of 42% of the respondents.\n\nThere are only two key individuals who are doing better than Trump in the survey. Kamala Harris who was trailing in the previous surveys has now moved past Trump and has a 42%-41% lead against him. What is actually surprising to many is the support received by former Secretary of State Hilary Clinton. She has unsuccessfully contested the 2016 presidential election against Trump. She has ruled out contest the election and has pledged her support to Biden. She is also a former first lady.\n\nThere are news reports that Harris is considering her running mates. Among them, Harris and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro have a lead over Trump by two percentage points, 42% to 40%. Other possible replacements are lagging behind. Shapiro has the best approval ratings among the Governors of the states. He will be able to ensure the victory of the Democrats in a key swing state.\n\nDo these national surveys make any difference?\n\nUltimately, the voters judge the fate of the candidates. However, these surveys point towards the major indicators for the pollsters.\n\nWhat is the sample size of this survey that was completed?\n\nThe survey was taken between July 2-6, 2024.

Now data from polls and prediction markets can also quantify the cost of that night to his campaign.\n\nOn the day of the June 27 debate, national polling averages between Biden and Donald Trump were tied. Since then, they have sharply diverged. Trump now holds a 2.3-point lead, according to polling averages from FiveThirtyEight.\n\nPolling in individual swing states has also tipped in Trump's favour, with two states -- Michigan and Wisconsin -- flipping from a brief Biden lead back to a slight Trump advantage, according to FiveThirtyEight polling averages. Elsewhere, Trump's advantage has widened.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, the state where Biden has spent the most on political advertisements -- about $60mn for ads aired and scheduled to air since early March -- the narrowing gap between the two men reversed course after June 27, with Trump on top.\n\nPolls-based prediction models have struggled to make sense of the upended race. For example, qualitative interventions such as those from former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democratic donor and actor George Clooney, who on Wednesday signalled concern about Biden remaining in the race, will not appear directly in a quantitative analysis of the race.\n\nA model published by The Economist sees Trump as a 3-1 favourite to win November's election, while the FiveThirtyEight model still sees the race as a coin flip. This is in part because with the election months away, polls are a noisy measure and certain \"fundamentals\" -- Biden's incumbency, for example -- remain in his favour.\n\n\"There are many sources of uncertainty that all have to be combined properly,\" FiveThirtyEight wrote on Tuesday.\n\nBettors and prediction markets, on the other hand, have spoken clearly about Biden's slipping chances. His implied odds of victory, according to live trading on PredictIt, fell precipitously during the first half-hour of the debate and continued to slip as the evening wore on.\n\nSince then, an average of a number of prediction and betting markets, published by RealClearPolitics, shows a similar downturn, and even a bouncy view on who would secure the Democratic nomination. At one point, vice-president Kamala Harris was seen as likelier than Biden.\n\nThe beneficiary of this flux: a steadily rising Trump, who these markets now see as nearly a 60 per cent favourite to win the election. Meanwhile, Biden's chances of re-election have slipped from nearly 40 per cent before the debate to less than 20 per cent.\n\nThe biggest problem for Biden may simply be that voters think he is too old -- and the older he gets the more they think so.

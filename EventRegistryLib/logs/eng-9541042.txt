They have been accused of sponsoring the press conference of seven individuals that claimed to be the leaders of the APC Ganduje Ward.\n\nSince their maiden press conference in Kano, where they announced the suspension of Ganduje, they have remained inaccessible to newsmen as they could not be reached.\n\nThe situation worsened when 27 exco members of the APC Ganduje Ward emerged claiming that they were impersonated , and that they didn't suspend the National Chairman.\n\nBarely a 48 hours after the maiden press conference, they were able to secure a court order affirming the suspension of Ganduje.\n\nThey secured the order from High Court four under Justice Usman Na'abba against who the troubled exco filed a petition before the National Judicial Commission (NJC).\n\nThey went before him again to secure another exparte order restraining the implementation of the initial order suspending Ganduje.\n\nThere is a general belief by the public that the scenario is sponsored by the Kwankwaso faction of NNPP to clear the ground for them to join the APC.\n\nCommenting on some of these issues, the state's APC spokesman, Ahmad Aruwa clarified that the issue of Ganduje's suspension is a bygone and has not succeeded.\n\nHe said that the same court that affirmed the suspension is the same court that reversed it and restrained anyone from affirming the suspension.\n\n\"The issue of suspension is now a bygone, it is no more because it has since been resolved. They sorted a court order affirming their claim which has since been restrained by yet another order from the same court. That issue has since been dealt with.\n\n\"There is nothing like suspension of our National Chairman by any group or individuals. Those behind it have failed.\n\n\"We have dealt with the situation since when we revealed to the world that they were impersonators and were sponsored by some disgruntled elements\" he explained.\n\nOn the intention of the Kwankwasiyya faction of the New Nigeria People's Party (NNPP) joining the ruling APC, the spokesperson confirmed that the APC is a mega party and has the federal government while the NNPP only boasts of having Kano. Like other smaller parties across the country, the NNPP would also want to join the APC. But their problem is coming under the leadership of the immediate past Governor of Kano state Abdullahi Ganduje, the National Chairman.\n\n\"On the issue of whether the Kwankwasiyya faction of the NNPP want to join the ruling APC, is something very clear. The ruling APC is a party all over the country with majority all the sectors. Whereas the NNPP has only Kano state. So it is obvious that not only the NNPP but other small parties from other states want to join the APC to become part of the mega party.\n\n\"The Kwankwasiyya Movement and the NNPP wants to join the APC but are afraid of the National Chairman, Abdullahi Ganduje, they see him as a threat to their interest. If they join the party they will be under him, at the state level he will be the party leader because he is the National Chairman of the party, these are all not in their interest.\n\n\"We the members of the party believe that if they want to join the APC they have to come through the National Chairman Abdullahi Ganduje and have to be loyal to him, and this is what they are seeing as their problem\" he explained.\n\nHe finally dismissed any possiblity of arrangements between president Bola Tinubu and the NNPP, saying it is only when they join the party that such can be known.\n\n\"On the issue of whether there is any agreement with the president Bola Tinubu, cannot be clarified. This is because they are yet to join the APC and are yet to show any direct intention of joining the party. Until they join, we cannot answer this question.\n\n\"If there is going to be any negotiations or agreements, they will have to be with our National Chairman Abdullahi Ganduje. It is with him that they have to negotiate and agree to join the party not with anyone else\" he stated.\n\nConcerning the allegations against the New Nigeria People's Party (NNPP) that they are the masterminds behind the Ganduje's tribulations, the part chairman of the party Hashimu Dungurawa, dismissed the claims that they have nothing to do with the APC in the same way as the former Kano governor declared that he has nothing to do with the Kwankwasiyya Movement.\n\n\"The truth here is that the APC are not being fair to their oppositions in any way. These patriotic young Ward leaders of the APC in Ganduje Ward, who were convinced of the corrupt acts of former governor Ganduje and how he is involved in bribery and corruption, they decided to save the image and integrity of the APC by suspending him from the party at the ward pending when it is clarified that he is innocent.\n\n\"This action of theirs is for the purpose of clearing the image and integrity of the APC which is affected by the corruption charges against the National Chairman of the party.\n\n\"They are disturbed by this problem despite their party having Senators, Rep members, state assembly members and others and yet the party is is faced with such calamity.\n\n\"These ward leaders are not happy with the way Ganduje has tarnished the image of the party in the state. He wrongly sold government property including schools, hospitals, market places and worship places.\n\n\"These young APC ward leaders are not happy with Ganduje at all. They now saw that the Kano state governor Abba Kabir Yusuf has opened investigations on the former governor and is seen to have a lot of skeletons in his cupboard, they decided to react which they did at the right time.\n\n\"They want him to be removed from the position of National Chairman pending the the completion of the cases and allegations against him. This will help the transparency in the process.\n\n\"They have done this at the right time such that the court has even issued and order to that effect. We wish to thank these young Ward leaders for their patriotism and call on them to also extend the same to all those involved in corrupt practices in their party.\n\n\"Concerning the issue of our leader Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso joining the APC, there is nothing the Ganduje will say that I will believe him except if he says there is only one God, I will believe that, but not any other thing.\n\n\"There is something Ganduje used to say that he will have nothing to do with the Kwankwasiyya Movement in his life again. In the same light I extend this message to him that we in the NNPP will have nothing to do with the APC in our lives as well. Onto them their deeds and onto us ours, everyone should go face his own.", "source": {"uri": "leadership.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "Leadership"}, "authors": [{"uri": "abdulmumin_murtala@leadership.ng", "name": "Abdulmumin Murtala", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Nigeria_People's_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Nigeria People's Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Progressives_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "All Progressives Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kano_(city)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kano (city)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabiu_Kwankwaso", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rabiu Kwankwaso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kano_State", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kano State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kano State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_governors_of_Kano_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "List of governors of Kano State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bola_Tinubu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bola Tinubu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abba_Kabir_Yusuf", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abba Kabir Yusuf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Senate of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/kwankwaso-and-ganduje.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541042", "eventUri": "eng-9541042", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

But those attacking him mischievously chose to close their eyes to the achievements .\n\n\"Are they now telling us that they were not in the country when Buhari was in charge of the country? Why didn't they talk when many things were not going well during the era of President Buhari ?\n\n\"Now that power has shifted to the other side of the divide ,they have suddenly found their voices ,mounting unsubstantiated allegations and criticisms against President Tinubu,who instructively rallied round Buhari through out his two terms of eight years in office .\n\n\"There was an agreement that gave birth to APC as a strong party in the country and Buhari's emergence was part of that agreement..\n\n\"Same agreement was what led to the emergence of Tinubu as president,.Those who are now at the forefront of criticizing President Tinubu and protesting were those that slipped out of the earlier agreements . And they are trying so hard to bring the President and his supporters down .\n\nPresident Tinubu is working hard to resolve the challenges posed by insecurity in the North, and the result can be seen from the fact that people can now travel freely from Abuja to Kaduna without fear of being attacked as was the case before.\" Kwankwaso stated.\n\nThe APC chieftain emphasised that instead of engaging in misplaced and misguided criticisms ,the Northern elders should rather support the President Tinubu administration to bring the dividends of democracy to the region.\n\n\"They should come out and call for the completion of the Abuja-Kaduna -Kano road,Abuja-Kano-Min na Rail line, AKK Gas Pipelines,Mambila Power Project,Bauchi/Gombe Oil Exploration and many others .Tinubu is ready to do all these and many others for the North .\n\n\"Get your Governors together and go for the development and progress of the region instead of engaging in mischievous criticisms\" Kwankwaso admonished .\n\nAlhaji Iliyasu Kwakwaso further revealed that there were some last minute agreements reached by all parties on Kano political situation before Governor Abba Kabir Yusuf was declared the winner by the Supreme Court .\n\n\"They (NNPP) accepted to join the APC, at the last minute and all agreements including power sharing in the State and Party were made at the last minute.\n\n\"They agreed to all the agreements reached, though behind their boss, for which he was not happy, but had no other choice than to accept ,with some conditions which even himself knew cannot be acceptable to the other side .\n\n\"Now ,the situation is that they, NNPP, are yet to fulfill their own part of the agreement. They have asked for more time, precisely five months to meet their own part of the agreement,which also include joining the APC\n\n\"We loyalist members of APC are not against any opposition party members joining the party .Every body is welcomed to the canopy of the biggest party in Africa,so long as the person is ready to contribute positively to growth and development of the party\" Kwankwaso stated.", "source": {"uri": "thesourceng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Source Magazine"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kano_(city)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kano (city)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bola_Tinubu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bola Tinubu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabiu_Kwankwaso", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rabiu Kwankwaso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammadu_Buhari", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Muhammadu Buhari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Progressives_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "All Progressives Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribal_chief", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tribal chief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kano_State", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kano State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kano State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bello_Matawalle", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bello Matawalle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "States of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdullahi_Umar_Ganduje", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abdullahi Umar Ganduje"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Nigeria_People's_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Nigeria People's Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abba_Kabir_Yusuf", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abba Kabir Yusuf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gombe_State", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gombe State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gombe State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuja", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauchi_State", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bauchi State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bauchi State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaduna", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kaduna"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kaduna"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://thesourceng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Musa-Iliyasu-Kwankwaso-jpg.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541042", "eventUri": "eng-9541042", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

party, which put the party's chairmanship in the zone.\n\nThe letter was endorsed by Muhammed Saidu Etsu, Gbenga Lubem, AbdulGaniyu Lukman, Bagu Bung Jung, Isa Abubakar Imam, and Mohammed Kabiru Idris.\n\nHowever, in an originating summons filed by Etsu, through their counsel, Joshua Oka Obono Obla Esq before an FCT high court on Friday, the group contended that Ganduje's continued chairmanship of the party contravened the provisions of Article 7(vii) and (ix) of the APC Constitution and the consensus reached at the 2022 National Convention held in Abuja, that the national chairman of the APC from 2022 to 2026 must be someone from the North Central geopolitical zone of the country.\n\nThey are asking the court to make an order setting aside the appointment of Ganduje by the APC as the National Chairman of the APC on August 3, 2023 on the ground that the APC \"failed, refused and or neglected to comply with the procedure laid down by Article 31.5 of the APC Constitution.\"\n\nThose joined as the defendants in the suit include Ganduje, the APC, the NEC of the APC and the NWC of the APC.\n\nIn the same vain, the North Central All Progressives Congress (APC) Forum in a suit filed on Monday 6 May before a federal high court in Abuja by their counsel, Ayuba Abdul Esq, is challenging the breach of the party's constitution by the nomination of Ganduje to replace ex-chairman Abdullahi Adamu in 2023.\n\nThe suit joined Ganduje, the APC and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as defendants.\n\nMeantime, no date has been fixed for the hearing of the suits.", "source": {"uri": "thenews-chronicle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News Chronicle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Ganduje was suspended from his ward in Kano, although the matter is currently before the Court of Appeal, his fate however would only be determined by the Supreme Court, being the final court in the country.\n\nUnlike the earlier suit, this fresh suit filed on May 3, came from some aggrieved members of the APC in the North Central geopolitical zone, who felt shortchanged with the appointment of Ganduje from the Northwest.\n\nGanduje, APC, the National Executive Committee (NEC) and the National Working Committee (NWC) of the APC are 1st to 4th defendants respectively, in the suit marked: CV/2258/2024.\n\nThe plaintiff, a former chairmanship aspirant from Nasarawa, Mohammed Etsu, claimed Ganduje's emergence as chairman of the APC last year was done in violation of agreement reached at the party's national convention in 2022, wherein the office of the chairman was zoned to North Central.\n\nHe argued that following the resignation of former Governor Abdullahi Adamu last year as chairman of the party, his successor ought to have come from the North Central zone.\n\nIn the affidavit he deposed to in support of the suit, Etsu submitted that, \"The emergence of Dr. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje is blatantly a violation of the APC Constitution.\"\n\nHe alleged that the NEC and NWC \"in their desperation and frenzy to impose Ganduje on the APC on August 3, 2023, failed to comply with the procedure stipulated in the APC Constitution for the replacement of a National/Zonal Officer in the event of a vacancy.\"\n\nNo date has been fixed for hearing.\n\nMeanwhile aggrieved members of the APC under the platform of Concerned North Central APC Stakeholders, had in a letter signed by Muhammed Saidu Etsu, Gbenga Lubem you AbdulGaniyu Lukman, Bagu Bung Jung, Isa Abubakar Imam, and

Within the last one year of being in office, he has achieved a lot but mischievously those attacking him closed their eyes against the achievements. There were agreements in the past that led to the merger that founded the APC as a political party in the country that began with the emergence of President Buhari.\n\n\"Tinubu fulfilled his part of the agreement satisfactorily by giving all supports. The same agreement led to the emergence of Tinubu as president and he is working hard towards seeing the end of insecurity in the region and the results can be seen in the fact that people can now travel freely between Abuja and Kaduna without fear of being attacked as it was before. We are praying for him to succeed and get his second term in office as former president Muhammadu Buhari ruled the country for a good eight years. Those negative moves have failed on arrival.\n\n\"Rather than engage in mischievous and unproductive missions, they should support Tinubu's administration in bringing the dividend of democracy to the region. They should call for the completion of the Abuja - Kaduna - Kano road, Abuja - Kano - Niger Republic rail line, AKK gas pipelines, Mambilla Power Project, Bauchi/ Gombe oil exploration and many others. Tinubu is ready to do all these and many others for the North. Get your Governors together and work for the development and progress of the region,\" he appealed.\n\nThe former three-time commissioner for Rural and Community Development in Kano state, said the Supreme Court declaration of Governor Abba Yusuf as winner of the 2023 gubernatorial election in Kano state was borne out of an agreement.\n\n\"There was actually a last minute agreement that led to the declaration of Abba Yusuf as the state governor by the Supreme Court which they agreed to and are going to fulfil it. They accepted to join the APC at the last minute and all arrangements including power sharing in the state and the party were made at that last minute,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "blueprint.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "Blueprint Newspapers Limited"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kano_(city)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kano (city)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bola_Tinubu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bola Tinubu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabiu_Kwankwaso", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rabiu Kwankwaso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammadu_Buhari", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Muhammadu Buhari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Progressives_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "All Progressives Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuja", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaduna", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kaduna"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kaduna"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mambilla_Plateau", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mambilla Plateau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gombe_State", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gombe State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gombe State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauchi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bauchi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bauchi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niger", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Niger"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Niger"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bello_Matawalle", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bello Matawalle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "States of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kano_State", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kano State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kano State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://blueprint.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Ahmed-tinubu.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541042", "eventUri": "eng-9541042", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Buhari,was in government,but failed to confronted his regime in a negative form forr good eight years he ruled\n\nHe appealed to the elders in the North in particular to be focussed and work hand in hand with the governor's of the region to bring dividend of democracy to the region as president Tinubu is there for them.\n\n\"Within the last one year of being in office he has achieved a lot but mischievously those attacking him close their eyes against the achievements\" he stated.\n\nHe then asked \" We they tell us ,they are not in the country,why do they they decided not to talk then,but now that the power has been shifted to the South,they were now mounted various unsubstantiated critics against president Tinubu,who had rally round Buhari in his right years of governance\n\nAccording to him,\"There were agreements in the past that led to the merger that founded the ruling APC as a strong political party in the country that began with the emergence of President Buhari.\n\nHe explained that the same agreement was what led to the emergence of Tinubu as president and he fulfilled his part of the agreement satisfactorily by making all the necessary agreements.\n\nKwankwaso disclosed that those behind the protests are the same people that slipped out of the earlier agreements and are now trying to follow channels to bring the president and his men down.\n\n\"Tinubu is working hard towards seeing the end of insecurity in the region and the results can be seen in the fact that people can now travel freely between Abuja and Kaduna without fear of being attacked as it was before\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "peoplesdailyng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Peoples Daily Newspaper"}, "authors": [{"uri": "peoples_daily@peoplesdailyng.com", "name": "Peoples

The President was inaugurated on May 29, 2023 for a four-year tenure and will mark a year in office in the next 23 days, but some chieftains of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) have practically launched an early campaign for his re-election. While such campaigns or endorsements are not new to Nigeria's polity, President of the Senate, Godswill Akpabio, blew the lid of the second term campaign for President Tinubu, while addressing state governors and federal lawmakers, who paid Sallah homage to Tinubu at his residence in Lagos during the Eid el Kabir celebration. \"As you coast home to victory for a second term, may all the governors seated here also coast home to a second term victory in their states,\" Akpabio proclaimed thereby setting the tone for an early push for Tinubu's re-election bid. At the gathering were 27 governors from across party divides, former governors and the leadership of both chambers of the National Assembly - Senate and House of Representatives. As expected, Akpabio's declaration set the stage for other speakers at the event to shower praises on the President.\n\nVice President Kashim Shettima, who spoke on behalf of his principal, not only expressed confidence in Nigeria's economic resurgence under Tinubu's leadership, but noted that the gathering of 27 governors in Lagos along with the legislative leadership is a testament of the President's unifying leadership that transcends ethnic and religious lines. His words: \"Let us unite, rally around our leader, and catapult this nation to a greater pedestal. By December, I hope we will have cause to celebrate. Let us coalesce to take the nation to a greater pedestal. The future of the black man rests on Nigeria to make or mar. Our economy has turned the corner. By the coming months, the economy will roar back to glory.\" Kwara State governor, AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, who also chairs the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF), also praised the President's efforts in stabilizing the economy and improving living conditions. \"We commend your efforts because the ship is gradually turning. We have seen how the exchange rate of the naira against the dollar is coming down. The cost of food is coming down. The dry season harvest is commencing soon. Things are getting better, and there is light at the end of the tunnel,\" he said. Urging President Tinubu to persevere in his efforts towards achieving economic stability, Governor AbdulRazaq expressed gratitude for the support provided by the Federal Government to states, particularly in distributing grains to alleviate food shortages. \"We are here to support you, and we also thank you for the support that you are giving to the sub-nationals. Trucks are wheeling up across the nation, distributing grains. I have received, and most of the states have. \"Because of what you are doing, those who are hoarding food items are releasing them, and that is why the prices of food are coming down,\" he said.\n\nGanduje, Nabbena says no vacancy in 2027\n\nWhile many took Akpabio's declaration with a pinch of salt given that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has not made any pronouncement concerning the 2027 elections , the recent pronouncement by the National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Abdullahi Ganduje that there will be no vacancy in Aso Rock (as the presidential villa is also known) in 2027, when another general election will be due, speaks volume of the scheming that is already going on. Ganduje, who made the assertion, while addressing supporters and some support groups at the party's national secretariat in Abuja, last week, added that the Tinubu administration has been contending with the accumulation of many years of neglect, policy summersaults and other disjointed decisions by previous administrations. Pointing fingers to the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), Ganduje said the leadership of the party and its chieftains are afraid, having been defeated in the last general election and already foreseeing another defeat are now engaged in a propaganda campaign against the leadership of APC.\n\nHis words: \"They are so afraid because we are consolidating. They are so afraid all over the country because we are receiving new entrants into our party. That is creating fears in their minds. They are already eyeing 2027, but at that time, there is no vacancy. Only our president, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, will, Insha Allah, continue as the president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\" The immediate past governor of Kano State, also taunted the leadership of NNPP and its chieftains in the state, accusing them of sponsoring protests and campaigning for his removal as APC national chairman. He described NNPP as a party of failed and arrogant politicians, saying: \"What they are doing is African magic drama in order to convey a failed programme and project by failed politicians. We will not allow them to continue with that. They are also sponsoring pockets of diffident protest from all over the country. They are spending a huge amount of money in order for people to demonstrate against the leadership of our party. \"It is a complete failure from what we have seen all over the country. The whole drama, political rascality, started from Kano with the government. Instead of responding to the yearnings, needs, and demands of the people of Kano State, they decided to divert attention. \"Our eyes are on those who are diverting our attention to political propaganda against the APC. We understand what they are doing. It is a political drama. They are a small party. They are a party that is terribly defeated all over the country. It is a party that is breaking down. It is a party that is a mixture of failed politicians. \"If you follow what is happening in that party, you will find out that it is a party that is sharply divided between those who are authentic members of the party and those who are fake members of the party, individualistic and so arrogant in the management of the political party.\" A former Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the APC, Yekini Nabena, who re-echoed the \"no-vacancy\" position, declared as unachievable, plots by some political parties to unseat President Tinubu in the next election. Nabena, who was reacting to talks of merger and a mega party among some members of the opposition, said: \"The 2027 presidential election will come and go but the presidency will remain in the South and President Bola Tinubu, by God's grace, will continue his good job. If former President Muhammadu Buhari could complete his eight years in office, by the grace of God Almighty, the incumbent, President Bola Tinubu will do the same, not even the talk of mega party or merger can stop him. \"The South must also complete the eight years political arrangement and President Bola Tinubu will do that for the South. The South will not fight one another again for another region to benefit. The era of division in Southern Nigeria is gone for good. The Almighty God will perfect President Bola Ahmed Tinubu's health and grant him wisdom to take the country to the Promised Land. On the move by some chieftains of the APC and the opposition to float a mega party, Nabena said: \"Again, we must also tell the plotters of a mega party and those ones thinking of merger that we are not afraid of any. I am so much hopeful that even before the next election, the results of the ongoing reforms will be evidenced even to the blind, and those plotting mega party or merger will not have option than to accept defeat before the election.\"\n\nSecond term campaign amidst hardship\n\nNo doubt, there is nothing wrong with anyone canvassing for a second term for the President because it is his constitutional right, the worry is that the second term campaign is on the heels of criticisms of some policies of his administration and the wait for him deliver on his campaign promises. President Tinubu had made several promises in the course of interacting with different stakeholders ahead of the 2023 elections. His policy document with the theme: \"Renewed Hope: Action Plan for a Better Nigeria,\" offered directions on his plans for security, economy and foreign policy. On his plans for the economy, Tinubu said he will engage the private sector to drive economic development across the country. He particularly promised to address the conflict between monetary and fiscal policies. He also assured Nigerians that budgeting would be based on the projected spending levels needed to push real annual growth rate above seven per cent, while unemployment rate will be reduced for the economy to be doubled in 10 years. Besides promising to phase out fuel subsidy, which he did on the day of his inauguration, Tinubu also pledged to accelerate full implementation of the Petroleum Industry Act as well as to implement additional favourable policies to attract investment in deep water assets within six months.\n\nOn the forex crisis that impeded the economy over the years, Tinubu stated in the Renewed Hope document: \"To ensure that exchange rate policy harmonises with our goals of optimal growth and job creation driven by industrial, agricultural and infrastructural expansion, we will work with the Central Bank and the financial sector to carefully review and better optimise the exchange rate regime. Our economic policies shall be guided by our desire for a stronger, more stable Naira founded upon a vibrant and productive real economy.\" On agriculture, he said his administration will place emphasis on the use of technology to improve the agricultural sector for better production and contribution to the nation's economy. According to him, \"the Buhari administration has invested heavily in agriculture, providing loans and expanding the country's total acreage of cultivated land. We will build on this, but our focus will be on using technology and expertise to accelerate growth and development by providing the critical infrastructure necessary to achieve the commodity transformations in the agriculture value chain. \"Roads, rail, access to ports, and storage infrastructure are what we require to radically transform the agriculture sector and increase its value to the nation. Providing these will be the areas of our focus so that the full potential of our agro economy can be achieved, and we can reap the benefits in jobs, improved economic opportunities and increased prosperity.\" On power, he said his administration will be committed to energy sufficiency through the reform of the sector. His words: \"Energy supply is another priority. There is no version of the world where Nigeria's ambition for self can be achieved without solving the problem of how to provide energy to homes and businesses across the country.\"\n\nThe education sector was not left out as Tinubu said he will provide student loans and reform the Almajiri system in the northern part of the country. He promised that he would recruit and train more teachers as a way of boosting education; establish technology hubs, where youths can develop technological languages on their own and make a better 21st-century approach to governance in Nigeria. On how he would tackle insecurity that is ravaging almost all parts of the country, he said his administration will establish a highly trained and disciplined anti-terrorist squad to tackle the problem. However, as the President marks one year in office on May 29, Nigerians seems to be running out of patience given the long wait for the Promised Land and the fact that the challenges he promised to tackle still persist. President Tinubu had initially blamed his inability to turns things around within the shortest possible time on the comatose economy he inherited. Although he did not publicly put the blame on Buhari, the belief is that his aides spoke his mind. For instance, there was no doubt that Nuhu Ribadu, a former chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), who is presently serving as National Security Adviser (NSA), spoke the President's mind, when he revealed that Buhari's administration not only looted the country but left it bankrupt before handing over power to Tinubu. Ribadu, who spoke at the Chief of Defence Intelligence, 2023, Annual Conference in November last year, was emphatic that Buhari left no money in the treasury for Tinubu to run the country.\n\nHis words: \"Yes, we're facing budgetary constraints. It is okay for me to tell you. Fine, it is important for you to know that we inherited a difficult situation, literally a bankrupt country, no money, to a point where we can say that all the money we're getting now, we're paying back what was taken. It is serious!\" While many saw reasons with the Tinubu administration's claim of empty treasury in its early days given the huge debt burden (over $103 billion) left by the Buhari administration, many Nigerians are no longer interested in listening to any excuse as a justification for nonperformance. To them, Tinubu was aware of the prevalent situation in the country before he made promises of better life for the citizenry. Matters seem to have been worsened by the belief that he played a major role in bringing Buhari to power. This, perhaps, explained the February protest over high cost of living in some states of the federation. The protest, which started in Minna, the Niger State capital, later spread to other cities across the country Besides the hardship over high cost of living, Nigerians are also grappling with security challenges and the situation has assumed an alarming dimension as emboldened criminal elements have upscale their attacks on citizens, killing and kidnapping for ransom. The states that are worst hit in the renewed killings are Plateau and Benue despite the President's promise in his inaugural speech to \"defend the nation from terror and all forms of criminality that threaten the peace and stability of our country.\"\n\nFear of the opposition\n\nPerhaps, the fear of the opposition is the beginning of wisdom for the APC. The belief is that the ruling party might not want to be caught napping given the way the opposition led by the presidential candidates of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and Labour Party (LP), Atiku Abubakar and Peter Obi have continuously intervened on critical national issues, especially on policies and programmes of the Tinubu administration. To most analysts, the duo kickstarted their respective campaigns for the 2027 election immediately after the Supreme Court judgement that affirmed Tinubu's election. Many had thought that Atiku, a former vice president would quit politics after his bid to upturn President Bola Tinubu's election was dashed by the apex court but he has vowed to fight on for the sake of the country's democracy, which according to him, is on a lifesupport. Addressing a press conference after the Supreme Court judgement, Atiku called for a comprehensive constitutional amendment that will prevent any court or tribunal to hide under technicalities or judicial sophistry to undermine the will of the people. This was he said that what the country is currently dealing with is bigger than one or two presidential elections and certainly bigger than him as well.\n\nHis words: \"I leave Nigerians and the world to decide what to make of the Supreme Court's unfortunate decision. But here's my take. The judgements of the Presidential Election Petition Court (PEPC) and the Supreme Court have very farreaching grave implications. \"It is not about me; it is about our country, Nigeria. It is about the kind of society we want to leave for the next generation and what kind of example we want to set for our children and their children. It is about the reputation of Nigeria and Nigerians. \"Someone asked me what I would do if I lost my election petition appeal at the Supreme Court. In response, I said that as long as Nigeria wins, the struggle would have been worth the while. By that, I meant that the bigger loss would not be mine but Nigeria's if the Supreme Court legitimizes illegality, including forgery, identity theft, and perjury. \"At the current historic moment, the easier option for me would have been to fold up and retreat after the mandate banditry perpetrated by the APC and Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). \"But I went to the Nigerian courts to seek redress. I even went to an American court to help with unravelling what our state institutions charged with such responsibilities were unwilling or unable to do, including unravelling the qualifying academic records of the person sworn in as our President and by implication, hopefully who he really is. \"I offered that evidence procured with the assistance of the American Court to our Supreme Court to help it to do justice in this case. As a stakeholder in the presidential election of February 25, I, along with other well-meaning Nigerians have done my bit in ensuring that our democratic process enjoys the privilege of full disclosure of the character deficiencies of the current political leadership. \"I also believe that even if the Supreme Court believes otherwise, the purpose of technology in our electoral system is to enhance transparency and not merely as a viewing centre. We have to move with the world and not be stuck in time.\" On his resolve to fight on, he declared: \"For as long as I breathe; I will continue to struggle with other Nigerians to deepen our democracy. I will continue to work for the return of political and economic restructuring that the country needs.\" The former vice president has even gone ahead to call for opposition political parties to come together and create a more formidable front that will salvage Nigeria's democracy from sliding into a one-party state. According to him, a formidable coalition is necessary to address the perceived decline in democratic values and to prevent Nigeria from becoming a de facto one-party system.\n\nHe also noted that the project of protecting democracy in the country is not about just one man. His words: \"The project of protecting democracy in our country is not about just one man. But the truth of the matter is that our democracy is fast becoming a one-party system; and, of course, you know that when we have a one-party system, we should just forget about democracy. \"We have all seen how the APC is increasingly turning Nigeria into a dictatorship of one party. If we don't come together to challenge what the ruling party is trying to create, our democracy will suffer for it, and the consequences of it will affect the generations yet unborn.\" Obi, on his part, declared that LP and the Obidient Movement that championed his 2023 presidential bid, is now an effective opposition to the Tinubu-led administration. The LP presidential candidate, had also in his reaction to the judgement of the Supreme Court, which affirmed Tinubu's election, said that LP has moved into effective opposition due to its policies and the governance modalities the party campaigned for prior to the 2023 presidential election. His words: \"Going forward, we in the Labour Party and the Obidient Movement are now effectively in opposition. We are glad that the nation has heard us loud and clear. We shall now expand the confines of our message of hope to the rest of the country. We shall meet the people in the places where they feel pain and answer their needs for hope. At marketplaces, motor parks, town halls, board rooms, and university and college campuses, we will all carry and deliver the message of a new Nigeria. \"As stakeholders and elected Labour Party officials, we shall remain loyal to our manifesto. We will continue to canvas for good governance and focus on issues that promote national interest, unity, and cohesion. We will continue to give primacy to our constitution, the rule of law, and the protection of ordered liberties. We will offer the checks and balances required in a functional democracy and vie robustly in forthcoming elections to elect those who share our vision of a new Nigeria. \"Given our present national circumstances, there is a compelling need for a strong political opposition. We shall, therefore, remain in opposition, especially because of the policies and the governance modalities that we in the Labour Party campaigned for, especially reducing the cost of governance, moving the nation from consumption to production, reducing inflation, ending insecurity, promoting the rule of law, guaranteeing the responsibility to protect, and stabilizing the Nigerian currency; are clearly not the priorities of the present administration nor is it interested in achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nThe LP presidential candidate, who garnered 6.1 million votes to place third in the February 25 presidential election that was won by Tinubu with 8.7 million votes, while Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) came second with 6.9 million votes, expressed optimism over what he described as a \"New Nigeria,\" which LP and the Obidient Movement fought for in the last elections. No doubt, Obi has so far walked his talk on keeping the ruling party on its toes, but his cross-country tour and consultation of relevant stakeholders across political, ethnic and religious divides speak volume of his plan for 2027. Besides the plot by Atiku and Obi, there also moves by some chieftains of the APC that points to the fact that they may either front an aspirant who will challenge Tinubu for the 2027 ticket or pull out of the party and possibly rock the boat for the President and his supporters. Fingers are already pointing to the immediate past governor of Kaduna State, Mallam Nasir el-Rufai, in this regard over his recent meeting with the leadership of the Social Democratic Party (SDP). El-Rufai's move may have informed why a former spokesman of the Atiku Campaign Organisation, Segun Sowunmi, cautioned President Tinubu against betraying the former Kaduna State governor and his Kogi State counterpart, Yahaya Bello, if he's interested in contesting for a second term. In a statement he signed, the PDP chieftain noted that the poor treatment meted to El-Rufai and Bello by the Tinubu's government goes against the long-term understanding between the Yoruba and the North. His words: \"Upon reflection on the trajectory of President Tinubu and his journey to the presidency, I find my mind wondering if my Yoruba Uncle is still the same person that I have always known and admired. \"You might need to think through this to understand me. The Yorubas already carry misconceptions about betrayal; that we don't keep our end of the bargain.

Not a few believe that the party which came with various promises to Nigerians has dashed their hopes and expectations.\n\nFor the majority, the situation has not changed under President Bola Tinubu's administration which came with the mantra of Renewed Hope. In the estimation of critical observers, there are obvious failure in economic management, security, provision of social amenities, and hike in the cost of living.\n\nIn the rating of many Nigerians, the failure of APC in both checkmating the crisis engulfing its leadership and management of resources in the country, reflecting in the excruciating economic woes and hopelessness, have become an emergency.\n\nIn fact, in the words of former APC Vice Chairman North-West, Salihu Moh Lukman, \"Without being academic, performances of APC, in every respect, have not presented any harmonised vision of development. It is a very disturbing reality that there is no common policy thread connecting governments produced by the APC at all levels since 2015.\n\n\"During the merger negotiations of 2012/2013, which produced the APC, the ideological thrust or proposition was oriented around social democracy, based on a commitment to values of collective justice and individual freedom where citizen's basic needs are expected to be met - food, shelter, healthcare, education, and the ability to actualise human capacities and endowment.\"\n\nHighlighting specifics about the failure of APC to deliver on democratic dividends and live up to the expectations of many since nine years in charge, the recent admission by Vice President Kashim Shettima that; \"this is the most difficult time to occupy political leadership in Nigeria due to the challenges facing the country.\"\n\nThe confession, for many, clearly confirmed the magnitude of uncertainty, helplessness and anomie that the ruling party has plunged the country into. And what reasons did Shettima adduce to further exasperate the unpleasant reality the APC-led government has sunk the country into?\n\nHear him: \"The President (Tinubu) chose the option that will save the lives of the people instead of the ones that will lead to a prolonged economic death. We will not resort to blaming the previous administration as leadership is about courage and continuity.\n\n\"Before we took charge, the biggest elephant in the room was about fuel subsidy removal. It was an albatross around the neck of the nation for the past 20 to 30 years. We understood why our predecessor decided to remove the subsidy because there was no sufficient budget for it in the fiscal year.\n\n\"A year before we took office, Nigeria's debt service to revenue ratio had grown to 111.18 per cent. It was an economic death sentence. To be plain to us, our debt service was that if you earn N100,000, you are forced to borrow an additional N11,800 to pay the debtor.\n\n\"How do we intend to survive this? It will be long before we become a pariah. We have to jettison the subsidy regime; it was a bitter pill to swallow but we had to do it.\"\n\nAs Nigerians were pondering on Shettima's admission, which was an indictment on the APC government and a departure from the usual traditional blame of the opposition party, typified in the eight years of former president Muhammadu Buhari's consistent attacks on the PDP, the earlier comments from officials of the present administration further confirmed the failure of the APC government.\n\nOnly recently, National Security Adviser (NSA), Nuhu Ribadu, had taken the Buhari-led administration to the cleaners although they are of the same party, in claiming that the Tinubu-led government inherited a bankrupt country from the Buhari administration.\n\nHe said: \"I assure you that the Federal Government will not rest on its oars in ensuring a robust and viable defence management and security apparatus to address contemporary challenges even in the face of enormous budgetary constraints.\n\n\"Yes, we are facing budgetary constraints. It is okay for me to tell you. Fine, it is important for you to know that we inherited a very difficult situation, literally a bankrupt country, with no money, to a point where we can say that all the money we are getting now; we are paying back what was taken. It is serious!\" Ribadu painted gloomy pictures of the tragic situation facing the country presently.\"\n\nAlso highlighting the failure of the party while further dragging Buhari into the blame game was the Minister of Finance and Coordinating Minister of the Economy, Wale Edun.\n\nEdun claimed that former president Buhari landed Nigeria into the hyperinflation bedevilling it now, revealing that the printing of naira in trillions was carried out without matching it with productivity. He further argued that the eight years of printing money without productivity is responsible for the high inflation confronting the country now.\n\n\"We talked about inflation, and you have helped to solve that. Where has it come from? It came from eight years of just printing money not matched by productivity. It is not like when you earn dollars, and you free the naira alongside it, although there is even a better way than that; however, that is still not as bad.\n\n\"It is not as if the money is matched by productivity increase in output. It is not. And what happened was that for eight years, the weak were left to their own devices. It is the privileged few that took everything,\" he claimed.\n\nFurther rising in defence of the current administration that directly or indirectly confirmed the failure of APC, some of Tinubu's supporters like the former Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II and Pan Yoruba socio-cultural group, Afenifere, also blamed the Buhari-led APC government for the current economic crisis.\n\nAfenifere, in defence of her son, not only alleged that the \"economic downturn\" facing Nigerians was caused by the mismanagement of the administration of former president Buhari, but also faulted those criticising Tinubu, insisting that they are still pained by his electoral victory.\n\n\"Those sleeping and snoring during the eight years of Buhari APC administration have suddenly woken up. They forgot that these remedial actions should have been taken many years back. The major sins of President Tinubu reside in his daring to contest and win the presidential election,\" Afenifere argued\n\nHowever, the justification of APC's failure through the blame games and defence will not come to many Nigerians that have borne the brunt as any surprise because according to many political watchers, the ruling party which merged for purposes of electoral victory, was not a truly progressive party.\n\nAnd instead of accepting criticisms and changing for the better, APC has always adopted buck passing as its trademark in close to a decade of its existence. For eight years under former president Buhari, it put almost the shortcomings his government recorded on the doorstep of the opposition political party, especially the PDP.\n\nJudging by the testimonies from the officials and supporters of the Tinubu-led APC administration, it is glaring that the ruling party under Buhari failed in the economic management, security and several other campaign promises he did not actualise.\n\nBut instead of admitting failure, it rather used the PDP as a scapegoat to whip up the sentiments of many Nigerians in justifying why it did not meet their expectations.\n\nThe defenders of the Buhari government would repeatedly remind Nigerians how it was impossible to work freely in Abuja during PDP years without bombs exploding and how many Local Government Areas (LGAs) hitherto under the control of militant Islamist and jihadist rebel group, Boko Haram, have been freed.\n\nThey would boldly boast how the Buhari government has technically defeated Boko Haram and that they could no longer mount 'conventional attacks' against security forces or populated centres.\n\nThe party promised national security by increasing the capacity and capability of the Nigerian military, police and other security agencies through the employment of additional personnel, provision of modern equipment, and commitment to professionalism, merit and excellence, in meeting the needs of Nigeria's growing population.\n\nThe unfulfilled promises of the APC government in the past nine years were evidenced in the inability of the ruling party at the centre to fulfill the promise to spend N148 billion in providing an average of 200 patrol vehicles per annum to state police commands and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nAs a party claiming to be progressive in ideology, many wonder why the APC delivered on its promises in the areas of rule of law, electoral process, true federalism, education, health, youths, sports, entertainment, social safety net, and economic development policies since it took over after the 2015 presidential election.\n\nThere are those who insist that if Nigerians tolerated what many described as eight locust years of the APC, the past one year, under the same ruling party, has been horrendous and traumatic to most people.\n\nFrom the removal of fuel subsidy and its attendant backlash on the economy to the dollar gaining strength over the naira, the hyperinflation and the high cost of living, the APC-led government has actually disappointed and dashed the hopes of many Nigerians in terms of administering the country.\n\nBut those agonising that APC, with big prospects, could disappoint in the governance of the country, would be more shocked that the ruling party equally failed to organise itself, considering the internal crisis within its leadership.\n\nFor example, APC may have had a more rapid turnover of national chairmen in the decade of its existence than other political parties. From Bisi Akande, the pioneer chairman, John Odigie-Oyegun, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, Governor Mai Mala-Buni, to Abdullahi Adamu and now Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, only about a few of them were not disgraced out of office after spending few years.\n\nHow again does one measure the failure of APC when all the organs of the party could not function as they statutorily ought to? Disappointingly, since 2015 when the Board of Trustees (BoT) was dissolved and renamed Elders Council, it has become extremely difficult for the national leaders of the party to constitute the members.\n\nAbove all, over the years, lack of internal democracy within the party has become insoluble resulting in one form of crisis or the other festering in the party at the ward, LGA, State and national levels, especially after every major election with many aggrieved aspirants protesting the imposition of candidates accounting for the majority of the cases.\n\nSurprisingly, the stark reality is that after APC emerged victorious in the 2015 presidential election, the ruling party became a mere tool in the hands of the President to the point that he dictated to the party what he wanted to be done and how it could be done. Till date, the President is the alpha and omega in APC and the APC is the President.\n\nSummarising how APC has disgracefully become a failed party, former member of its National Working Committee (NWC), Lukman noted that: \"Nigerians expect that APC, being an envisioned progressive party, elected leaders produced by the APC will change and put the country on the pedestal of good governance.\n\n\"Integral to good governance is increased accountability based on which elected representatives produced by the APC are expected to be more responsive and representative to the interests of Nigerians. Increased accountability requires the existence of a functionally stronger political party.\n\n\"Before the emergence of the APC, virtually all political parties in Nigeria, including the PDP and the opposition parties that merged to form the APC, were simply election platforms. Being election platforms, issues of vision and commitment to ideology as could have been outlined in the manifesto of political parties is simply non-existent.\n\n\"With such reality, the culture of impunity and corruption became rampant, and Nigerians were highly contemptuous of political leaders in the country. Largely on account of widespread abuse of office, which is highly manifested by the sad incidences of elected leaders converting public resources to personal wealth, the capacity of governments at all levels to spearhead national development shrunk.\n\n\"The emergence of APC raised the hopes of Nigerians about the potential for change. Coming with the slogan CHANGE, part of also what justified the confidence of Nigerians that APC would produce a paradigm shift in Nigerian politics and governance was that the internal debate within the party during the merger negotiations aggregated national debate.\n\n\"In many respects, the manifesto of the party and all the campaign promises before the 2015 general elections resonated with the aspirations of Nigerians. Immediately after winning the 2015 elections, the APC began to move away from its orientation of working as an organised group, holding meetings, debating issues, and taking decisions accordingly.\"\n\nAssessing his party further, the former Director General of APC Progressive Governors Forum (PGF) wrote: \"Perhaps, largely on account of the towering political profile of former president Buhari, whose popularity was the major electoral strength of APC, gradually and systematically, decisions and initiatives towards managing the APC government began to be personalised.\n\n\"Issues of appointments and policy priorities of the APC government became the prerogative of the President. As a result, party leaders who were major stakeholders and equal partners before the electoral victory of 2015 became subordinates of former president Buhari.\n\n\"Consequently, most leaders were relegated to being lobbyists for appointments in APC controlled Federal Government. Once that is the case, issues of party management took the back seat. Meetings of organs, especially, the National Executive Committee (NEC) and National Caucus became irregular.\n\n\"The NEC, which by the provision of the APC Constitution is required to meet quarterly, for almost a year after the 2015 general elections did not hold. Similarly, the National Caucus, which before the 2015 elections was meeting almost weekly stopped. The BoT, whose membership was established before the 2015 elections was never inaugurated.\"\n\nBut, in the reaction of another chieftain of the party, who preferred anonymity, the trend of the president taking charge of the ruling party did not start with the APC.\n\n\"Don't forget that a greater number of what constitutes the APC now were formally from other political parties, especially the PDP. How do you expect a total and automatic transformation from them in APC? Most political parties in Nigeria lacking ideology should expectedly be a tool in the hands of the sitting president.\n\n\"As for whether the APC has failed Nigerians, it is a yes and no answer because you cannot just wish away the landmark achievements the party recorded in the areas of infrastructural development in the road and railway sectors. But I also know that our party would have done better in lifting Nigerians from the current hardship experienced in every facet of our lives.", "source": {"uri": "sunnewsonline.com", "dataType":

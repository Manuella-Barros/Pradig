On 4 July, if Scots wanted independence, then a vote for the SNP was the way to achieve it, he said. Victory in a majority of Scottish seats would, said Swinney, mean a mandate for him to 'embark on negotiations with the UK government to turn the democratic wishes of people in Scotland into a reality'.\n\nThe most unquestioning of Scottish nationalists might buy this stuff, but to anyone else it's patently nonsense.\n\nOn the day Rishi Sunak called the General Election, the nationalists held 41 of 59 Scottish constituencies. Every poll published this year shows the SNP dropping seats (there will be 57 in the next parliament following boundary changes). Not even Swinney seriously believes the nationalists' can lose MPs next month and claim the result as a victory for independence.\n\nThe SNP could win every seat and that still wouldn't give Swinney a mandate to begin independence negotiations. The Scottish government has spent a fortune establishing in court that the power to hold a referendum on the constitution lies firmly with Westminster. If, post 4 July, Swinney tells prime minister Keir Starmer that he has a mandate to begin negotiations on independence, Starmer will be entitled to reply 'No, you don't' and that will be the end of that.\n\nOf course, Swinney's promise to his supporters - and this was a message for the most loyal Nats - was carefully worded. Is a negotiation to 'turn the democratic wishes of the people of Scotland into a reality' the same as a negotiation to break up the Union or a negotiation to establish a referendum? No, it's not.\n\nThe SNP manifesto launch was pitched at the original fanbase, at those nationalists who were around in the pre-success days. With his party losing support to Scottish Labour and Alex Salmond, now leader of the Alba party/vanity project, harrying his former colleagues for failing to progress the independence cause, Swinney was keen to tickle the tummies of the true believers.\n\nBeyond promising things he will not be able to to deliver on the constitution, Swinney's big pitch to voters was on the NHS. If Scots got behind SNP candidates, they'd campaign at Westminster for the next government to increase spending on the NHS.\n\nNationalist MPs, said Swinney, would pressure the UK government to invest at least another \u00a36billion in the NHS to match recent pay deals struck with healthcare staff in Scotland. The SNP also wants a boost of NHS spending in England of at least \u00a310billion-a-year to 'address rampant inflationary pressures and improve performance'.\n\nNow, because you're a clever cove, you will be asking what business it is of the SNP how any UK government chooses to run the NHS? Health is fully devolved to Holyrood. Every aspect of the NHS in Scotland is under the control of the Scottish government.\n\nThe reason Swinney wants this extra spending in England is because it would have financial consequences for Scotland. The Barnett Formula, drawn up in 1978, is the mechanism the Treasury uses to calculate and distribute funds across the UK. Scotland benefits disproportionately from Barnett. In 2018/19, for example, public expenditure per head in England was \u00a39,296, while in Scotland it was \u00a311,242. The SNP wants to make the most of Barnett to fill Holyrood's coffers.\n\nThe First Minister's message to voters as polling day approaches is a masterclass in inconsistency. Vote SNP for independence, says John Swinney, but also to enjoy the fruits of the Union.", "source": {"uri": "spectator.us", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectator USA"}, "authors": [{"uri":

So it cannot be out of office quick enough in my view.\n\n\"I think it is an absolute certainty that the Labour Party will win the election in England, and I hope people in Scotland will recognise the importance of having strong SNP voices in the House of Commons who will argue for decisions to be made in Scotland for Scotland and will put the interests of people in Scotland first.\"\n\nMr Swinney also said that when he became party leader at a \"difficult time\" just over six weeks ago, he was tasked with rebuilding the trust of the Scottish people and with improving people's lives.\n\nMr Swinney also highlighted the importance of Scottish independence and of rejoining the EU to his party's domestic agenda, and made his arguments for independence clear when asked whether he would settle for more devolved powers instead.\n\nMr Swinney said: \"I'm never going to say \"no\" to more powers for the Scottish Parliament. But what I want to be able to do is to do the things that will transform people's lives.\n\n\"I want to live in a fairer, more equal country.

And when you look at those countries, they are more prosperous, they are more equal, they are fairer than Scotland and the United Kingdom.\n\n\"And that's a prize I think people in Scotland are attracted to and want to make sure happens for our country.\"\n\nWhen one audience member asked him whether he would keep holding referenda \"until you get what you want\", he said politicians should set out what they \"actually believe in\" and let people decide, and that he was a democrat who respected \"the right of the people of Scotland to decide their own future\".\n\nFiona Bruce repeatedly challenged him on what it would mean for his democratic mandate for independence if the SNP failed to win a majority of Scottish seats in July given, she suggested, it would be a \"democratic decision that you shouldn't be pursuing independence\".\n\nWhen he repeated that he wanted people in Scotland to confidently vote for the SNP so the party could turn its manifesto into reality, she voiced her conclusion that he was not going to answer the question.\n\nHe was also asked why the SNP had backtracked on its opposition to new oil and gas licences, and he said that while the need to transition to net zero was \"absolutely inescapable\" it would be necessary to use fossil fuels \"for some time to come\".\n\nHe added that any new licences would be assessed on a case-by-case basis and would have to be \"compatible with our objectives on climate change\", saying issues like energy security would form part of this consideration.", "source": {"uri": "guernseypress.com", "dataType": "news",

an increase of one percentage point from the last poll in late May.\n\nSupport for the SNP remained on 33%.\n\nThe Scottish Conservatives dropped two points in the latest poll to 15%, with the survey coming in the wake of Douglas Ross's decision to stand down as party leader after July 4 following his bid to seek re-election to Westminster in place of ill colleague David Duguid.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats remain on 7%, the poll shows, while a further 7% of those questioned said they will vote for another party.\n\nThe two biggest parties also remain almost inseparable in Holyrood support, the poll suggests, with both increasing their share of the vote by one point in constituencies to 36% for the SNP and 35% for Labour.\n\nThe SNP has dropped one point and Labour remains stagnant on the regional list - putting both parties on 29%.\n\nThe Tories, meanwhile, dropped one and two points on the constituency and list vote respectively, with both settling at 16%.\n\nThe Scottish Greens increased their list vote by two points to 12%, while the Lib Dems dropped one point to 7% in constituencies but remain on 10% in the list vote.\n\nEmma Levin, an associate director at Savanta, said the SNP appears to have ended its \"downward spiral\" but Labour could return as the country's largest party on July 4 if the findings are replicated.\n\n\"Our latest Scottish voting intention suggests a stable picture, with Labour's narrow lead in Scotland relatively unchanged since before the election campaign and John Swinney's elevation to First Minister,\" she said.\n\n\"The SNP appear to have successfully stopped their downward spiral, but this would still mean that Scotland would contribute to a UK-wide majority for Labour.\n\n\"If nothing changes between now and polling day, Anas Sarwar and Keir Starmer will have overseen Labour's return to their previously long-established position as Scotland's largest party.\n\n\"It's more than both men could've hoped for, even several years ago.\"\n\nScottish Labour leader deputy leader Jackie Baillie said: \"The only poll that matters is on the 4th of July, but it is clear that people are looking to Scottish Labour to deliver the change Scotland needs.\n\n\"Scots are tired of SNP incompetence and division.\n\n\"In fourteen days we will have the opportunity to finally get rid of this Tory Government -

So it cannot be out of office quick enough in my view.\n\n\"I think it is an absolute certainty that the Labour Party will win the election in England, and I hope people in Scotland will recognise the importance of having strong SNP voices in the House of Commons who will argue for decisions to be made in Scotland for Scotland and will put the interests of people in Scotland first.\"\n\nMr Swinney also said that when he became party leader at a \"difficult time\" just over six weeks ago, he was tasked with rebuilding the trust of the Scottish people and with improving people's lives.\n\nHe said the SNP is committed to eradicating child poverty and strengthening the economy, as well as pledging to \"put in the resources\" to address immediate problems like NHS waiting lists.\n\nMr Swinney also highlighted the importance of Scottish independence and of rejoining the EU to his party's domestic agenda, and made his arguments for independence clear when asked whether he would settle for more devolved powers instead.\n\nMr Swinney said: \"I'm never going to say \"no\" to more powers for the Scottish Parliament. But what I want to be able to do is to do the things that will transform people's lives.\n\n\"I want to live in a fairer, more equal country. I want to live in a country that prioritises the improvement of our economy and strengthening the rights and the responsibilities of people in our country. I don't think that can be achieved for us in the United Kingdom.\n\n\"I want Scotland to be like Denmark, or Ireland, or Sweden as an independent country. And when you look at those countries, they are more prosperous, they are more equal, they are fairer than Scotland and the United Kingdom.\n\n\"And that's a prize I think people in Scotland are attracted to and want to make sure happens for our country.\"\n\nWhen one audience member asked him whether he would keep holding referenda \"until you get what you want\", he said politicians should set out what they \"actually believe in\" and let people decide, and that he was a democrat who respected \"the right of the people of Scotland to decide their own future\".\n\nFiona Bruce repeatedly challenged him on what it would mean for his democratic mandate for independence if the SNP failed to win a majority of Scottish seats in July given, she suggested, it would be a \"democratic decision that you shouldn't be pursuing independence\".\n\nWhen he repeated that he wanted people in Scotland to confidently vote for the SNP so the party could turn its manifesto into reality, she voiced her conclusion that he was not going to answer the question.\n\nHe was also asked why the SNP had backtracked on its opposition to new oil and gas licences, and he said that while the need to transition to net zero was \"absolutely inescapable\" it would be necessary to use fossil fuels \"for some time to come\".\n\nHe added that any new licences would be assessed on a case-by-case basis and would have to be \"compatible with our objectives on climate change\", saying issues like energy security would form part of this consideration.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

Since the SNP won't provide the next prime minister, they don't need fully costed plans. And of course, since Westminster politics is so hopelessly right-wing, adversarial and short-term, Swinney doesn't need to be Che Guevara to sound revolutionary.\n\nREAD MORE: SNP launch General Election manifesto with pledge to 'deliver independence'\n\nEven beginning the manifesto launch with a description of the SNP as a \"moderate, left of centre party\", delivered in that softly-spoken, managerial Scots brogue still sounded vaguely radical.\n\nAfter all, the SNP are the only big party to match policies to mainstream Scottish thinking - clearly and happily to the left of English voters But beyond that low bar, how to judge the performance of the manifesto and the man?\n\nFirstly, Swinney's presentation was assured, clanger-free and somehow very Scottish.\n\nThe First Minister moved into top gear raging over Labour's refusal to axe the two-child benefit cap: \"Why is beyond me. It's a simple test. Are you in government to help kids out of poverty or so morally lost you push them in?\"\n\nThis was Swinney at his strongest, sounding like a mix of Dr Findlay (one for the teenagers), Andy Murray and Canon Kenyon Wright - a polite, trustworthy and utterly exasperated by the political meanness of his opponents. Of course, it's a mistake to judge a book by its cover.\n\nAnd I'm certain the SNP leader is as much of a wheeler-dealer as the rest when necessary. His open-faced, genial default masks an ability - indeed an instinct - to tear the heid off any opposition.\n\nBut despite provocation from the full gamut of the media at the launch, he managed to keep smiling.\n\nA second measure of success - did Swinney close down Labour's claims about the SNP and establish credentials progressive enough to deter any wandering voters?\n\nWell, he gave it a good try. Scottish Labour wants voters to believe that Swinney in Edinburgh and Rishi Sunak in Westminster are - to use the vernacular - two cheeks of the same arse. Equally bad. Equally bad, duplicitous and incompetent.\n\nEven a cursory glance at government policy makes that contention utterly absurd.\n\nAnd I'd guess the more Anas Sarwar trots out his \"peas in a pod\" line, the harder that line will fall. But even if the idea of government equivalence is absurd, a spirited rebuttal of Holyrood incompetence must still be made.\n\nMeanwhile, the SNP must persuade voters that Labour are lying when they say NHS privatisation will happen over their dead bodies. Yes, they concede, Labour will use spare private capacity when the NHS is full.\n\nWhich sounds quite reasonable. But no private operator can keep beds and staff vacant and waiting - just in case.\n\nThis could only possibly work if private health providers are given a minimum income guarantee. And that's got to be more expensive than just financing the NHS properly in the first place.\n\nIt smacks of the same inverted logic and awful outcomes of Labour's last wheeze for improving services without taxing wealth. Colin Fox wrote an excellent column about PFI recently quoting Professor Allyson Pollock, its leading critic: \"PFI is where you pay for three NHS hospitals and get one - and even that doesn't belong to you.\"\n\nWith Labour's covert NHS plans to keep the private sector on permanent standby, here we go again. It would be great to see the SNP leadership push much harder and press for more detail on this one.\n\nA third aspect of the SNP manifesto \"success\" is whether it highlighted the enduring reality of Britain's underfunded public services under Tony Blair, Gordon Brown or any of the Tory PMs. And it did - a bit.\n\nAmazingly, a Scottish BBC correspondent explained for the first time I can remember that whilst health is devolved to Holyrood at an operational level, funding is entirely reserved to London.\n\nREAD MORE: Three polls predict General Election winner in every UK constituency\n\nThus, if the Westminster government spends more on public services, Scotland gets more too - but the reverse is also true. A point made succinctly by none other than Wes Streeting with reference to Wales, when he pointed out all funding leads back to Westminster. Indeed, it does.\n\nThe SNP needs to keep delivering these political reality checks.\n\nStephen Flynn, on Politics Live at lunchtime, was asked by presenter Jo Coburn why Westminster should give Scotland any more money with its record waiting lists?\n\nI didn't register the answer - raging from the implication that Scotland exists only as a mix of Oliver Twist asking for more and a naughty teenager looking for a pocket money raise.\n\nAfter Flynn's (below) riposte about GB Energy in an earlier debate - It's not GB Energy. It's Scotland's energy and we want more than an HQ, we want control - I was really hoping he would turn the tables again and challenge the whole idea that benevolent English MPs are bailing out poor, broken, dependent and deluded little Scotland.\n\nPerhaps that level of challenge is hard to deliver in the five minutes BBC network devotes to (evidently) boring old Scotland.\n\nThough to be fair, the BBC news channel put 100% more effort and analysis into the SNP launch yesterday than Radio Scotland whose newsroom had already mentally moved east to ponder every aspect of our chances in Germany.\n\nSo finally - independence policy. Did it get mentioned and did the new strategy stack up?\n\nWell yes and no.\n\nSwinney spoke with enthusiasm and at greater length about independence at a manifesto launch than I can remember, effectively rebutting the either/or approach favoured by the media.\n\n\"Never let anyone tell you independence is separate from people's everyday concerns. It is fundamental to [resolving] them.\"\n\nHe put flesh on the bones of what an indy Scotland would look like with a constitutional right to NHS treatment and Westminster's creeping privatisation agenda along with its hostility to migrants - both over for good.\n\nNo austerity. No Trident. Bairns not bombs.\n\nBut the SNP leader was on the ropes over whether a failure to \"win\" on July 4 would mean the people have spoken and don't want the Scottish Government to pursue an independence agenda - the logical flip-side of his insistence that winning will enable talks with Number 10 over another indyref.\n\nThe SNP leader suggested several times that the gold standard was the 2021 Holyrood election where a majority of pro-indy MSPs were elected, only for that mandate to be ignored.\n\nREAD MORE: Everything the SNP manifesto says about Scottish independence\n\nHe justified that emphasis by adding a D - democracy - to his existing ABC list of election grievances on austerity, Brexit and the cost of living crisis. Fine - but the questioners are right. Either winning this election in Scotland matters, or it doesn't.\n\nThe new stance didn't quite add up - but then neither does the Labour Party automatically vetoing indyref2, however Scots actually vote.\n\nIn the end, the biggest problem will be persuading voters that an SNP victory in Scotland matters enough to fight for - and that's tough.\n\nIt's an election in difficult circumstances and although Swinney in his previous guises may have contributed to the loss of SNP trust he is now trying to make up, his ducking and weaving around the contradictions of his party's stances appeared elegant enough.\n\nMaybe the only manifesto message that really matters is the game is still on, and a narrow SNP win still possible. The latest polls have the SNP and Labour even and YouGov suggests the SNP has halved the gap with Labour over the last two weeks.\n\nMomentum is with the SNP.\n\nHow will they generate enough excitement now to keep that ball rolling?", "source": {"uri": "www-tmp.thenational.scot", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

But what I want to be able to do is to do the things that will transform people's lives.\n\n\"I want to live in a fairer, more equal country. I want to live in a country that prioritises the improvement of our economy and strengthening the rights and the responsibilities of people in our country. I don't think that can be achieved for us in the United Kingdom.\n\n\"I want Scotland to be like Denmark, or Ireland, or Sweden as an independent country. And when you look at those countries, they are more prosperous, they are more equal, they are fairer than Scotland and the United Kingdom.\n\n\"And that's a prize I think people in Scotland are attracted to and want to make sure happens for our country.\"\n\nWhen one audience member asked him whether he would keep holding referenda \"until you get what you want\", he said politicians should set out what they \"actually believe in\" and let people decide, and that he was a democrat who respected \"the right of the people of Scotland to decide their own future\".\n\nFiona Bruce repeatedly challenged him on what it would mean for his democratic mandate for independence if the SNP failed to win a majority of Scottish seats in July given, she suggested, it would be a \"democratic decision that you shouldn't be pursuing independence\".\n\nWhen he repeated that he wanted people in Scotland to confidently vote for the SNP so the party could turn its manifesto into reality, she voiced her conclusion that he was not going to answer the question.\n\nHe was also asked why the SNP had backtracked on its opposition to new oil and gas licences, and he said that while the need to transition to net zero was \"absolutely inescapable\" it would be necessary to use fossil fuels \"for some time to come\".\n\nHe added that any new licences would be assessed on a case-by-case basis and would have to be \"compatible with our objectives on climate change\", saying issues like energy security would form part of this consideration.", "source": {"uri": "clactonandfrintongazette.co.uk",

Its laser focus on independence won't help | Lesley Riddoch", "body": "Will the publication of the SNP manifesto stop it losing seats on 4 July? Probably not.\n\nBut since the party can't form the next Westminster government, its manifesto would never be a fully costed set of plans for the whole UK. Instead, it is a mix of policies for running Scotland and demands for higher spending by the likely winners at Westminster. It's. confusing - like all post-devolution Westminster elections - and unlikely to set the heather alight.\n\nSo, manifestos don't really cut it in Scotland at general election time. Allocating blame for service delivery failures north of the border is the name of the game. Is the fault mainly with Westminster or Holyrood? The SNP is trading on its record in Scotland and the stark contrast with British norms that has been revealed in every leaders' debate.\n\nWhile the Tories are proposing more benefits cuts and Labour is noncommittal, the SNP mitigated the bedroom tax out of existence here 10 years ago - few Scots realise it still operates down south. The Tories and Labour will maintain prescription charges for England - they've been free here since 2011. The Scottish government resolved all NHS pay claims through negotiation while the British government is still battling junior doctors.\n\nIndeed, many of the big announcements daringly revealed by Westminster rivals during various leaders' debates are already up and running in Scotland: council house building restarted when the right to buy was axed in 2016, and free personal care for elderly people was introduced by a Labour first minister in 2002. All of this has been delivered within the considerable constraints of devolution, with next to no borrowing powers and the legal requirement to deliver a balanced budget.\n\nWestminster politics is so rightwing, adversarial and timorous, John Swinney doesn't need to be Che Guevara to sound revolutionary. Indeed, at the launch he described the SNP as a \"moderate, left-of-centre party\", yet channelled the thunderous fury of a 21st-century John Knox over Labour's refusal to axe the two-child benefits cap, declaring that it was \"a simple test. Are you in government to help kids out of poverty. Or are you so morally lost, that you push more kids into poverty?\"\n\nBut there's the rub. Despite a unique Scottish child payment - described by Prof Danny Dorling as the biggest single anti-poverty measure anywhere in Europe for the last 40 years - poverty levels haven't much shifted. Despite a much smaller private sector in the NHS, waiting lists are still long. Despite a big social rented sector, the Holyrood parliament declared a housing emergency last month.\n\nThe question for Scottish voters is who to blame. Is it Tory/Labour Westminster or is it SNP-run Holyrood? Can Scottish leader Anas Sarwar convince SNP voters that a Westminster Labour government will turn the Scottish ship around? Can John Swinney persuade SNP voters that performance problems here largely arise from Westminster-made economic crises and chronically underfunded public services that Labour is unwilling to turbocharge?\n\nThe polls suggest a Labour win in Scotland for the first time in a decade but that may not prove it's winning the argument. Scottish voters may be so desperate to see the Tories out, they'll back the only party that can oust them. But the Swinney assault on Labour's adoption of Tory austerity - with the SNP leader in the House of Commons, Stephen Flynn, also joining in - is having an impact, along with the argument that an assured Labour victory across the UK means Scots can vote for an effective progressive opposition instead.\n\nThat, of course, raises the question: does the SNP achieve anything worthwhile in a first-past-the-post-constructed parliament, where one of the Big Two wins the most seats by a country mile (with a minority of the vote) and doesn't have to pay heed to anyone?\n\nThe SNP points to its widely admired stance on Gaza, which helped to persuade a painfully cowed Labour party into backing a ceasefire. But that is thin gruel. Some frustrated independence supporters are suggesting SNP MPs should abstain - like Sinn F\u00e9in. The SNP has skipped around this idea as deftly as it skips around a clear position on oil and gas licences (issued actually by Westminster) and what \"losing\" the Scottish election would mean for independence.\n\nLogically, if John Swinney maintains that winning the most seats should allow him to start indyref2 talks with No 10, then losing should mean parking a cause backed by roughly half the Scottish electorate. That could backfire, though it only mirrors Labour's point-blank refusal to contemplate another poll, whatever the election outcome.\n\nNow it's on page one, line one of his manifesto (and with the pro-indy Greens and Alba on his tail) Swinney won't let independence slip. At the manifesto launch, he rebutted the idea that the cost of living crisis or NHS funding are now more central issues: \"Never let anyone tell you independence is separate from people's everyday concerns. It is fundamental to [resolving] them.\"\n\nHas the focus on independence been successful? Some voters in the all-important, ex-Labour west of Scotland are disgusted with an SNP-run Glasgow council for planning to lay off teachers because of funding cuts from an SNP-led Scottish government. And few SNP canvassers will be mentioning ferries (delayed and over-budget) on the Hebridean islands. The one thing that hasn't happened is a collapse of faith in left-of-centre, collectivist, green policies. The question is whether Holyrood or Westminster, the SNP or Labour, will best deliver them.\n\nSome sage heads say two disappointing years of an underwhelming Labour government will help the SNP in the next Holyrood vote in 2026. But whatever the pollsters and manifestos say, the general election in Scotland is still very much up for grabs.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"},

putting both parties on 29%.\n\nThe Tories, meanwhile, dropped one and two points on the constituency and list vote respectively, with both settling at 16%.\n\nPollsters said Anas Sarwar, right, and Sir Keir Starmer could be on course to oversee Labour\u00b4s return as Scotland\u00b4s largest party (PA)\n\nThe Scottish Greens increased their list vote by two points to 12%, while the Lib Dems dropped one point to 7% in constituencies but remain on 10% in the list vote.\n\nEmma Levin, an associate director at Savanta, said the SNP appears to have ended its \"downward spiral\" but Labour could return as the country's largest party on July 4 if the findings are replicated.\n\n\"Our latest Scottish voting intention suggests a stable picture, with Labour's narrow lead in Scotland relatively unchanged since before the election campaign and John Swinney's elevation to First Minister,\" she said.\n\n\"The SNP appear to have successfully stopped their downward spiral, but this would still mean that Scotland would contribute to a UK-wide majority for Labour.\n\n\"If nothing changes between now and polling day, Anas Sarwar and Keir Starmer will have overseen Labour's return to their previously long-established position as Scotland's largest party.\n\n\"It's more than both men could've hoped for, even several years ago.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Labour", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Labour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Democrats_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liberal Democrats (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Ross_(Scottish_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Douglas Ross (Scottish politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Conservatives", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Conservatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scotsman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Scotsman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Percentage point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Duguid_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Duguid (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Greens", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Greens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anas_Sarwar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anas Sarwar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swinney", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Swinney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/20/12/wire-86361763-1718881326-336_636x382.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667152", "eventUri": "eng-9667152", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-14", "dateEnd": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 177, "textEnd": 191}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 249, "textEnd": 255, "freq": 3}], "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

Independence for a stronger economy, and happier, healthier lives. And independence for a better future for Scotland - made in Scotland - for Scotland.\"\n\nHe urged those thinking of voting Labour to \"be careful what you wish for\", saying Labour will continue with austerity measures.\n\nHowever, David Phillips, an associate director at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, says the party's plan for pulling out of the union does not face up to the big fiscal challenges an independent Scotland would face.\n\n\"The SNP manifesto calls for UK-wide spending plans to be topped up. This is to avoid the need to cut spending on unprotected areas, and to increase spending on, in particular, the NHS, working-age benefits, overseas aid and green investment,\" said Mr Philips in an assessment of the SNP's general election manifesto.\n\n\"They argue that the cost of this could be met by UK-wide tax rises, additional economic growth from the UK rejoining the EU in the coming parliament, and additional borrowing.\n\n\"However, in its call for Scottish independence, the SNP ignores the potential hit to economic growth from leaving the UK, and the big fiscal challenges an independent Scotland would immediately have to confront.\"\n\nThe SNP says an additional \u00a318 billion is required for 'unprotected' UK government departmental budgets by 2028-29, to prevent real-terms cuts. This is within the \u00a310bn to \u00a320bn that the IFS has previously warned such departments would need to avoid cuts under existing spending totals.\n\nMr Philips notes that the SNP wants a significant rise in spending on the NHS by the UK government which would generate an extra \u00a31.6bn for the Scottish Government to invest in health services.\n\n\"But because some of the increases in spending in the rest of the UK would be funded by income tax rises that wouldn't apply in Scotland, the Scottish Government's own funding would not increase by as much as the SNP appears to assume,\" he says.\n\nThe SNP also wants the next UK government to cancel the real-terms cuts to capital investment planned by the Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, and immediately invest at least \u00a328 billion a year in the green economy.\n\nIt wants a \u00a320bn boost to the benefit system, plus annual uplifts in support for housing costs and the abolition of the two-child limit in universal credit.\n\nMr Philips says: \"To help fund all this, the SNP propose a range of tax rises at the UK level. The biggest would be big income tax increases for higher-income individuals to match Scotland's system, raising an estimated \u00a316.5 billion in 2028-29.\n\n\"This would see income tax for someone in England, Wales and Northern Ireland earning \u00a350,000 a year rise by \u00a31,600, while those earning \u00a3125,000 would see an increase of \u00a35,200.\n\n\"By far the biggest revenue-raiser, though, is the proposal that the UK rejoin the EU. The SNP assumes that the resulting boost to economic growth would increase revenues by \u00a330 billion a year. In the seemingly unlikely event that the UK did rejoin the EU within the next parliament, this would not be an unreasonably high figure for the eventual boost to revenues.\"\n\nHowever, Mr Philips says that on their own figures the SNP proposals \"would involve higher borrowing and public sector net debt rising as a share of national income for longer.\"\n\nThe SNP has called for significant further tax devolution to Scotland - including full powers over income tax, as well as the devolution of National Insurance, VAT and the power to levy windfall taxes on 'excess' profits.\n\nMr Philips says that devolving income tax on savings and dividends, as well as National Insurance contributions is a \"sensible idea\", although it would add complexity for some taxpayers and the tax authorities.\n\n\"VAT is a particularly tricky tax to devolve, potentially creating trade barriers between Scotland and the rest of the UK, with reforms to VAT in Scotland also complicating the system.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailybusinessgroup.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Business"}, "authors": [{"uri": "terry_murden@dailybusinessgroup.co.uk", "name": "Terry Murden", "type":

What is clear from the position taken by the Prime Minister, supported by Douglas Ross and the Conservatives, is that they don't care about the journey on climate.\n\n'They're not interested in the

claimed the Scottish Government and SNP MSPs 'don't care' about jobs in the north east of Scotland supported by the oil and gas sector.\n\n'Whenever a new development is proposed in the North Sea, the SNP oppose it,' he said.\n\n'They oppose every round of new licences granted for the oil and gas sector, in recent years, they have not supported any new fields - not one.\n\n'Whatever John Swinney is claiming today, it's only a temporary position for the SNP, because their position is actually very clear.\n\n'They don't and will not stand up for Scotland's oil and gas industry, they are willing to

We are now beyond the halfway mark, and this week will see the launch of the Scottish party manifestos.\n\nAs always, the later stages of the campaign will see intensified activity on the ground. They may, as they don't always, see more focus on the specifics of policy.\n\nMedia attention is easily caught by, and directed toward, the theatrical or speculative aspects of elections, but it should be resisted. So far, too much of the coverage, both across the UK and here in Scotland, has been devoted to supposed gaffes, presentation or polling.\n\nThe fact that politicians are fond of saying that the only poll that matters is on polling day doesn't detract from the fact that it is true.\n\nEnergy expended on margins of error or methodological flaws is waste of time when it comes to getting the message across and persuading voters - it should be left to the psephologists and strategists. If you're on the frontline of the campaign, polls (whether they encourage complacency or dejection) are a distraction.\n\nThat's especially true in Scotland; UK-wide polls are far too blunt to address the local landscape. It's not just that the issues are different, but that, though this is a Westminster election, many Scots will be casting their vote against the SNP.\n\nIt has been in government for more than a decade and a half, and almost everything that affects people's real priorities is their responsibility alone. Not that they pay much attention to those bread-and-butter issues; independence remains \"page one, line one\" of their manifesto, as their new leader recently confirmed.\n\nTheir focus on independence is, of course, because it's their chief purpose. They know, however, that it is still opposed by a clear majority of Scots, who have woken up to their dismal record on the everyday responsibilities of government.\n\nBut it is red meat to throw to their dwindling number of supporters, since it's the only thing on which they agree.\n\nThe general election result won't remove them from government in Scotland at once, but it would be the clearest possible signal that Scotland has had enough of their malign influence. Since the last general election, the Scottish Conservatives have removed two SNP first ministers - Nicola Sturgeon and Humza Yousaf - from office.\n\nA vote for us on 4 July could make it a hat trick, by seeing the back of John Swinney, who has been chief fixer for this rotten administration for the best part of two decades.\n\nThe Nats currently have the vast bulk of Scotland's MPs, having won 48 of 59 seats in 2019. Every one of them emboldens those who want to tear up the UK and impedes the delivery of policies that would address Scotland's real needs.\n\nIn seats up and down the country, it is a two-horse race between the SNP and the Conservatives. A vote for anyone but us is effectively one for the separatists. In the North East and the Borders in particular, any vote that isn't cast for the Scottish Conservatives is wasted.\n\nLabour and the Liberal Democrats have, in any case, backed some of the SNP's worst policies. But they simply don't figure at all in the running in most of these seats. The Greens and Alba are extremists, just as obsessed with separatism as the Nationalists. And a vote for Reform, which doesn't stand a chance of winning any Scottish seats, risks letting the SNP sneak in.\n\nAs the Scottish party chairman, I'm well aware that Conservatives face an uphill struggle nationally. But in Scotland, I genuinely believe that we can not only defend our seats, but make gains at the expense of the SNP.\n\nIt is the SNP that have made the decisions that affect almost all of the issues that affect ordinary Scots - and they've been disastrous. While they continued obsessing about independence they neglected basic priorities like our NHS, schools, justice system and council services.\n\nThey've introduced a long list of abysmal policies: the grotesque gender ID bill, the illiberal Hate Crime Act, a botched bottle return scheme, and a ban on wood-burning stoves.\n\nThey created a gigantic black hole in public finances which has led to savage cuts in everything from care to colleges and pothole repairs to police numbers - yet they've had the biggest block grants in history, and have made us the highest-taxed part of the UK.\n\nThe Scottish Conservatives are the opposition here not just because we're the largest party after the SNP, but because on a host of issues, we've been the only effective opposition.\n\nThe SNP campaign has already run into trouble over their desperate attempts to row back on their position on oil and gas. Sturgeon advocated an effective veto on new development - though, thankfully, that's not within the Scottish government's control - and thus endangered tens of thousands of jobs, billions in tax revenue, and any credible environmental transition.\n\nMany of those jobs are in the North East, already a strong area for us, but it is estimated that the energy sector supports, directly or indirectly, around one in every 30 Scottish jobs.\n\nAttempts by parts of the SNP to pretend that this has never been their policy (notably by Kate Forbes, the Deputy First Minister) were brutally shot down by Swinney - though he tried to differentiate their stance from Labour's which is, to all intents and purposes, identical.\n\nOnly the Scottish Conservatives are standing up for this vital industry and its skilled workers, who will be crucial for any realistic attempt to deliver energy security and a transition to renewables and new technologies.\n\nThe vital message that we now have to get across in those key seats where it is a straight, and often a close, fight between us and the SNP is that a vote for any other party risks letting the Nationalists in.\n\nThings may look difficult for us across the UK, but in Scotland the Conservatives can not only hold our seats, but make gains at the SNP's expense which could finish them off as a significant parliamentary force, north and south of the border.", "source": {"uri": "conservativehome.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Conservative Home"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Is It Too Late? | Novara Media", "body": "For the first half of this election campaign, the Scottish National party struggled to find a message. The party has been through its second leadership change in just over a year, and neither Humza Yousaf nor John Swinney was ever the selfie-attracting celebrity that Nicola Sturgeon had been since 2014.\n\nPicking up the pieces after a bruising break-up with the Greens, the new first minister would have hoped for a little longer to assemble the party into some kind of coherent picture.\n\nBut he didn't get it, and, ever since Sunak surprised everyone by calling the vote months before he had to, the SNP had failed to make much of a case about why Scotland's centre-left majority should stump for them over Labour. Largely, they seemed to fall back on their tired \"standing up for Scotland\" schtick which, if you live here, starts to sound a little like a tipsy friend telling the same old story again - one that wasn't very interesting in the first place.\n\nWhen the party released its election broadcast at the start of June - a gentle chat with Swinney and his controversial deputy Kate Forbes - it felt like a funeral home trying to sell you their bronze package.\n\nWith its manifesto launch yesterday, the party has developed a clearer message. Swinney trailed the document by saying it would be \"the most leftwing\" of the so-called major parties.\n\nSpeaking to Sky News on Tuesday, he added: \"The SNP is a moderate left-of-centre political party, it always has been, always will be.\" He also attacked Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves, saying: \"The Labour party has essentially accepted the discipline of the Conservative approach to the economy. And that's going to constrain them in all that they can do.\n\n\"We already know that there's going to be spending cuts that the Tories have put in place, which the Labour party is going to accept.\"\n\nThe document itself continues in this theme: the introduction promises \"moderate left of centre policies to make the lives of the people of Scotland better\".\n\nAt the centre of the SNP's argument is Institute for Fiscal Studies analysis that suggests Labour (and Lib Dem) promises to sign up to Tory fiscal rules inevitably mean billions of pounds more in cuts.\n\nThe SNP propose, on the one hand, a rebalancing of the Treasury's batshit fiscal rules to allow for more borrowing to invest in public assets, and devolution of various taxes - windfall taxes and national insurance are named explicitly - so the Scottish government can continue to follow the approach already taken with those income taxes which have been devolved, and raise them on the wealthier.\n\nPerhaps reasonably, since Swinney's party aren't suggesting they will be the Westminster government, and this isn't a Holyrood election, they don't give specific figures for these tax rises, instead saying \"SNP MPs will stand firmly against the Westminster consensus on continued cuts, and demand increased investment in our vital public services\".\n\nSimilarly, the party promises to oppose NHS privatisation, including with a bill to protect the health service's status as a public institution in any future trade deals, and to reverse the various anti-trade union laws in recent years. There are pledges to push for an end to the bedroom tax, the two-child benefit cap and resultant 'rape clause'. At the launch, Swinney's criticism of Labour for its failure to promise the cap was trenchant: \"It's a simple test: are you in government to help kids out of poverty?\"\n\nElsewhere there are pledges that, in Westminster, seem radical: to scrap Trident nuclear weapons, abolish the House of Lords, end arms sales to Israel and recognise Palestine immediately, decriminalise drug use, defend migrants including by expanding the right to vote to numerous immigrant groups, and take Scotland back into the EU.\n\nThe manifesto doesn't set out a social transformation on the scale we need. It doesn't float large scale nationalisations, as the Green manifesto does, and the tax rises are implied rather than spelled out. It has a lot to say about the climate emergency: just transition and driving renewable energy, but ultimately doesn't go nearly far enough - suggesting, for example, that new oil and gas licences should be granted on a \"rigorously evidence led case-by-case basis through a robust climate compatibility assessment\". In reality, climate justice requires an outright ban. Instead, the manifesto pedals wishful thinking false solutions, like carbon capture and storage, and hydrogen.\n\nMoreover, having led on trans rights, here the party carefully avoids the word, promising to \"protect and enhance the rights of LGBTI people,\" but otherwise stepping back from a 'Terf war'.\n\nIt is, though, largely what it says it is - moderate left, at a time when Labour is running to the right.\n\nIf there is a second leg of the document - and the campaign - then it is an explicit pitch for independence. \"If the SNP wins a majority of Scottish seats,\" it says, \"the Scottish government will be empowered to begin immediate negotiations with the UK government to give democratic effect to Scotland becoming an independent country\".\n\nIt's a slightly odd wording, presumably intended to leave various routes to the party's ultimate goal open. But what it seems to mean in reality is that if the party gets more than half of Scotland's seats - that is, 29 MPs - it will feel emboldened when it reminds the new prime minister of the mandate from the 2021 Scottish parliament election to hold an independence referendum. I doubt Sir Keir will take much notice.\n\nIn practice, thousands of independence supporters in Scotland have responded to the stagnation caused by Westminster vetoing another vote by giving up on the idea as a short-term prospect, and the SNP are desperately trying to persuade them to go to the polling station at all - and, if they do, not to vote Labour (or Lib Dem in the north).\n\nNow they finally have a half-decent pitch, they have two weeks to endlessly repeat it to those people until - they will hope - it is heard.", "source": {"uri": "novaramedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

That means the party has dialled down some of its rhetoric about the General Election as a de facto referendum.\n\nBut Mr Swinney maintains his stumbling party will still have a mandate for indepen-dence even if they are punished at the election. Talk about delusional!\n\nElsewhere in its manifesto, the SNP pledged to 'champion our vision for an independent Scotland in the EU'.\n\nThis is nothing more than a pipe dream - and in any event would cede key economic decisions to Brussels bureaucrats.\n\nThere is a commitment to tackle drug deaths - coming from the party which presided over a surge in fatalities to the highest level in Europe.\n\nThe manifesto also claims that the SNP is 'doing all it can to support people through the Westminster-made cost of living crisis'.\n\nBut its punitive taxes mean Scotland is in danger of becoming a no-go zone for entrepreneurs and hard-working young professionals. Scots are crying out for change - but the SNP has nothing to offer them but the same tired old platitudes and snake-oil salesmanship.\n\nDon't trust Reform\n\nReform is a party of misfits - a truth borne out by our disturbing revelations about one of its candidates. Jo Hart shared vile comments about the late Queen and other Royals in a 2022 post on Facebook.\n\nPlainly, vetting has been minimal or at least ineffective - after all, it doesn't take much detective work to check social media feeds.\n\nBut this unedifying episode raises an important question - if Reform has made such a botched job of candidate selection, how on earth could it be trusted in office?\n\nA vote for Reform in Scotland would make SNP victories more likely in those key targets seats where the Tories are defending vulnerable majorities.\n\nIt may be tempting for Tory voters to back Nigel Farage in protest after a torrid time for their party.\n\nBut it would be a wasted vote - and one that would put the Union in fresh peril.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType":

But Swinney has 'enjoyed' the briefest of political honeymoons since becoming nominated as First Minister on May 7.\n\nRishi Sunak's declaration of July 4 as the date of the general election caught Swinney by surprise but he got his campaign off to the worst of all starts. Shortly after the election was called, he was castigated for refusing to back a lengthy suspension from Holyrood for Michael Mathes, the disgraced former SNP health secretary, who charged the taxpayer \u00a311,000 for roaming charges he racked up on holiday. Swinney's approach resulted in both his party's and his personal popularity plummeting in opinion polls.\n\nSaid one veteran campaigner: \"On the doorsteps people are fed up. They think Swinney has lost the plot.\n\n\"If he thinks that the voters don't care about issues like this, he is completely wrong. Disillusionment with the SNP is now turning to anger.\"\n\nSwinney, who looks every one of his sixty years, is remembered, principally, as Alex Salmond's first lieutenant when the SNP entered the new Scottish parliament's temporary home at the top of Edinburgh's Royal Mile twenty five years ago. It was a pretty poor runner-up to Labour, still then Scotland's natural party of government, in the first election.\n\nWith the Liberal Democrats joining Labour in a coalition government - a situation that lasted for eight years - the SNP was shut out of power and looking a long way off from their goal of Scottish independence. In spite of his placid, workmanlike, demeanour this was a cause that has always burned fiercely in Swinney's heart.\n\nAs opposition leader Salmond took the lead against Donald Dewar, the former Scottish Secretary, who'd been specially selected by Blair to run what was seen from Downing Street as little more than Labour's branch office in Edinburgh. That all changed in 2000 when, first, Dewar died of a brain haemorrhage and Salmond, for reasons still not adequately explained, resigned as SNP leader.\n\nSwinney was the natural successor but his term of office was, to say the least, ill-starred. Against, at first, Henry McLeish as Labour First Minister and then Jack McConnell, after McLeish resigned following an expenses mix-up, the weekly joust between the two party leaders lost much of its former lustre. Instead of heavyweights battling it out, such as Salmond and Dewar, there was Swinney versus McLeish - a distinct drop in star quality, so much so that one sketch writer dubbed Question Time 'hamster wars'.\n\nBut that was the least of his worries. Under Swinney's leadership, the SNP lost one of their six MPs at the 2001 general election and notched up only 19 per cent of the vote in the 2004 European Parliament election, one of its lowest ever shares of the vote. It was deemed a disaster and by this time Swinney's allies were convinced that Salmond was undermining him from Westminster.\n\nIt was widely reported that James Bond star Sir Sean Connery, a leading Scottish independence backer and friend of Salmond had made it known that Swinney was too boring to be leader.\n\nThe denouement arrived when senior party figures - only half-jokingly referred to as \"the men in kilts\" - advised Swinney to stand down. He did, only to be succeeded by the man he had succeeded, Alex Salmond.\n\nBut now, and proving that there's nothing new in politics, he is back as both party leader and First Minister. However, the poisoned chalice he won in 2000, and was forced to give up four years later, has been replaced by another of the same. With the polls suggesting that whereas the Tories are in for a hiding south of the border on July 4, in Scotland it is the SNP which is in trouble - more trouble than they could ever have imagined only a few short years ago when they acquired the mantle of Scotland's natural party of government.\n\nA veritable blitzkrieg of bad government, sleaze and hugely unpopular policies which alienated the voters have, say their opponents, turned their supporters against them. Furthermore, lurking in the background is the case of the Missing Six Hundred Thousand - the massive sum which has disappeared from the party's coffers, cash that had been donated by party activists to pay for a hoped-for new independence referendum but which has now disappeared.\n\nIt has been investigated by Police Scotland in what is code named Operation Branchform for nearly three years and Peter Murrell, Nicola Sturgeon's husband, has been charged in connection with embezzlement. A report from Police Scotland has now gone to the Crown Office, which is Scotland's prosecuting authority.\n\nSturgeon herself and Colin Beattie, the party's former treasurer, have both been arrested and then freed pending further inquiries - inquiries that police say are still continuing. Sturgeon said she was \"certain I have committed no offence\" and insisted that \"I am in fact innocent of any wrongdoing.\" Beattie said he would \"co-operate fully with Police Scotland's inquiries\".\n\nThe case may be seldom mentioned in polite political circles, but according to veteran campaigners it is constantly raised \"on the doorsteps\".\n\nStaunch supporter of Scotland's independence\n\nSwinney was born in Edinburgh in 1964 and attended Forrester High School in the city. He became attracted to the SNP during the second general election of 1974, when the party won 30 per cent of the vote and 11 seats.\n\nAnother factor that he has said pushed him towards the SNP was his irritation when English commentators described the swimmer David Wilkie as British when he triumphed at the Commonwealth Games but Scottish when he did not.\n\nSwinney joined the party in 1979, aged only 15, convinced that Scotland was getting a raw deal from the Union and needed to leave the UK.\n\nHe graduated from Edinburgh University in 1986 with an MA in politics before becoming a research officer with the Scottish Coal Project. The same year he became the party's national secretary at the age of only 22.\n\nWithin two years he was working as a business and management consultant for a Glasgow firm, where he met his first wife, Lorna. The reserved and quiet Swinney and the outgoing Lorna King did not appear to be the most obvious match.\n\nHowever, the couple married in 1991 and a daughter, Judith, was born a few years later followed by a son, Stuart.\n\nLater he worked for insurance firm Scottish Amicable but his life was soon turned upside down. First, he was elected the MP for Tayside North in the 1997 general election, ousting Tory Bill Walker.\n\nEven then he was being touted within SNP circles as the natural successor to then party leader Alex Salmond. However, in August 1998 he and Lorna announced their separation after seven years of marriage.\n\nAt first they claimed no one else was involved but it emerged that she had been having an affair with a married nursery teacher. Swinney moved out of the family home and his wife broke off the relationship with her lover.\n\nAlthough they divorced, it did not appear to be a rancorous split, with Lorna stating at the time: \"He is still the father of my children and a good father at that.\"\n\nIn January 2001 the then 37-year-old announced he had a new girlfriend, Elizabeth Quigley, a BBC politics reporter eight years his junior. She promptly moved to cover general news instead of politics to avoid any suggestion of bias. They married in 2003.\n\nSwinney has never been viewed as a charismatic politician and has normally been seen as a moderate voice in the SNP hierarchy but his support for independence has never been questioned.\n\nHowever, in a long career as SNP finance minister - he boasts that he has successfully got eleven budgets through the Scottish Parliament - he has earned the respect, if not the admiration, of his opponents.\n\nBut a low point in his political career - so far - came in 2016 when Sturgeon moved him from the role of finance secretary to education secretary in a bid to stop the slide in Scotland's traditionally well-regarded education system. He remained deputy first minister.\n\nHowever, moving Swinney to education didn't work and in 2020 he faced fierce criticism from parents, teachers and political opponents over what Labour's Richard Leonard described as his 'disastrous' overview of examination results which saw 125,000 pupils having their grades reduced on the basis of past school results.\n\nHe survived a no confidence motion in the Holyrood parliament on that issue and survived another such vote a year later over what was described by Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross as the \"bureaucratic mess\" of a new teaching system.\n\nSturgeon then removed him from the education brief and made him the minister for Covid recovery - seen by many as a \"non job\" - while still retaining his title as deputy first minister.\n\nAnd it was his role in this latter post when Scottish politicians saw another side of Swinney - as what seemed to be an out and out apologist for Sturgeon. She has been locked in a bitter personal battle with Salmond, since succeeding him after the failed referendum campaign in 2014.\n\nThis included Salmond accusing Sturgeon of being part of a conspiracy against him, which included him being facing trial - and being acquitted in 2019 - on 13 harassment charges, including one of sexual assault with intent to rape.\n\nSturgeon denied a role in any conspiracy and there then followed several years of mudslinging between the two along the lines of 'who said what to whom and when' and including a complaint that Sturgeon had misled the Scottish Parliament.\n\nSwinney found himself in the middle of this bitter dispute, having to issue statements on First Minister Sturgeon's behalf.\n\nHowever, he earned criticism, too, for what he didn't say when in 2022 Sturgeon forced her controversial gender reform act - which allowed over 16s to self declare their gender - through the Scottish parliament. Nor has he made any public statement about the more than \u00a3600,000 missing from the SNP's coffers.\n\nBut the shambles of the Sturgeon period came to a head when after she resigned last year, insisting it had nothing to do with the missing cash, and was replaced by 'her' candidate Humza Yousaf, her accident prone health minister.\n\nSwinney saw his chance and resigned as deputy first minister almost before the ink was dry on Sturgeon's resignation letter.\n\nHis exile on the backbenches lasted only a year when, again, with what looked like unseemly haste and no opposition he effectively made himself First Minister when Yousaf was forced to resign to escape a no confidence motion after ending the SNP coalition deal with the Greens.\n\nSwinney promised his party and opponents that he'd pursue a moderate and voter-friendly policy agenda while also, for the first time, publicly expressing his Christian faith.\n\nThe latter explanation may have had something to do with the fact that he made Kate Forbes - in the eyes of many the best candidate to be First Minister - his deputy. She was an already avowed Christian and member of the Free Church of Scotland.\n\nBut Swinney's promises look hollow against his recent behaviour in defending a friend and ministerial ally over the latter's attempt to get the taxpayers to foot an \u00a311,000 data bill run up by his family on a foreign holiday and then lying to the public about the circumstances.\n\nAs a result, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar attacked Swinney for \"putting the SNP first ... not Scotland\", while Ross accused him of \"disgusting behaviour ... that demeans the office of First Minister.\"\n\nIn response Swinney sought to attack Ross for using \"nasty, personal abuse\" - an accusation that many observers might reckon is rich given the routine approach of SNP leaders when responding to attacks.\n\nSwinney's real problem is that he still has to prove to the voters that Clement Attlee's old adage that he is \"not up to the job\" doesn't apply to him.", "source": {"uri":

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nJohn Swinney has refused to say what will happen to Scottish independence if the SNP does not win a majority of seats at the general election.\n\nThe Nationalists have said that winning a majority of constituencies would give \"democratic effect\" to independence talks.\n\nBut the SNP leader would not say on BBC's Question Time that his party taking less than half of seats would mean that Scotland had rejected independence.\n\nHe was repeatedly asked but refused to properly address the question.\n\nOpinion polls have suggested that the SNP could lose dozens of seats to Labour and end up in second place.\n\nPresenter Fiona Bruce asked the First Minister if he would take a majority of non-SNP MPs as \"a democratic decision that you shouldn't be pursuing independence\".\n\nHe refused to address the question and said: \"What I want to make sure is that the legitimate decisions of the people in Scotland in the election in 2021, when a Scottish Parliament was elected with a majority of members favouring independence and a referendum, that that can actually be respected by the United Kingdom.\"\n\nWhen it was put to him that not winning a majority of seats would be the public giving him a \"red light\" over independence, he again refused to answer.\n\nHe said: \"I want people in Scotland to confidently vote for the SNP to make sure we can turn that manifesto into a reality.\"\n\nWhen pushed another time on what getting less than half of seats would mean, he refused to properly address the question.\n\nSwinney said: \"What I want to do during the election campaign is to encourage people to vote for the SNP to enable us to deliver on that policy commitment.\"\n\nBruce then asked him if he would finally answer the question.\n\nSwinney replied: \"What I'm saying is I want people to vote for the SNP...\"\n\nBruce then cut him off and went to the next question.\n\nSwinney was speaking in a general election special of BBC Question time. The programme also featured Lib Dem leader Ed Davey, Labour leader Keir Starmer and Tory Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.\n\nHe also admitted the SNP had had \"a tough time\" and had to \"rebuild trust\" with the Scottish people.\n\nIt comes after former chief executive and Nicola Sturgeon's husband was charged with embezzlement in relation to the party's finances.\n\nSturgeon and former treasurer Colin Beattie were also arrested and released without charge as part of the police probe.\n\nSwinney said: \"We've had a very tough time as a party in the last couple of years.\"\n\nHe continued: \"It has been a turbulent time and I would be the first to accept that and to admit that.\n\n\"My party's asked me to lead it through this election campaign and beyond the 2026 parliamentary elections to essentially do two things.\n\n\"First of all, to rebuild trust between the electorate and the Scottish National Party.\n\n\"And secondly to provide the direction that's necessary in the Scottish Government to change people's lives.\"\n\nStarmer appeared after Swinney on the programme.\n\nHe defended his support of former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's 2019 manifesto, despite recently comparing it to Sunak's offer.\n\nAn audience member asked the Labour leader: \"You criticised the Tory manifesto as Jeremy Corbyn-like. Anything you want can go in it, nothing is costed. Why did you back his original manifesto in 2019?\"\n\nStarmer replied: \"In 2019 I campaigned for the Labour Party as I've always campaigned for the Labour Party.\"\n\nHe said that afterwards it became clear the electorate \"thought it was too much and they wanted to see something which was fully costed and fully funded.\"\n\nBruce then repeatedly challenged him over his one-time statement Corbyn would make a great prime minister but he refused to answer\n\nStarmer said: \"It wasn't a question that really arose because I didn't think we were going to win the election.\"\n\nBruce asked for a yes or no answer to whether he meant it. He did not give one and the audience laughed.\n\nHe then said Corbyn would have been a better prime minister than Boris Johnson.\n\nTo sign up to the Daily Record Politics newsletter, click here",

But what I want to be able to do is to do the things that will transform people's lives.\n\n\"I want to live in a fairer, more equal country. I want to live in a country that prioritises the improvement of our economy and strengthening the rights and the responsibilities of people in our country. I don't think that can be achieved for us in the United Kingdom.\n\n\"I want Scotland to be like Denmark, or Ireland, or Sweden as an independent country. And when you look at those countries, they are more prosperous, they are more equal, they are fairer than Scotland and the United Kingdom.\n\n\"And that's a prize I think people in Scotland are attracted to and want to make sure happens for our country.\"\n\nWhen one audience member asked him whether he would keep holding referenda \"until you get what you want\", he said politicians should set out what they \"actually believe in\" and let people decide, and that he was a democrat who respected \"the right of the people of Scotland to decide their own future\".\n\nFiona Bruce repeatedly challenged him on what it would mean for his democratic mandate for independence if the SNP failed to win a majority of Scottish seats in July given, she suggested, it would be a \"democratic decision that you shouldn't be pursuing independence\".\n\nWhen he repeated that he wanted people in Scotland to confidently vote for the SNP so the party could turn its manifesto into reality, she voiced her conclusion that he was not going to answer the question.\n\nHe was also asked why the SNP had backtracked on its opposition to new oil and gas licences, and he said that while the need to transition to net zero was \"absolutely inescapable\" it would be necessary to use fossil fuels \"for some time to come\".\n\nHe added that any new licences would be assessed on a case-by-case basis and would have to be \"compatible with our objectives on climate change\", saying issues like energy security would form part of this consideration.", "source": {"uri": "rhyljournal.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

What is clear from the position taken by the Prime Minister, supported by Douglas Ross and the Conservatives, is that they don't care about the journey on climate.\n\n'They're not interested in the crisis that we face in the climate emergency, while this Government will take the responsible approach to managing that transition and the challenges of the climate emergency.'\n\nIn turn, Mr Ross claimed the Scottish Government and SNP MSPs 'don't care' about jobs in the north east of Scotland supported by the oil and gas sector.\n\n'Whenever a new development is proposed in the North Sea, the SNP oppose it,' he said.\n\n'They oppose every round of new licences granted for the oil and gas sector, in recent years, they have not supported any new fields - not one.\n\n'Whatever John Swinney is claiming today, it's only a temporary position for the SNP, because their position is actually very clear.\n\n'They don't and will not stand up for Scotland's oil and gas industry, they are willing to

What gives?", "body": "This is what the latest available data from surveys of several thousand people each between February 2021 and September 2023 tells us. People were asked on a scale of zero to ten how much they felt they classified themselves with these different national identities.\n\nA slightly more sophisticated survey method asks people to state if they identify as 'Scottish not British', 'More Scottish than British', 'Equally Scottish and British', 'More British than Scottish' or 'British not Scottish'.\n\nOver a longer period of time - January 2012 to the latest available data in December 2022 - 'Scottish not British' rose to predominate over 'More Scottish than British' and 'Equally Scottish and British'. So, the sense of Scottish national identity has solidified and strengthened.\n\nFast forward to today and the effect of the general election campaign on society in Scotland is to accentuate both the senses of Scottishness and Britishness and the divide between them.\n\nSir Keir Starmer is rarely seen in England without a Union flag (Image: free)\n\nAs Labour under Sir Keir Starmer has become more right-wing than for many years, it has also become ever more patriotic under him. That patriotism is to Britain and is clearly evident in the imagery and words used by Labour, whether that be using the Union flag on election materials, promising to create the Great British Energy company or using the slogan, Let's Get Britain's Future Back.\n\nThus far, all the polls suggest that Labour in Scotland will take many seats from the SNP and secure the most MPs in Scotland.\n\nMeantime, SNP depute party leader, Keith Brown, laid out the SNP's case for being the only political party capable of defending 'Scottish values'. Then his party leader, John Swinney, urged electors to vote SNP in order to put 'Scotland's interests first'. Yet, the SNP seems set to further lose its grip upon political dominance in Scottish politics in the run up to the crucial 2026 Holyrood elections.\n\nWe have a few more weeks of the crass but conflictual counter-posing of national identities. Nigel Farage's re-entry into the general election campaign as a party leader and candidate for the Clacton constituency has only further served to emphasise Britishness, with Reform UK using a Trump-toting slogan of Let's Make Britain Great.\n\nSo, standing back from all this, what will be the implications for the differences in political values between Scotland and England as a result of this period of frenzied politicking?\n\nSuccessive British Social Attitudes surveys have shown for several decades that people in Scotland are more egalitarian in their values than those in England in terms of recognising social inequality and desiring more governmental intervention to ameliorate through the likes of higher taxation and more public spending.\n\nIt's easy going all the way for Labour. Ask yourself why\n\nScotland is a parody. Is Tartan Army to blame or Unionist politicians?\n\nThere has been some debate about the extent of these differences as well as the extent to which they have changed over time. Nonetheless, there is a consensus that the differences do exist and are genuine.\n\nAs an aside, it's worth recalling here that if the attitudes of people in the Central Belt of Scotland are contrasted to a comparable region of England, like the north east of north west, the differences would be far less marked.\n\nWith the likelihood of a Starmer-led Labour government in Westminster as well as a loud presence of Reform UK and a decimated Tory party seeking to battle Reform UK on the patriotism front, not only will the national identity of Britishness be ratcheted up but there will be a backlash of Scottishness.\n\nRight-wing politics will then become further enmeshed with British national identity. The sting in the tail will really come when Labour at Westminster is recognised as not making the required and desired changes that people voted it for in Scotland, where the sense of what is Scottishness will, therefore, strengthen further.\n\nThis will be the counter-punch because of the more egalitarian values in Scotland and the association of these with what is seen as being Scottish. But this does not mean the right-wing politics entwined with Britishness will find their polar political opposite in the traditional upholder of Scottishness, namely, the SNP.\n\nThe SNP's attempt to portray itself as social democratic and left-wing has been a classic case of 'the emperor's new clothes'. Under new leader, Swinney but pushed on by right-winger, Kate Forbes, not only will the SNP not try - or even be able - to continue with this charade but it will move to become openly more business-friendly.\n\nForbes is not only Deputy First Minister of Scotland but also Cabinet Secretary for Economy. Consequently, this Scottish sense of political progressiveness will not find a political home in the SNP. The Alba party, led by Alex Salmond, will also not change this equation, whether as a result of its small size, lack of credibility or not being left-wing.\n\n'A sense of hopelessness, disillusionment and despair could easily come into Scottish politics' (Image: free)\n\nSurprisingly, support for independence will strengthen, even where the SNP is no longer the dominant political force. But, with a revival of the radical left in Scotland unlikely any time soon, there is no obvious vehicle by which the progressive sense of Scottishness will find any political representation in the political system.\n\nUnfortunately, a sense of hopelessness, disillusionment and despair could easily come into play. Some may say this is where the independence movement will find its feet again. Yet not only is the independence movement's 'jam tomorrow' a promise even further down the line than that of a political party in any forthcoming election but the independence movement is not naturally or wholly progressive and left-wing.\n\nFinally, what of the Scottish Greens? Though not necessarily damaged by their drastic defenestration from the Scottish Government, their Scottishness is somewhat still subdued. In this context, it seems to many that they do not embody a wide enough portfolio of progressive policies to be able to benefit from the coming further movement of the Tectonic plates of politics.",

The Tories are projected to win five seats and the Lib Dems four.\n\nThe polling company said: \"Even for an election with such a dramatic change in the composition of the House of Commons, the churn in Scotland is notable. 32 seats are changing hands according to our model, more than half of the total number of seats.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Sign up to our must-read daily briefing email on all things Labour\n\nIt also found that Scotland is \"notably more marginal than England\", with 16 of Scotland's 57 seats designated as \"toss-ups\" - where the winning party's lead is less than five points.\n\nThe analysis predicted Labour gains including all six Glasgow seats, Central Ayrshire, Lothian East, Cowdenbeath and Kirkcaldy and Na h-Eileanan an Iar.\n\nThe latest analysis predicted a marginally less dominant performance by Labour than YouGov's earlier projection from two weeks ago, which predicted Labour would win 34 seats, ahead of the SNP on 17, the Tories on five and the Lib Dems on one.\n\nMore in Common\n\nMore in Common's latest MRP analysis also projected that Labour will become the biggest party in Scotland with 33 seats, ahead of the SNP on 18 - though the polling company found that 20 seats in Scotland are within a 5% margin. It put the Tories on four seats and the Lib Dems on two.\n\nREAD MORE: Read Scottish Labour manifesto Sarwar calls a 'blueprint to brighter future'\n\nMore in Common's analysis also predicted that Labour would pick up all of Glasgow's six seats from the SNP, as well as making gains elsewhere in the country including Dundee Central and Kilmarnock and Loudoun.\n\nThe findings mark quite a contrast to More in Common's analysis from earlier in the campaign, which put the SNP on 35 and Labour on 14 - though at the time the pollster highlighted a wide range of potential outcomes, finding that Labour would win 28 seats if the party won all the seats where it was within 4% of the SNP.\n\nSavanta\n\nSavanta's MRP analysis - the most cataclysmic of the recent MRP analyses for the Tories, putting the party on just 53 seats - paints the worst picture for the SNP, projecting that the party will pick up just eight seats, with Labour likely to gain constituencies including Hamilton and Clyde Valley and Midlothian.\n\nREAD MORE: UK general election poll tracker: Daily roundup on how polls look for Labour\n\nBut, alongside its headline findings - which were based on the MRP model's most likely winner for each individual seat - the pollster published its probability estimates that aggregate the percentage chance of a party winning in all seats. The latter approach saw the SNP winning 13 seats.\n\nThe analysis found that nationally 175 seats were \"too close to call\" (with a less than 7.5 percentage-point difference between first and second), ten of which were Labour leading the SNP and seven of which were the SNP leading Labour.\n\nLabourList has been rounding up the latest polling news in our general election tracker, publishing the results of the main UK pollsters as they are released during the campaign.

I am also grateful to each of them. They mainly suffered my questions in good humour although as Drew, in particular, found out, if I did not get the answers I thought I was looking for, I was willing to pursue a point or make it clear that I had not achieved my objective.\n\nAs far as I was concerned, the objective of this exercise was to explore the differences between the three pro-independence parties in Scotland so that those who want to vote for parties who believe that the country should be independent can clearly see three things.\n\nThe first of these is that being pro-independence does not mean that there has to be a uniformity of views on display. This became very clear during the interviews. To provide one very obvious example, the positions of the Greens and Alba are almost diametrically opposed with regard to oil. The Greens' position is principle-based, grounded in evidence, and unambiguously argues that oil and gas production must move towards a close. Alba, in contrast, is keen to accommodate the interests of Aberdeen, where Alex Salmond has traditionally found his support. Their whole approach is based on a compromise which feels to be a fudge that lacks a great deal of intellectual consistency. The idea that there is a singular approach to the economy in the independence movement is blown apart by this one issue.\n\nREAD MORE: Landmark court ruling throws new UK oil and gas projects into doubt\n\nSecond, I wanted to explore attitudes towards the social problems that blight Scotland. It is a fact that cannot be disputed that too many families in the country are struggling to make ends meet, and that far too many children are suffering as a result. I do not think that wanting a child to have food on its table makes anyone a socialist, but you would think that is the case based upon the attitude of the English-based Conservative and Labour parties. Neither show any interest in addressing this issue, to their massive discredit.\n\nIn fairness, my interviews make clear that all the Scottish parties disagree with this approach by what I call the English parties. The difference between them is in the measures that they are willing to put in place to address these issues.\n\nRoss Greer was interviewed by the professor (Image: NQ)\n\nRoss Greer for the Greens was emphatic that redistributive taxes were necessary to ensure that no child need go hungry in Scotland. Both wealth taxes, and higher taxes on income were mentioned by Greer, but in the latter case, Neale Hanvey's ambition was quite limited in scope, being restricted only to increases in capital gains tax. Ross Greer demonstrated a much stronger comprehension of the role of tax as a social issue. I did, in fact, suggest to him, after the interview, that he might be amongst the top 1% of politicians when it comes to tax given his comprehension of this issue.\n\nAs will be apparent from the interview with Drew Hendry, he was reluctant to be drawn by me on what the SNP might do with regard to taxation. Admittedly, the interview took place before any of these parties had published their manifesto, but I might I could not get Drew to commit to anything that he thought that the SNP might do with the additional tax powers on income and wealth which he thought Scotland should have, meaning that in the time available I gave up asking what his intention might be, because it was obvious he would not divulge them.\n\nAs we now know, the SNP manifesto has little more to say on this. It simply suggests that the UK should replicate the tax rates used by the SNP and raise more than \u00a316 billion in revenue as a result. Apart from mentions of tackling tax abuse, and reducing tax on oil, the SNP have almost nothing else to say on tax in this election, as the interview with Drew Hendry also made clear.\n\nThe third of my objectives was to look at the independence issue itself, by seeking to establish if there was a clear understanding of the need for Scotland to have immediate control of its own currency if that goal was achieved. The Greens and Alba understand that. Drew Hendry agreed that without its own currency an independent Scotland could not control its economy, but frustratingly he still tried to hedge his bets around the immediate commitment. To me that suggests that the SNP have still not really understood, or embraced, just what independence really means as yet. The other parties did so, more obviously.\n\nWhere does this leave readers? Alba and the Greens are not going to win seats in this election. The SNP undoubtedly will. They are going to be a vital part of the parliamentary opposition to a massive Labour majority in the next Westminster parliament. Voting for them is essential, but I cannot help but say that if I could do so I would whilst simultaneously wishing they were much more convincing when it comes to economics, and other issues.", "source": {"uri": "thenational.scot", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alba_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alba Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Greens", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Greens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Hendry", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drew Hendry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Greer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ross Greer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_90/The_Greens", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Greens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neale_Hanvey", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Neale Hanvey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scottish independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_(Scotland)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The National (Scotland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Salmond", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex Salmond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifesto", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manifesto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wealth tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Separatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Socialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberdeen", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aberdeen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Aberdeen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliamentary opposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_gains_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Capital gains tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Socialism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Socialism", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax_Negotiation_and_Representation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax Negotiation and Representation", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Tax_Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Tax Preparation", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.thenational.scot/resources/images/17349785/", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667152", "eventUri": "eng-9667152", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

Activists are now focusing their efforts on the areas where the Conservatives are the best-placed alternative to defeat the SNP.\n\nIn the final instalment of a three-day guide to these key battlegrounds, MICHAEL BLACKLEY examines four seats in west and central Scotland.\n\nPERTH AND KINROSS-SHIRE\n\nLuke Graham is closing in on the SNP in Perth\n\nScotland's ancient former capital of Perth used to attract visitors from across the country to enjoy its vibrant town centre packed with local businesses and diverse cultural and leisure attractions.\n\nIn recent years, however, it has lost institutions such as McEwens, the department store which had served Perth for 150 years.\n\nAfter its closure, it was initially revived as a Beales outlet but it too has now closed its doors, leaving the prominent building in St John Street empty.\n\nNational chains such as New Look, Debenhams and The Body Shop have also vanished from the city in recent times, leaving the scar of empty units in and around its once buzzing high street.\n\nIt has led to a growing feeling of decay in the city.\n\nLocals believe this has been partly caused by national problems including the SNP government's failure to provide Scottish firms with vital business rates relief handed to those in the hard-pressed retail, hospitality and leisure sectors south of the border by the UK Government.\n\nAnother key factor is the feeling that there has been a much greater focus on investment in nearby Dundee in recent years.\n\nIn a rare boost, the Chancellor Jeremy Hunt's spring Budget included \u00a310million for cultural and regeneration projects in Perth and Dunfermline - giving hope that much-needed investment is in the pipeline.\n\nSNP ministers have also come under fire for breaking their promise to have the A9, which links Perth and Inverness, fully dualled by 2025.\n\nIt is Scotland's most dangerous road and an analysis of official figures suggests lives are being lost because of the failure to upgrade the road.\n\nTransport Scotland data indicates that from 2020-2023 there were 199 injuries and 15 deaths on single-carriage sections of the road, compared to 114 injuries and seven deaths on dualled sections.\n\nLast year, the promise to fully dual the road was pushed back by a decade, until 2035, leading to claims that motorists had been 'betrayed'.\n\nFormer Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson joins Luke Graham in Perthshire\n\nLocal transport is also a major concern across the Perth and Kinross-shire constituency, with a number of bus services being cut.\n\nThe constituency has been significantly altered by boundary changes, replacing the old Perth and North Perthshire seat.\n\nPete Wishart, 62, is the SNP's longest-serving MP, having first been elected in 2001. He survived an almighty scare in 2017 when he finished just 21 votes ahead of Tory rival Ian Duncan.\n\nThe 2019 general election was more convincing, as he ran up a 7,550 majority over Conservative candidate Angus Forbes.\n\nThe boundary changes have increased Tory hopes as a number of local wards where they are traditionally strong, such as Strathearn, Almond and Earn, and Kinross-shire, have been drawn into the constituency.\n\nMr Wishart appears to be increasingly worried about his seat, and lashed out at other pro-independence candidates standing in his constituency for Alba and the Scottish Greens by questioning why they believe splitting the vote 'advances independence and helps keep the Tories out'.\n\nIn 2019, other pro-Union parties trailed far behind, with the Lib Dems in third place on just 7 per cent and Labour in fourth on 4.6 per cent. The two parties have struggled to gain a foothold in the area, which has become a clear SNP/Tory head-to-head battle.\n\nPerth and Kinross Council has also swung between the SNP and Tories, and has just two Labour councillors out of 40.\n\nDespite the SNP's big lead in 2019, some recent polling has indicated the gap has closed considerably and the Tories are close to a major scalp.\n\nA Norstat poll last week put the SNP on 30.25 per cent and the Conservatives on 29.97 per cent.\n\nTory candidate Luke Graham, 39, who previously represented Ochil and South Perthshire from 2017 to 2019, is highly regarded in the Conservative Party.\n\nBut his prospects of a return to the Commons will be largely determined by whether he can persuade pro-Union voters to unite behind him.\n\n\u25a0 2019 Winner: Pete Wishart (SNP)\n\n\u25a0 2019 majority: 7,550\n\n\u25a0 Key battle: Luke Graham (Con) v Wishart\n\nCoastal communities hit by ferry farce could swing seat to Tories\n\nARGYLL, BUTE AND SOUTH LOCHABER\n\nThe SNP's ferries fiasco has angered coastal communities across the west coast of Scotland and the islands.\n\nTory candidate Amanda Hampsey\n\nIn Argyll, Bute and South Lochaber, the Tories are hoping to encourage tactical voting by traditional Lib Dem and Labour supporters to punish the Nationalists for ignoring and betraying the area.\n\nThe Tory candidate is Amanda Hampsey, pictured, who has served as a local councillor for Oban South and the Isles since 2022.\n\nThe SNP had a majority of 4,110 in 2019 but polling indicates its support has collapsed since then across Scotland. Some of the areas in this constituency worst affected by ferry delays include Islay, Jura and Gigha, and the anger of residents could hit the prospects of re-election for Brendan O'Hara, who is the SNP's foreign affairs spokesman in the Commons.\n\nWhen first elected in 2015, he ousted long-serving Lib Dem MP Alan Reid. Since then the constituency has become a straight SNP/Tory fight.\n\nIn 2017, Mr O'Hara had a majority of just 1,328 when he secured 36 per cent of the vote, with the Tories in second on 33 per cent. In 2019, the SNP had 44 per cent while the Conservatives had 35 per cent.\n\n\u25a0 2019 winner: Brendan O'Hara (SNP)\n\n\u25a0 2019 majority: 4,110\n\n\u25a0 Key battle: Amanda Hampsey (Con) v O'Hara\n\nDr Gulhane puts the NHS front and centre as he seeks to oust Nats\n\nEAST RENFREWSHIRE\n\nOnce a Labour stronghold, East Renfrewshire has swung between the SNP and the Tories since 2015.\n\nMSP Sandesh Gulhane is the party's health spokesman at Holyrood\n\nKirsten Oswald ousted Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy, the area's long-serving MP, that year.\n\nLabour hoped to reclaim the seat, which has a large number of affluent, middle-class households, in 2017 but former Better Together chief Blair McDougall was third on 27 per cent with Tory Paul Masterton winning with 40 per cent.\n\nIn 2019, Ms Oswald won it back with 45 per cent of the vote. But the Tories cemented their position as the SNP's main rival by taking 35 per cent, with Labour on just 12 per cent. Mr McDougall is back for Labour and some polling suggests it may again be a three-way battle.\n\nThe Tories have selected MSP Sandesh Gulhane, the party's health spokesman at Holyrood.\n\nThe

in vast swathes of northern Perthshire and the northern suburbs of Dundee.\n\nExperienced Tory MSP Stephen Kerr\n\nThe incumbent MP is Dave Doogan, who was previously a Perth councillor and leader of the SNP group on Perth and Kinross Council.\n\nDuring the 2019 campaign - which saw former supporters desert the sitting Tory MP Kirstene Hair due to issues such as Brexit and the appointment of Boris Johnson as Prime Minister - Mr Doogan secured a 3,795 majority.\n\nHis main rival on July 4 is respected Tory MSP Stephen Kerr, pictured, who has held a number of prominent party roles but now sits on the backbenches.\n\nThe former Stirling MP is hoping to tap into local anger against the SNP Government over its poor response to the severe flooding that hit Brechin during Storm Babet in October last year.\n\nA recent poll indicates the SNP is on 34.4 per cent, with the Tories on 31.7 per cent.\n\nMr Kerr has highlighted that the Tories can beat the SNP when pro-Union voters unite behind the party and he now needs to persuade others to now rally to his cause.\n\n\u25a0 2019 winner: Dave Doogan (SNP)\n\n\u25a0 2019 majority: 3,795\n\n\u25a0 Key battle: Stephen Kerr (Con) v Doogan\n\n\u25a0

Rah rah rah! The Tory benches cheered on their boss.\n\nSwinney was quick to remind Ross that he was heading for the exit in that job.\n\n'Answer the question!' the soon to be ex-Tory leader barked. 'He is not presenting an accurate picture of the remarks I have made,' Swinney huffed.\n\nDouglas Ross accused Mr Swinney of 'turning his back on the Scottish oil and gas sector'\n\n'I'm quoting you!' Ross yapped, exasperated. Swinney was unmoved: 'I will not have my words misrepresented by Douglas Ross!'\n\nCue grunting from the Nat benches and rasping from the Tories.\n\nCan you tell there's an election on? First Minister's Questions is a rabble at the best of times but give them a whiff of a ballot box and they turn feral. Especially this election, with the outcome so unpredictable in Scotland.\n\nThe polls say the Tories might be facing another wipeout - or set to do better than last time. For the Nats, it's a case of clinging on to as many seats as they can.\n\nRoss, standing again in the North-East, lashed out at the SNP for its opposition to the Rosebank development.\n\nIt could, he said, create 1,600 jobs and \u00a36billion in investment but the Nats had turned their backs on it.\n\nSwinney protested that his party wasn't against oil and gas exploration, it just believed in conducting 'climate compatibility assessments'.\n\nThey had to bear in mind 'the journey to net zero', 'issues in relation to energy security' and 'a responsible approach to management of the transition'. It wasn't the SNP's fault, you see, it was the fault of policies the SNP had put in place. Please sir, a big climate compatibility assessment did it and ran away.\n\nClick here to visit the Scotland home page for the latest news and sport\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll through Swinney's tortuous self-justifications Ross struggled to keep bum on seat. He was agitated, revving away like a turbocharged engine, desperate for the spark plug to ignite. Then he hit the road at 90mph.\n\nSwinney was 'turning his back on the Scottish oil and gas sector'. He was 'unable to be truthful with the people of Scotland'.\n\nHe should 'be honest' and admit 'the SNP opposes every single oil and gas licence being issued'.\n\nThe First Minister was already roadkill but managed to emit a lame retort: 'I'm not sure Douglas Ross is on the strongest ground taking me to task about honesty when the Gambling Commission is investigating the alleged conduct of senior members of the Conservative Party.'\n\nRoss's tyres were still smoking. 'So much for Honest John!'\n\nThe Presiding Officer drew him daggers and ordered an apology.\n\nWhile Labour and the Tories have been duffing up the SNP for raising taxes, Patrick Harvie reckons Swinney isn't raising them enough.\n\n'His only proposal is to devolve taxes, not increase them,' he hissed, as if it were a bad thing.\n\nHarvie urged the SNP leader to tax 'the super rich who are hoarding the country's wealth'. This bike-lane Bolshevik believes all assets belong to the state and should be apportioned by a bureaucrat in Edinburgh. He calls himself a Green but he's red through and through.\n\nSwinney's more a deep shade of pink, as demonstrated by a reply stressing that his government had 'asked higher earners to pay more'.\n\n'Asked'. As though it was voluntary. As though he'd suggested they chip an extra couple of quid into a menage. You don't 'ask' people to do something if not doing it comes with a prison sentence.\n\nThe Presiding Officer reminded members that 'the chamber is not the place for election campaigning'.\n\nWhy not? Better they do it in there than out here.\n\n\u25a0 Click here to visit the Scotland home page for the latest news and sport", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Ross_(Scottish_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Douglas Ross (Scottish politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swinney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Swinney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tory", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister's_Questions_(Scottish_Parliament)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Minister's Questions (Scottish Parliament)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Stewart_(Scottish_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Stewart (Scottish politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backbencher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Backbencher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_(geology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fault (geology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_neutrality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carbon neutrality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Energy security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbocharger", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turbocharger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolsheviks", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bolsheviks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presiding_Officer_of_the_Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Harvie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Harvie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadkill", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roadkill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Devolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edinburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edinburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Oil_and_Gas", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Oil and Gas", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Fats_and_Oils", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Fats and Oils", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Energy", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Advertising_Collectibles", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Advertising Collectibles", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/20/21/86387165-0-image-a-44_1718914242264.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667152", "eventUri": "eng-9667152", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

When faced with infertility, Christians who believe life begins at or around conception wrestle with the ethics of IVF and how to build a family in a way that conforms with their beliefs.\n\nLAURA UNGAR AND TIFFANY STANLEY\n\nAssociated Press\n\nIN VITRO FERTILIZATION\n\nWhen faced with infertility, Amanda and Jeff Walker had a baby through in vitro fertilization but were left with extra embryos -- and questions. Tori and Sam Earle \"adopted\" an embryo frozen 20 years earlier by another couple. Matthew Eppinette and his wife chose to forgo IVF out of ethical concerns and have no children of their own.\n\nAll are guided by a strong Christian faith and believe life begins at or around conception. All have wrestled with the same weighty questions: How do you build a family in a way that conforms with your beliefs? Is IVF an ethical option, especially if it creates more embryos than a couple can use?\n\n\"We live in a world that tries to be black and white on the subject,\" Tori Earle said. \"It's not a black-and-white issue.\"\n\nThe dilemma reflects the age-old friction between faith and science at the heart of the recent IVF controversy in Alabama, where the state Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos have the legal status of children.\n\nPeople are also reading...

State leaders devised a temporary solution that shielded clinics from liability. Concerns about IVF's future prompted U.S. senators from both parties to propose bills aiming to protect IVF nationwide.\n\nLaurie Zoloth, a professor of religion and ethics at the University of Chicago, said arguments about this modern medical procedure touch on two ideas fundamental to American democracy: freedom of religion and who counts as a full person.\n\n\"People have different ideas of what counts as a human being,\" said Zoloth, who is Jewish. \"And it's not a political question. It's really a religious question.\"\n\nFor many evangelicals, IVF can be problematic. The process is \"inherently unnatural,\" and there are concerns relating to \"the dignity of human embryos,\" said Jason Thacker, an ethicist who directs a research institute at the Southern Baptist Convention.\n\n\"I'm both pro-family and pro-life,\" he said. \"But just because we can do something, it doesn't mean we should.\"\n\nKelly and Alex Pelsor of Indianapolis turned to a fertility specialist after trying to have children naturally for two years. Doctors recommended IVF, which accounts for around 2% of births in the U.S.\n\n\"I was honestly very scared,\" said Pelsor, who believes life begins right after conception. \"I didn't know which way to go.\"\n\nPelsor and her husband prayed. She began attending a Christian infertility support group, and decided to move forward with IVF. Her daughter was born in March 2022.\n\n\"I truly believe she's a miracle from God,\" said Pelsor, 37. \"She would not be here without IVF.\"\n\nPelsor later miscarried a remaining embryo after it was transferred. So she never had to personally face the quandary of what to do with extras.\n\nAmanda Walker of Albuquerque, New Mexico, did.\n\nShe and her husband turned to IVF after five years of trying and a miscarriage.\n\nShe wound up with 10 embryos. She miscarried five. Three became her children: an 8-year-old daughter and twins who will be 3 in July.\n\nThat left her with two more, which she agonized and prayed about.\n\n\"We didn't want to destroy them,\" said Walker, 42. \"We believe that they are children.\"\n\nMatthew Eppinette, a bioethicist, says he hears many similar stories.\n\nCouples tell him, \"'We got way into the process, and we had these frozen embryos, and we just never realized that we were going to have to make decisions about this,'\" said Eppinette, executive director of the Center for Bioethics and Human Dignity at Trinity International University, an evangelical school based in Illinois. He said the church and the medical community should do more to educate people about IVF.\n\nDr. John Storment, a reproductive endocrinologist in Lafayette, Louisiana, said there are ways to minimize the risk of extra embryos. For example, doctors can give less ovary-stimulating medication, or they can fertilize only two or three eggs. These adjustments can add about $5,000 on top of the usual $15,000 to $25,000 for a round of IVF.\n\nReligious scholars say the IVF issue is largely under-explored among evangelical Protestants, who lack the clear position against the procedure taken by the Catholic Church.\n\nStill, Eppinette said most evangelical leaders would advise couples to create only as many embryos as they're going to use.\n\nIn his own life, Eppinette said he and his wife weren't willing to try IVF when they faced infertility.\n\nSome couples find an answer in embryo adoption. Snowflakes, a division of Nightlight Christian Adoptions, has offered this service to more than 9,000 families since 1997, with more than 1,170 births. Executive Director Elizabeth Button said they got an influx of inquiries after the Alabama ruling.\n\nFor the Walkers, Snowflakes offered a perfect solution. They chose an open adoption that allowed them to get to know the family adopting their embryos.\n\nThe adoptive mom miscarried one but gave birth to a daughter with the other. The two families touch base weekly and plan to vacation together.\n\nCouples on the other side of the adoption arrangement say it's been a good solution for them, too.\n\nBefore finding Snowflakes, the Earles of Lakeland, Florida, had struggled with infertility for years and were considering traditional adoption. IVF wasn't an option because of leftover embryo concerns.\n\n\"We asked the Lord to just kind of guide us,\" said Tori, 30, who belongs to a Baptist church.\n\nThey adopted 13 embryos that had been frozen for 20 years. One became their daughter Novalie, born last April. They hope to have another three or four children with the remaining embryos, knowing that not all will grow into a baby.\n\n\"God can use everything to His glory,\" said Sam Earle, 30. \"There's certainly an aspect that you consider with IVF: the ethics of freezing more embryos than you need ... But for families who struggle with infertility, it's a beautiful opportunity.\"\n\nAmanda and Ryan Visser of Sterling, Colorado, feel the same. When they faced infertility after having a child naturally 14 years ago, they were uncomfortable about IVF. \"At some point,\" Ryan said, \"you feel like you're playing God too much.\"\n\nThey fostered and adopted two children, and later heard about Snowflakes. They adopted three embryos. Two became their twin boys, born in October. They plan to use or donate the one they have left.\n\n\"God creates families in so many ways,\" said Amanda, 42.\n\nSeveral Christians who faced infertility said they support the Alabama court ruling. Amanda Visser said she hopes it \"paves the way for more states to consider the dignity of human embryos.\"\n\nStill, no couples said IVF should be stopped, although some wondered whether more regulation or education is needed.\n\nEven among Christians who see embryos as treasured lives, there's a spectrum of complicated views. Kelly Pelsor, for one, doesn't want to see IVF threatened anywhere.\n\n\"When clinics started pausing their services and it looked uncertain for a moment, it broke my heart, because for a lot of people, this is a chance to have a child,\" Pelsor said.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand

Matthew Eppinette and his wife chose to forgo IVF out of ethical concerns and have no children of their own.\n\nAll are guided by a strong Christian faith and believe life begins at or around conception. All have wrestled with the same weighty questions: How do you build a family in a way that conforms with your beliefs? Is IVF an ethical option, especially if it creates more embryos than a couple can use?\n\n\"We live in a world that tries to be black and white on the subject,\" Tori Earle said. \"It's not a black-and-white issue.\"\n\nThe dilemma reflects the age-old friction between faith and science at the heart of the recent IVF controversy in Alabama, where the state Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos have the legal status of children.\n\nPeople are also reading...

State leaders devised a temporary solution that shielded clinics from liability. Concerns about IVF's future prompted U.S. senators from both parties to propose bills aiming to protect IVF nationwide.\n\nLaurie Zoloth, a professor of religion and ethics at the University of Chicago, said arguments about this modern medical procedure touch on two ideas fundamental to American democracy: freedom of religion and who counts as a full person.\n\n\"People have different ideas of what counts as a human being,\" said Zoloth, who is Jewish. \"And it's not a political question. It's really a religious question.\"\n\nFor many evangelicals, IVF can be problematic. The process is \"inherently unnatural,\" and there are concerns relating to \"the dignity of human embryos,\" said Jason Thacker, an ethicist who directs a research institute at the Southern Baptist Convention.\n\n\"I'm both pro-family and pro-life,\" he said. \"But just because we can do something, it doesn't mean we should.\"\n\nKelly and Alex Pelsor of Indianapolis turned to a fertility specialist after trying to have children naturally for two years. Doctors recommended IVF, which accounts for around 2% of births in the U.S.\n\n\"I was honestly very scared,\" said Pelsor, who believes life begins right after conception. \"I didn't know which way to go.\"\n\nPelsor and her husband prayed. She began attending a Christian infertility support group, and decided to move forward with IVF. Her daughter was born in March 2022.\n\n\"I truly believe she's a miracle from God,\" said Pelsor, 37. \"She would not be here without IVF.\"\n\nPelsor later miscarried a remaining embryo after it was transferred. So she never had to personally face the quandary of what to do with extras.\n\nAmanda Walker of Albuquerque, New Mexico, did.\n\nShe and her husband turned to IVF after five years of trying and a miscarriage.\n\nShe wound up with 10 embryos. She miscarried five. Three became her children: an 8-year-old daughter and twins who will be 3 in July.\n\nThat left her with two more, which she agonized and prayed about.\n\n\"We didn't want to destroy them,\" said Walker, 42. \"We believe that they are children.\"\n\nMatthew Eppinette, a bioethicist, says he hears many similar stories.\n\nCouples tell him, \"'We got way into the process, and we had these frozen embryos, and we just never realized that we were going to have to make decisions about this,'\" said Eppinette, executive director of the Center for Bioethics and Human Dignity at Trinity International University, an evangelical school based in Illinois. He said the church and the medical community should do more to educate people about IVF.\n\nDr. John Storment, a reproductive endocrinologist in Lafayette, Louisiana, said there are ways to minimize the risk of extra embryos. For example, doctors can give less ovary-stimulating medication, or they can fertilize only two or three eggs. These adjustments can add about $5,000 on top of the usual $15,000 to $25,000 for a round of IVF.\n\nReligious scholars say the IVF issue is largely under-explored among evangelical Protestants, who lack the clear position against the procedure taken by the Catholic Church.\n\nStill, Eppinette said most evangelical leaders would advise couples to create only as many embryos as they're going to use.\n\nIn his own life, Eppinette said he and his wife weren't willing to try IVF when they faced infertility.\n\nSome couples find an answer in embryo adoption. Snowflakes, a division of Nightlight Christian Adoptions, has offered this service to more than 9,000 families since 1997, with more than 1,170 births. Executive Director Elizabeth Button said they got an influx of inquiries after the Alabama ruling.\n\nFor the Walkers, Snowflakes offered a perfect solution. They chose an open adoption that allowed them to get to know the family adopting their embryos.\n\nThe adoptive mom miscarried one but gave birth to a daughter with the other. The two families touch base weekly and plan to vacation together.\n\nCouples on the other side of the adoption arrangement say it's been a good solution for them, too.\n\nBefore finding Snowflakes, the Earles of Lakeland, Florida, had struggled with infertility for years and were considering traditional adoption. IVF wasn't an option because of leftover embryo concerns.\n\n\"We asked the Lord to just kind of guide us,\" said Tori, 30, who belongs to a Baptist church.\n\nThey adopted 13 embryos that had been frozen for 20 years. One became their daughter Novalie, born last April. They hope to have another three or four children with the remaining embryos, knowing that not all will grow into a baby.\n\n\"God can use everything to His glory,\" said Sam Earle, 30. \"There's certainly an aspect that you consider with IVF: the ethics of freezing more embryos than you need ... But for families who struggle with infertility, it's a beautiful opportunity.\"\n\nAmanda and Ryan Visser of Sterling, Colorado, feel the same. When they faced infertility after having a child naturally 14 years ago, they were uncomfortable about IVF. \"At some point,\" Ryan said, \"you feel like you're playing God too much.\"\n\nThey fostered and adopted two children, and later heard about Snowflakes. They adopted three embryos. Two became their twin boys, born in October. They plan to use or donate the one they have left.\n\n\"God creates families in so many ways,\" said Amanda, 42.\n\nSeveral Christians who faced infertility said they support the Alabama court ruling. Amanda Visser said she hopes it \"paves the way for more states to consider the dignity of human embryos.\"\n\nStill, no couples said IVF should be stopped, although some wondered whether more regulation or education is needed.\n\nEven among Christians who see embryos as treasured lives, there's a spectrum of complicated views. Kelly Pelsor, for one, doesn't want to see IVF threatened anywhere.\n\n\"When clinics started pausing their services and it looked uncertain for a moment, it broke my heart, because for a lot of people, this is a chance to have a child,\" Pelsor said.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this

Tori and Sam Earle \"adopted\" an embryo frozen 20 years earlier by another couple. Matthew Eppinette and his wife chose to forgo IVF out of ethical concerns and have no children of their own.\n\nAll are guided by a strong Christian faith and believe life begins at or around conception. All have wrestled with the same weighty questions: How do you build a family in a way that conforms with your beliefs? Is IVF an ethical option, especially if it creates more embryos than a couple can use?\n\n\"We live in a world that tries to be black and white on the subject,\" Tori Earle said. \"It's not a black-and-white issue.\"\n\nThe dilemma reflects the age-old friction between faith and science at the heart of the recent IVF controversy in Alabama, where the state Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos have the legal status of children.\n\nPeople are also reading... 2 charged in stomping man downtown UPDATED: Sioux City motorcyclist killed in crash on Ingleside Ave. Journal Athlete of the Week: East's Theeler ascends as team leader Woman dies in single-vehicle crash near Vermillion RE/MAX City Centre to host summer movie series Marriage licenses for Woodbury County for June 10, 2024 Journal Special Report: Heating issue at new Woodbury County jail caused months of contentious back-and-forth Judge rules homicide suspect mentally incompetent, suspends case Dena Mae Heeney Community health center supports employees in a culture of positivity NW Iowa softball top performers: Five individuals, five teams that stand out Man charged with burglarizing Sioux City Subway store, stealing cash Sibley therapist accused of sexually abusing 13-year-old MRAC softball: North stays unbeaten, completes road sweep of 4A No. 12 SB-L Dr. John William \"Bill\" Holtze\n\nThe ruling -- which decided a lawsuit about embryos that were accidentally destroyed -- caused large clinics to pause IVF services, sparking a backlash. State leaders devised a temporary solution that shielded clinics from liability. Concerns about IVF's future prompted U.S. senators from both parties to propose bills aiming to protect IVF nationwide.\n\nLaurie Zoloth, a professor of religion and ethics at the University of Chicago, said arguments about this modern medical procedure touch on two ideas fundamental to American democracy: freedom of religion and who counts as a full person.\n\n\"People have different ideas of what counts as a human being,\" said Zoloth, who is Jewish. \"And it's not a political question. It's really a religious question.\"\n\nFor many evangelicals, IVF can be problematic. The process is \"inherently unnatural,\" and there are concerns relating to \"the dignity of human embryos,\" said Jason Thacker, an ethicist who directs a research institute at the Southern Baptist Convention.\n\n\"I'm both pro-family and pro-life,\" he said. \"But just because we can do something, it doesn't mean we should.\"\n\nKelly and Alex Pelsor of Indianapolis turned to a fertility specialist after trying to have children naturally for two years. Doctors recommended IVF, which accounts for around 2% of births in the U.S.\n\n\"I was honestly very scared,\" said Pelsor, who believes life begins right after conception. \"I didn't know which way to go.\"\n\nPelsor and her husband prayed.\n\nShe began attending a Christian infertility support group, and decided to move forward with IVF. Her daughter was born in March 2022.\n\n\"I truly believe she's a miracle from God,\" said Pelsor, 37. \"She would not be here without IVF.\"\n\nPelsor later miscarried a remaining embryo after it was transferred. So she never had to personally face the quandary of what to do with extras.\n\nAmanda Walker of Albuquerque, New Mexico, did.\n\nShe and her husband turned to IVF after five years of trying and a miscarriage.\n\nShe wound up with 10 embryos. She miscarried five. Three became her children: an 8-year-old daughter and twins who will be 3 in July.\n\nThat left her with two more, which she agonized and prayed about.\n\n\"We didn't want to destroy them,\" said Walker, 42. \"We believe that they are children.\"\n\nMatthew Eppinette, a bioethicist, says he hears many similar stories.\n\nCouples tell him, \"'We got way into the process, and we had these frozen embryos, and we just never realized that we were going to have to make decisions about this,'\" said Eppinette, executive director of the Center for Bioethics and Human Dignity at Trinity International University, an evangelical school based in Illinois. He said the church and the medical community should do more to educate people about IVF.\n\nDr. John Storment, a reproductive endocrinologist in Lafayette, Louisiana, said there are ways to minimize the risk of extra embryos. For example, doctors can give less ovary-stimulating medication, or they can fertilize only two or three eggs. These adjustments can add about $5,000 on top of the usual $15,000 to $25,000 for a round of IVF.\n\nReligious scholars say the IVF issue is largely under-explored among evangelical Protestants, who lack the clear position against the procedure taken by the Catholic Church.\n\nStill, Eppinette said most evangelical leaders would advise couples to create only as many embryos as they're going to use.\n\nIn his own life, Eppinette said he and his wife weren't willing to try IVF when they faced infertility.\n\nSome couples find an answer in embryo adoption. Snowflakes, a division of Nightlight Christian Adoptions, has offered this service to more than 9,000 families since 1997, with more than 1,170 births. Executive Director Elizabeth Button said they got an influx of inquiries after the Alabama ruling.\n\nFor the Walkers, Snowflakes offered a perfect solution. They chose an open adoption that allowed them to get to know the family adopting their embryos.\n\nThe adoptive mom miscarried one but gave birth to a daughter with the other. The two families touch base weekly and plan to vacation together.\n\nCouples on the other side of the adoption arrangement say it's been a good solution for them, too.\n\nBefore finding Snowflakes, the Earles of Lakeland, Florida, had struggled with infertility for years and were considering traditional adoption. IVF wasn't an option because of leftover embryo concerns.\n\n\"We asked the Lord to just kind of guide us,\" said Tori, 30, who belongs to a Baptist church.\n\nThey adopted 13 embryos that had been frozen for 20 years. One became their daughter Novalie, born last April. They hope to have another three or four children with the remaining embryos, knowing that not all will grow into a baby.\n\n\"God can use everything to His glory,\" said Sam Earle, 30. \"There's certainly an aspect that you consider with IVF: the ethics of freezing more embryos than you need ... But for families who struggle with infertility, it's a beautiful opportunity.\"\n\nAmanda and Ryan Visser of Sterling, Colorado, feel the same. When they faced infertility after having a child naturally 14 years ago, they were uncomfortable about IVF. \"At some point,\" Ryan said, \"you feel like you're playing God too much.\"\n\nThey fostered and adopted two children, and later heard about Snowflakes. They adopted three embryos. Two became their twin boys, born in October. They plan to use or donate the one they have left.\n\n\"God creates families in so many ways,\" said Amanda, 42.\n\nSeveral Christians who faced infertility said they support the Alabama court ruling. Amanda Visser said she hopes it \"paves the way for more states to consider the dignity of human embryos.\"\n\nStill, no couples said IVF should be stopped, although some wondered whether more regulation or education is needed.\n\nEven among Christians who see embryos as treasured lives, there's a spectrum of complicated views. Kelly Pelsor, for one, doesn't want to see IVF threatened anywhere.\n\n\"When clinics started pausing their services and it looked uncertain for a moment, it broke my heart, because for a lot of people, this is a chance to have a child,\" Pelsor said.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand

Matthew Eppinette and his wife chose to forgo IVF out of ethical concerns and have no children of their own.\n\nAll are guided by a strong Christian faith and believe life begins at or around conception. All have wrestled with the same weighty questions: How do you build a family in a way that conforms with your beliefs? Is IVF an ethical option, especially if it creates more embryos than a couple can use?\n\n\"We live in a world that tries to be black and white on the subject,\" Tori Earle said. \"It's not a black-and-white issue.\"\n\nThe dilemma reflects the age-old friction between faith and science at the heart of the recent IVF controversy in Alabama, where the state Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos have the legal status of children.\n\nPeople are also reading...

State leaders devised a temporary solution that shielded clinics from liability. Concerns about IVF's future prompted U.S. senators from both parties to propose bills aiming to protect IVF nationwide.\n\nLaurie Zoloth, a professor of religion and ethics at the University of Chicago, said arguments about this modern medical procedure touch on two ideas fundamental to American democracy: freedom of religion and who counts as a full person.\n\n\"People have diff erent ideas of what counts as a human being,\" said Zoloth, who is Jewish. \"And it's not a political question. It's really a religious question.\"\n\nFor many evangelicals, IVF can be problematic. The process is \"inherently unnatural,\" and there are concerns relating to \"the dignity of human embryos,\" said Jason Thacker, an ethicist who directs a research institute at the Southern Baptist Convention.\n\n\"I'm both pro-family and pro-life,\" he said. \"But just because we can do something, it doesn't mean we should.\"\n\nKelly and Alex Pelsor of Indianapolis turned to a fertility specialist after trying to have children naturally for two years. Doctors recommended IVF, which accounts for around 2% of births in the U.S.\n\n\"I was honestly very scared,\" said Pelsor, who believes life begins right after conception. \"I didn't know which way to go.\"\n\nPelsor and her husband prayed. She began attending a Christian infertility support group, and decided to move forward with IVF. Her daughter was born in March 2022.\n\n\"I truly believe she's a miracle from God,\" said Pelsor, 37. \"She would not be here without IVF.\"\n\nPelsor later miscarried a remaining embryo after it was transferred. So she never had to personally face the quandary of what to do with extras.\n\nAmanda Walker of Albuquerque, New Mexico, did.\n\nShe and her husband turned to IVF after five years of trying and a miscarriage.\n\nShe wound up with 10 embryos. She miscarried five. Three became her children: an 8-year-old daughter and twins who will be 3 in July.\n\nThat left her with two more, which she agonized and prayed about.\n\n\"We didn't want to destroy them,\" said Walker, 42. \"We believe that they are children.\"\n\nMatthew Eppinette, a bioethicist, says he hears many similar stories.\n\nCouples tell him, \"'We got way into the process, and we had these frozen embryos, and we just never realized that we were going to have to make decisions about this,'\" said Eppinette, executive director of the Center for Bioethics and Human Dignity at Trinity International University, an evangelical school based in Illinois. He said the church and the medical community should do more to educate people about IVF.\n\nDr. John Storment, a reproductive endocrinologist in Lafayette, Louisiana, said there are ways to minimize the risk of extra embryos. For example, doctors can give less ovary-stimulating medication, or they can fertilize only two or three eggs. These adjustments can add about $5,000 on top of the usual $15,000 to $25,000 for a round of IVF.\n\nReligious scholars say the IVF issue is largely under-explored among evangelical Protestants, who lack the clear position against the procedure taken by the Catholic Church.\n\nStill, Eppinette said most evangelical leaders would advise couples to create only as many embryos as they're going to use.\n\nIn his own life, Eppinette said he and his wife weren't willing to try IVF when they faced infertility.\n\nSome couples find an answer in embryo adoption. Snowflakes, a division of Nightlight Christian Adoptions, has offered this service to more than 9,000 families since 1997, with more than 1,170 births. Executive Director Elizabeth Button said they got an influx of inquiries after the Alabama ruling.\n\nFor the Walkers, Snowflakes offered a perfect solution. They chose an open adoption that allowed them to get to know the family adopting their embryos.\n\nThe adoptive mom miscarried one but gave birth to a daughter with the other. The two families touch base weekly and plan to vacation together.\n\nCouples on the other side of the adoption arrangement say it's been a good solution for them, too.\n\nBefore finding Snowflakes, the Earles of Lakeland, Florida, had struggled with infertility for years and were considering traditional adoption. IVF wasn't an option because of leftover embryo concerns.\n\n\"We asked the Lord to just kind of guide us,\" said Tori, 30, who belongs to a Baptist church.\n\nThey adopted 13 embryos that had been frozen for 20 years. One became their daughter Novalie, born last April. They hope to have another three or four children with the remaining embryos, knowing that not all will grow into a baby.\n\n\"God can use everything to His glory,\" said Sam Earle, 30. \"There's certainly an aspect that you consider with IVF: the ethics of freezing more embryos than you need ... But for families who struggle with infertility, it's a beautiful opportunity.\"\n\nAmanda and Ryan Visser of Sterling, Colorado, feel the same. When they faced infertility after having a child naturally 14 years ago, they were uncomfortable about IVF. \"At some point,\" Ryan said, \"you feel like you're playing God too much.\"\n\nThey fostered and adopted two children, and later heard about Snowflakes. They adopted three embryos. Two became their twin boys, born in October. They plan to use or donate the one they have left.\n\n\"God creates families in so many ways,\" said Amanda, 42.\n\nSeveral Christians who faced infertility said they support the Alabama court ruling. Amanda Visser said she hopes it \"paves the way for more states to consider the dignity of human embryos.\"\n\nStill, no couples said IVF should be stopped, although some wondered whether more regulation or education is needed.\n\nEven among Christians who see embryos as treasured lives, there's a spectrum of complicated views. Kelly Pelsor, for one, doesn't want to see IVF threatened anywhere.\n\n\"When clinics started pausing their services and it looked uncertain for a moment, it broke my heart, because for a lot of people, this is a chance to have a child,\" Pelsor said.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this

Republicans also blocked a similar effort to codify the right to contraception earlier this month.\n\nIn another defensive move, Republicans this week sought to pass their own bill seeking to protect access to IVF services. The legislation, authored by Sens. Ted Cruz (Texas) and Katie Britt (Ala.), would have revoked Medicaid funding to any state that enacts an outright ban on access to IVF. But Democrats blocked the measure, saying it contained loopholes that allowed states to restrict IVF.\n\n\"Calling your bill The IVF Protection Act without doing anything to protect IVF is despicable,\" Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), sponsor of the Right to IVF Act, said of the GOP bill during a Wednesday press conference. \"It is akin to an arsonist selling you fire insurance that doesn't cover arson.\"\n\nCruz, who has softened his tone this year as he seeks reelection, meanwhile, accused Democrats of \"playing politics\" on IVF, adding they want to \"scare voters rather than actually protect IVF.\"\n\nThe Alabama Supreme Court ruling in February that declared that frozen embryos can be considered children under state law didn't ban the procedure outright. IVF providers in the state nevertheless responded by ceasing to offer services for fear of being held legally liable if embryos were destroyed. The GOP state legislature later passed a bill extending protections for IVF providers.\n\nDemocrats contend that other states could mount similar efforts to block or curtail IVF services. On Wednesday, the Southern Baptist Convention, the nation's largest Protestant denomination, voted to oppose IVF, a move that \"may signal the beginning of a broad turn on the right against IVF,\" Politico reported.\n\nAmericans broadly support IVF, with 82% of respondents in a recent Gallup poll saying it is morally acceptable. But views on destroying frozen human embryos created by in vitro fertilization were more mixed, with support among Republicans falling off substantially.\n\n\"Senate Republicans who like to pretend that IVF is not under threat should have a word with the likes of the Heritage Foundation and Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America,\" Schumer said Thursday. \"These organizations are some of the most influential authorities in conservatism and on the Republican Party, and they are making it plain as day that IVF is the hard-right's next project.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "igor_bobic@yahoo.com", "name": "Igor Bobic", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filibuster", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Filibuster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Cruz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ted Cruz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Britt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Katie Britt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Alabama", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of Alabama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codification_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Codification (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammy_Duckworth", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tammy Duckworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reproductive rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medicaid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arson", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Embryo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Birth control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_B._Anthony_Pro-Life_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Susan B.

That's the same position held by the Alabama Supreme Court in ruling that frozen embryos have the full rights of people.\n\nIn the wake of that decision, Alabama passed a law shielding IVF providers from prosecution and lawsuits -- reflecting that even in a state with strong anti-abortion sentiment, there is support for a technology used by many couples facing infertility.\n\nThe resolution also urged couples to adopt surplus frozen embryos that would otherwise be destroyed.\n\nDid the resolution condemn IVF or call for its banning?\n\nNot in a blanket way.

The procedure can use a couple's eggs and sperm or those from a donor.\n\nWhy is this an important issue for Southern Baptists?\n\nEver since the nation's largest Protestant body took a conservative turn in the 1980s, it has made opposing abortion a top priority. With the overturning of the Roe v.

Others said that despite that laudable goal, the practice is ethically unacceptable.\n\nSome believe it's ethical to use IVF to create only the number of embryos intended for implantation.\n\nAlbert Mohler, a prominent SBC seminary president and conservative activist, made a hardline denunciation of IVF at a sideline event before the SBC meeting on Monday, calling IVF a \"commodification of the embryo\" that assaults human dignity. He also criticized it for enabling people to have children outside of heterosexual marriage.\n\nDid the resolution call for a government ban on IVF?\n\nNo. It calls for government to \"restrain actions inconsistent with the dignity of ... frozen embryonic human beings.\" But it doesn't prescribe specific measures.\n\n\"I think especially after the Alabama Supreme Court decision, there's been a rush at state level as well as federal level to protect IVF or to even expand IVF access, often with very little thought to some of the other realities at stake,\" said Jason Thacker, a Southern Baptist ethicist who advised the resolutions committee.\n\n\"We're not naive enough to say that we can just ban this technology, full stop,\" he said. \"While that would be the goal, because that's consistent with dignity of the human embryo in many ways,\" he said he recognized that there are others who believe there are ethical ways to apply IVF technology.\n\nWhat's essential, he said, is laws that respect embryos' human dignity.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP's collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

That's the same position held by the Alabama Supreme Court in ruling that frozen embryos have the full rights of people.\n\nIn the wake of that decision, Alabama passed a law shielding IVF providers from prosecution and lawsuits -- reflecting that even in a state with strong anti-abortion sentiment, there is support for a technology used by many couples facing infertility.\n\nThe resolution also urged couples to adopt surplus frozen embryos that would otherwise be destroyed.\n\nDid the resolution condemn IVF or call for its banning?\n\nNot in a blanket way. What it did was denounce the routine practice of creating multiple embryos, frozen for potential use but often with surplus embryos destroyed. It also denounced the use of embryos for experiments, as well as \"dehumanizing methods for determining suitability for life and genetic sorting, based on notions of genetic fitness and parental preferences.\"\n\nKristen Ferguson, chair of the committee on resolutions, said after the vote that the resolution amounts to the SBC's first foray into a new ethnical frontier but rooted in their longstanding belief in \"the sanctity of the human embryo.\"\n\nIVF \"is not respecting the sanctity of the human embryo ... in the way it is routinely practiced,\" she said. \"Right now we're trying to open the conversation, remind Southern Baptists of our long-held beliefs of the sanctity of human life and allow them to begin to think through the ethical implications.\"\n\nShe anticipated there may be resolutions with \"much stronger language\" and more specific applications in the future, such as how these issues relate to the medical community, she said.\n\n\"But we are not speaking to that at this time, because Southern Baptists aren't ready to speak to that yet,\" she said. \"They wanted to say an affirmation of the human embryo and that it has implications for IVF. \"\n\nWhat is IVF?\n\nIn vitro fertilization offers a possible solution when a woman has trouble getting pregnant. The procedure involves retrieving her eggs and combining them in a lab dish with a man's sperm to create a fertilized embryo, which is then transferred into the woman's uterus in an attempt to create a pregnancy.\n\nIVF is done in cycles and may take more than one to create a successful pregnancy, according to The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The procedure can use a couple's eggs and sperm or those from a donor.\n\nWhy is this an important issue for Southern Baptists?\n\nEver since the nation's largest Protestant body took a conservative turn in the 1980s, it has made opposing abortion a top priority. With the overturning of the Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion, new issues have reached the forefront, including IVF.\n\nThis resolution makes clear that Southern Baptists' belief that life begins at conception extends to embryos generated via IVF.\n\nDo Southern Baptists and other conservative evangelicals have consensus on IVF?\n\nNo. On the convention floor, some delegates gave impassioned testimony to how IVF enabled couples to have long-sought children. Others said that despite that laudable goal, the practice is ethically unacceptable.\n\nSome believe it's ethical to use IVF to create only the number of embryos intended for implantation.\n\nAlbert Mohler, a prominent SBC seminary president and conservative activist, made a hardline denunciation of IVF at a sideline event before the SBC meeting on Monday, calling IVF a \"commodification of the embryo\" that assaults human dignity. He also criticized it for enabling people to have children outside of heterosexual marriage.\n\nDid the resolution call for a government ban on IVF?\n\nNo. It calls for government to \"restrain actions inconsistent with the dignity of ... frozen embryonic human beings.\" But it doesn't prescribe specific measures.\n\n\"I think especially after the Alabama Supreme Court decision, there's been a rush at state level as well as federal level to protect IVF or to even expand IVF access, often with very little thought to some of the other realities at stake,\" said Jason Thacker, a Southern Baptist ethicist who advised the resolutions committee.\n\n\"We're not naive enough to say that we can just ban this technology, full stop,\" he said. \"While that would be the goal, because that's consistent with dignity of the human embryo in many ways,\" he said he recognized that there are others who believe there are ethical ways to apply IVF technology.\n\nWhat's essential, he said, is laws that respect embryos' human dignity.\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP's collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

The final vote was 48-47, with only two Republicans defecting: Sens. Susan Collins (Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska).\n\nThe Right to IVF Act, sponsored by Democratic Sens. Tammy Duckworth (D), Patty Murray (D) and Cory Booker (D), is a package of four bills that would both establish a nationwide right to IVF and other assisted reproductive technology, as well as lower the costs of IVF treatment to make it more accessible.\n\nThe vote Thursday is the latest in a series set up by Senate Democratic leadership about codifying reproductive rights.\n\nDemocrats want to drive a wedge between Republicans and put them on the record opposing those efforts, especially as the GOP struggles with how to message its stance on reproductive rights in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\n\"Protecting IVF should be the easiest 'yes' vote the Senate has taken all year. Republicans cannot say they are profamily and then vote against protecting IVF,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said on the floor Thursday.\n\nThursday's vote comes a week after Republicans blocked a similar bill from Democrats that would have guaranteed the right to contraception.\n\nRepublicans criticized the vote as an election year stunt, expressing concerns about unfunded mandates and the impact on religious freedom.\n\nPresident Biden released a statement slamming Republicans for blocking the bill.\n\n\"Once again, Senate Republicans refused to protect access to fertility treatments for women who are desperately trying to get pregnant,\" he said in a statement.\n\n\"Republican officials have had every opportunity to protect reproductive freedom since the Supreme Court's extreme decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, but they refuse to do so. Instead, Republicans' dangerous, out-of-touch agenda is devastating women's health and lives.\"\n\nGOP senators Wednesday tried to bring up their own alternative IVF bill from Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Katie Britt (R-Ala.).\n\nThe effort to pass it unanimously was blocked by Murray.\n\nThe bill \"explicitly allows states to enact restrictions and burdensome requirements that would force IVF clinics to close their doors,\" Murray told reporters Wednesday. \"That bill is nothing but a PR stunt, providing cover for Republicans to keep somehow pretending they're not going to control women's bodies.\"\n\nThe legislation would bar states from receiving Medicaid funding if they implement a ban on IVF. Cruz and Britt also said the legislation would ensure IVF is fully protected by federal law, though it does not create a right to IVF.\n\nThe Republican bill would create an incentive for politicians not to pass legislation banning IVF, but it wouldn't stop a court from restricting the procedure, like what happened in Alabama. It also would have still allowed restrictions on how embryos are stored, implanted and disposed of.\n\nOn the Senate floor Wednesday, Britt said Democrats were only interested in fearmongering.\n\n\"Sadly, they aren't interested in a bill to actually protect IVF access and figuring out how we could get that to become law. That wouldn't advance their true goal, which is about partisan electoral politics,\" Britt said.\n\nFollowing the vote, every Senate Republican signed a pledge saying they \"strongly support\" continued nationwide access to IVF, which surged to the forefront of election year politics when the Alabama Supreme Court in February ruled that embryos are children and thus protected when it comes to the state's wrongful death statute.\n\nSince the court ruling in February, Republicans have loudly spoken up to say they fully support IVF.

That's the same position held by the Alabama Supreme Court in ruling that frozen embryos have the full rights of people.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nIn the wake of that decision, Alabama passed a law shielding IVF providers from prosecution and lawsuits -- reflecting that even in a state with strong anti-abortion sentiment, there is support for a technology used by many couples facing infertility.\n\nThe resolution also urged couples to adopt surplus frozen embryos that would otherwise be destroyed.\n\nDid the resolution condemn IVF or call for its banning?\n\nNot in a blanket way. What it did was denounce the routine practice of creating multiple embryos, frozen for potential use but often with surplus embryos destroyed. It also denounced the use of embryos for experiments, as well as \"dehumanizing methods for determining suitability for life and genetic sorting, based on notions of genetic fitness and parental preferences.\"\n\nKristen Ferguson, chair of the committee on resolutions, said after the vote that the resolution amounts to the SBC's first foray into a new ethnical frontier but rooted in their longstanding belief in \"the sanctity of the human embryo.\"\n\nIVF \"is not respecting the sanctity of the human embryo ... in the way it is routinely practiced,\" she said. \"Right now we're trying to open the conversation, remind Southern Baptists of our long-held beliefs of the sanctity of human life and allow them to begin to think through the ethical implications.\"\n\nShe anticipated there may be resolutions with \"much stronger language\" and more specific applications in the future, such as how these issues relate to the medical community, she said.\n\n\"But we are not speaking to that at this time, because Southern Baptists aren't ready to speak to that yet,\" she said. \"They wanted to say an affirmation of the human embryo and that it has implications for IVF. \"\n\nWhat is IVF?\n\nIn vitro fertilization offers a possible solution when a woman has trouble getting pregnant. The procedure involves retrieving her eggs and combining them in a lab dish with a man's sperm to create a fertilized embryo, which is then transferred into the woman's uterus in an attempt to create a pregnancy.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nIVF is done in cycles and may take more than one to create a successful pregnancy, according to The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The procedure can use a couple's eggs and sperm or those from a donor.\n\nWhy is this an important issue for Southern Baptists?\n\nEver since the nation's largest Protestant body took a conservative turn in the 1980s, it has made opposing abortion a top priority. With the overturning of the Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion, new issues have reached the forefront, including IVF.\n\nThis resolution makes clear that Southern Baptists' belief that life begins at conception extends to embryos generated via IVF.\n\nDo Southern Baptists and other conservative evangelicals have consensus on IVF?\n\nNo. On the convention floor, some delegates gave impassioned testimony to how IVF enabled couples to have long-sought children. Others said that despite that laudable goal, the practice is ethically unacceptable.\n\nSome believe it's ethical to use IVF to create only the number of embryos intended for implantation.\n\nAlbert Mohler, a prominent SBC seminary president and conservative activist, made a hardline denunciation of IVF at a sideline event before the SBC meeting on Monday, calling IVF a \"commodification of the embryo\" that assaults human dignity. He also criticized it for enabling people to have children outside of heterosexual marriage.\n\nDid the resolution call for a government ban on IVF?\n\nNo. It calls for government to \"restrain actions inconsistent with the dignity of ... frozen embryonic human beings.\" But it doesn't prescribe specific measures.\n\n\"I think especially after the Alabama Supreme Court decision, there's been a rush at state level as well as federal level to protect IVF or to even expand IVF access, often with very little thought to some of the other realities at stake,\" said Jason Thacker, a Southern Baptist ethicist who advised the resolutions committee.\n\n\"We're not naive enough to say that we can just ban this technology, full stop,\" he said. \"While that would be the goal, because that's consistent with dignity of the human embryo in many ways,\" he said he recognized that there are others who believe there are ethical ways to apply IVF technology.\n\nWhat's essential, he said, is laws that respect embryos' human dignity.\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP's collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

The final vote was 48-47, with only two Republicans defecting: Sens. Susan Collins (Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska).\n\nThe Right to IVF Act, sponsored by Sens. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.), is a package of four bills that would both establish a nationwide right to IVF and other assisted reproductive technology, as well as lower the costs of IVF treatment to make it more accessible.\n\nThe vote Thursday is the latest in a series set up by Senate Democratic leadership about codifying reproductive rights.\n\nDemocrats want to drive a wedge between Republicans and put them on the record opposing those efforts, especially as the GOP struggles with how to message its stance on reproductive rights in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\n\"Protecting IVF should be the easiest 'yes' vote the Senate has taken all year. Republicans cannot say they are profamily and then vote against protecting IVF,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said on the floor Thursday.\n\nThursday's vote comes a week after Republicans blocked a similar bill from Democrats that would have guaranteed the right to contraception.\n\nRepublicans criticized the vote as an election year stunt, expressing concerns about unfunded mandates and the impact on religious freedom.\n\nGOP senators Wednesday tried to bring up their own alternative IVF bill from Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Katie Britt (R-Ala.).\n\nThe effort to pass it unanimously was blocked by Murray.\n\nThe bill \"explicitly allows states to enact restrictions and burdensome requirements that would force IVF clinics to close their doors,\" Murray told reporters Wednesday. \"That bill is nothing but a PR stunt, providing cover for Republicans to keep somehow pretending they're not going to control women's bodies.\"\n\nThe legislation would bar states from receiving Medicaid funding if they implement a ban on IVF. Cruz and Britt also said the legislation would ensure IVF is fully protected by federal law, though it does not create a right to IVF.\n\nThe Republican bill would create an incentive for politicians not to pass legislation banning IVF, but it wouldn't stop a court from restricting the procedure, like what happened in Alabama. It also would have still allowed restrictions on how embryos are stored, implanted and disposed of.\n\nOn the Senate floor Wednesday, Britt said Democrats were only interested in fearmongering.\n\n\"Sadly, they aren't interested in a bill to actually protect IVF access and figuring out how we could get that to become law. That wouldn't advance their true goal, which is about partisan electoral politics,\" Britt said.\n\nFollowing the vote, every Senate Republican signed a pledge saying they \"strongly support\" continued nationwide access to IVF, which surged to the forefront of election year politics when the Alabama Supreme Court in February ruled that embryos are children and thus protected when it comes to the state's wrongful death statute.\n\nSince the court ruling in February, Republicans have loudly spoken up to say they fully support IVF. But they have also largely avoided the question at the heart of the issue: If they believe life begins at conception, how should clinics handle viable embryos that are not implanted?\n\nDuring IVF treatments, multiple eggs are often harvested, fertilized and then frozen to increase the chances of successful implementation and pregnancy. If an embryo is not viable, if genetic abnormalities are identified or if a patient does not wish to have any more children, common medical practice is to discard them.\n\nThe vote Thursday also comes a day after the Southern Baptist Convention, the largest Protestant denomination in the country, voted to oppose IVF.

Wade.\n\nThe vote to advance the measure failed with 48 votes in favor to 47 opposed, with just two Republicans -- Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska -- joining Democrats and independents. The legislation needed 60 votes to move forward.\n\nThe issue came to the national attention after the Alabama Supreme Court earlier this year ruled that embryos are considered children under state law, prompting providers to halt fertility treatments. The legislature later approved a bill to protect IVF in the state.\n\nAcross the nation, Democrats put the blame on Republicans as the development raised concern about similar moves elsewhere, warning of a new front in the fight over reproductive rights.\n\n\"Now that the hard right has finished eliminating Roe, they're setting their sights on IVF,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said after the vote on Thursday. \"By blocking the Right to IVF Act, Senate Republicans have fallen in line with MAGA extremists who have made it clear IVF is their next target.\"\n\nThe package, called the Right to IVF Act, is made up of four bills, some of which have previously been blocked by Senate Republicans. It's sponsored by Sens. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, Patty Murray of Washington and Cory Booker of New Jersey, and centers on a right to receive and provide IVF services, while working to make the treatments more affordable.\n\nOne measure would create a statutory right for access to assisted reproductive services like IVF. Duckworth tried to secure passage of the bill in February under unanimous consent, but one Republican senator objected, claiming that it would go too far. The package also includes a measure geared toward expanding access to the fertility treatments for veterans, which was likewise blocked by a Republican senator earlier this year. Other provisions are aimed at lowering costs for Americans by requiring insurance plans to cover IVF.\n\nAnother push related to reproductive rights fell short in the Senate last week, when Democrats tried to advance legislation protecting access to contraception, with most Republicans opposing the measure. The two votes come as part of an effort by Democrats to highlight reproductive rights this month, with an eye toward the November elections, which Republicans have criticized. But Schumer argues that the votes aren't mere messaging votes, they show Americans who their senators are.\n\n\"Today Senate Republicans showed us just who they were -- they are against supporting and protecting IVF,\" Schumer said.\n\nSenate Democrats have wanted to put Republicans on the record over the issues related to reproductive rights, which have been a driving force at the polls.\n\n\"Republicans just voted against IVF for all the world to see, on the record,\" Murray said after the vote. \"So let's put to rest once and for all the idea Republicans actually care about protecting IVF access.\"\n\nWhen it comes to IVF, although Senate Republicans have expressed support for the fertility treatments in the wake of the Alabama ruling, lawmakers are at odds over a path forward that would satisfy both parties.\n\nLast month, two Senate Republicans, Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Katie Britt of Alabama, introduced legislation to protect access to the procedure, urging bipartisan support. But Democrats quickly pushed back on the legislation, questioning its scope and enforcement mechanism.\n\nThe GOP bill, called the IVF Protection Act, would require that states \"do not prohibit in vitro fertilization\" as a condition for the states to receive federal funding for Medicaid, which provides health insurance for low-income Americans. The bill doesn't compel an organization or individual to provide IVF services, and it doesn't preclude states from otherwise regulating IVF, which Democrats generally oppose.\n\nOn Wednesday, Cruz and Britt attempted to approve the legislation under unanimous consent, in order to preempt the Democrat-led vote on Thursday. But Murray blocked the move, calling it a \"PR tool\" and argued that it's \"ridiculous to claim that this bill protects IVF when it does nothing of the sort.\"\n\nMurray and other Democrats have highlighted concerns over granting personhood rights to embryos, since embryos are often discarded during fertility treatments. They've warned that the GOP legislation doesn't address the handling of frozen embryos, which could threaten access to the fertility treatments, while saying it's an intentional move to appeal to the anti-abortion movement.\n\nAll 49 Senate Republicans signed on to a statement released later Wednesday reiterating their support for the fertility treatments, saying they \"strongly support continued nationwide access to IVF.\"\n\nSen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, reiterated the message Thursday, saying from the Senate floor ahead of the vote, \"Republicans in the Senate support IVF.\" He added that \"the tragic situation in Alabama has been used to fearmonger and scare that IVF is somehow in jeopardy,\" saying \"that is not true.\"\n\n\"There is no state in the United States of America that prohibits a woman from growing her family through IVF,\" Cassidy said. \"And Democrats know that.\"\n\nBut Democrats say the Alabama ruling tells a different story. And on Wednesday, the country's largest Protestant denomination adopted a resolution criticizing IVF, calling on Southern Baptists to \"reaffirm the unconditional value and fight to life of every human being, including those in an embryonic stage.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reproductive rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assisted reproductive technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammy_Duckworth", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tammy Duckworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patty_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Patty Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nThe resolution -- approved near the end of the Southern Baptist Convention's two-day annual meeting -- affirms that embryos are human beings from the moment of fertilization, whether in the womb or generated in the laboratory via IVF. That's the same position held by the Alabama Supreme Court in ruling that frozen embryos have the full rights of people.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIn the wake of that decision, Alabama passed a law shielding IVF providers from prosecution and lawsuits -- reflecting that even in a state with strong anti-abortion sentiment, there is support for a technology used by many couples facing infertility.\n\nThe resolution also urged couples to adopt surplus frozen embryos that would otherwise be destroyed.\n\nDid the resolution condemn IVF or call for its banning?\n\nNot in a blanket way. What it did was denounce the routine practice of creating multiple embryos, frozen for potential use but often with surplus embryos destroyed. It also denounced the use of embryos for experiments, as well as \"dehumanizing methods for determining suitability for life and genetic sorting, based on notions of genetic fitness and parental preferences.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nKristen Ferguson, chair of the committee on resolutions, said after the vote that the resolution amounts to the SBC's first foray into a new ethnical frontier but rooted in their longstanding belief in \"the sanctity of the human embryo.\"\n\nYou might be interested in Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIVF \"is not respecting the sanctity of the human embryo ... in the way it is routinely practiced,\" she said. \"Right now we're trying to open the conversation, remind Southern Baptists of our long-held beliefs of the sanctity of human life and allow them to begin to think through the ethical implications.\"\n\nShe anticipated there may be resolutions with \"much stronger language\" and more specific applications in the future, such as how these issues relate to the medical community, she said.\n\n\"But we are not speaking to that at this time, because Southern Baptists aren't ready to speak to that yet,\" she said. \"They wanted to say an affirmation of the human embryo and that it has implications for IVF. \"\n\nWhat is IVF?\n\nIn vitro fertilization offers a possible solution when a woman has trouble getting pregnant. The procedure involves retrieving her eggs and combining them in a lab dish with a man's sperm to create a fertilized embryo, which is then transferred into the woman's uterus in an attempt to create a pregnancy.\n\nIVF is done in cycles and may take more than one to create a successful pregnancy, according to The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The procedure can use a couple's eggs and sperm or those from a donor.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nWhy is this an important issue for Southern Baptists?\n\nEver since the nation's largest Protestant body took a conservative turn in the 1980s, it has made opposing abortion a top priority. With the overturning of the Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion, new issues have reached the forefront, including IVF.\n\nThis resolution makes clear that Southern Baptists' belief that life begins at conception extends to embryos generated via IVF.\n\nDo Southern Baptists and other conservative evangelicals have consensus on IVF?\n\nNo. On the convention floor, some delegates gave impassioned testimony to how IVF enabled couples to have long-sought children.

They deployed a similar strategy last week, when Democrats held a vote on a bill that would have guaranteed a nationwide right to contraception - which, like IVF, is very popular. That bill, the Right to Contraception act, also failed.\n\n\"Last week, every senator was put on the record as to whether they will defend the right to contraception. And despite Republicans' words about supporting birth control, their actions - voting against the Right to Contraception act - spoke louder,\" Murray said in a speech from the Senate floor Thursday. \"Today, we are putting Republicans on the record on another issue families across the country are deeply concerned about: the right to IVF.\"\n\nLouisiana senator Bill Cassidy, a Republican, slammed the bill, which he said was motivated by \"political purposes\".\n\n\"This is not serious legislation,\" Cassidy said. \"It was not brought through the committee process. It is a political process.\"\n\nBecause IVF typically involves creating embryos that may not be implanted in a woman's uterus or may go unused after genetic testing, some anti-abortion campaigners have long opposed IVF. However, the US abortion wars have rarely focused on IVF.\n\nThen, in February, the Alabama state supreme court ruled that frozen embryos created through IVF are legally \"extrauterine children\" - a decision that endorsed the tenets of so-called fetal personhood, promoted by a US movement that seeks to endow embryos and fetuses with full legal rights and protections. The ruling led many IVF providers in Alabama to temporarily pause their operations, which created chaos and triggered backlash across the country.\n\nStill, anti-abortion activists have continued to gain ground in their battle on IVF. On Wednesday, the Southern Baptist Convention, the largest Protestant group in the US, voted at its annual to condemn IVF. With its nearly 13 million members and enormous political influence, the Southern Baptist Convention's rejection of IVF signaled a turning point in the debate over IVF. Although evangelical Protestants have largely supported IVF, the vote suggests that the anti-abortion movement is successfully making the case that opposition to abortion necessitates opposition to IVF.\n\n\"This is not the end of our fight for family building for all. We will continue until everyone in this country has access to the family building options they need and the availability of IVF is guaranteed in all 50 states,\" Barbara Collura, president and CEO of Resolve: The National Infertility Association, said in a statement Thursday, after the failed Senate vote. \"Introducing this bill was already a big win for advocates of increasing access to fertility treatments. Our work led to this comprehensive legislation, and we are not giving up.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri":

That's the same position held by the Alabama Supreme Court in ruling that frozen embryos have the full rights of people.\n\nIn the wake of that decision, Alabama passed a law shielding IVF providers from prosecution and lawsuits -- reflecting that even in a state with strong anti-abortion sentiment, there is support for a technology used by many couples facing infertility.\n\nThe resolution also urged couples to adopt surplus frozen embryos that would otherwise be destroyed.\n\nNot in a blanket way. What it did was denounce the routine practice of creating multiple embryos, frozen for potential use but often with surplus embryos destroyed. It also denounced the use of embryos for experiments, as well as \"dehumanizing methods for determining suitability for life and genetic sorting, based on notions of genetic fitness and parental preferences.\"\n\nKristen Ferguson, chair of the committee on resolutions, said after the vote that the resolution amounts to the SBC's first foray into a new ethnical frontier but rooted in their longstanding belief in \"the sanctity of the human embryo.\"\n\nIVF \"is not respecting the sanctity of the human embryo ... in the way it is routinely practiced,\" she said. \"Right now we're trying to open the conversation, remind Southern Baptists of our long-held beliefs of the sanctity of human life and allow them to begin to think through the ethical implications.\"\n\nShe anticipated there may be resolutions with \"much stronger language\" and more specific applications in the future, such as how these issues relate to the medical community, she said.\n\n\"But we are not speaking to that at this time, because Southern Baptists aren't ready to speak to that yet,\" she said. \"They wanted to say an affirmation of the human embryo and that it has implications for IVF. \"\n\nIn vitro fertilization offers a possible solution when a woman has trouble getting pregnant. The procedure involves retrieving her eggs and combining them in a lab dish with a man's sperm to create a fertilized embryo, which is then transferred into the woman's uterus in an attempt to create a pregnancy.\n\nIVF is done in cycles and may take more than one to create a successful pregnancy, according to The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The procedure can use a couple's eggs and sperm or those from a donor.\n\nEver since the nation's largest Protestant body took a conservative turn in the 1980s, it has made opposing abortion a top priority. With the overturning of the Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion, new issues have reached the forefront, including IVF.\n\nThis resolution makes clear that Southern Baptists' belief that life begins at conception extends to embryos generated via IVF.\n\nNo. On the convention floor, some delegates gave impassioned testimony to how IVF enabled couples to have long-sought children. Others said that despite that laudable goal, the practice is ethically unacceptable.\n\nSome believe it's ethical to use IVF to create only the number of embryos intended for implantation.\n\nAlbert Mohler, a prominent SBC seminary president and conservative activist, made a hardline denunciation of IVF at a sideline event before the SBC meeting on Monday, calling IVF a \"commodification of the embryo\" that assaults human dignity.

IVF involves combining eggs and sperm in a laboratory dish to create an embryo.\n\nThe move is the latest sign that U.S. evangelicals - a powerful voting bloc that helped propel Donald Trump to victory in the 2016 presidential election - are broadening their anti-abortion efforts, two years after successfully helping to overturn Roe v.

Trump's challenger for the Nov. 5 election - President Joe Biden - in turn has made access to abortion, contraception and fertility treatments a centerpiece of his campaign, arguing that reproductive rights are at risk if Trump were to be re-elected.\n\nThe Southern Baptist Convention includes 50,000 churches and over 14 million faithful and has become a political force in recent decades. The IVF resolution before the thousands of leaders gathered in Indianapolis noted the pain infertile couples encounter but said that \"not all technological means of assisting human reproduction are equally God-honoring or morally justified.\"\n\nBefore the IVF vote, some Baptist leaders spoke about their own experiences with IVF and urged a softening of the resolution's language to put less emphasis on the frozen embryos involved in the medical process. Daniel Taylor, a deacon with Charity Baptist Church in Paris, Michigan, spoke emotionally about his godson, who was born through IVF.\n\n\"Because of him, I thank God for IVF,\" Taylor said. He added that the IVF resolution \"would castigate and condemn the entirely moral and ethical actions\" of parents seeking to have a child through IVF.\n\nThe resolution recommended members use alternative fertility therapies or adopt frozen embryos. The resolution called on \"Southern Baptists to reaffirm the unconditional value and right to life of every human being, including those in an embryonic stage, and to only utilize reproductive technologies consistent with that affirmation.\"\n\n'STAND FOR LIFE' In February, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos should be considered children. The ruling arose from lawsuits by three families against Alabama fertility procedure providers accused of failing to properly safeguard frozen embryos, resulting in their destruction when a patient improperly accessed them.\n\nThe court ruling was based on an amendment to the Alabama state constitution approved by voters in 2018 that made it official policy to uphold \"the sanctity of unborn life and the rights of unborn children.\" The court ruling left unclear how to legally store, transport and use embryos. Democrats portrayed Alabama's all-Republican high court as bent on further restricting women's ability to make choices about reproduction following the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that toppled Roe, abolishing women's constitutional right to abortion.\n\nRepublicans faced backlash nationwide, even as some particularly conservative members of the party continued to question IVF procedures. In Alabama, the Republican-led state legislature passed measures aimed at protecting IVF providers from both criminal charges and civil lawsuits, and the Republican governor quickly signed them into law, prompting Alabama providers who had halted the IVF procedure following the court ruling to resume offering the treatment.\n\nIn Washington, Republican senators blocked Democrats' attempt to guarantee access to IVF treatments, saying the proposal went too far. In May, Brent Leatherwood, head of the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, wrote U.S. senators to urge more robust oversight of the IVF process.\n\n\"A human embryo is a life. This life is as deserving of protection and all the standards of care we would give to a child or an adult,\" Leatherwood wrote. \"In the post-Roe moment we find ourselves in, we must make the most of this opportunity to stand for life in all its forms.\" FEMALE PASTORS\n\nThe proposed constitutional change banning women pastors, known as the Law Amendment, had been approved during last year's annual meeting. By church rules, any such change must be approved at two consecutive annual meetings, and this year it was approved by 61.45% of church leaders who voted - short of the two-thirds majority required. The denomination has in recent annual meetings voted that individual churches that have female leaders were no longer in \"friendly cooperation\" with the organization, citing the denomination's doctrine and scriptures as indicating that only men can lead a church.\n\nThe over 10,000 church leaders - known as \"messengers\" - attending the meeting and voting on an array of issues, fell just short of officially changing the SBC's constitution to assert that a church can only employ \"men as any kind of pastor or elder as qualified by the scripture.\" Individual Baptist churches are largely autonomous, typically locally own their own facilities and make their own decisions on how to worship.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Baptist_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southern Baptist Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Embryo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelicalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Evangelicalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assisted reproductive technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptists", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baptists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reproductive rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

That's the same position held by the Alabama Supreme Court in ruling that frozen embryos have the full rights of people.\n\nAdvertisementBreaking News\n\nGet the latest breaking news from North Texas and beyond.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nOr with:\n\nGoogleFacebook\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nIn the wake of that decision, Alabama passed a law shielding IVF providers from prosecution and lawsuits -- reflecting that even in a state with strong anti-abortion sentiment, there is support for a technology used by many couples facing infertility.\n\nThe resolution also urged couples to adopt surplus frozen embryos that would otherwise be destroyed.\n\nAdvertisementDid the SBC resolution condemn IVF or call for its banning?\n\nNot in a blanket way. What it did was denounce the routine practice of creating multiple embryos, frozen for potential use but often with surplus embryos destroyed. It also denounced the use of embryos for experiments, as well as \"dehumanizing methods for determining suitability for life and genetic sorting, based on notions of genetic fitness and parental preferences.\"\n\nKristen Ferguson, chair of the committee on resolutions, said after the vote that the resolution amounts to the SBC's first foray into a new ethnical frontier but rooted in their longstanding belief in \"the sanctity of the human embryo.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIVF \"is not respecting the sanctity of the human embryo ... in the way it is routinely practiced,\" she said. \"Right now we're trying to open the conversation, remind Southern Baptists of our long-held beliefs of the sanctity of human life and allow them to begin to think through the ethical implications.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe anticipated there may be resolutions with \"much stronger language\" and more specific applications in the future, such as how these issues relate to the medical community, she said.\n\nWhat is IVF?\n\nIn vitro fertilization offers a possible solution when a woman has trouble getting pregnant. The procedure involves retrieving her eggs and combining them in a lab dish with a man's sperm to create a fertilized embryo, which is then transferred into the woman's uterus in an attempt to create a pregnancy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIVF is done in cycles and may take more than one to create a successful pregnancy, according to The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The procedure can use a couple's eggs and sperm or those from a donor.\n\nDo Southern Baptists and other conservative evangelicals have consensus on IVF?\n\nNo. On the convention floor, some delegates gave impassioned testimony to how IVF enabled couples to have long-sought children. Others said that despite that laudable goal, the practice is ethically unacceptable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome believe it's ethical to use IVF to create only the number of embryos intended for implantation.\n\nAlbert Mohler, a prominent SBC seminary president and conservative activist, made a hardline denunciation of IVF at a sideline event before the SBC meeting on Monday, calling IVF a \"commodification of the embryo\" that assaults human dignity. He also criticized it for enabling people to have children outside of heterosexual marriage.\n\nDid the resolution call for a government ban on IVF?\n\nNo. It calls for government to \"restrain actions inconsistent with the dignity of ... frozen embryonic human beings.\" But it doesn't prescribe specific measures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I think especially after the Alabama Supreme Court decision, there's been a rush at state level as well as federal level to protect IVF or to even expand IVF access, often with very little thought to some of the other realities at stake,\" said Jason Thacker, a Southern Baptist ethicist who advised the resolutions committee.\n\n\"We're not naive enough to say that we can just ban this technology, full stop,\" he said. \"While that would be the goal, because that's consistent with dignity of the human embryo in many ways,\" he said he recognized that there are others who believe there are ethical ways to apply IVF technology.\n\nWhat's essential, he said, is laws that respect embryos' human dignity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy PETER SMITH, The Associated Press\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP's collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

They deployed a similar strategy last week, when Democrats held a vote on a bill that would have guaranteed a nationwide right to contraception - which, like IVF, is very popular. That bill, the Right to Contraception act, also failed.\n\n\"Last week, every senator was put on the record as to whether they will defend the right to contraception. And despite Republicans' words about supporting birth control, their actions - voting against the Right to Contraception act - spoke louder,\" Murray said in a speech from the Senate floor on Thursday. \"Today, we are putting Republicans on the record on another issue families across the country are deeply concerned about: the right to IVF.\"\n\nThe Louisiana senator Bill Cassidy, a Republican, denounced the bill, which he said was motivated by \"political purposes\".\n\n\"This is not serious legislation,\" Cassidy said. \"It was not brought through the committee process. It is a political process.\"\n\nBecause IVF typically involves creating embryos that may not be implanted in a woman's uterus or may go unused after genetic testing, some anti-abortion campaigners have long opposed IVF. However, the US abortion wars have rarely focused on IVF.\n\nThen, in February, the Alabama state supreme court ruled that frozen embryos created through IVF are legally \"extrauterine children\" - a decision that endorsed the tenets of so-called fetal personhood, promoted by a US movement that seeks to endow embryos and fetuses with full legal rights and protections. The ruling led many IVF providers in Alabama to temporarily pause their operations, which created chaos and triggered backlash across the country.\n\nRelated: Despite the supreme court ruling for the abortion pill, the battle is far from over\n\nStill, anti-abortion activists have continued to gain ground in their battle on IVF. On Wednesday, the Southern Baptist Convention, the largest Protestant group in the US, voted at its annual meeting to condemn IVF. With its nearly 13 million members and enormous political influence, the Southern Baptist Convention's rejection of IVF signaled a turning point in the debate over IVF. Although evangelical Protestants have largely supported IVF, the vote suggests that the anti-abortion movement is successfully making the case that opposition to abortion necessitates opposition to IVF.\n\n\"This is not the end of our fight for family building for all. We will continue until everyone in this country has access to the family building options they need and the availability of IVF is guaranteed in all 50 states,\" Barbara Collura, president and CEO of Resolve: The National Infertility Association, said in a statement Thursday, after the failed Senate vote. \"Introducing this bill was already a big win for advocates of increasing access to fertility treatments.

The fertilized egg is later implanted into a woman's uterus to increase the odds of pregnancy. Fertilized eggs are sometimes discarded during the process if they are not growing properly or if a family has more fertilized eggs than they need.\n\nThe Senate's IVF legislative package combines language from four smaller IVF bills from Sens. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Cory Booker, D-N.J.\n\nThe final vote was 48-47, with Republicans Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska joining Democrats in voting to end debate and move forward on the legislation. The Senate requires 60 votes to move forward on the bill.\n\nAt the end of the vote, Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., changed his vote from yes to no, so he could bring up the legislation later under Senate rules.\n\nBefore the vote, Democrats described the vote as an uncontroversial moral decision: either vote to protect families' access to IVF or stand in the way.\n\n\"Today, we are putting Republicans on the record on an issue families across the country are deeply concerned about -- the right to IVF,\" Murray said from the Senate floor.\n\nSome senators told personal stories. Schumer, also an original co-sponsor of the bill, talked about how his grandchild was born because of IVF.\n\nDuckworth spoke of how she would not have been able to have children if not for IVF, telling her colleagues that the pain of miscarriages was worse than any wound she suffered while serving in the military.\n\nBut Republicans accused Democrats of distorting facts and politicizing a deeply personal issue for political gain.\n\nSen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., argued that no states currently ban IVF, and said the Alabama legislature passed a law protecting IVF after the court decision. Cassidy also criticized Democrats for not getting a Congressional Budget Office score for the bill and not going through the committee process.\n\n\"This is not serious legislation. It was not brought through the committee process. It is a political process,\" Cassidy said.\n\nThe package includes language from two bills from Duckworth, who has long spoken about her personal experience using IVF.\n\nOne would establish a statutory right for health practitioners to provide IVF, patients to seek these services and for insurance plans to cover these treatments without interference.\n\nThe second would require health plans and insurers participating in the Federal Employees Health Benefit program to cover fertility treatments.\n\nThe package also included language from a bill sponsored by Booker that would require employer-sponsored plans to cover fertility treatments.\n\nFinally, it included language from Murray's bill that would expand fertility treatments covered through the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs, including cryopreservation ahead of deployment and IVF.\n\nSome state laws and advocacy groups argue that life begins at conception as opposed to implantation, a debate which has triggered a reckoning among Republican lawmakers who want to support IVF but oppose destroying viable embryos.\n\nSBA Pro-Life America has opposed existing IVF legislation offered from both parties, seeking additional ethical protections before endorsing bills.\n\nSenate Republicans have pushed for an alternative IVF bill from Sens. Katie Britt, R-Ala. and Ted Cruz, R-Texas, that would require states that receive federal Medicaid funds to not prohibit IVF. The pair introduced the bill in May.\n\nSen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., announced a seven-figure ad buy in early June stating his commitment to protecting IVF access. Scott is not a co-sponsor of either the GOP or the Democrat-led bill.\n\nThe vote comes just one day after thousands of delegates at the Southern Baptist Convention voted to formally oppose IVF, a vote largely symbolic of when evangelicals believe personhood begins.\n\nThe resolution called on the government to restrain actions inconsistent with the dignity \"of every human being,\" including embryos.", "source": {"uri": "rollcall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Roll Call"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jessica_wehrman@rollcall.com", "name": "Jessica Wehrman", "type": "author", "isAgency":

The Southern Baptist Convention, the largest Protestant denomination in the U.S., today voted to condemn the use of in vitro fertilization, signaling the campaign by evangelicals against abortion is widening to include the popular fertility treatment.\n\nThe Southern Baptist Convention, the largest Protestant denomination in the U.S., today voted to condemn the use of in vitro fertilization, signaling the campaign by evangelicals against abortion is widening to include the popular fertility treatment.\n\nEarlier at its annual meeting, a proposed amendment to the church's constitution that would have banned women as pastors fell just short of the two-thirds majority vote it needed to pass.\n\nIn its vote against in vitro fertilization, or IVF, the Southern Baptists said the process routinely creates more embryos than can be implanted and that leads to the destruction of hundreds of thousands of frozen embryos, which the church considers human life.\n\nIVF involves combining eggs and sperm in a laboratory dish to create an embryo.\n\nThe move is the latest sign that U.S. evangelicals -- a powerful voting bloc that helped propel Donald Trump to victory in the 2016 presidential election -- are broadening their anti-abortion efforts, two years after successfully helping to overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\nTrump's challenger for the Nov. 5 election -- President Joe Biden -- in turn has made access to abortion, contraception and fertility treatments a centerpiece of his campaign, arguing that reproductive rights are at risk if Trump were to be re-elected.\n\nThe Southern Baptist Convention includes 50,000 churches and over 14 million faithful and has become a political force in recent decades.\n\nThe IVF resolution before the thousands of leaders gathered in Indianapolis noted the pain infertile couples encounter but said that \"not all technological means of assisting human reproduction are equally God-honoring or morally justified.\"\n\nBefore the IVF vote, some Baptist leaders spoke about their own experiences with IVF and urged a softening of the resolution's language to put less emphasis on the frozen embryos involved in the medical process.\n\nDaniel Taylor, a deacon with Charity Baptist Church in Paris, Michigan, spoke emotionally about his godson, who was born through IVF.\n\n\"Because of him, I thank God for IVF,\" Taylor said.\n\nHe added that the IVF resolution \"would castigate and condemn the entirely moral and ethical actions\" of parents seeking to have a child through IVF.\n\nThe resolution recommended members use alternative fertility therapies or adopt frozen embryos.\n\nThe resolution called on \"Southern Baptists to reaffirm the unconditional value and right to life of every human being, including those in an embryonic stage, and to only utilize reproductive technologies consistent with that affirmation.\"\n\n'STAND FOR LIFE'\n\nIn February, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos should be considered children. The ruling arose from lawsuits by three families against Alabama fertility procedure providers accused of failing to properly safeguard frozen embryos, resulting in their destruction when a patient improperly accessed them.\n\nThe court ruling was based on an amendment to the Alabama state constitution approved by voters in 2018 that made it official policy to uphold \"the sanctity of unborn life and the rights of unborn children.\" The court ruling left unclear how to legally store, transport and use embryos.\n\nDemocrats portrayed Alabama's all-Republican high court as bent on further restricting women's ability to make choices about reproduction following the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that toppled Roe, abolishing women's constitutional right to abortion.\n\nRepublicans faced backlash nationwide, even as some particularly conservative members of the party continued to question IVF procedures.\n\nIn Alabama, the Republican-led state legislature passed measures aimed at protecting IVF providers from both criminal charges and civil lawsuits, and the Republican governor quickly signed them into law, prompting Alabama providers who had halted the IVF procedure following the court ruling to resume offering the treatment.\n\nIn Washington, Republican senators blocked Democrats' attempt to guarantee access to IVF treatments, saying the proposal went too far.\n\nIn May, Brent Leatherwood, head of the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, wrote U.S. senators to urge more robust oversight of the IVF process.\n\n\"A human embryo is a life. This life is as deserving of protection and all the standards of care we would give to a child or an adult,\" Leatherwood wrote. \"In the post-Roe moment we find ourselves in, we must make the most of this opportunity to stand for life in all its forms.\"\n\nFEMALE PASTORS\n\nThe proposed constitutional change banning women pastors, known as the Law Amendment, had been approved during last year's annual meeting. By church rules, any such change must be approved at two consecutive annual meetings, and this year it was approved by 61.45% of church leaders who voted -- short of the two-thirds majority required.\n\nThe denomination has in recent annual meetings voted that individual churches that have female leaders were no longer in \"friendly cooperation\" with the organization, citing the denomination's doctrine and scriptures as indicating that only men can lead a church.\n\nThe over 10,000 church leaders -- known as \"messengers\" -- attending the meeting and voting on an array of issues, fell just short of officially changing the SBC's constitution to assert that a church can only employ \"men as any kind of pastor or elder as qualified by the scripture.\"\n\nIndividual Baptist churches are largely autonomous, typically locally own their own facilities and make their own decisions on how to worship.", "source": {"uri": "staradvertiser.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Honolulu Star Advertiser"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@staradvertiser.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Baptist_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southern Baptist Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_denomination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Christian denomination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assisted reproductive technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Embryo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelicalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Evangelicalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Alabama", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of Alabama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptists", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baptists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

(Photo by Sandy Huffaker/Getty Images)\n\nWASHINGTON -- Alabama Republican Sen. Katie Britt's efforts to pass legislation that would block Medicaid funding from going to states that ban in vitro fertilization were unsuccessful Wednesday when Democrats blocked the bill from advancing.\n\nBritt, who introduced the legislation earlier this year alongside Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, said during brief debate the bill would assuage concerns about couples losing access to IVF, though Democrats said the measure fell short of providing real protections.\n\nDebate took place shortly after the Southern Baptist Convention, the United States' largest Protestant religious organization and one with significant influence in conservative politics, voted to condemn IVF.\n\nIt also came one day before the entire U.S. Senate is set to vote on a bill from Democrats that would provide nationwide protections for IVF. That measure also lacks the bipartisan backing needed to advance to final passage.\n\n\"For the millions of Americans who face infertility every year, IVF provides the hope of a pathway to parenthood,\" Britt said on the floor. \"We all have loved ones -- whether they're family members or friends -- who have become parents or grandparents through IVF.\"\n\nBritt said that ensuring access to IVF is \"fundamentally pro-family\" and that the legislation should provide couples with \"certainty and peace of mind that IVF will remain legal and available in every single state.\"\n\nWashington Democratic Sen. Patty Murray said the Britt-Cruz bill would still allow states to \"enact burdensome and unnecessary\" regulations on IVF that could lead to the kind of \"legal uncertainty and risk\" that forced IVF clinics in Alabama to close temporarily earlier this year.\n\n\"Even though it is an inherent part of the IVF process that families will make more embryos than they need,\" Murray said. \"This bill does absolutely nothing -- not a single thing -- to ensure families who use IVF can have their clinics dispose of unused embryos without facing legal threats for a standard medical procedure.\"\n\nMurray said GOP senators were completely ignoring the issue of what happens to frozen embryos and using the bill as a \"PR tool.\"\n\n\"The stone-cold reality is that you cannot protect IVF and champion fetal personhood,\" Murray said.\n\nThe Britt-Cruz legislation would prevent a state from receiving Medicaid funding if it barred access to IVF, though the bill didn't say anything about states that define life as beginning at fertilization.\n\nThe Alabama state Supreme Court ruling earlier this year that frozen embryos constituted children didn't explicitly ban IVF, but all of the state's clinics stopped operating until the legislature provided civil and criminal protections.\n\nCruz sought to pass the bill using the unanimous consent process, where any one senator can ask for approval and any one senator can block that legislation from moving forward. Murray blocked Cruz's request.\n\nUnanimous consent requests don't include a recorded vote.\n\nThe legislation had three additional co-sponsors -- Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, Roger Wicker of Mississippi and Roger Marshall of Kansas.\n\nThe Senate is set to take a procedural vote as soon as Thursday on legislation from Democrats that would bolster protections for IVF, though that bill isn't expected to get the GOP support needed to move forward.\n\nThat bill is more detailed and broader than the Britt-Cruz bill, which has received criticism from Democrats as being insufficient.\n\nNew Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker said Wednesday during a press conference that access to IVF shouldn't be turned into a political issue and called on GOP senators to back the bill.\n\n\"We can't make this seem like a left-right issue. It's absolutely not,\" Booker said. \"This is an issue that's overwhelmingly supported in America by Republican families, Democratic families and independent families. And so trying to make this into some kind of typical political debate in Washington is just wrong.\"\n\nBooker said protecting access to IVF is, instead, \"about protecting fundamental rights, expanding opportunity, taking care of our military families.\"\n\nIllinois Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth, the bill's lead co-sponsor who has been open about using IVF to have her two daughters, threw cool water on working with Republicans on a bipartisan bill when asked about the possibility during the press conference.\n\n\"Well, they're welcome to join ours and make it bipartisan. We've got 47 co-sponsors thus far and it's a very simple piece of legislation,\" Duckworth said. \"I can't see why they wouldn't join it.\n\n\"In contrast, 90% of Republicans have not signed on to Senator Britt's bill,\" Duckworth added.\n\nSenate debate on in vitro fertilization is taking place the same week the Southern Baptist Convention meets in Indiana for its annual convention.\n\nDuring that two-day gathering more than 10,000 Baptists, called messengers, voted on official policies of the SBC, which included objecting to how IVF is practiced now.\n\nThe SBC wrote in its resolution that IVF \"most often engages in the destruction of embryonic human life and increasingly engages in dehumanizing methods for determining suitability for life and genetic sorting, based on notions of genetic fitness and parental preferences.\"\n\nThe resolution on IVF \"resolved\" that members of the SBC should \"only utilize reproductive technologies consistent with that affirmation\" as well as several other affirmations within the document.\n\nThe resolution was titled, \"On the Ethical Realities of Reproductive Technologies and the Dignity of the Human Embryo.\"\n\nKristen Ferguson, from 11th Street Baptist Church in Upland, California, who announced the resolution before the vote, opposed an amendment that would have made several changes to the text.\n\nFerguson said during a brief debate the committee that wrote the resolutions for the SBC to vote on wanted to make sure it addressed IVF \"with the utmost sensitivity.\"\n\nShe added that members of the resolutions committee did \"not take this topic lightly and we want to make sure that we're speaking carefully about it.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Wade, the landmark 1973 ruling federally guaranteeing abortion access, in June 2022. In February, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled frozen embryos used in IVF must legally be treated as children under state law, though after a public outcry this move was reversed by the state legislature.\n\nThe IVF process involves extracting eggs from a woman's ovaries and fertilizing them with sperm in a laboratory. The fertilized eggs, or embryos, are then cultured for a few days before being implanted into the woman's uterus.\n\nCruz and Britt pushed for a vote on their bill on Wednesday but the move was blocked by Democrats, who are instead advancing legislation introduced by Illinois Senator Tammy Duckworth which would prevent states banning IVF treatment and also aim to make the procedure more affordable.\n\nThe Democrats move to block the vote was condemned by Cruz in a post on X, where he said: \"Dems are playing politics with IVF.\n\n\"We should have passed my bill providing iron-clad protection for IVF in federal law. But Dems blocked it because they want to scare voters rather than actually protect IVF.\"\n\nSenator Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington state, said that the proposal was a \"PR tool, plain and simple.\"\n\nShe added: \"I am not going to mince words here. It is ridiculous to claim that this bill protects IVF when it does nothing of the sort.\"\n\nWhen approached for comment, Cruz's Washington, D.C., office referred Newsweek to a joint statement issued on Wednesday by all 49 Republican Senators.\n\nIt said: \"Senate Democrats have embraced a Summer of Scare Tactics - a partisan campaign of false fearmongering intended to mislead and confuse the American people.\n\n\"In vitro fertilization is legal and available in every state across our nation. We strongly support continued nationwide access to IVF, which has allowed millions of aspiring parents to start and grow their families.\"\n\nDemocrats are expected to try and force a vote on Duckworth's rival legislation on Thursday.\n\nIn an interview with NBC News Duckworth, who had two children using IVF herself, questioned whether Republicans are truly committed to the treatment.\n\nShe said: \"You can't support fetal personhood or a fertilized egg as a person and also support IVF.\n\n\"And that is the critical part that our Republican colleagues are trying to hide from the American people.\"\n\nReferring to her personal experience Duckworth added: \"So many families go through this pain of trying to conceive and not being able to conceive and trying to figure out what was happening.\n\n\"With IVF, I was finally able to hold my baby and have my children, and they are the joys of my life.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the Southern Baptist Convention, the largest Protestant Christian group in the U.S., voted against the use of IVF claiming the treatment violates their belief in \"unconditional value and right to life of every human being,\" which they believe includes embryos.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_bickerton@newsweek.com", "name": "James Bickerton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Cruz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ted Cruz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Britt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Katie Britt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

Earlier at its annual meeting, a proposed amendment to the church's constitution that would have banned women as pastors fell just short of the two-thirds majority vote it needed to pass. In its vote against in vitro fertilization, or IVF, the Southern Baptists said the process routinely creates more embryos than can be implanted and that leads to the destruction of hundreds of thousands of frozen embryos, which the church considers human life. IVF involves combining eggs and sperm in a laboratory dish to create an embryo. The move is the latest sign that U.S. evangelicals - a powerful voting bloc that helped propel Donald Trump to victory in the 2016 presidential election - are broadening their anti-abortion efforts, two years after successfully helping to overturn Roe v. Wade. Trump's challenger for the Nov. 5 election - President Joe Biden - in turn has made access to abortion, contraception and fertility treatments a centerpiece of his campaign, arguing that reproductive rights are at risk if Trump were to be re-elected. The Southern Baptist Convention includes 50,000 churches and over 14 million faithful and has become a political force in recent decades. The IVF resolution before the thousands of leaders gathered in Indianapolis noted the pain infertile couples encounter but said that \"not all technological means of assisting human reproduction are equally God-honoring or morally justified.\" Before the IVF vote, some Baptist leaders spoke about their own experiences with IVF and urged a softening of the resolution's language to put less emphasis on the frozen embryos involved in the medical process. Daniel Taylor, a deacon with Charity Baptist Church in Paris, Michigan, spoke emotionally about his godson, who was born through IVF. \"Because of him, I thank God for IVF,\" Taylor said. He added that the IVF resolution \"would castigate and condemn the entirely moral and ethical actions\" of parents seeking to have a child through IVF. The resolution recommended members use alternative fertility therapies or adopt frozen embryos. The resolution called on \"Southern Baptists to reaffirm the unconditional value and right to life of every human being, including those in an embryonic stage, and to only utilize reproductive technologies consistent with that affirmation.\" In February, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos should be considered children. The ruling arose from lawsuits by three families against Alabama fertility procedure providers accused of failing to properly safeguard frozen embryos, resulting in their destruction when a patient improperly accessed them. The court ruling was based on an amendment to the Alabama state constitution approved by voters in 2018 that made it official policy to uphold \"the sanctity of unborn life and the rights of unborn children.\" The court ruling left unclear how to legally store, transport and use embryos.", "source": {"uri": "thedailyherald.sx", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "editorial_dept@thedailyherald.sx", "name": "Editorial Dept.", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Baptist_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southern Baptist Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Embryo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assisted reproductive technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelicalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Evangelicalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sperm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_denomination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christian denomination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supermajority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptists", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baptists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reproductive rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

Republicans, Democrats split over the latest push.", "body": "IVF treatments are resuming on Thursday in Alabama as many were put on hold after a controversial ruling by the state Supreme Court a few weeks ago.\n\nWASHINGTON - The Senate will vote Thursday on a push to protect access to in vitro fertilization, though it's expected to fail in the face of nearly unanimous opposition from the chamber's Republicans.\n\nDemocrats including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., have promised to bring up a series of votes protecting reproductive health this summer in an effort to squeeze Republicans with uncomfortable decisions in the lead up to the November election.\n\nSenators on Thursday will consider The Right to IVF Act, a bill from Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., who used the treatment to have two children, and Sens. Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Cory Booker, D-N.J. It would bar states from adding restrictions to IVF and require insurance plans to cover the fertility treatment.\n\n\"Just a few years ago, it would have been unthinkable, unimaginable even, that access to a safe and widely used reproductive service like IVF would be put at risk,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor Wednesday. \"But sadly, after frightening decisions like the one from Alabama, not even IVF is safe in the aftermath of Roe.\"\n\nThe Alabama Supreme Court ruled earlier this year that embryos used in IVF are children. While the Alabama legislature quickly carved out new rules aimed at protecting IVF providers, the decision has created new questions on reproductive health services outside of abortion, including access to IVF, birth control and more.\n\nThe Senate vote also comes the same day that the Supreme Court threw out a case challenging the legality of mifepristone, known as the abortion pill, and the day after the Southern Baptist Convention voted to oppose in vitro fertilization - illustrating the rapidly shifting landscape of an issue that animates voters across the country.\n\nMost Senate Republicans will vote against the bill, which they argue tramples on religious freedoms and would extend beyond IVF. All 49 Senate Republicans signed a statement released Thursday ahead of the vote saying that \"Senate Democrats have embraced a Summer of Scare Tactics.\"\n\nIt's \"a partisan campaign of false fearmongering intended to mislead and confuse the American people. In vitro fertilization is legal and available in every state across our nation,\" they wrote. \"We strongly support continued nationwide access to IVF, which has allowed millions of aspiring parents to start and grow their families.\"\n\nRepublicans have been pushing an alternative bill that seeks to protect IVF sponsored by Sens. Katie Britt, R-Ala., and Ted Cruz, R-Texas. They sought unanimous consent to pass that bill on Wednesday, but it was struck down by an objection from Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., who called it \"a PR tool, plain and simple.\"\n\nBritt and Cruz's bill would withhold Medicaid funding for states that enact an outright ban on IVF. It comes as Republicans have said they want to protect IVF but have hesitated to tell states how to regulate the procedure.\n\nDemocrats oppose the Republican bill because they argue states could still pass laws that give embryos the same rights as a child.\n\n\"It absolutely is a real solution. It's the only one that can get 60 votes in that chamber,\" Britt said of her bill. \"I think it's critically important that we stop trying to scare women who are looking to experience God's greatest gift, that is being a mother.\"", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammy_Duckworth", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tammy Duckworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Booker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cory Booker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Alabama", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of Alabama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alabama Legislature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mifepristone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mifepristone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Baptist_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southern Baptist Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patty_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patty Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

A little more than 10 days away from the second-anniversary of the Supreme Court's disastrous Dobbs decision that put IVF at risk, Senate Democrats pushed to pass this pro-family, pro-freedom legislative package that would both establish a right to IVF and other assisted reproductive technology (ART), expand access for hopeful parents, Veterans and federal employees as well as lower the costs of IVF treatment for middle class families. In her remarks on the Senate floor ahead of the vote, Duckworth slammed Republicans for blocking her previous legislation to protect IVF access after the Alabama Supreme Court ruling shut down state clinics and painted IVF parents and their doctors as criminals -- proving that their public \"support for IVF\" was a ruse to mislead voters. Senator Duckworth's remarks can be found on YouTube.\n\n\"As very real threats against IVF continue to grow, Republicans today had yet another chance to prove their so-called 'support for IVF' by helping us pass our legislation that would protect IVF access and lower fertility care costs nationwide -- and nearly every single Republican voted against it,\" said Senator Duckworth. \"Despite literally campaigning on the fact that they support IVF, this marks the third time Republicans have blocked legislation I've led to protect IVF -- making it clear that the only thing Republicans do care about is misleading voters and bowing down to the most extreme wing of their party. Today, Republicans once again turned their backs on families, Veterans and the majority of Americans who support access to IVF. And we won't forget it.\"\n\n\"Republicans just voted against IVF for all the world to see, on the record. So let's put to rest, once and for all, the idea Republicans actually care about protecting IVF access. And while we are at it -- let's put to rest this utter fiction that their bill does anything to support IVF. The issue with Republicans' bill isn't that it doesn't do enough to protect IVF, it is that their bill does nothing to meaningfully protect IVF from the very real threats from lawmakers and anti-abortion extremists in their party all over this country. Their bill would allow states to regulate IVF out of existence!\" said Senator Murray. \"Republicans will keep trying to cry 'fearmonger' but it's hard to hide a fire when everyone can see the flames. We saw what happened in Alabama, the chaos that caused. We saw what happened yesterday in Indianapolis, a prominent conservative group voting to fully, explicitly oppose IVF -- and we saw how Republicans voted today. Everyone in America knows the threat to IVF is real, and it is not going away just because it's inconvenient for Republicans. And Democrats are not going away either -- we are going to keep fighting to protect IVF, make sure everyone can access this medical care, and make sure no politician can stand in the way.\"\n\n\"I am profoundly disappointed that Senate Republicans have voted today to deny countless families the opportunity and the right to make their own deeply personal decisions about starting a family,\" said Senator Booker. \"I will never stop fighting for the fundamental freedoms of all Americans, and I will continue to advocate for comprehensive reproductive health care that is affordable and accessible to everyone in this country. No family should have to endure hardship to realize their dream of having children. This fight is far from over.\"\n\nAhead of today's vote on their Right to IVF Act, Senators Duckworth and Murray released the following fact sheet that outlines the very real and growing threat Republican lawmakers in Congress and across the country are posing to IVF and other ART. Yesterday, Duckworth, Murray and Booker joined IVF patients, providers and advocates in coordination with RESOLVE and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) for a press conference to underscore the urgent need to pass the Right to IVF Act as Republicans continue their anti-choice, anti-science crusade.\n\nBuilding on the lawmakers' previous efforts to protect and strengthen access to IVF, the Right to IVF Act includes updated and enhanced versions of:\n\nSenator Duckworth's Access to Family Building Act, which would establish a nationwide right for patients to access IVF and other ART services, a right for doctors to provide IVF treatment in accordance with medical standards as well as a right for insurance carriers to cover IVF without prohibition, limitation, interference or impediment. By establishing a statutory right, this would pre-empt any state effort to limit such access and ensuring no hopeful parent -- or their doctors -- are punished for trying to start or grow a family.\n\nIn February, Senator Duckworth sought unanimous consent to pass this legislation and Republican U.S. Senator of Mississippi Cindy Hyde-Smith blocked it.\n\nSenator Murray's Veteran Families Health Services Act, which would expand the fertility treatments and family-building services that are covered under servicemembers' and Veterans' health care to include -- among other things -- the option for individuals to cryopreserve their gametes (freeze their eggs or sperm) ahead of deployment to a combat zone and in vitro fertilization (IVF) for servicemembers and veterans who are unable to conceive without assistance.\n\nIn March, Senator Murray sought unanimous consent to pass this legislation and Republican U.S. Senator of Oklahoma James Lankford blocked it.\n\nSenator Booker's Access to Infertility Treatment and Care Act, which would increase affordability of fertility care -- including IVF -- by requiring employer-sponsored insurance plans and other public insurance plans to cover fertility treatments. Additionally, it would standardize a baseline of high-quality fertility treatment coverage under private health insurance plans, while protecting Americans against excessive out-of-pocket costs.\n\nSenator Duckworth's Family Building FEHB Fairness Act, which would require Federal Employees Health Benefit (FEHB) Program -- the largest employer-sponsored health insurance plan in the world -- carriers to cover IVF and ART to help more hardworking Americans start and grow their families.\n\nThroughout her time in the Senate, Duckworth has made protecting reproductive freedom and expanding access to IVF top priorities in the face of Republicans' anti-choice crusade. When Senator Hyde-Smith blocked Senator Duckworth's Access to Family Building Act from passing through unanimous consent, this was the second time Senate Republicans blocked Duckworth-led legislation that would protect access to IVF nationwide. The Access to Family Building Act builds on previous legislation she introduced in 2022.\n\nMeanwhile, while Senate Democrats continue their efforts to protect IVF and reproductive freedom, Senate Republicans continue to make it clear that they want to further undermine access to basic healthcare for millions of Americans. Duckworth condemned the so-called \"IVF Protection\" bill led by U.S. Senators Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Katie Britt (R-AL) that wouldn't do anything to protect IVF, but actually incentivize state legislatures to both ban IVF and defund Medicaid at the same time -- unpopular, extreme policies that far-right Republican policymakers have sought to do for decades.\n\nDuckworth and Murray also joined their Senate Democratic women colleagues in excoriating new legislation introduced by Senate Republicans that would create a new government-run website to collect data on pregnant women and direct them to anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers and other \"resources\" to pressure women into carrying pregnancies to term, no matter their circumstances.\n\nDuckworth was the first Senator to give birth while serving in office and had both of her children with the help of IVF. In 2018, she advocated for the Senate to change its rules so she could bring her infant onto the Senate floor.\n\n-30-", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammy_Duckworth", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tammy Duckworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Booker", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cory Booker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patty_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patty Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assisted reproductive technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

That's the same position held by the Alabama Supreme Court in ruling that frozen embryos have the full rights of people.\n\nIn the wake of that decision, Alabama passed a law shielding IVF providers from prosecution and lawsuits -- reflecting that even in a state with strong anti-abortion sentiment, there is support for a technology used by many couples facing infertility.\n\nThe resolution urged members \"to advocate for the government to restrain actions inconsistent with the dignity and value of every human being, which necessarily includes frozen embryonic human beings.\"\n\nIt also exhorted members to \"promote adoption\" and \"to consider adopting frozen embryos in order to rescue those who are eventually to be destroyed.\"\n\nIn vitro fertilization offers a possible solution when a woman has trouble getting pregnant. The procedure involves retrieving her eggs and combining them in a lab dish with a man's sperm to create a fertilized embryo, which is then transferred into the woman's uterus in an attempt to create a pregnancy.\n\nIVF is done in cycles and may take more than one to create a successful pregnancy, according to The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The procedure can use a couple's eggs and sperm or those from a donor.\n\nNot in a blanket way. What it did was denounce the routine practice of creating multiple embryos, frozen for potential use but often with surplus embryos destroyed. It also denounced the use of embryos for experiments, as well as \"dehumanizing methods for determining suitability for life and genetic sorting, based on notions of genetic fitness and parental preferences.\"\n\nKristen Ferguson, chair of the committee on resolutions, said after the vote that the resolution amounts to the SBC's first foray into a new ethnical frontier but rooted in their longstanding belief in \"the sanctity of the human embryo.\"\n\nIVF \"is not respecting the sanctity of the human embryo ... in the way it is routinely practiced,\" she said. \"Right now we're trying to open the conversation, remind Southern Baptists of our long-held beliefs of the sanctity of human life and allow them to begin to think through the ethical implications.\"\n\nShe anticipated there may be resolutions with \"much stronger language\" and more specific applications in the future, such as how these issues relate to the medical community, she said.\n\n\"But we are not speaking to that at this time, because Southern Baptists aren't ready to speak to that yet,\" she said. \"They wanted to say an affirmation of the human embryo and that it has implications for IVF. \"\n\nEver since the nation's largest Protestant body took a conservative turn in the 1980s, it has made opposing abortion a top priority. With the overturning of the Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion, new issues have reached the forefront, including IVF.\n\nThis resolution makes clear that Southern Baptists' belief that life begins at conception extends to embryos generated via IVF.\n\nNo. On the convention floor, some delegates gave impassioned testimony to how IVF enabled couples to have long-sought children. Others said that despite that laudable goal, the practice is ethically unacceptable.\n\nSome believe it's ethical to use IVF to create only the number of embryos intended for implantation.\n\nAlbert Mohler, a prominent SBC seminary president and conservative activist, made a hardline denunciation of IVF at a sideline event before the SBC meeting on Monday, calling IVF a \"commodification of the embryo\" that assaults human dignity. He also criticized it for enabling people to have children outside of heterosexual marriage.\n\nNo. It calls for government to \"restrain actions inconsistent with the dignity of ... frozen embryonic human beings.\" But it doesn't prescribe specific measures.\n\n\"I think especially after the Alabama Supreme Court decision, there's been a rush at state level as well as federal level to protect IVF or to even expand IVF access, often with very little thought to some of the other realities at stake,\" said Jason Thacker, a Southern Baptist ethicist who advised the resolutions committee.\n\n\"We're not naive enough to say that we can just ban this technology, full stop,\" he said. \"While that would be the goal, because that's consistent with dignity of the human embryo in many ways,\" he said he recognized that there are others who believe there are ethical ways to apply IVF technology.\n\nWhat's essential, he said, is laws that respect embryos' human dignity.", "source": {"uri": "nbcchicago.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Chicago"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Baptist_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southern Baptist Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Embryo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Uterus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Infertility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_embryonic_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human embryonic development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Alabama", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of Alabama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sperm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_denomination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christian denomination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_College_of_Obstetricians_and_Gynecologists", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctity_of_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sanctity of life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_(biology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fitness (biology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

Katie Britt's efforts to pass legislation that would block Medicaid funding from going to states that ban in vitro fertilization were unsuccessful Wednesday when Democrats blocked the bill from advancing.\n\nBritt, who introduced the legislation earlier this year alongside Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, said during brief debate the bill would assuage concerns about couples losing access to IVF, though Democrats said the measure fell short of providing real protections.\n\nDebate took place shortly after the Southern Baptist Convention, the United States' largest Protestant religious organization and one with significant influence in conservative politics, voted to condemn IVF.\n\nIt also came one day before the entire U.S. Senate is set to vote on a bill from Democrats that would provide nationwide protections for IVF. That measure also lacks the bipartisan backing needed to advance to final passage.\n\n\"For the millions of Americans who face infertility every year, IVF provides the hope of a pathway to parenthood,\" Britt said on the floor. \"We all have loved ones -- whether they're family members or friends -- who have become parents or grandparents through IVF.\"\n\nBritt said that ensuring access to IVF is \"fundamentally pro-family\" and that the legislation should provide couples with \"certainty and peace of mind that IVF will remain legal and available in every single state.\"\n\nWashington Democratic Sen. Patty Murray said the Britt-Cruz bill would still allow states to \"enact burdensome and unnecessary\" regulations on IVF that could lead to the kind of \"legal uncertainty and risk\" that forced IVF clinics in Alabama to close temporarily earlier this year.\n\n\"Even though it is an inherent part of the IVF process that families will make more embryos than they need,\" Murray said. \"This bill does absolutely nothing -- not a single thing -- to ensure families who use IVF can have their clinics dispose of unused embryos without facing legal threats for a standard medical procedure.\"\n\nMurray said GOP senators were completely ignoring the issue of what happens to frozen embryos and using the bill as a \"PR tool.\"\n\n\"The stone-cold reality is that you cannot protect IVF and champion fetal personhood,\" Murray said.\n\nSpeaker Jon Burns presides over the House during the 2024 legislative session. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder\n\nOn the same day, Georgia House Speaker Jon Burns said he would support legislation protecting access to IVF treatment, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.\n\n\"There should be no question that in-vitro fertilization will remain available in Georgia,\" Burns said in a statement. \"Millions of families - many across our state - have struggled with fertility, and IVF has been a life-changing blessing for so many of them to become parents.\"\n\nBurns pointed to a House resolution, which did not require a vote, that passed on the last day of the 2024 legislative session expressing support for IVF. He said a bill would be in the works for next year that would \"enshrine those protections in law,\" though he did not offer specifics for how a bill might specifically protect access to IVF in Georgia.\n\nThe Britt-Cruz legislation would prevent a state from receiving Medicaid funding if it barred access to IVF, though the bill didn't say anything about states that define life as beginning at fertilization.\n\nThe Alabama state Supreme Court ruling earlier this year that frozen embryos constituted children didn't explicitly ban IVF, but all of the state's clinics stopped operating until the legislature provided civil and criminal protections.\n\nCruz sought to pass the bill using the unanimous consent process, where any one senator can ask for approval and any one senator can block that legislation from moving forward. Murray blocked Cruz's request.\n\nUnanimous consent requests don't include a recorded vote.\n\nThe legislation had three additional co-sponsors -- Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, Roger Wicker of Mississippi and Roger Marshall of Kansas.\n\nThe Senate is set to take a procedural vote as soon as Thursday on legislation from Democrats that would bolster protections for IVF, though that bill isn't expected to get the GOP support needed to move forward.\n\nThat bill is more detailed and broader than the Britt-Cruz bill, which has received criticism from Democrats as being insufficient.\n\nNew Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker said Wednesday during a press conference that access to IVF shouldn't be turned into a political issue and called on GOP senators to back the bill.\n\n\"We can't make this seem like a left-right issue. It's absolutely not,\" Booker said. \"This is an issue that's overwhelmingly supported in America by Republican families, Democratic families and independent families. And so trying to make this into some kind of typical political debate in Washington is just wrong.\"\n\nBooker said protecting access to IVF is, instead, \"about protecting fundamental rights, expanding opportunity, taking care of our military families.\"\n\nIllinois Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth, the bill's lead co-sponsor who has been open about using IVF to have her two daughters, threw cool water on working with Republicans on a bipartisan bill when asked about the possibility during the press conference.\n\n\"Well, they're welcome to join ours and make it bipartisan. We've got 47 co-sponsors thus far and it's a very simple piece of legislation,\" Duckworth said. \"I can't see why they wouldn't join it.\n\n\"In contrast, 90% of Republicans have not signed on to Senator Britt's bill,\" Duckworth added.\n\nSenate debate on in vitro fertilization is taking place the same week the Southern Baptist Convention meets in Indiana for its annual convention.\n\nDuring that two-day gathering more than 10,000 Baptists, called messengers, voted on official policies of the SBC, which included objecting to how IVF is practiced now.\n\nThe SBC wrote in its resolution that IVF \"most often engages in the destruction of embryonic human life and increasingly engages in dehumanizing methods for determining suitability for life and genetic sorting, based on notions of genetic fitness and parental preferences.\"\n\nThe resolution on IVF \"resolved\" that members of the SBC should \"only utilize reproductive technologies consistent with that affirmation\" as well as several other affirmations within the document.\n\nThe resolution was titled, \"On the Ethical Realities of Reproductive Technologies and the Dignity of the Human Embryo.\"\n\nKristen Ferguson, from 11th Street Baptist Church in Upland, California, who announced the resolution before the vote, opposed an amendment that would have made several changes to the text.\n\nFerguson said during a brief debate the committee that wrote the resolutions for the SBC to vote on wanted to make sure it addressed IVF \"with the utmost sensitivity.\"\n\nShe added that members of the resolutions committee did \"not take this topic lightly and we want to make sure that we're speaking carefully about it.\"\n\nGeorgia Recorder Deputy Editor Jill Nolin contributed to this report.\n\nThe post Republican IVF

Many on the right have begun to question whether the practice, which often discards fertilized eggs, is at odds with their beliefs on when life begins, even as it is relied upon by millions of Americans to grow their families and is supported by the overwhelming majority of evangelicals.\n\n\"It's going to be a long process. It took us 50 years to take down Roe,\" said Brent Leatherwood, president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, the public policy arm of the SBC. \"It may take us a similarly long time frame to get people to a place where they are thinking more deeply about something like this. It's okay. It takes time. We have to be patient.\"\n\nThe resolution, which was passed by nearly 11,000 so-called messengers to the Southern Baptist Convention's annual meeting, declares that IVF \"most often participates in the destruction of embryonic human life\" and calls on Southern Baptists to adopt and \"only utilize reproductive technologies\" that affirm \"the unconditional value and right to life of every human being.\"\n\nThough the resolution is nonbinding, nearly 13 million Southern Baptists across 45,000 churches may now face pressure from the pulpit or in individual conversations with pastors to eschew IVF.\n\nWhile Catholics have long opposed IVF, many Protestant denominations have largely ignored it even as they have preached on the sanctity of life as it relates to abortion. That is starting to change in the wake of the Alabama Supreme Court's decision in February that ruled that frozen embryos created during the IVF process should have full personhood rights.\n\nThe Southern Baptists' Wednesday vote could encourage other evangelical denominations and churches to follow suit in declaring -- or at least teaching about -- their ethical concerns with IVF.\n\n\"This is a very powerful faith group,\" said Christa Brown, an advocate for reform within the denomination as it relates to sexual assault and women's issues. \"They have huge influence not only because of their own numbers but because they're a bellwether for all of white evangelicalism.\"\n\nThe IVF conversation has put Republicans in an uncomfortable position as they stare down polling showing overwhelming popular support for IVF. A CBS News/YouGov poll earlier this year found that 86 percent of respondents thought IVF should be legal, and a survey released in December by a firm run by Kellyanne Conway, former President Donald Trump's former senior counselor and campaign manager, found that IVF had 78 percent support among self-identified \"pro-life advocates\" and 83 percent among evangelical Christians.\n\nThe Alabama high court's decision forced many evangelicals to for the first time think deeply about the ethical implications of the procedure, which as commonly practiced in the U.S. results in the destruction of excess embryos. Doctors create extra embryos to ensure the best chance of a successful pregnancy. The leftover embryos are frozen, destroyed or donated to medical research.\n\nMany evangelicals are now coming around to the fact that their conviction that life begins at conception must be applied to IVF, too. If abortion is murder, the destruction of viable embryos created during the IVF process is as well.\n\n\"I know friends -- fellow believers -- that have struggled with fertility issues,\" said Katie Royce, a member of Birchman Baptist Church in Fort Worth, Texas. \"It does pain my heart to see them not just invest so much money into IVF because they want to have a natural-born baby of their own, but it breaks my heart because I think, well, have you done all the research behind it? Or did you just cock the gun and pull the trigger?\"\n\nSome Republicans in Washington have responded to the IVF discourse by signing onto legislation creating broad federal protections for IVF or introducing their own bills to expand access to the procedure. Last month, Sen. Ted Crux (R-Texas), a Southern Baptist, and Katie Britt (R-Ala.) introduced legislation to strip Medicaid funding from any state that bans IVF, a proposal the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission resoundingly condemned in a recent letter.\n\nAlbert Mohler, a prominent evangelical theologian, president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary and one of the two people who submitted the IVF resolution for consideration, said Republican elected officials need to do better.\n\n\"I'm very frustrated. A lot of them are responding out of political expediency, not out of moral principle. You can't say on one hand life begins at fertilization and then on the other hand say but now we're not so concerned about that in this other arena,\" Mohler said. \"I find the initiatives and legislation to be deeply troubling and I think they reveal a lack of seriousness on the part of many social conservatives.\"\n\nMohler and Andrew Walker, an ethics professor at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, have long advocated on the IVF issue. But they said the Alabama Supreme Court decision created an opportunity for a wider conversation about the practice within the denomination.\n\n\"Do I think this means that Southern Baptist couples will never ever pursue IVF again? No, I don't think that's the case,\" Walker said. \"I think that this is a very helpful point in time brought about by national circumstances that is allowing us to make an initial but very important statement on IVF.\"\n\nStill, the issue can be hard for Republicans who want to tout their \"pro-life\" credentials but not alienate the vast majority of their constituents who accept IVF as a common way to bring life into the world. Even House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Southern Baptist and former ERLC trustee, has struggled with how to talk about the issue. He has publicly underscored his support for IVF while declining to weigh in on whether the destruction of unused embryos is murder.\n\n\"We've seen many politicians come out in support of IVF, and the messaging often clearly is, we want to support families in expanding and growing their families. We want to say 'yes and amen' to that, but not by any means possible,\" said Jason Thacker, a senior fellow and director of the research institute at the ERLC. \"We have to consider the ethical implications and realities of these technologies and making sure that we're valuing human life even in the embryonic stage.\"\n\nMany Southern Baptists were doing just that during their annual meeting this week. In interviews, many said they hadn't fully thought through the ethical implications of IVF. Those who had were split on whether IVF can be used ethically if no embryos are destroyed, or whether IVF is inherently unethical because it separates conception from sex between husband and wife.\n\nErick Sessions, a pastor at Graceland Church in New Albany, Indiana, is in the latter camp. He and his wife struggled to conceive for seven years; they ultimately decided against IVF because of ethical concerns and decided instead to foster children. Nearly 15 years later, they have four adopted and five naturally conceived children.\n\n\"Anytime you get outside of the normal means within which procreation occurs, the more foreign you get or the more alien you get from that, the more you have to consider its moral implications,\" Sessions said. \"When you divorce it now from the actual physical act of sex, and you put it into a laboratory, it just becomes further and further away from the normal means within the natural world of procreation.\"\n\nBut he said he is unsure whether his congregation is ready to hear about IVF from the pulpit. One of the pastors at his church, he said, has had a child through IVF.\n\nKaren Patrick, whose husband is senior pastor at First Baptist Church of Sylacauga, Alabama, said she had conversations with friends immediately after the state Supreme Court decision forced many families to pause the IVF process as the Legislature scrambled to pass a bill that would allow procedures to resume in the state. Patrick said there was \"a lot of confusion\" about IVF in the women's study group she leads at church.\n\n\"I had conversations just immediately after that with some friends who were struggling with how this decision impacted people that they knew personally, whose process of IVF had been put on hold and not knowing what was going to happen with that, and just trying to help people think through that while being sympathetic to those who were very much wanting to have children,\" Patrick said. \"Until recently, I didn't really think through that deeply either.\"\n\nHer husband, Rick, said Monday that he planned to support the IVF resolution. Though he said he normally preaches on abortion, not IVF, he said he's gotten more questions on the latter from congregants in advance of this week's meeting.\n\n\"I'm sensitive to the couple that wants to have a child. Certainly you want to help them. It's just disheartening. The bottom line is, life begins at conception and I firmly believe it does. The way we would do any kind of IVF, we need to not produce the additional fertilized eggs that are going to assuredly be destroyed,\" he said. \"That is just unconscionable that we would kill those lives. We don't want murder, to murder those human beings.\"\n\nFor Kelsey Melvin, who attends International Baptist Church in Arlington, Texas, it's personal. She and her husband are deciding whether to move forward with IVF; if they do, they plan to have as many children as viable embryos are created.\n\nMelvin, after hearing Mohler speak to the Danbury Institute, a Christian advocacy organization, on Monday, said she appreciated his tone and his tenor.\n\n\"I just disagree with him on this particular issue,\" she said. \"We're pro-life, and I feel like that is another way that we can be pro-life. I believe it is a way that God has given us to have children.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Baptist_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southern Baptist Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_denomination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Christian denomination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Embryo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelicalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Evangelicalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_&_Religious_Liberty_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

Wade -- despite near-certain opposition from Republicans.\n\nThe issue came to the national attention after the Alabama Supreme Court earlier this year ruled that embryos are considered children under state law, prompting providers to halt fertility treatments. The legislature later approved legislation to protect IVF in the state.\n\nAcross the nation, Democrats put the blame on Republicans as the development raised concern about similar moves elsewhere, warning of a new front in the fight over reproductive rights.\n\n\"The anti-abortion movement is not yet finished. Now that Roe is gone, they have set their sights on a new target: in vitro fertilization,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Thursday morning ahead of the vote. \"So today the question before the Senate is very simple: Do we agree that Americans should be free to use IVF if they want to?\"\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, the upper chamber is scheduled to take a procedural vote on the package, called the Right to IVF Act, made up of four bills, some of which have previously been blocked by Senate Republicans. The package, which has almost no chance of being approved, is sponsored by Sens. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, Patty Murray of Washington and Cory Booker of New Jersey, and centers on a right to receive and provide IVF services, while working to make the treatments more affordable.\n\nOne measure would create a statutory right for access to assisted reproductive services like IVF. Duckworth tried to secure passage of the bill in February under unanimous consent, but one Republican senator objected, claiming that it would go too far. The package also includes a measure geared toward expanding access to the fertility treatments for veterans, which was likewise blocked by a Republican senator earlier this year. Other provisions are aimed at lowering costs for Americans by requiring insurance plans to cover IVF.\n\nAnother push related to reproductive rights fell short in the Senate last week, when Democrats tried to advance legislation protecting access to contraception, with most Republicans opposing the measure. The two votes come as part of an effort by Democrats to highlight reproductive rights this month, with an eye toward the November elections, which Republicans have criticized. But Schumer argues that the votes aren't mere messaging votes.\n\n\"Protecting IVF, like protecting contraception, is not a show vote,\" Schumer said at a news conference on Wednesday. \"It's a show-us-who-you-are vote.\"\n\nHowever, Senate Democrats want to put Republicans on the record over the issues related to reproductive rights issues, which has been a driving force at the polls.\n\n\"Every single Republican needs to answer clearly for the record: do you want our laws to protect IVF or do you want laws that say frozen embryos have the same rights as living, breathing human beings?\" Murray said at a news conference on Wednesday. \"You cannot have both.\"\n\nWhen it comes to IVF, although Senate Republicans have expressed support for the fertility treatments in the wake of the Alabama ruling, lawmakers appear to be at odds over a path forward that would satisfy both parties.\n\nLast month, two Senate Republicans, Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Katie Britt of Alabama, introduced legislation to protect access to IVF, urging bipartisan support. But Democrats quickly pushed back on the legislation, questioning its scope and mechanism.\n\nThe GOP bill, called the IVF Protection Act, would require that states \"do not prohibit in vitro fertilization\" as a condition for the states to receive federal funding for Medicaid, which provides health insurance for low-income Americans. The bill doesn't compel an organization or individual to provide IVF services, and it doesn't preclude states from otherwise regulating IVF -- which Democrats generally oppose.\n\nOn Wednesday, Cruz and Britt attempted to approve the legislation under unanimous consent, in order to preempt the Democrat-led vote on Thursday. But Murray blocked the move, calling it a \"PR tool\" and argued that it's \"ridiculous to claim that this bill protects IVF when it does nothing of the sort.\"\n\nMurray and other Democrats have highlighted concerns over granting personhood rights to embryos, since embryos are often discarded during fertility treatments. They've warned that the GOP legislation doesn't address the handling of frozen embryos, which could threaten access to the fertility treatments, while saying it's an intentional move to appeal to the anti-abortion movement.\n\nAll 49 Senate Republicans signed on to a statement released later Wednesday reiterating their support for the fertility treatments, saying they \"strongly support continued nationwide access to IVF.\"\n\nThough the Democrats' IVF package isn't likely to advance, at least one Republican, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, said she intends to vote to advance the IVF package. She told reporters she doesn't want \"the message to be that Republicans are against IVF,\" but she also noted that the move is \"clearly not a serious attempt at legislating.\"\n\nAnd Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, said she's still looking at the components of the package. The two Republicans were the only members of their party to vote in favor of advancing the contraception legislation last week.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reproductive rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assisted reproductive technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammy_Duckworth", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tammy Duckworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Embryo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) introduced the Right to IVF Act last week, combining four of their previously introduced bills into one.\n\nThe legislation would establish a universal right to receive and provide fertility treatments, including IVF; expand access to such treatments for veterans and military members; and require both federal and private health insurance plans to cover IVF services.\n\nMs. Duckworth, a veteran herself, noted at a June 12 press conference that she had her two daughters through IVF.\n\n\"My battle with infertility was one of the most heartbreaking struggles of my life,\" she said, adding that her miscarriage was \"more painful than any wound I earned in Iraq.\"\n\nThe Right to IVF Act, she said, would provide \"real solutions that would help tens of thousands of Americans every year build the families of their dreams.\"\n\nThe move to cement a right to such treatments follows a controversial Alabama Supreme Court ruling earlier this year that embryos created through IVF are legally children under state law.\n\nThe decision came in response to a lawsuit filed over the destruction of three couples' frozen embryos at a hospital that provided them with IVF services.\n\nThe ruling prompted several IVF providers in the state to suspend their services in fear of future litigation.\n\nMost returned to business as usual after state lawmakers passed a law to shield them from liability, but the hospital that was sued has announced that it will suspend all IVF services after this year.\n\nThe aftermath has led some to fear that similar situations could arise in other states, resulting in a lack of access to IVF services.\n\nFor Democrats, who are still reeling over the Supreme Court's 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade and the federal right to abortion, the issue has become a pillar of the party's 2024 platform.\n\n\"Eighty-six percent of Americans support IVF, but in the aftermath of Roe, when after frightening decisions like the one from Alabama, many families fear that this basic service cannot be taken for granted,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said on June 11 on the Senate floor.\n\nSen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) told The Epoch Times that he supports IVF but will not be voting for the Democrats' bill.\n\n\"They don't want to talk about the border, they don't want to talk about Biden, they don't really want to talk about Trump. They want to talk about anything else.\"\n\nThe legislation needs the backing of at least nine Republicans to pass a filibuster.\n\nFor some, the IVF treatment process poses moral and ethical concerns regarding the disposal of embryos that are not used or wanted.\n\n\"The act explicitly waives the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and would subject religious and pro-life organizations to crippling lawsuits,\" Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), chair of the Senate's Pro-life Caucus, said in February when the bill was first introduced.\n\n\"Religious and pro-life organizations could be forced to facilitate procedures that violate their core beliefs, including their health insurance plans.\"\n\nSen.

(Getty Images)\n\nWASHINGTON -- Alabama Republican Sen. Katie Britt's efforts to pass legislation that would block Medicaid funding from going to states that ban in vitro fertilization were unsuccessful Wednesday when Democrats blocked the bill from advancing.\n\nBritt, who introduced the legislation earlier this year alongside Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, said during brief debate the bill would assuage concerns about couples losing access to IVF, though Democrats said the measure fell short of providing real protections.\n\nDebate took place shortly after the Southern Baptist Convention, the United States' largest Protestant religious organization and one with significant influence in conservative politics, voted to condemn IVF.\n\nIt also came one day before the entire U.S. Senate is set to vote on a bill from Democrats that would provide nationwide protections for IVF. That measure also lacks the bipartisan backing needed to advance to final passage.\n\n\"For the millions of Americans who face infertility every year, IVF provides the hope of a pathway to parenthood,\" Britt said on the floor. \"We all have loved ones -- whether they're family members or friends -- who have become parents or grandparents through IVF.\"\n\nBritt said that ensuring access to IVF is \"fundamentally pro-family\" and that the legislation should provide couples with \"certainty and peace of mind that IVF will remain legal and available in every single state.\"\n\nWashington Democratic Sen. Patty Murray said the Britt-Cruz bill would still allow states to \"enact burdensome and unnecessary\" regulations on IVF that could lead to the kind of \"legal uncertainty and risk\" that forced IVF clinics in Alabama to close temporarily earlier this year.\n\n\"Even though it is an inherent part of the IVF process that families will make more embryos than they need,\" Murray said. \"This bill does absolutely nothing -- not a single thing -- to ensure families who use IVF can have their clinics dispose of unused embryos without facing legal threats for a standard medical procedure.\"\n\nMurray said GOP senators were completely ignoring the issue of what happens to frozen embryos and using the bill as a \"PR tool.\"\n\n\"The stone-cold reality is that you cannot protect IVF and champion fetal personhood,\" Murray said.\n\nThe Britt-Cruz legislation would prevent a state from receiving Medicaid funding if it barred access to IVF, though the bill didn't say anything about states that define life as beginning at fertilization.\n\nThe Alabama state Supreme Court ruling earlier this year that frozen embryos constituted children didn't explicitly ban IVF, but all of the state's clinics stopped operating until the legislature provided civil and criminal protections.\n\nCruz sought to pass the bill using the unanimous consent process, where any one senator can ask for approval and any one senator can block that legislation from moving forward. Murray blocked Cruz's request.\n\nUnanimous consent requests don't include a recorded vote.\n\nThe legislation had three additional co-sponsors -- Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, Roger Wicker of Mississippi and Roger Marshall of Kansas.\n\nThe Senate is set to take a procedural vote as soon as Thursday on legislation from Democrats that would bolster protections for IVF, though that bill isn't expected to get the GOP support needed to move forward.\n\nThat bill is more detailed and broader than the Britt-Cruz bill, which has received criticism from Democrats as being insufficient.\n\nNew Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker said Wednesday during a press conference that access to IVF shouldn't be turned into a political issue and called on GOP senators to back the bill.\n\n\"We can't make this seem like a left-right issue. It's absolutely not,\" Booker said. \"This is an issue that's overwhelmingly supported in America by Republican families, Democratic families and independent families. And so trying to make this into some kind of typical political debate in Washington is just wrong.\"\n\nBooker said protecting access to IVF is, instead, \"about protecting fundamental rights, expanding opportunity, taking care of our military families.\"\n\nIllinois Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth, the bill's lead co-sponsor who has been open about using IVF to have her two daughters, threw cool water on working with Republicans on a bipartisan bill when asked about the possibility during the press conference.\n\n\"Well, they're welcome to join ours and make it bipartisan. We've got 47 co-sponsors thus far and it's a very simple piece of legislation,\" Duckworth said. \"I can't see why they wouldn't join it.\n\n\"In contrast, 90% of Republicans have not signed on to Senator Britt's bill,\" Duckworth added.\n\nSenate debate on in vitro fertilization is taking place the same week the Southern Baptist Convention meets in Indiana for its annual convention.\n\nDuring that two-day gathering more than 10,000 Baptists, called messengers, voted on official policies of the SBC, which included objecting to how IVF is practiced now.\n\nThe SBC wrote in its resolution that IVF \"most often engages in the destruction of embryonic human life and increasingly engages in dehumanizing methods for determining suitability for life and genetic sorting, based on notions of genetic fitness and parental preferences.\"\n\nThe resolution on IVF \"resolved\" that members of the SBC should \"only utilize reproductive technologies consistent with that affirmation\" as well as several other affirmations within the document.\n\nThe resolution was titled, \"On the Ethical Realities of Reproductive Technologies and the Dignity of the Human Embryo.\"\n\nKristen Ferguson, from 11th Street Baptist Church in Upland, California, who announced the resolution before the vote, opposed an amendment that would have made several changes to the text.\n\nFerguson said during a brief debate the committee that wrote the resolutions for the SBC to vote on wanted to make sure it addressed IVF \"with the utmost sensitivity.\"\n\nShe added that members of the resolutions committee did \"not take this topic lightly and we want to make sure that we're speaking carefully about it.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The court said frozen embryos are legally considered children and are protected under the state's Wrongful Death of a Minor Act, a ruling that sparked national debate.\n\nDebate on the floor of the convention over the resolution exhibited divisions within the nation's largest Protestant denomination over the issue. The statement is the first of its kind for the SBC but could reverberate across other conservative denominations.\n\n\"This resolution would castigate and condemn the entirely moral and ethical actions of these two friends of mine calling their faithful sacrifice, struggle and blessing a wicked thing,\" Michigan messenger Daniel Taylor said during the floor debate, alluding to friends who used IVF to have children. \"It would also unnecessarily make it more difficult for all of us to reach those who have gone through IVF as parents or children.\"\n\nRole of women: Southern Baptist ban on women pastors fails in historic vote\n\nTaylor proposed an amendment to the resolution to soften certain language. Messengers overwhelmingly voted against the amendment, leading to a vote immediately after to adopt the resolution in its original form.\n\nKentucky messenger Monica Hall spoke against Taylor's amendment, referencing her own experience with embryo adoption. Hall said the embryos were left over by someone else who started the IVF process and that the embryos ultimately didn't reach viability.\n\n\"There is no way to describe the treatment of embryos at any point in the IVF process as ethical or dignified,\" Hall said during the floor debate. \"Nothing in the process of IVF upholds the sanctity of life.\"\n\nThe resolutions committee recommended the full convention adopt the statement after receiving a draft authored by Al Mohler, president of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, and Southern seminary professor Andrew Walker.\n\nTuesday updates SBC live updates: Virginia church ousted over woman pastor\n\nMohler, a leading contemporary evangelical Christian voice in the U.S., has opposed IVF for two decades and has cited what he views as other potentially problematic components, such as how IVF can allow same-sex couples or a single woman to have children.\n\n\"In our churches, we have compromise on this issue,\" said Mohler during an address at a luncheon Monday ahead of the convention's expected vote on the resolution. \"A lot of evangelicals don't want to state the proposition clearly.\"\n\nMany conservatives, even those who oppose abortion, have supported IVF and how it has allowed countless Americans to start families who might otherwise be unable to do so. In the wake of the Alabama court's rulings, many in the GOP voiced their support and state lawmakers approved a legislative fix to protect IVF providers.\n\nAbout 2% of births a year involve IVF, a process by which multiple eggs are harvested, fertilized and implanted to create a pregnancy. The Alabama ruling and the stance by the SBC raise questions about what should happen with unused embryos.\n\nA Pew Research Center report in May said 63% of white evangelical Protestants believe IVF is good and 28% were unsure. The percentages were similar those of Catholics, a religious group that is more well-known for opposing IVF and surrogacy.\n\nThe SBC's resolution contends that IVF \"most often engages in the destruction of embryonic human life and increasingly engages in dehumanizing methods for determining suitability for life.\"\n\nIt calls on Southern Baptists to \"advocate for the government to restrain actions inconsistent with the dignity and value of every human being, which necessarily includes frozen embryonic human beings.\"\n\nThe debate on Wednesday echoed one from two years ago, when the convention fought over Southern Baptists' commitment to pro-life ideals. Opposition conservatives supported an abolitionist anti-abortion stance that supports charging women with crimes for having abortions. Proponents of the abolitionist stance decried Southern Baptists who align with an incrementalist anti-abortion view as insufficiently pro-life.\n\nThe 2022 SBC annual meeting also included an ultimately unsuccessful push to abolish the denomination's public policy arm, the Nashville-based Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission, for rejecting abolitionist proposals.\n\nBut with IVF, the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission drew a line in the sand in a May 24 letter urging Congress to limit access and funding for the medical procedure.\n\nA similar attempt to abolish the public policy arm at this year's SBC annual meeting failed on Wednesday morning.\n\nBackground: Southern Baptists to debate measure opposing IVF following Alabama court ruling", "source": {"uri":

That's the same position held by the Alabama Supreme Court in ruling that frozen embryos have the full rights of people.\n\nIn the wake of that decision, Alabama passed a law shielding IVF providers from prosecution and lawsuits -- reflecting that even in a state with strong anti-abortion sentiment, there is support for a technology used by many couples facing infertility.\n\nThe resolution also urged couples to adopt surplus frozen embryos that would otherwise be destroyed.\n\nDid the resolution condemn IVF or call for its banning?Not in a blanket way. What it did was denounce the routine practice of creating multiple embryos, frozen for potential use but often with surplus embryos destroyed. It also denounced the use of embryos for experiments, as well as \"dehumanizing methods for determining suitability for life and genetic sorting, based on notions of genetic fitness and parental preferences.\"\n\nKristen Ferguson, chair of the committee on resolutions, said after the vote that the resolution amounts to the SBC's first foray into a new ethnical frontier but rooted in their longstanding belief in \"the sanctity of the human embryo.\"\n\nIVF \"is not respecting the sanctity of the human embryo ... in the way it is routinely practiced,\" she said. \"Right now we're trying to open the conversation, remind Southern Baptists of our long-held beliefs of the sanctity of human life and allow them to begin to think through the ethical implications.\"\n\nShe anticipated there may be resolutions with \"much stronger language\" and more specific applications in the future, such as how these issues relate to the medical community, she said.\n\n\"But we are not speaking to that at this time, because Southern Baptists aren't ready to speak to that yet,\" she said. \"They wanted to say an affirmation of the human embryo and that it has implications for IVF. \"\n\nWhat is IVF?In vitro fertilization offers a possible solution when a woman has trouble getting pregnant. The procedure involves retrieving her eggs and combining them in a lab dish with a man's sperm to create a fertilized embryo, which is then transferred into the woman's uterus in an attempt to create a pregnancy.\n\nIVF is done in cycles and may take more than one to create a successful pregnancy, according to The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The procedure can use a couple's eggs and sperm or those from a donor.\n\nWhy is this an important issue for Southern Baptists?Ever since the nation's largest Protestant body took a conservative turn in the 1980s, it has made opposing abortion a top priority. With the overturning of the Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion, new issues have reached the forefront, including IVF.\n\nThis resolution makes clear that Southern Baptists' belief that life begins at conception extends to embryos generated via IVF.\n\nDo Southern Baptists and other conservative evangelicals have consensus on IVF?No. On the convention floor, some delegates gave impassioned testimony to how IVF enabled couples to have long-sought children. Others said that despite that laudable goal, the practice is ethically unacceptable.\n\nSome believe it's ethical to use IVF to create only the number of embryos intended for implantation.\n\nAlbert Mohler, a prominent SBC seminary president and conservative activist, made a hardline denunciation of IVF at a sideline event before the SBC meeting on Monday, calling IVF a \"commodification of the embryo\" that assaults human dignity. He also criticized it for enabling people to have children outside of heterosexual marriage.\n\nDid the resolution call for a government ban on IVF?No. It calls for government to \"restrain actions inconsistent with the dignity of ... frozen embryonic human beings.\" But it doesn't prescribe specific measures.\n\n\"I think especially after the Alabama Supreme Court decision, there's been a rush at state level as well as federal level to protect IVF or to even expand IVF access, often with very little thought to some of the other realities at stake,\" said Jason Thacker, a Southern Baptist ethicist who advised the resolutions committee.\n\n\"We're not naive enough to say that we can just ban this technology, full stop,\" he said. \"While that would be the goal, because that's consistent with dignity of the human embryo in many ways,\" he said he recognized that there are others who believe there are ethical ways to apply IVF technology.\n\nWhat's essential, he said, is laws that respect embryos' human dignity.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP's collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)\n\nWASHINGTON -- Alabama Republican Sen. Katie Britt's efforts to pass legislation that would block Medicaid funding from going to states that ban in vitro fertilization were unsuccessful Wednesday when Democrats blocked the bill from advancing.\n\nBritt, who introduced the legislation earlier this year alongside Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, said during brief debate the bill would assuage concerns about couples losing access to IVF, though Democrats said the measure fell short of providing real protections.\n\nDebate took place shortly after the Southern Baptist Convention, the United States' largest Protestant religious organization and one with significant influence in conservative politics, voted to condemn IVF.\n\nIt also came one day before the entire U.S. Senate is set to vote on a bill from Democrats that would provide nationwide protections for IVF. That measure also lacks the bipartisan backing needed to advance to final passage.\n\n\"For the millions of Americans who face infertility every year, IVF provides the hope of a pathway to parenthood,\" Britt said on the floor. \"We all have loved ones -- whether they're family members or friends -- who have become parents or grandparents through IVF.\"\n\nBritt said that ensuring access to IVF is \"fundamentally pro-family\" and that the legislation should provide couples with \"certainty and peace of mind that IVF will remain legal and available in every single state.\"\n\nWashington Democratic Sen. Patty Murray said the Britt-Cruz bill would still allow states to \"enact burdensome and unnecessary\" regulations on IVF that could lead to the kind of \"legal uncertainty and risk\" that forced IVF clinics in Alabama to close temporarily earlier this year.\n\n\"Even though it is an inherent part of the IVF process that families will make more embryos than they need,\" Murray said. \"This bill does absolutely nothing -- not a single thing -- to ensure families who use IVF can have their clinics dispose of unused embryos without facing legal threats for a standard medical procedure.\"\n\nMurray said GOP senators were completely ignoring the issue of what happens to frozen embryos and using the bill as a \"PR tool.\"\n\n\"The stone-cold reality is that you cannot protect IVF and champion fetal personhood,\" Murray said.\n\nState access\n\nThe Britt-Cruz legislation would prevent a state from receiving Medicaid funding if it barred access to IVF, though the bill didn't say anything about states that define life as beginning at fertilization.\n\nThe Alabama state Supreme Court ruling earlier this year that frozen embryos constituted children didn't explicitly ban IVF, but all of the state's clinics stopped operating until the legislature provided civil and criminal protections.\n\nCruz sought to pass the bill using the unanimous consent process, where any one senator can ask for approval and any one senator can block that legislation from moving forward. Murray blocked Cruz's request.\n\nUnanimous consent requests don't include a recorded vote.\n\nThe legislation had three additional co-sponsors -- Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, Roger Wicker of Mississippi and Roger Marshall of Kansas.\n\nDemocrat bill\n\nThe Senate is set to take a procedural vote as soon as Thursday on legislation from Democrats that would bolster protections for IVF, though that bill isn't expected to get the GOP support needed to move forward.\n\nThat bill is more detailed and broader than the Britt-Cruz bill, which has received criticism from Democrats as being insufficient.\n\nNew Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker said Wednesday during a press conference that access to IVF shouldn't be turned into a political issue and called on GOP senators to back the bill.\n\n\"We can't make this seem like a left-right issue. It's absolutely not,\" Booker said. \"This is an issue that's overwhelmingly supported in America by Republican families, Democratic families and independent families. And so trying to make this into some kind of typical political debate in Washington is just wrong.\"\n\nBooker said protecting access to IVF is, instead, \"about protecting fundamental rights, expanding opportunity, taking care of our military families.\"\n\nIllinois Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth, the bill's lead co-sponsor who has been open about using IVF to have her two daughters, threw cool water on working with Republicans on a bipartisan bill when asked about the possibility during the press conference.\n\n\"Well, they're welcome to join ours and make it bipartisan. We've got 47 co-sponsors thus far and it's a very simple piece of legislation,\" Duckworth said. \"I can't see why they wouldn't join it.\n\n\"In contrast, 90% of Republicans have not signed on to Senator Britt's bill,\" Duckworth added.\n\nSouthern Baptists' resolution\n\nSenate debate on in vitro fertilization is taking place the same week the Southern Baptist Convention meets in Indiana for its annual convention.\n\nDuring that two-day gathering more than 10,000 Baptists, called messengers, voted on official policies of the SBC, which included objecting to how IVF is practiced now.\n\nThe SBC wrote in its resolution that IVF \"most often engages in the destruction of embryonic human life and increasingly engages in dehumanizing methods for determining suitability for life and genetic sorting, based on notions of genetic fitness and parental preferences.\"\n\nThe resolution on IVF \"resolved\" that members of the SBC should \"only utilize reproductive technologies consistent with that affirmation\" as well as several other affirmations within the document.\n\nThe resolution was titled, \"On the Ethical Realities of Reproductive Technologies and the Dignity of the Human Embryo.\"\n\nKristen Ferguson, from 11th Street Baptist Church in Upland, California, who announced the resolution before the vote, opposed an amendment that would have made several changes to the text.\n\nFerguson said during a brief debate the committee that wrote the resolutions for the SBC to vote on wanted to make sure it addressed IVF \"with the utmost sensitivity.\"\n\nShe added

They know that is at total odds with IVF -- and they don't care! They just want the American people to forget that inconvenient truth until after November -- and we're not going to let them.\"\n\n***WATCH: Livestream of the Press Conference***\n\nWashington, DC- Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), a senior member and former Chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, spoke at a press conference ahead of the Senate vote this week on the Right to IVF Act, legislation Murray introduced with Senators Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) and Cory Booker (D-NJ) that would establish a nationwide right to IVF and other assisted reproductive technology, expand insurance coverage of IVF services to lower the cost of IVF treatment for families, and expand access to IVF and other fertility services for our nation's veterans and servicemembers. Murray was joined at the press conference by Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY); Senators Duckworth and Booker; Jamie Heard, an IVF patient from Alabama whose IVF treatment was interrupted by the Alabama Supreme Court decision; Julie Eshelman, a military spouse whose daughter was conceived through IVF and who has faced family-building challenges due to military service and high out-of-pocket costs for treatment; Dr. Amanda Adeleye, an IVF doctor from Illinois; and Luisa Lopez, a New York resident who recently gave birth to a baby conceived through IVF and who faced financial hardships due to the extremely high out-pocket-costs of IVF treatment. Video of the press conference is available HERE.\n\n\"We already saw the chaos and heartbreak caused when the Alabama Supreme Court upended IVF access. Women who were days away from appointments they had waited months for, and spent thousands of dollars on, had their treatment canceled and their dreams of motherhood thrown into uncertainty,\" said Senator Murray. \"This already happened! It was national news. It was complete chaos. So, Republican efforts to dismiss this vote as fearmongering are simply not going to fly. Today, the threat is not gone -- because the Life at Conception Act -- supported by a majority of House Republicans -- would make fetal personhood the law of the land, and take the crisis we saw in Alabama nationwide.\"\n\n\"Tomorrow, we are going to hold a Senate vote on the Right to IVF Act -- for all the American public to see. Every Senator will be put on the record as to whether they are serious about supporting IVF, serious about preventing more chaos like we saw in Alabama, and serious about standing with the one in seven women who need to turn to care like IVF to grow their families,\" Murray continued. \"Don't let Republicans fool you -- their top political leaders, including the Speaker of the House, continue to support legislation that would give an embryo the exact same rights as a living, breathing human being. They know that is at total odds with IVF -- and they don't care! They just want the American people to forget that inconvenient truth until after November -- and we're not going to let them. Senate Democrats will protect your right to IVF -- and we will protect all reproductive health care for women in this country.\"\n\nBuilding on the lawmakers' previous efforts to protect and strengthen access to IVF, the Right to IVF Act is a pro-family, pro-freedom legislative package that includes:\n\nA summary of the bill can be found HERE.\n\nSenator Murray's full remarks, as delivered at the press conference, are below:\n\n\"We saw last week that despite the fact that there are Republican bills right now that would jeopardize birth control, Republicans were unwilling to vote to protect contraception.\n\n\"This week -- we are going to see where they stand on IVF. As each of us has made clear -- the threat to IVF is not hypothetical!\n\n\"We already saw the chaos and heartbreak caused when the Alabama Supreme Court upended IVF access.\n\n\"Women who were days away from appointments they had waited months for, and spent thousands of dollars on, had their treatment canceled and their dreams of motherhood thrown into uncertainty.\n\n\"This already happened! It was national news. It was complete chaos. So Republican efforts to dismiss this vote as fearmongering are simply not going to fly.\n\n\"Today, the threat is not gone -- because the Life at Conception Act -- supported by a majority of House Republicans -- would make 'fetal personhood' the law of the land, and take the crisis that we saw in Alabama nationwide!\n\n\"Meanwhile, Republicans' bill to allegedly 'protect' IVF wouldn't do anything to stop these attacks, in fact it explicitly allows states to enact restrictions and burdensome requirements that would force IVF clinics to close their doors.\n\n\"That bill is nothing but a PR stunt -- providing cover for Republicans to keep somehow pretending they are not trying to control women's bodies.\n\n\"Now, the good news is, if Republicans really -- truly and honestly -- want to protect IVF in a meaningful way, Democrats have a bill to do just that!\n\n\"The Right to IVF Act protects the right to IVF, and lowers IVF costs for families -- including our servicemembers and veterans, who should never have to sacrifice their ability to start their families.\n\n\"Tomorrow, we are going to hold a Senate vote on the Right to IVF Act -- for all the American public to see.\n\n\"Every Senator will be put on the record as to whether they are serious about supporting IVF, serious about preventing more chaos like we saw in Alabama, and serious about standing with the one in seven women who need to turn to care like IVF to grow their families.\n\n\"So don't let Republicans fool you -- their top political leaders, including the Speaker of the House, continue to

A little more than 10 days away from the second-anniversary of the Supreme Court's disastrous Dobbs decision that put IVF at risk, Senate Democrats pushed to pass this pro-family, pro-freedom legislative package that would both establish a right to IVF and other assisted reproductive technology (ART), expand access for hopeful parents, Veterans and federal employees as well as lower the costs of IVF treatment for middle class families.\n\n\"I am profoundly disappointed that Senate Republicans have voted today to deny countless families the opportunity and the right to make their own deeply personal decisions about starting a family,\" said Senator Booker. \"I will never stop fighting for the fundamental freedoms of all Americans, and I will continue to advocate for comprehensive reproductive health care that is affordable and accessible to everyone in this country. No family should have to endure hardship to realize their dream of having children. This fight is far from over.\"\n\n\"As very real threats against IVF continue to grow, Republicans today had yet another chance to prove their so-called 'support for IVF' by helping us pass our legislation that would protect IVF access and lower fertility care costs nationwide -- and nearly every single Republican voted against it,\" said Senator Duckworth. \"Despite literally campaigning on the fact that they support IVF, this marks the third time Republicans have blocked legislation I've led to protect IVF -- making it clear that the only thing Republicans do care about is misleading voters and bowing down to the most extreme wing of their party. Today, Republicans once again turned their backs on families, Veterans and the majority of Americans who support access to IVF. And we won't forget it.\"\n\n\"Republicans just voted against IVF for all the world to see, on the record. So let's put to rest, once and for all, the idea Republicans actually care about protecting IVF access. And while we are at it -- let's put to rest this utter fiction that their bill does anything to support IVF. The issue with Republicans' bill isn't that it doesn't do enough to protect IVF, it is that their bill does nothing to meaningfully protect IVF from the very real threats from lawmakers and anti-abortion extremists in their party all over this country. Their bill would allow states to regulate IVF out of existence!\" said Senator Murray. \"Republicans will keep trying to cry 'fearmonger' but it's hard to hide a fire when everyone can see the flames. We saw what happened in Alabama, the chaos that caused. We saw what happened yesterday in Indianapolis, a prominent conservative group voting to fully, explicitly oppose IVF -- and we saw how Republicans voted today. Everyone in America knows the threat to IVF is real, and it is not going away just because it's inconvenient for Republicans. And Democrats are not going away either -- we are going to keep fighting to protect IVF, make sure everyone can access this medical care, and make sure no politician can stand in the way.\"\n\nYesterday, Booker, Duckworth, and Murray joined IVF patients, providers and advocates in coordination with RESOLVE and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) for a press conference to underscore the urgent need to pass the Right to IVF Act as Republicans continue their anti-choice, anti-science crusade.\n\nBuilding on the lawmakers' previous efforts to protect and strengthen access to IVF, the Right to IVF Act includes updated and enhanced versions of:\n\nSenator Booker's Access to Infertility Treatment and Care Act, which would increase affordability of fertility care -- including IVF -- by requiring employer-sponsored insurance plans and other public insurance plans to cover fertility treatments.

That's the same position held by the Alabama Supreme Court in ruling that frozen embryos have the full rights of people.\n\nIn the wake of that decision, Alabama passed a law shielding IVF providers from prosecution and lawsuits - reflecting that even in a state with strong anti-abortion sentiment, there is support for a technology used by many couples facing infertility.\n\nThe resolution also urged couples to adopt surplus frozen embryos that would otherwise be destroyed.\n\nNot in a blanket way. What it did was denounce the routine practice of creating multiple embryos, frozen for potential use but often with surplus embryos destroyed. It also denounced the use of embryos for experiments, as well as \"dehumanizing methods for determining suitability for life and genetic sorting, based on notions of genetic fitness and parental preferences.\"\n\nMessengers raise their ballots in support of a motion put up for vote during a Southern Baptist Convention annual meeting Tuesday, June 11, 2024, in Indianapolis. (AP Photo/Doug McSchooler)\n\nKristen Ferguson, chair of the committee on resolutions, said after the vote that the resolution amounts to the SBC\u00b4s first foray into a new ethnical frontier but rooted in their longstanding belief in \"the sanctity of the human embryo.\"\n\nIVF \"is not respecting the sanctity of the human embryo ... in the way it is routinely practiced,\" she said. \"Right now we\u00b4re trying to open the conversation, remind Southern Baptists of our long-held beliefs of the sanctity of human life and allow them to begin to think through the ethical implications.\"\n\nShe anticipated there may be resolutions with \"much stronger language\" and more specific applications in the future, such as how these issues relate to the medical community, she said.\n\n\"But we are not speaking to that at this time, because Southern Baptists aren\u00b4t ready to speak to that yet,\" she said. \"They wanted to say an affirmation of the human embryo and that it has implications for IVF. \"\n\nIn vitro fertilization offers a possible solution when a woman has trouble getting pregnant. The procedure involves retrieving her eggs and combining them in a lab dish with a man\u00b4s sperm to create a fertilized embryo, which is then transferred into the woman\u00b4s uterus in an attempt to create a pregnancy.\n\nIVF is done in cycles and may take more than one to create a successful pregnancy, according to The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The procedure can use a couple\u00b4s eggs and sperm or those from a donor.\n\nEver since the nation's largest Protestant body took a conservative turn in the 1980s, it has made opposing abortion a top priority. With the overturning of the Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion, new issues have reached the forefront, including IVF.\n\nThis resolution makes clear that Southern Baptists' belief that life begins at conception extends to embryos generated via IVF.\n\nNo. On the convention floor, some delegates gave impassioned testimony to how IVF enabled couples to have long-sought children. Others said that despite that laudable goal, the practice is ethically unacceptable.\n\nSome believe it's ethical to use IVF to create only the number of embryos intended for implantation.\n\nAlbert Mohler, a prominent SBC seminary president and conservative activist, made a hardline denunciation of IVF at a sideline event before the SBC meeting on Monday, calling IVF a \"commodification of the embryo\" that assaults human dignity. He also criticized it for enabling people to have children outside of heterosexual marriage.\n\nNo. It calls for government to \"restrain actions inconsistent with the dignity of ... frozen embryonic human beings.\" But it doesn't prescribe specific measures.\n\n\"I think especially after the Alabama Supreme Court decision, there\u00b4s been a rush at state level as well as federal level to protect IVF or to even expand IVF access, often with very little thought to some of the other realities at stake,\" said Jason Thacker, a Southern Baptist ethicist who advised the resolutions committee.\n\n\"We\u00b4re not naive enough to say that we can just ban this technology, full stop,\" he said. \"While that would be the goal, because that\u00b4s consistent with dignity of the human embryo in many ways,\" he said he recognized that there are others who believe there are ethical ways to apply IVF technology.\n\nWhat\u00b4s essential, he said, is laws that respect embryos\u00b4 human dignity.\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP\u00b4s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

It needed 60 votes to advance. Republicans criticized the Democrat-led legislation as unnecessary overreach and a political show vote.\n\n\"Why should we vote for a bill that fixes a non-existent problem? There's not a problem. There's no restrictions on IVF, nor should there be,\" Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, told reporters.\n\nThe vote is part of a broader push by Senate Democrats to draw a contrast with Republicans over reproductive health care in the run up to the November elections. Democrats are highlighting the issue this month, which marks the two-year anniversary of the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\n\"Today, women and families across America are worried about more than Roe's demise. They're worried about what comes next, including the erosion of reproductive freedoms nobody thought were at risk. This includes access to services like IVF,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said earlier this week in remarks on the Senate floor.\n\nThe procedural vote is likely to fail due to GOP opposition. Republicans have criticized the Democrat-led legislation as unnecessary overreach and a political show vote.\n\nThe legislation the Senate will take up - the Right to IVF Act - would enshrine into federal law a right for individuals to receive IVF treatment as well as for doctors to provide treatment, which would override any attempt at the state level to restrict access.\n\nThe bill seeks to make IVF treatment more affordable by mandating coverage for fertility treatments under employer-sponsored insurance and certain public insurance plans. It would also expand coverage of fertility treatments, including IVF, under US military service members and veterans' health care.\n\nThe IVF legislative package was introduced by Democratic Sens. Patty Murray of Washington state, Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and Cory Booker of New Jersey.\n\nThe vote comes after Alabama's Supreme Court said, in a first-of-its-kind ruling earlier this year, that frozen embryos are children and those who destroy them can be held liable for wrongful death - a decision that reproductive rights advocates warned could have a chilling effect on infertility treatments.\n\nWhile the state's legislature took action aimed at protecting IVF in the wake of the ruling, Democrats argue that this is only one example of how access to reproductive health care is under threat across the nation.\n\nSouthern Baptist delegates, for instance, expressed alarm Wednesday over the way in vitro fertilization is routinely being practiced, approving a resolution lamenting that the creation of surplus frozen embryos often results in \"destruction of embryonic human life.\"\n\nThe IVF vote is the latest move by Democrats to bring up a bill expected to be blocked by Republicans. Last week, Senate Republicans voted to block a Democrat-led bill that would guarantee access to contraception.\n\nMost Republicans dismissed the effort as a political messaging vote that was unnecessary and overly broad, though GOP Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine crossed over to vote with Democrats in favor of advancing the bill.\n\nRepublicans have introduced their own bills on IVF and contraception. GOP Sens. Katie Britt of Alabama and Ted Cruz of Texas have introduced a bill called the IVF Protection Act and Republican Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa has put forward a separate bill to promote access to contraception.\n\nCruz and Britt attempted to pass their IVF legislation on the Senate floor Wednesday through a unanimous consent request, but Democrats blocked the effort.\n\nMurray, who objected to the request, criticized the GOP bill, arguing that states could \"enact burdensome and unnecessary requirements and create the kind of legal uncertainty and risk that would force clinics to once again close their doors.\"\n\nUnder the IVF bill from Britt and Cruz, states would not be eligible for Medicaid funding if they prohibit access to IVF, but the legislation \"permits states to implement health and safety standards regarding the practice of IVF,\" according to a press release.\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments.\n\nCNN's Morgan Rimmer contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

That's the same position held by the Alabama Supreme Court in ruling that frozen embryos have the full rights of people.\n\nIn the wake of that decision, Alabama passed a law shielding IVF providers from prosecution and lawsuits -- reflecting that even in a state with strong anti-abortion sentiment, there is support for a technology used by many couples facing infertility.\n\nThe resolution also urged couples to adopt surplus frozen embryos that would otherwise be destroyed.\n\nNot in a blanket way. What it did was denounce the routine practice of creating multiple embryos, frozen for potential use but often with surplus embryos destroyed. It also denounced the use of embryos for experiments, as well as \"dehumanizing methods for determining suitability for life and genetic sorting, based on notions of genetic fitness and parental preferences.\"\n\nKristen Ferguson, chair of the committee on resolutions, said after the vote that the resolution amounts to the SBC's first foray into a new ethnical frontier but rooted in their longstanding belief in \"the sanctity of the human embryo.\"\n\nIVF \"is not respecting the sanctity of the human embryo ... in the way it is routinely practiced,\" she said. \"Right now we're trying to open the conversation, remind Southern Baptists of our long-held beliefs of the sanctity of human life and allow them to begin to think through the ethical implications.\"\n\nShe anticipated there may be resolutions with \"much stronger language\" and more specific applications in the future, such as how these issues relate to the medical community, she said.\n\n\"But we are not speaking to that at this time, because Southern Baptists aren't ready to speak to that yet,\" she said. \"They wanted to say an affirmation of the human embryo and that it has implications for IVF. \"\n\nEver since the nation's largest Protestant body took a conservative turn in the 1980s, it has made opposing abortion a top priority. With the overturning of the Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion, new issues have reached the forefront, including IVF.\n\nThis resolution makes clear that Southern Baptists' belief that life begins at conception extends to embryos generated via IVF.\n\nNo. On the convention floor, some delegates gave impassioned testimony to how IVF enabled couples to have long-sought children. Others said that despite that laudable goal, the practice is ethically unacceptable.\n\nSome believe it's ethical to use IVF to create only the number of embryos intended for implantation.\n\nAlbert Mohler, a prominent SBC seminary president and conservative activist, made a hardline denunciation of IVF at a sideline event before the SBC meeting on Monday, calling IVF a \"commodification of the embryo\" that assaults human dignity. He also criticized it for enabling people to have children outside of heterosexual marriage.\n\nNo. It calls for government to \"restrain actions inconsistent with the dignity of ... frozen embryonic human beings.\" But it doesn't prescribe specific measures.\n\n\"I think especially after the Alabama Supreme Court decision, there's been a rush at state level as well as federal level to protect IVF or to even expand IVF access, often with very little thought to some of the other realities at stake,\" said Jason Thacker, a Southern Baptist ethicist who advised the resolutions committee.\n\n\"We're not naive enough to say that we can just ban this technology, full stop,\" he said. \"While that would be the goal, because that's consistent with dignity of the human embryo in many ways,\" he said he recognized that there are others who believe there are ethical ways to apply IVF technology.\n\nWhat's essential, he said, is laws that respect embryos' human dignity.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP's collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Also pictured are supporters of Senate Democrats' IVF access bill as well as New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker and Illinois Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth. (Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)\n\nWASHINGTON -- Alabama Republican Sen. Katie Britt's efforts to pass legislation that would block Medicaid funding from going to states that ban in vitro fertilization were unsuccessful Wednesday when Democrats blocked the bill from advancing.\n\nBritt, who introduced the legislation earlier this year alongside Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, said during brief debate the bill would assuage concerns about couples losing access to IVF, though Democrats said the measure fell short of providing real protections.\n\nDebate took place shortly after the Southern Baptist Convention, the United States' largest Protestant religious organization and one with significant influence in conservative politics, voted to condemn IVF.\n\nIt also came one day before the entire U.S. Senate is set to vote on a bill from Democrats that would provide nationwide protections for IVF. That measure also lacks the bipartisan backing needed to advance to final passage.\n\n\"For the millions of Americans who face infertility every year, IVF provides the hope of a pathway to parenthood,\" Britt said on the floor. \"We all have loved ones -- whether they're family members or friends -- who have become parents or grandparents through IVF.\"\n\nBritt said that ensuring access to IVF is \"fundamentally pro-family\" and that the legislation should provide couples with \"certainty and peace of mind that IVF will remain legal and available in every single state.\"\n\nThis is an issue that's overwhelmingly supported in America by Republican families, Democratic families and independent families.\n\n- Sen. Cory Booker\n\nWashington Democratic Sen. Patty Murray said the Britt-Cruz bill would still allow states to \"enact burdensome and unnecessary\" regulations on IVF that could lead to the kind of \"legal uncertainty and risk\" that forced IVF clinics in Alabama to close temporarily earlier this year.\n\n\"Even though it is an inherent part of the IVF process that families will make more embryos than they need,\" Murray said. \"This bill does absolutely nothing -- not a single thing -- to ensure families who use IVF can have their clinics dispose of unused embryos without facing legal threats for a standard medical procedure.\"\n\nMurray said GOP senators were completely ignoring the issue of what happens to frozen embryos and using the bill as a \"PR tool.\"\n\n\"The stone-cold reality is that you cannot protect IVF and champion fetal personhood,\" Murray said.\n\nThe Britt-Cruz legislation would prevent a state from receiving Medicaid funding if it barred access to IVF, though the bill didn't say anything about states that define life as beginning at fertilization.\n\nThe Alabama state Supreme Court ruling earlier this year that frozen embryos constituted children didn't explicitly ban IVF, but all of the state's clinics stopped operating until the legislature provided civil and criminal protections.\n\nCruz sought to pass the bill using the unanimous consent process, where any one senator can ask for approval and any one senator can block that legislation from moving forward. Murray blocked Cruz's request.\n\nUnanimous consent requests don't include a recorded vote.\n\nThe legislation had three additional co-sponsors -- Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, Roger Wicker of Mississippi and Roger Marshall of Kansas.\n\nThe Senate is set to take a procedural vote as soon as Thursday on legislation from Democrats that would bolster protections for IVF, though that bill isn't expected to get the GOP support needed to move forward.\n\nThat bill is more detailed and broader than the Britt-Cruz bill, which has received criticism from Democrats as being insufficient.\n\nNew Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker said Wednesday during a press conference that access to IVF shouldn't be turned into a political issue and called on GOP senators to back the bill.\n\n\"We can't make this seem like a left-right issue. It's absolutely not,\" Booker said. \"This is an issue that's overwhelmingly supported in America by Republican families, Democratic families and independent families. And so trying to make this into some kind of typical political debate in Washington is just wrong.\"\n\nBooker said protecting access to IVF is, instead, \"about protecting fundamental rights, expanding opportunity, taking care of our military families.\"\n\nIllinois Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth, the bill's lead co-sponsor who has been open about using IVF to have her two daughters, threw cool water on working with Republicans on a bipartisan bill when asked about the possibility during the press conference.\n\n\"Well, they're welcome to join ours and make it bipartisan. We've got 47 co-sponsors thus far and it's a very simple piece of legislation,\" Duckworth said. \"I can't see why they wouldn't join it.\n\n\"In contrast, 90% of Republicans have not signed on to Senator Britt's bill,\" Duckworth added.\n\nSenate debate on in vitro fertilization is taking place the same week the Southern Baptist Convention meets in Indiana for its annual convention.\n\nDuring that two-day gathering more than 10,000 Baptists, called messengers, voted on official policies of the SBC, which included objecting to how IVF is practiced now.\n\nThe SBC wrote in its resolution that IVF \"most often engages in the destruction of embryonic human life and increasingly engages in dehumanizing methods for determining suitability for life and genetic sorting, based on notions of genetic fitness and parental preferences.\"\n\nThe resolution on IVF \"resolved\" that members of the SBC should \"only utilize reproductive technologies consistent with that affirmation\" as well as several other affirmations within the document.\n\nThe resolution was titled, \"On the Ethical Realities of Reproductive Technologies and the Dignity of the Human Embryo.\"\n\nKristen Ferguson, from 11th Street Baptist Church in Upland, California, who announced the resolution before the vote, opposed an amendment that would have made several changes to the text.\n\nFerguson said during a brief debate the committee that wrote the resolutions for the SBC to vote on wanted to make sure it addressed IVF \"with the utmost sensitivity.\"\n\nShe added that members of the resolutions committee did \"not take this topic lightly and we want to make sure that we're speaking carefully about it.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Tammy Duckworth, a military veteran who has used the fertility treatment to have her two children, has championed the bill, called the Right to IVF Act. The bill would also expand access through insurance as well as for military members and veterans.\n\n\"These are real solutions that would help tens of thousands of Americans every year build the families of their dreams,\" Duckworth, D-Ill., said this week.\n\nBut most Republicans were expected to vote against advancing the measure, instead offering their own, alternative legislation that would discourage states from enacting outright bans on the treatment. Democrats in turn blocked it Wednesday.\n\nThe overtly political back-and-forth, with no attempt at finding a legislative compromise, showed how quickly Congress has shifted into a campaign mindset five months out from the fall election.\n\nAs Schumer seeks to protect a narrow Senate majority and buoy Democrats' hopes of holding the White House, he has sought to spotlight Republican intransigence to federal legislation that would guarantee women's rights to reproductive care. Democrats have campaigned heavily on the issue ever since the 2022 Supreme Court decision that ended a federal right to abortion.\n\nSchumer, a New York Democrat, also held a vote last week on legislation to protect access to contraception, but Republicans blocked it, arguing it was nothing more than a political stunt. Republicans have also blocked previous attempts to quickly pass IVF protections. They stressed that they support IVF and said Schumer was once again playing to the campaign trail with Thursday's vote.\n\n\"Despite some claims from my colleagues on the other side, protecting IVF is not a show vote at all. It's a show-us-who-you-are vote,\" Schumer said. \"This will be a chance for senators on both sides to show their support for strengthening treatments for people who start families.\"\n\nDemocrats say it is necessary for Congress to protect access to the fertility treatment after the Supreme Court in 2022 allowed states to ban abortions and the Alabama Supreme Court in February ruled that frozen embryos can be considered children under state law. Several clinics in the state suspended IVF treatments until the state enacted a law to provide legal protections for IVF clinics.\n\nSenate Democrats said it showed how all types of reproductive care could be upended in many parts of the country after Roe v. Wade was overturned.\n\nMost Republicans in Congress, meanwhile, have expressed support for IVF, but have also largely declined to tell states how to regulate reproductive care. Instead, two Republicans, Sens. Katie Britt of Alabama and Ted Cruz of Texas have sought to quickly pass a bill that would threaten to withhold Medicaid funding for states where IVF is banned. Democrats blocked that bill on Wednesday.\n\nCruz, who is running for reelection in Texas, said it showed Democrats were making a \"cynical political decision.\"\n\n\"They don't want to provide reassurance and comfort to millions of parents in America because instead, they want to spend millions of dollars running campaign ads suggesting the big, bad Republicans want to take away IVF,\" he said in a speech on the Senate floor.\n\nDemocrats argued that the GOP bill was insufficient because it would still allow states to enact laws that grant embryos or fetuses the same rights as a person. Abortion opponents in over a dozen states have advanced legislation based on the concept of fetal rights.\n\nSen. Patty Murray, the Washington Democrat who objected to quickly passing the GOP bill, dismissed it as \"nothing but a PR stunt.\"\n\nBut Republicans also criticized the Democratic bill. Britt said it \"extends far past IVF. It also treads on religious freedom and protection.\"\n\nIn the wake of the Alabama Supreme Court ruling, Christians, who have been a driving force in the anti-abortion movement based on the belief life begins at or around conception, have wrestled with the fertility treatment. The Southern Baptist Convention this week approved a nonbinding resolution that cautioned couples about using IVF.\n\nWith the Senate deadlocked on the issue, advocates for access to the treatment said families would be left in uncertainty.\n\nJamie Heard, who lives in Birmingham and had to suspend her effort to have a second child using IVF when the state Supreme Court made its decision, said the ruling left her both scared and angry. She has been able to continue the treatment, yet spoke alongside other IVF advocates at the Capitol Wednesday to urge lawmakers to act.\n\n\"There are still a lot of questions that we have about how to move forward,\" Heard said.", "source": {"uri": "sandiegouniontribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Diego Union-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stephen_groves@sandiegouniontribune.com", "name": "Stephen Groves", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "migration_temp@sandiegouniontribune.com", "name": "Migration Temp", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assisted reproductive technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammy_Duckworth", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tammy Duckworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veteran", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Veteran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Alabama", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of Alabama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Women's rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Embryo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Birth control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Cruz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ted Cruz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Britt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Katie Britt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

The fertilized eggs, or embryos, are then cultured before being implanted into the woman's uterus.\n\nIVF treatment became a heated political topic after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 ruling federally guaranteeing abortion access, in June 2022. In February, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos used in IVF must legally be treated as children under state law, but the decision was later reversed by the state Legislature.\n\nRepublican senators criticized the Democrats' Right to IVF Act, which needed 60 votes to pass, as overreaching in its aim. Instead, they had submitted their own legislation, which Democrats said didn't go far enough and blocked on Wednesday.\n\nOn Thursday, Murkowski explained her vote in a post to X, formerly Twitter.\n\n\"In vitro fertilization is a crucial part of reproductive health, allowing couples with fertility challenges to grow their families. Today I voted to move to consider 'The Right to IVF Act,' legislation that would establish in federal statute the right for an individual to access IVF treatment, which has been called into question at the state level,\" she said.\n\n\"I have significant reservations about the bill's overly broad mandates for insurers to pay for treatment costs -- but I want to be clear on my support for a family's right to access IVF. I hope that we can work toward a bipartisan solution to protect access to IVF.\"\n\n\"Once again, Senate Republicans refused to protect access to fertility treatments for women who are desperately trying to get pregnant,\" Biden said. \"And just last week, Senate Republicans blocked nationwide protections for birth control. The disregard for a woman's right to make these decisions for herself and her family is outrageous and unacceptable.\"\n\nRepublican Senator John Cornyn of Texas explained to reporters after the vote why he didn't support the legislation.\n\n\"Why should we vote for a bill that fixes a non-existent problem?

Democrats are highlighting the issue this month, which marks the two-year anniversary of the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v.

They're worried about what comes next, including the erosion of reproductive freedoms nobody thought were at risk.

John Cornyn of Texas, told reporters.\n\nThe legislation the Senate will take up - the Right to IVF Act - would enshrine into federal law a right for individuals to receive IVF treatment as well as for doctors to provide treatment, which would override any attempt at the state level to restrict access.\n\nThe bill seeks to make IVF treatment more affordable by mandating coverage for fertility treatments under employer-sponsored insurance and certain public insurance plans. It would also expand coverage of fertility treatments, including IVF, under US military service members and veterans' health care.\n\nThe IVF legislative package was introduced by Democratic Sens.

Last week, Senate Republicans voted to block a Democrat-led bill that would guarantee access to contraception.\n\nMost Republicans dismissed the effort as a political messaging vote that was unnecessary and overly broad, though GOP Sens.

Also pictured are supporters of Senate Democrats' IVF access bill as well as New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker and Illinois Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth. (Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)\n\nWASHINGTON -- Alabama Republican Sen. Katie Britt's efforts to pass legislation that would block Medicaid funding from going to states that ban in vitro fertilization were unsuccessful Wednesday when Democrats blocked the bill from advancing.\n\nBritt, who introduced the legislation earlier this year alongside Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, said during brief debate the bill would assuage concerns about couples losing access to IVF, though Democrats said the measure fell short of providing real protections.\n\nDebate took place shortly after the Southern Baptist Convention, the United States' largest Protestant religious organization and one with significant influence in conservative politics, voted to condemn IVF.\n\nIt also came one day before the entire U.S. Senate is set to vote on a bill from Democrats that would provide nationwide protections for IVF. That measure also lacks the bipartisan backing needed to advance to final passage.\n\nSenate Democrats said a Republican measure to block Medicaid funds from going to states that ban in vitro fertilization didn't go far enough and would allow states to \"enact burdensome and unnecessary\" regulations.\n\n\"For the millions of Americans who face infertility every year, IVF provides the hope of a pathway to parenthood,\" Britt said on the floor. \"We all have loved ones -- whether they're family members or friends -- who have become parents or grandparents through IVF.\"\n\nBritt said that ensuring access to IVF is \"fundamentally pro-family\" and that the legislation should provide couples with \"certainty and peace of mind that IVF will remain legal and available in every single state.\"\n\nWashington Democratic Sen. Patty Murray said the Britt-Cruz bill would still allow states to \"enact burdensome and unnecessary\" regulations on IVF that could lead to the kind of \"legal uncertainty and risk\" that forced IVF clinics in Alabama to close temporarily earlier this year.\n\n\"Even though it is an inherent part of the IVF process that families will make more embryos than they need,\" Murray said. \"This bill does absolutely nothing -- not a single thing -- to ensure families who use IVF can have their clinics dispose of unused embryos without facing legal threats for a standard medical procedure.\"\n\nMurray said GOP senators were completely ignoring the issue of what happens to frozen embryos and using the bill as a \"PR tool.\"\n\n\"The stone-cold reality is that you cannot protect IVF and champion fetal personhood,\" Murray said.\n\nThe Britt-Cruz legislation would prevent a state from receiving Medicaid funding if it barred access to IVF, though the bill didn't say anything about states that define life as beginning at fertilization.\n\nThe Alabama state Supreme Court ruling earlier this year that frozen embryos constituted children didn't explicitly ban IVF, but all of the state's clinics stopped operating until the legislature provided civil and criminal protections.\n\nCruz sought to pass the bill using the unanimous consent process, where any one senator can ask for approval and any one senator can block that legislation from moving forward. Murray blocked Cruz's request.\n\nUnanimous consent requests don't include a recorded vote.\n\nThe legislation had three additional co-sponsors -- Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, Roger Wicker of Mississippi and Roger Marshall of Kansas.\n\nThe Senate is set to take a procedural vote as soon as Thursday on legislation from Democrats that would bolster protections for IVF, though that bill isn't expected to get the GOP support needed to move forward.\n\nThat bill is more detailed and broader than the Britt-Cruz bill, which has received criticism from Democrats as being insufficient.\n\nNew Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker said Wednesday during a press conference that access to IVF shouldn't be turned into a political issue and called on GOP senators to back the bill.\n\n\"We can't make this seem like a left-right issue. It's absolutely not,\" Booker said. \"This is an issue that's overwhelmingly supported in America by Republican families, Democratic families and independent families. And so trying to make this into some kind of typical political debate in Washington is just wrong.\"\n\nBooker said protecting access to IVF is, instead, \"about protecting fundamental rights, expanding opportunity, taking care of our military families.\"\n\nIllinois Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth, the bill's lead co-sponsor who has been open about using IVF to have her two daughters, threw cool water on working with Republicans on a bipartisan bill when asked about the possibility during the press conference.\n\n\"Well, they're welcome to join ours and make it bipartisan. We've got 47 co-sponsors thus far and it's a very simple piece of legislation,\" Duckworth said. \"I can't see why they wouldn't join it.\n\n\"In contrast, 90% of Republicans have not signed on to Senator Britt's bill,\" Duckworth added.\n\nSenate debate on in vitro fertilization is taking place the same week the Southern Baptist Convention meets in Indiana for its annual convention.\n\nDuring that two-day gathering more than 10,000 Baptists, called messengers, voted on official policies of the SBC, which included objecting to how IVF is practiced now.\n\nThe SBC wrote in its resolution that IVF \"most often engages in the destruction of embryonic human life and increasingly engages in dehumanizing methods for determining suitability for life and genetic sorting, based on notions of genetic fitness and parental preferences.\"\n\nThe resolution on IVF \"resolved\" that members of the SBC should \"only utilize reproductive technologies consistent with that affirmation\" as well as several other affirmations within the document.\n\nThe resolution was titled, \"On the Ethical Realities of Reproductive Technologies and the Dignity of the Human Embryo.\"\n\nKristen Ferguson, from 11th Street Baptist Church in Upland, California, who announced the resolution before the vote, opposed an amendment that would have made several changes to the text.\n\nFerguson said during a brief debate the committee that wrote the resolutions for the SBC to vote on wanted to make sure it addressed IVF \"with the utmost sensitivity.\"\n\nShe added that members of the resolutions committee did \"not take this topic lightly and we want to make sure that we're speaking carefully about it.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) changed his vote to \"no\" at the last minute to reserve the ability to bring the bill up again.\n\nIn addition to cementing a statutory right to fertility treatments, the bill would have required private and federal health insurance plans to cover IVF treatments while also expanding access to the treatments for military members and veterans.\n\nThe measure was not expected to pass.\n\n\"This is not a 'show vote.' It's a 'show us who you are' vote,\" Mr. Schumer said on the Senate floor ahead of the vote. \"Today, unfortunately, it seems our Republican colleagues are going to show us just who they are -- people who will not protect a woman's right to IVF.\"\n\nHis comments were made after all Senate Republicans affirmed their support for IVF and accused Democrats of \"fearmongering.\"\n\n\"In vitro fertilization is legal and available in every state across our nation. We strongly support continued nationwide access to IVF, which has allowed millions of aspiring parents to start and grow their families,\" the 49 Republican senators wrote in a June 12 statement.\n\nThe move to enshrine access to IVF follows a February ruling from the Alabama Supreme Court that human embryos created through the process are legally children under state law. Some IVF providers in the state responded by suspending their services until lawmakers passed a law shielding them from liability.\n\nSens. Katie Britt (R-Ala.) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas) put forward their own legislation to protect access to IVF nationwide. That bill would have withheld Medicaid funding from states that ban the procedure. However, when Mr. Cruz called for unanimous consent to pass the measure on June 12, Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) blocked the move.\n\nMr. Cruz said the Democrats' legislation, of which Ms. Murray was a sponsor, did not include protections for the First Amendment rights of those who object to IVF on religious grounds.\n\n\"If your faith teaches you not to use IVF, as a doctor, you should have the right to say: 'I am not going to participate in that,' Mr. Cruz said.\"\n\nHours before the Senate vote, House Democrats held a press conference in support of their companion bill, which sponsor Rep.

And so I'm asking my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to put their money where their mouth is.\"\n\nAsked if Democrats would try to force a vote on the bill via a discharge petition, the congresswoman said she was discussing the matter with Republican members.

Congress has a chance to change that.", "body": "Gavin Newsom took to X to comment on the political landscape in Alabama.\n\nIn 2022, nearly 92,000 babies were born in the United States thanks to in vitro fertilization (IVF). These babies have brought incalculable joy to their families. Some of them were born to parents who were diagnosed with infertility or cancer survivors unable to conceive after chemotherapy. Others are the dreams of LGBTQ+ parents who would have no other way of having their own biological children. All of them are miracles of science and the fulfillment of their parents' hopes and prayers.\n\nWhile every single American should have access to IVF, this life-changing medical care has remained out of reach for millions. This could change dramatically with the \"Right to IVF\" legislation introduced in the Senate this month. It would establish a statutory right for patients to access IVF, require more insurance providers to cover fertility care, and ensure our service members and veterans have access to this treatment.\n\nFor the 85% of American adults who support family building through in vitro fertilization, this legislation is a lifeline to help millions of families have a baby and end this war on family building.\n\nWhy is IVF so expensive? I was diagnosed with cancer and couldn't afford fertility treatment. IVF should be free.\n\nAlabama's 'unborn children' ruling raised the stakes for IVF\n\nIn February, the world watched in horror as Alabama's IVF clinics paused care to patients following the state Supreme Court's ruling that frozen embryos are \"unborn children\" under the state's Wrongful Death of a Minor Act. This ruling was devastating for thousands of families trying to build their families using IVF, many of whom had taken additional jobs and drained their savings for a chance to have a baby.\n\nIt also created widespread uncertainty throughout the country on which states were next to harm access to IVF. The Right to IVF Act would provide much-needed federal protection for this health care; it would safeguard people's right to build their families without fear of government restrictions on this practice or future legal recourse against them.\n\nIt also would protect doctors who specialize in IVF treatment and ensure they can adhere to best medical practices, which are absolutely critical for patient safety and optimizing outcomes.\n\nFear of government restrictions on IVF is not the only hurdle people face when considering undergoing IVF treatment. Out-of-pocket costs - and lack of insurance coverage - continue to be a major barrier.\n\nToday, employees of the U.S. federal government, the largest employer in the country, do not have a guaranteed benefit to IVF through their health insurance plans.\n\nI want to be a mom. Abortion policies and IVF choices limit my options - and my future.\n\nInsurance should cover IVF treatment to build families\n\nThe Right to IVF Act would change this by requiring IVF and other assisted reproductive technology to be covered by the Federal Employees Health Benefits program.\n\nFederal employees, the backbone of this country, would then be able to build their families without fear of crushing health care debt.\n\nThe Right to IVF Act also would radically transform insurance coverage for service members and veterans, including providing IVF coverage for those who are unable to conceive without assistance and the option to freeze sperm or eggs before deploying into a combat zone.\n\nCurrently, only those who can prove that their infertility is attributed to a service-related injury or illness are eligible for coverage, leaving too many military members and their loved ones without access to the fertility care they need. Providing this coverage is the best way to show how important families are in our country, ensuring that the brave men and women who defend our country don't have to sacrifice their dream of having a family.\n\nIn addition to federal employees, service members and veterans, Americans who are employed by private companies also would benefit from the Right to IVF Act. This legislation would ensure that high-quality fertility treatment coverage is standardized under private health insurance plans.\n\nThe emotional anguish of trying - and failing - to get pregnant is heartbreaking. We need the federal government to make it easier for people to navigate this fraught and uncertain time. Passing the Right to IVF Act would create a far smoother road for would-be parents to travel and help families welcome home more babies.\n\nWe urge every member of the Senate to support this transformative legislation and pass it without delay.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assisted reproductive technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infertility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fertility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chemotherapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Embryo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sperm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Infertility", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Infertility", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family_Resources_and_Support", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family Resources and Support", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/04/05/NAAS/73222685007-ivf-real.JPG?auto=webp&crop=3296,1854,x0,y129&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9641932", "eventUri": "eng-9641932", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

It said the procedure \"routinely generates more embryos than can be safely implanted, thus resulting in the continued freezing, stockpiling, and ultimate destruction of human embryos, some of whom may also be subjected to medical experimentation.\"\n\nThe delegates called on Southern Baptists to \"reaffirm the unconditional value and right to life of every human being, including those in an embryonic stage.\" They urged members to \"only utilize reproductive technologies consistent with that affirmation especially in the number of embryos generated in the IVF process.\" Those planning to use IVF should \"consider adopting frozen embryos,\" the resolution says.\n\nThe delegates also called on Southern Baptists to \"advocate for the government to restrain actions inconsistent with the dignity and value of every human being, which necessarily includes frozen embryonic human beings.\"\n\nWith a network of tens of thousands of churches, the Southern Baptist Convention has around 13 million members, mainly in the American South.

The vote will be the first presidential election since the US Supreme Court in 2022 overturned the nationwide right to an abortion, after which most Republican-led states moved to quickly outlaw the procedure.\n\nIVF has also become a major issue following a February court ruling in deeply conservative Alabama that said that frozen embryos had the rights of children. Decried by Democratic President Joe Biden as \"outrageous and unacceptable,\" the decision led to several Alabama clinics suspending their IVF programs and quickly became a national political flashpoint. Faced with a national outcry, including pressure from Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, Alabama's legislature quickly moved to pass a law to protect IVF.\n\nSeeking to raise the issue's profile, Democrats in the US Senate plan to bring a national IVF protection bill to a vote on Thursday.

Wade, but they refuse to do so,\" the president said. \"Instead, Republicans' dangerous, out-of-touch agenda is devastating women's health and lives.\"\n\nOnly two Republican Senators -- Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska -- voted for the legislation. Collins told The Independent earlier this week that she would vote for it despite her reservations.\n\n\"I wish we would bring some serious legislation to the floor rather than just messaging bills that are voted on just as we're departing town,\" Collins said.\n\nSenate Republicans introduced a similar bill last week -- the IVF Protection Act -- that would have withheld federal Medicaid funding to states that ban IVF. Senator Ted Cruz dismissed these concerns, telling The Independent Democrats \"could have protected IVF yesterday\" if they voted for the GOP bill, which he led alongside Senator Katie Britt.\n\nBut Democrats shot the bill down because they say it has a key omission: it did not address state efforts to criminalize disposing of nonviable embryos during the IVF process.\n\nThat concern about criminalizing IVF stems from a February ruling by the Alabama Supreme Court classifying frozen embryos are classified as children under state law. As a result, three of Alabama's largest IVF centers paused treatment over concerns they could face criminal charges.\n\nBritt accused Democrats of playing politics with the legislation on Wednesday.\n\n\"I think what you see is Democrats continuing to fear monger on this very issue,\" she told The Independent.\n\nMeanwhile, last week nearly every Senate Republican blocked a measure last week that would protect the right to contraception in the United States as GOP lawmakers across the country block efforts to ensure access to birth control.\n\nDemocrats contend that despite Republican rhetoric, their policies would put both contraception and IVF in danger. Specifically, they cite the fact that a majority of House Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, have signed onto support the Life Begins at Conception Act. The legislation states that an embryo can be considered a life \"at all stages of life, including the moment of fertilization.\"\n\nJust ahead of Thursday's Senate vote, House Democrats reaffirmed the need for codified IVF protections.\n\nA coalition of House Democrats previously introduced a companion to the Senate bill that calls for similar IVF protections: the Access to Family Building Act. That act was championed by several Democrats, including Representative Susan Wild and Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who have both undergone IVF treatments.\n\nWild, who held a press conference Thursday morning, says their bill protects IVF and expands access for veterans and active-duty military, ensuring they will have access to treatments regardless of the state in which they're stationed.\n\n\"This is why we need federal codification of this right,\" Wild told reporters on Thursday. \"It is so unfair to our military families to face the prospect of either not being able to continue IVF treatment or get it at all depending on what their next duty station is.\"\n\nWasserman Schultz told The Independent on Thursday that Republicans need to do more than say they support IVF -- they need to vote to codify protections.\n\n\"Comments are not codification,\" Wasserman Schultz told The Independent. \"The only way that we can ensure that women's reproductive decisions aren't further eroded -- like they were completely obliterated with Dobbs -- is to put it in federal law.\"\n\nSome 8 million children have been conceived through IVF, according to the Columbia University Fertility Center.\n\nThe process involves removing an egg from an individual's body and combining it with sperm in a laboratory before it is implanted. This requires the person who plans to become pregnant to undergo eight to ten days of fertility injections and hormone treatments.\n\nThe procedure costs thousands of dollars for a single cycle -- though more than one cycle is often required.

Republicans, Democrats split over the latest push.\n\nRiley Beggin, USA TODAY\n\nJune 13, 2024 at 6:34 PM\n\nWASHINGTON - The Senate will vote Thursday on a push to protect access to in vitro fertilization, though it's expected to fail in the face of nearly unanimous opposition from the chamber's Republicans.\n\nDemocrats including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., have promised to bring up a series of votes protecting reproductive health this summer in an effort to squeeze Republicans with uncomfortable decisions in the lead up to the November election.\n\nSenators on Thursday will consider The Right to IVF Act, a bill from Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., who used the treatment to have two children, and Sens. Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Cory Booker, D-N.J. It would bar states from adding restrictions to IVF and by requiring insurance plans to cover the fertility treatment.\n\n\"Just a few years ago, it would have been unthinkable, unimaginable even, that access to a safe and widely used reproductive service like IVF would be put at risk,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor Wednesday. \"But sadly, after frightening decisions like the one from Alabama, not even IVF is safe in the aftermath of Roe.\"\n\nThe Alabama Supreme Court ruled earlier this year that embryos used in IVF are children. While the Alabama legislature quickly carved out new rules aimed at protecting IVF providers., the decision has created new questions on reproductive health services outside of abortion, including access to IVF, birth control and more.\n\nThe Senate vote also comes the same day that the Supreme Court threw out a case challenging the legality of mifepristone, known as the abortion pill, and the day after the Southern Baptist Convention voted to oppose in vitro fertilization - illustrating the rapidly shifting landscape of an issue that animates voters across the country.\n\nMost Senate Republicans will vote against the bill, which they argue tramples on religious freedoms and would extend beyond IVF. All 49 Senate Republicans signed a statement released Thursday ahead of the vote saying that \"Senate Democrats have embraced a Summer of Scare Tactics.\"\n\nIt's \"a partisan campaign of false fearmongering intended to mislead and confuse the American people. In vitro fertilization is legal and available in every state across our nation,\" they wrote. \"We strongly support continued nationwide access to IVF, which has allowed millions of aspiring parents to start and grow their families.\"\n\nRepublicans have been pushing an alternative bill that seeks to protect IVF sponsored by Sens. Katie Britt, R-Ala., and Ted Cruz, R-Texas. They sought unanimous consent to pass that bill on Wednesday, but it was struck down by an objection from Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., who called it \"a PR tool, plain and simple.\"\n\nBritt and Cruz's bill would withhold Medicaid funding for states that enact an outright ban on IVF. It comes as Republicans have said they want to protect IVF but have hesitated to tell states how to regulate the procedure.\n\nDemocrats oppose the Republican bill because they argue states could still pass laws that give embryos the same rights as a child.\n\n\"It absolutely is a real solution. It's the only one that can get 60 votes in that chamber,\" Britt said of her bill. \"I think it's critically important that we stop trying to scare women who are looking to experience God's greatest gift, that is being a mother.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Will the Senate vote to protect IVF?

She noted she was only able to become a mom through IVF after her military service in Iraq.\n\nDuckwoth blasted the ruling saying the people claiming to be 'defending family values' are actively trying to enact policies that would prevent Americans from creating those families.\n\nThe push by Senate Democrats to protect IVF is the latest effort as families, healthcare providers and officials have been scrambling in the wake of the bombshell Alabama ruling which raises concerns that clinics could be held liable for destroying fertilized eggs.\n\nSome fertility clinics in Alabama have already paused treatments amid fear of prosecution as the ruling opened the door to wrongful death lawsuits in all cases where embryos do not survive being thawed and transferred to the uterus.\n\nEmbryo selection for IVF shown under a light micrograph - the treatment is overwhelmingly popular with Americans\n\nThe highlighted states have laws on the books stipulating that life begins at the moment of fertilization. In Louisiana, the intentional disposal or destruction of a human embryo is illegal\n\nPresident Biden called the ruling 'outrageous and unacceptable' in a statement.\n\nDemocrats have slammed the decision as a direct result of the Supreme Court decision in 2022 to overturn Roe v Wade.\n\n'Make no mistake: this ruling is a direct result of Donald Trump's promise to overturn Roe v. Wade -- and I've been warning that IVF would be next for years,' Duckworth said on Tuesday.\n\nShe put the onus on Senate Republicans saying if they 'truly care about the sanctity of families, then they need to show it by not blocking this bill.'\n\nRepublicans have been scrambling to reject the Alabama ruling.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump said he would 'strongly support the availability of IVF' and called on Alabama to find an immediate solution.\n\nGOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley said she sees frozen embryos as babies but later attempted to clarify that she did not say she agreed with the Alabama ruling.\n\nFormer President Trump called on Alabama to find a solution following the ruling and said he supports the availability of IVF treatment. Democrats say the AL ruling is the direct result of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v Wade with the addition of three justices he appointed\n\nHaley, who has talked in general terms about her personal struggles with fertility, said she used artificial insemination to have her son Nalin, the second of her two children. She said she views embryos as babies but later clarified she does not agree with the Alabama ruling\n\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee also told DailyMail.com that none of their candidates support a ban on IVF.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said in a statement following the court ruling that he supports IVF treatment.\n\nBut he along with 124 other House Republicans backed the Life Begins at Conception bill last year. It does not include a carveout for IVF treatment, though it does state nothing in the bill should be 'construed to authorize the prosecution of any woman for the death of her unborn child.'", "source": {"uri": "expressdigest.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "expressdigest.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Alabama", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of Alabama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Embryo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fertility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Britt", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Katie Britt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mifepristone", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mifepristone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assisted reproductive technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Cruz", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ted Cruz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kay_Ivey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kay Ivey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammy_Duckworth", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tammy Duckworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reproductive rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

Tammy Duckworth, a military veteran who has used the fertility treatment to have her two children, has championed the bill, called the Right to IVF Act. The bill would have also expanded access through insurance as well as for military members and veterans.\n\n\"As a mom who struggled with infertility for years, as a parent who needed IVF to have my two beautiful little girls, all I can say to my Republican colleagues in this moment is, 'How dare you,'\" Duckworth, D-Ill., said following the vote.\n\nSee also: Katie Britt says Democrats blocked her IVF bill because 'they would lose a key scare tactic'\n\nAll Republicans except Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine voted against advancing the measure, ensuring that it only gained 48 votes -- well short of the 60 votes needed. Instead, GOP senators offered their own, alternative legislation that would discourage states from enacting explicit bans on the treatment. Democrats in turn blocked it Wednesday.\n\nThe overtly political back-and-forth, with no attempt at finding a legislative compromise, showed how quickly Congress has shifted into a campaign mindset five months out from the fall election.\n\nAs Schumer seeks to protect a narrow Senate majority and buoy Democrats' hopes of holding the White House, he has sought to spotlight Republican intransigence to federal legislation that would guarantee women's rights to reproductive care. Democrats have campaigned heavily on the issue ever since the 2022 Supreme Court decision that ended a federal right to abortion.\n\n\"The anti-abortion movement is not yet finished. Now that Roe is gone, they have set their sights to a new target -- in vitro fertilization,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor Thursday.\n\nSchumer, a New York Democrat, also held a vote last week on legislation to protect access to contraception, but Republicans blocked it, arguing it was nothing more than a political stunt. Republicans have also blocked previous attempts to quickly pass IVF protections. They stressed that they support IVF and said Schumer was once again playing to the campaign trail with Thursday's vote.\n\nSen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, said Democrats were trying to \"politicize a deeply personal issue for short term political gain.\" He added that Schumer had brought the bill to the floor without allowing the committee work and studies that usually mark a serious piece of legislation.\n\nStill, Schumer said he would continue to bring up legislation on reproductive care.\n\n\"Republicans are twisting themselves in knots trying to run away from their very record on reproductive freedom,\" he said at a news conference following the vote.\n\nDemocrats took to the Senate floor Thursday to make a series of speeches that highlighted personal stories of how people have been able to have children using IVF. They say Congress must protect access to the fertility treatment after the Supreme Court in 2022 allowed states to ban abortions and the Alabama Supreme Court in February ruled that frozen embryos can be considered children under state law. Several clinics in the state suspended IVF treatments until the state enacted a law to provide legal protections for IVF clinics.\n\nHere is full coverage of Alabama's IVF ruling\n\n\"After the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that a frozen embryo is the same, has the exact same rights as a living, breathing person, women who waited for months and spent tens of thousands of dollars and were days away from an IVF appointment were left to wonder if it was all for nothing when their treatment was abruptly canceled,\" said Sen. Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat.\n\nMost Republicans in Congress, meanwhile, have expressed support for IVF, but have also largely declined to tell states how to regulate reproductive care. Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican GOP presidential nominee, met with lawmakers on Thursday and told them that abortion rules should be left to the states. He also said he supported exceptions for rape, incest and to save the life of the mother, according to Republicans in the meetings.\n\nRepublicans are seeking to come up with a response to voters' concerns about access to abortion and reproductive care -- an issue that is expected to figure largely in the November election. Following the Supreme Court's ruling Thursday that preserved access to the abortion pill mifepristone, anti-abortion groups expressed dismay while most Republicans remained quiet.\n\nIn the Senate this week, Republicans highlighted their efforts to expand access to fertility treatments, yet stopped short of endorsing the Democratic plan.\n\nSen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, said in a floor speech this week that his daughter was currently receiving IVF treatment and spoke of a proposal to expand the flexibility of health savings accounts. Two other GOP Republicans, Sens. Katie Britt of Alabama and Ted Cruz of Texas, also tried to quickly pass a bill that would threaten to withhold Medicaid funding for states where IVF is banned.\n\nDemocrats blocked that bill on Wednesday.\n\nCruz, who is running for reelection in Texas, said it showed Democrats were making a \"cynical political decision.\"\n\n\"They don't want to provide reassurance and comfort to millions of parents in America because instead, they want to spend millions of dollars running campaign ads suggesting the big, bad Republicans want to take away IVF,\" he said in a speech on the Senate floor.\n\nDemocrats argued that the GOP bill was insufficient because it would still allow states to enact laws that grant embryos or fetuses the same rights as a person. Abortion opponents in over a dozen states have advanced legislation based on the concept of fetal rights.\n\nMurray, who objected to quickly passing the GOP bill, said the bill was flawed because it is \"silent on whether parents should be allowed to have clinics dispose of unused embryos -- something that is a common and necessary part of the IVF process.\"\n\nBut Republicans also criticized the Democratic bill. Britt said it \"extends far past IVF. It also treads on religious freedom and protection.\"\n\nIn the wake of the Alabama Supreme Court ruling, Christians, who have been a driving force in the anti-abortion movement based on the belief life begins at or around conception, have wrestled with the fertility treatment.\n\nThe Southern Baptist Convention this week approved a nonbinding resolution that cautioned couples about using IVF. The resolution lamented that the creation of surplus frozen embryos often results in the \"destruction of embryonic human life.\"\n\nThe bill proposed by Britt and Cruz also came under criticism from the Heritage Foundation, a conservative group that has pushed for stringent regulations on IVF clinics.\n\nWith the Senate deadlocked on the issue, advocates for access to the treatment said families would still be left in uncertainty.\n\nJamie Heard, who lives in Birmingham and had to suspend her effort to have a second child using IVF when the state Supreme Court made its decision, said that ruling left her both scared and angry. She has been able to continue the treatment, yet spoke alongside other IVF advocates at the Capitol Wednesday to urge lawmakers to act.\n\n\"There are still a lot of questions that we have about how to move forward,\" Heard said.", "source": {"uri": "al.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "al"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammy_Duckworth", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tammy Duckworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assisted reproductive technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Britt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Katie Britt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Alabama", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of Alabama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Murkowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lisa Murkowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Collins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Susan Collins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veteran", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Veteran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Embryo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maine"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maine"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Cassidy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bill Cassidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reproductive rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patty_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patty Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

This decision is part of wider discussions on women's roles in the church and reproductive issues post-Roe v. Wade. The resolution calls for honoring the sanctity of embryonic life.\n\nThe Southern Baptist Convention on Wednesday voted at its annual meeting to condemn the use of in vitro fertilization and commend its congregants who use alternative fertility therapies or adopt frozen embryos. With the vote on the use of in vitro fertilization, the largest Protestant denomination in the U.S. weighed in on an issue that conservatives across the United States have seen can have political pitfalls in the volatile landscape created by the overturning of Roe v. Wade two years ago.\n\nEarlier at the meeting at which issues affecting women have been prominent, a proposed amendment to the church's constitution that would have banned women as pastors fell just short of the two-thirds majority vote it needed to pass. The IVF resolution before the thousands of leaders gathered in Indianapolis noted the searing pain infertile couples encounter, but made plain that \"not all technological means of assisting human reproduction are equally God-honoring or morally justified.\"\n\nIVF involves combining eggs and sperm in a laboratory dish to create an embryo for couples having difficulty conceiving. The resolution states that the IVF process routinely creates more embryos than can reasonably be implanted and that naturally leads to the ultimate destruction of hundreds of thousands of frozen embryos, which the church considers sacred life.\n\nThe resolution called on \"Southern Baptists to reaffirm the unconditional value and right to life of every human being, including those in an embryonic stage, and to only utilize reproductive technologies consistent with that affirmation ...\" In February, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos should be considered children. The ruling arose from lawsuits by three families against Alabama fertility procedure providers accused of failing to properly safeguard frozen embryos, resulting in their destruction when a patient improperly accessed them.\n\nThe court ruling was based on an amendment to the Alabama state constitution approved by voters in 2018 that made it official policy to uphold \"the sanctity of unborn life and the rights of unborn children.\" The court ruling left unclear how to legally store, transport and use embryos. Democrats portrayed Alabama's all-Republican high court as bent on further restricting women's ability to make choices about reproduction following the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that toppled Roe, abolishing women's constitutional right to abortion.\n\nRepublicans faced backlash nationwide, even as some particularly conservative members of the party continued to question IVF procedures. In Alabama, the Republican-led state legislature passed measures aimed at protecting IVF providers from both criminal charges and civil lawsuits, and the Republican governor quickly signed them into law, prompting Alabama providers who had halted the IVF procedure following the court ruling to resume offering the treatment.\n\nIn Washington, Republican senators blocked Democrats' attempt to guarantee access to IVF treatments, saying the proposal went too far. In May, Brent Leatherwood, head of the Southern Baptist Convention's public policy Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, wrote U.S. senators to urge more robust oversight of the IVF process.\n\n\"A human embryo is a life. This life is as deserving of protection and all the standards of care we would give to a child or an adult,\" Leatherwood wrote. \"In the post-Roe moment we find ourselves in, we must make the most of this opportunity to stand for life in all its forms.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Baptist_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southern Baptist Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Embryo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fertility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

The document contained a separate clause endorsing the adoption of \"frozen embryos in order to rescue those who are eventually to be destroyed.\"\n\nEarlier this year, the Alabama Supreme Court declared that IVF embryos were legally people in the eyes of the state, calling them \"extrauterine children.\" The ruling generated immediate chaos for couples engaged in fertility treatments in Alabama, and sparked national backlash that spurred Alabama lawmakers to pass a bill protecting access to IVF a few weeks later.\n\nRegardless, the Alabama Supreme Court decision was a win for hardline conservatives who see the end of federal abortion rights as just the beginning of their crusade against reproductive autonomy. IVF quickly became a national hot topic, and in February Republicans in the U.S. Senate struck down legislation that sought to protect access to IVF at the federal level. \"They aren't going to just stop in Alabama; mark my words, if we don't act now, it will only get worse,\" the bill's author, Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), said at the time.\n\nWhile the resolution passed by the Southern Baptist Convention is not binding, it does serve as a guiding framework for millions of evangelical congregations throughout the country. The same day that the convention voted to oppose IVF, it failed to secure the required two-thirds majority needed to pass an amendment to its constitution barring collaboration with congregations that \"affirm, appoint, or employ a woman as a pastor of any kind.\"\n\nThe vote failed by a margin of just five percentage points.", "source": {"uri": "rollingstone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rolling Stone"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nikki_mccann_ramirez@rollingstone.com", "name": "Nikki McCann Ramirez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Embryo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assisted reproductive technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Alabama", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of Alabama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Raskin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Raskin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Baptist_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southern Baptist Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptists", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baptists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right to life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infertility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelicalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Evangelicalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Protestantism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Autonomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammy_Duckworth", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tammy Duckworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supermajority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Infertility", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Infertility", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Southern-Baptist-Vote.jpg?crop=0px%2C120px%2C1798px%2C1014px&resize=1600%2C900", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9641932", "eventUri": "eng-9641932", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

Tammy Duckworth, a military veteran who has used the fertility treatment to have her two children, has championed the bill, called the Right to IVF Act. The bill would also expand access through insurance as well as for military members and veterans.\n\n\"These are real solutions that would help tens of thousands of Americans every year build the families of their dreams,\" Duckworth, D-Ill., said this week.\n\nBut almost all Republicans voted against advancing the measure, ensuring that it fell short of the 60 votes needed. Instead, GOP senators offered their own, alternative legislation that would discourage states from enacting outright bans on the treatment. Democrats in turn blocked it Wednesday.\n\nThe overtly political back-and-forth, with no attempt at finding a legislative compromise, showed how quickly Congress has shifted into a campaign mindset five months out from the fall election.\n\nAs Schumer seeks to protect a narrow Senate majority and buoy Democrats' hopes of holding the White House, he has sought to spotlight Republican intransigence to federal legislation that would guarantee women's rights to reproductive care. Democrats have campaigned heavily on the issue ever since the 2022 Supreme Court decision that ended a federal right to abortion.\n\n\"The anti-abortion movement is not yet finished. Now that Roe is gone, they have set their sights to a new target -- in vitro fertilization,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor Thursday. \"So today, the question before the Senate is very simple. Do we agree that Americans should be free to use IVF if they want to, yes or no?\"\n\nSchumer, a New York Democrat, also held a vote last week on legislation to protect access to contraception, but Republicans blocked it, arguing it was nothing more than a political stunt. Republicans have also blocked previous attempts to quickly pass IVF protections. They stressed that they support IVF and said Schumer was once again playing to the campaign trail with Thursday's vote.\n\nDemocrats took to the Senate floor Thursday to make a series of speeches that highlighted personal stories of how people have been able to have children using IVF. They say Congress must protect access to the fertility treatment after the Supreme Court in 2022 allowed states to ban abortions and the Alabama Supreme Court in February ruled that frozen embryos can be considered children under state law. Several clinics in the state suspended IVF treatments until the state enacted a law to provide legal protections for IVF clinics.\n\n\"After the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that a frozen embryo is the same, has the exact same rights as a living, breathing person, women who waited for months and spent tens of thousands of dollars and were days away from an IVF appointment were left to wonder if it was all for nothing when their treatment was abruptly canceled,\" said Sen. Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat.\n\nSenate Democrats said it showed how all types of reproductive care could be upended in many parts of the country after Roe v. Wade was overturned.\n\nMost Republicans in Congress, meanwhile, have expressed support for IVF, but have also largely declined to tell states how to regulate reproductive care. Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican GOP presidential nominee, met with House lawmakers on Thursday morning and told them that abortion rules should be left to the states. He also said he supported exceptions for rape, incest and to save the life of the mother, according to Republicans in the meeting.\n\nRepublicans are seeking to come up with a response to voters' concerns about access to abortion and reproductive care -- an issue that is expected to figure largely in the November election. Following the Supreme Court's ruling Thursday that preserved access to the abortion pill mifepristone, anti-abortion groups expressed dismay while most Republicans remained quiet.\n\nIn the Senate this week, Republicans highlighted their efforts to expand access to fertility treatments, yet stopped short of endorsing the Democratic plan.\n\nSen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, said in a floor speech this week that his daughter was currently receiving IVF treatment and spoke of a proposal to expand the flexibility of health savings accounts. Two other GOP Republicans, Sens. Katie Britt of Alabama and Ted Cruz of Texas, also tried to quickly pass a bill that would threaten to withhold Medicaid funding for states where IVF is banned.\n\nDemocrats blocked that bill on Wednesday.\n\nCruz, who is running for reelection in Texas, said it showed Democrats were making a \"cynical political decision.\"\n\n\"They don't want to provide reassurance and comfort to millions of parents in America because instead, they want to spend millions of dollars running campaign ads suggesting the big, bad Republicans want to take away IVF,\" he said in a speech on the Senate floor.\n\nDemocrats argued that the GOP bill was insufficient because it would still allow states to enact laws that grant embryos or fetuses the same rights as a person. Abortion opponents in over a dozen states have advanced legislation based on the concept of fetal rights.\n\nSen. Patty Murray, the Washington Democrat who objected to quickly passing the GOP bill, dismissed it as \"nothing but a PR stunt.\"\n\nBut Republicans also criticized the Democratic bill. Britt said it \"extends far past IVF. It also treads on religious freedom and protection.\"\n\nIn the wake of the Alabama Supreme Court ruling, Christians, who have been a driving force in the anti-abortion movement based on the belief life begins at or around conception, have wrestled with the fertility treatment. The Southern Baptist Convention this week approved a nonbinding resolution that cautioned couples about using IVF.\n\nWith the Senate deadlocked on the issue, advocates for access to the treatment said families would be left in uncertainty.\n\nJamie Heard, who lives in Birmingham and had to suspend her effort to have a second child using IVF when the state Supreme Court made its decision, said the ruling left her both scared and angry. She has been able to continue the treatment, yet spoke alongside other IVF advocates at the Capitol Wednesday to urge lawmakers to act.\n\n\"There are still a lot of questions that we have about how to move forward,\" Heard said.", "source": {"uri": "weareiowa.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Local 5 - weareiowa.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammy_Duckworth", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tammy Duckworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assisted reproductive technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Alabama", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of Alabama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veteran", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Veteran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Embryo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

Wade.\n\n\"Today, women and families across America are worried about more than Roe's demise. They're worried about what comes next, including the erosion of reproductive freedoms nobody thought were at risk. This includes access to services like IVF,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said earlier this week in remarks on the Senate floor.\n\nThe procedural vote is likely to fail due to GOP opposition. Republicans have criticized the Democrat-led legislation as unnecessary overreach and a political show vote.\n\n\"Why should we vote for a bill that fixes a non-existent problem? There's not a problem. There's no restrictions on IVF, nor should there be,\" Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, told reporters.\n\nThe legislation the Senate will take up - the Right to IVF Act - would enshrine into federal law a right for individuals to receive IVF treatment as well as for doctors to provide treatment, which would override any attempt at the state level to restrict access.\n\nThe bill seeks to make IVF treatment more affordable by mandating coverage for fertility treatments under employer-sponsored insurance and certain public insurance plans. It would also expand coverage of fertility treatments, including IVF, under US military service members and veterans' health care.\n\nThe IVF legislative package was introduced by Democratic Sens. Patty Murray of Washington state, Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and Cory Booker of New Jersey.\n\nThe vote comes after Alabama's Supreme Court said, in a first-of-its-kind ruling earlier this year, that frozen embryos are children and those who destroy them can be held liable for wrongful death - a decision that reproductive rights advocates warned could have a chilling effect on infertility treatments.\n\nWhile the state's legislature took action aimed at protecting IVF in the wake of the ruling, Democrats argue that this is only one example of how access to reproductive health care is under threat across the nation.\n\nSouthern Baptist delegates, for instance, expressed alarm Wednesday over the way in vitro fertilization is routinely being practiced, approving a resolution lamenting that the creation of surplus frozen embryos often results in \"destruction of embryonic human life.\"\n\nThe IVF vote is the latest move by Democrats to bring up a bill expected to be blocked by Republicans. Last week, Senate Republicans voted to block a Democrat-led bill that would guarantee access to contraception.\n\nMost Republicans dismissed the effort as a political messaging vote that was unnecessary and overly broad, though GOP Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine crossed over to vote with Democrats in favor of advancing the bill.\n\nRepublicans have introduced their own bills on IVF and contraception. GOP Sens. Katie Britt of Alabama and Ted Cruz of Texas have introduced a bill called the IVF Protection Act and Republican Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa has put forward a separate bill to promote access to contraception.\n\nCruz and Britt attempted to pass their IVF legislation on the Senate floor Wednesday through a unanimous consent request, but Democrats blocked the effort.\n\nMurray, who objected to the request, criticized the GOP bill, arguing that states could \"enact burdensome and unnecessary requirements and create the kind of legal uncertainty and risk that would force clinics to once again close their doors.\"\n\nUnder the IVF bill from Britt and Cruz, states would not be eligible for Medicaid funding if they prohibit access to IVF, but the legislation \"permits states to implement health and safety standards regarding the practice of IVF,\" according to a press release.\n\nCNN's Morgan Rimmer contributed to this report.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "clare_foran@aol.com", "name": "Clare Foran", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "ted_barrett@aol.com", "name": "Ted Barrett", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) changed his vote to \"no\" at the last minute to reserve the ability to bring the bill up again.\n\nIn addition to cementing a statutory right to fertility treatments, the bill would have required private and federal health insurance plans to cover IVF treatments while also expanding access to the treatments for military members and veterans.\n\nThe measure was not expected to pass.\n\n\"This is not a 'show vote.' It's a 'show us who you are' vote,\" Mr. Schumer said on the Senate floor ahead of the vote. \"Today, unfortunately, it seems our Republican colleagues are going to show us just who they are -- people who will not protect a woman's right to IVF.\"\n\nHis comments were made after all Senate Republicans affirmed their support for IVF and accused Democrats of \"fearmongering.\"\n\n\"In vitro fertilization is legal and available in every state across our nation. We strongly support continued nationwide access to IVF, which has allowed millions of aspiring parents to start and grow their families,\" the 49 Republican senators wrote in a June 12 statement.\n\nThe move to enshrine access to IVF follows a February ruling from the Alabama Supreme Court that human embryos created through the process are legally children under state law. Some IVF providers in the state responded by suspending their services until lawmakers passed a law shielding them from liability.\n\nThe ruling sparked fears nationally that a similar situation could occur in other states, particularly in the wake of the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision overturning the federal right to abortion and sending the issue back to states. Recent Gallup polling shows that the vast majority of Americans (82 percent), including 72 percent of Republicans, find its use for conception to be morally acceptable.\n\nSens. Katie Britt (R-Ala.) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas) put forward their own legislation to protect access to IVF nationwide. That bill would have withheld Medicaid funding from states that ban the procedure. However, when Mr. Cruz called for unanimous consent to pass the measure on June 12, Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) blocked the move.\n\nMr. Cruz said the Democrats' legislation, of which Ms. Murray was a sponsor, did not include protections for the First Amendment rights of those who object to IVF on religious grounds.\n\n\"If your faith teaches you not to use IVF, as a doctor, you should have the right to say: 'I am not going to participate in that,' Mr. Cruz said.\"\n\nRepublicans have recently also rejected the Right to Contraception Act.\n\nHours before the Senate vote, House Democrats held a press conference in support of their companion bill, which sponsor Rep. Susan Wild (D-Pa.) said had garnered the support of four Republicans.\n\n\"Right now we have four Republicans who have signed on, and yet many, many claim to support IVF,\" Ms. Wild said. \"So, words of support are nice to hear, but Americans need action, not empty promises. And so I'm asking my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to put their money where their mouth is.\"\n\nAsked if Democrats would try to force a vote on the bill via a discharge petition, the congresswoman said she was discussing the matter with Republican members. She noted that even with the four who already support the bill, she would still need one more Republican to sign on to reach the 218-member threshold for that move to work.", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assisted reproductive technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Cruz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ted Cruz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

Senate rules require 60 votes to proceed on most legislation.\n\nMaine Sen. Susan Collins and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, both Republicans, broke with their GOP colleagues to support the IVF measure moving toward a final vote. The two also voted for cloture on the contraception access bill last week.\n\nDuring both debates, the vast majority of Senate Republicans said the bills went too far or were too broad, a characterization that Democrats vehemently rejected, calling the GOP stance on certain reproductive rights out of step with most Americans.\n\nWashington Democratic Sen. Patty Murray said during floor debate the bill would ensure patients have a right to access IVF and that doctors have a right to provide that fertility treatment, as well as require more health insurance companies to cover IVF.\n\nThe package included additional provisions that would \"help more veterans and service members, who have trouble conceiving, get the critical fertility services they need to start their families, including IVF,\" Murray said.\n\n\"This is something I've long been pushing for, for years now, and it is long overdue,\" Murray said. \"All these men and women, who fought to protect our families, we owe it to them to make sure they have the support when they come home to grow theirs.\"\n\nMurray said advancing the bill should not be \"controversial, especially if Republicans are serious about\" supporting access to IVF.\n\n\"As we saw in Alabama, the threat to IVF is not hypothetical, it is not overblown and it is not fear mongering,\" Murray said.\n\n'A show vote'\n\nLouisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy spoke out against the bill during floor debate, saying it was not a serious effort at legislating and that no state currently bans access to IVF.\n\n\"I have been sitting here listening to this and I can't help but notice my Democratic fellow senators have chosen to disrespect and deceive the American people as they politicize a deeply personal issue for short-term political gain,\" he said.\n\nCassidy, ranking member on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said that had Democrats been serious about moving this bill, they would have put it up for debate in committee before bringing it to the floor.\n\nHe also criticized the legislation for requiring private insurance companies to provide unlimited fertility treatments, but setting a cap on how many treatments a veteran could receive from a Veterans Affairs clinic.\n\nRepublicans, Cassidy said, \"are so open to working with Democrats on a sincere, bipartisan effort. But this is a show vote.\"\n\n\"Today's vote is disingenuous -- pushing a bill haphazardly drafted and destined to fail does a disservice to all who may pursue IVF treatments,\" Cassidy said.\n\nGOP bill\n\nThe Senate vote came one day after Alabama Sen. Katie Britt and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, both Republicans, attempted to pass their IVF bill through a fast-track process called unanimous consent.\n\nTheir legislation would have blocked Medicaid funding from going to any state that bans IVF, though Democrats argued the measure wouldn't actually have guarded against states classifying frozen embryos as children.\n\nBritt said during debate on her bill Wednesday that she strongly supported nationwide access to IVF.\n\n\"Across America, about 2% of babies born are born because of IVF -- that is about 200 babies per day,\" Britt said. \"So think about the magnitude of that number and the faces and the stories and the dreams it represents. In recent decades, millions of people have been born with the help of IVF.\"\n\nMurray blocked the Britt-Cruz bill from passing the Senate on Wednesday after Cruz asked unanimous consent to approve the measure. There was no recorded vote.\n\nProtecting access\n\nSenate Democrats' IVF access bill was introduced by Illinois Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth, Murray and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker earlier this month.\n\nThe 64-page bill would have provided a right for people to access IVF and for doctors to provide that health care without the state or federal government \"enacting harmful or unwarranted limitations or requirements.\"\n\nThe measure included provisions that would have bolstered access to IVF for members of the military and veterans as well as spouses, partners, or gestational surrogates.\n\nThe legislation defines fertility treatment as \"preserving human oocytes, sperm, or embryos for later reproductive use; artificial insemination; genetic testing of embryos; use of medications for fertility; and gamete donation.\"\n\nThe bill defines assisted reproductive technology as \"including in vitro fertilization and other treatments or procedures in which reproductive genetic material, such as oocytes, sperm, fertilized eggs, and embryos, are handled, when clinically appropriate.\"\n\nDuckworth tried to pass a similar bill through unanimous consent back in February. But Mississippi Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith blocked approval through the fast-track unanimous consent process. There was no recorded vote at the time.\n\nPersonal experience\n\nDuckworth has talked openly about her struggles to start a family and use of IVF throughout her time as a senator, including this year after the Alabama state Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos constituted children under state law.\n\nDuring floor debate Thursday, she spoke again about her own experiences with IVF, which she said is the reason she gets to put her 6-year-old's drawings up on her Senate office wall and get tackled by her 9-year-old on Mother's Day.\n\n\"I didn't know it at the time back then, but infertility would become one of the most heartbreaking struggles of my life,\" Duckworth said of her 23 years in the military that included a helicopter crash in which she lost her legs. \"My miscarriage, more painful than any wound I ever earned on the battlefield.\"\n\nDuckworth said Republican opposition to the bill shows a lack of \"common decency and common sense.\"\n\n\"Excuse me if I find it a bit offensive when a bunch of politicians, who've never spent a day in med school, hint that those of us who've needed the help of IVF to become moms should be sitting behind bars rather than lulling our babies to sleep in rocking chairs.\"", "source": {"uri": "ncnewsline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NC Newsline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jennifer_shutt@ncnewsline.com", "name":

But because her fetus still had cardiac activity, doctors refused to provide an abortion, fearing criminal and civil punishment under the state's near-total abortion ban. After days of waiting to get sick enough for emergency care, Zurawski became septic and the hospital agreed to induce labor.\n\nThe experience left Zurawski in the intensive care unit with severe damage to her reproductive organs, leaving her unable to carry a future pregnancy to term. She was one of 20 women who sued the state of Texas because they were denied medically necessary abortions; the state Supreme Court recently ruled against them.\n\nZurawski and her husband have since turned to in vitro fertilization and surrogacy to start their family, but those services are in peril now, too.\n\nThe Texas Supreme Court is currently weighing whether to take a case that could threaten IVF access. Though the details of the case are not identical, it could have a similar outcome to the recent Alabama Supreme Court decision that ruled frozen embryos should be legally defined as children -- and that discarding them, as is common in the IVF process, would be equivalent to causing the death of a child.\n\nThe ruling, announced in February, immediately caused several IVF clinics in the state to pause services. Shortly thereafter, the state legislature stepped in and passed a bill to protect IVF in Alabama.\n\nTerrified that what happened in Alabama could happen in her home state, Zurawski transported her frozen embryos out of Texas -- a time-consuming and expensive move.\n\n\"Even though the Alabama decision was temporary, that had a catastrophic impact,\" Zurawski told HuffPost. \"One day, one hour of delay can make or break an entire cycle.\"\n\n\"IVF is very much on the chopping block right now -- on a state-by-state basis, but also nationwide,\" she said. \"They have come for abortion. They're coming for IVF. They're coming for contraception. Certainly, I believe that surrogacy would be on the table, if it's not already.\"\n\nDemocrats and Republicans have been sparring over national IVF rules since the Alabama ruling. Most Republicans shied away from speaking publicly about their stance on IVF, given that many support anti-abortion legislation that would also threaten the fertility treatment.\n\nRecently, Republican Sens. Ted Cruz (Texas) and Katie Britt (Ala.) introduced a bill that seeks to protect IVF nationwide by barring states from receiving Medicaid funding if they implement an IVF ban. But Democrats and other IVF supporters are concerned that the Republican bill could motivate states to reject Medicaid funding.\n\n\"Calling your bill The IVF Protection Act without doing anything to protect IVF is despicable,\" Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) said of the GOP bill during a Wednesday press conference. \"It is akin to an arsonist selling you fire insurance that doesn't cover arson.\"\n\nSen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) blocked Cruz and Britt from bringing their IVF bill to the Senate floor on Wednesday. Murray and Duckworth have championed IVF protections for years, forecasting that Republicans would come for fertility services after Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022.\n\nThough Senate Republicans have repeatedly blocked IVF bills from Duckworth and Murray, the two Democrats, along with Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), are renewing their IVF legislation this week with a Senate floor vote on their Right To IVF Act. The legislation would establish a statutory right to access IVF, protect providers from criminalization, expand IVF insurance coverage, and include IVF protections as well as extended access for veterans and service members.\n\n\"My battle with infertility was one of the most heartbreaking struggles of my life. My miscarriage [was] more painful than any wound I earned in Iraq,\" said Duckworth, who had both of her daughters using IVF, at the Wednesday press conference. \"So excuse me if I took it personally when the same Republicans who rely on NRA blood money to get elected, suggested that women like me are committing acts akin to murder when all we're trying to do is create life and not to have to suffer through more miscarriages.\"\n\nThe Senate is expected to vote on Democrats' IVF bill on Thursday. Republicans are likely to block it again.\n\nZurawski hopes IVF protections can be passed on the federal level because she doesn't trust governments in red states to hold her embryos without the threat of criminalizing her. She pointed to the recent news that the Texas GOP is considering a platform that advocates giving legal personhood to embryos -- and by extension may implicitly endorse the death penalty for abortion and IVF patients.\n\nThe Texas GOP also wants to outlaw \"human embryo trafficking,\" or moving embryos out of state -- exactly what Zurawski and her husband did.\n\n\"It's getting harder and harder to live here [in Texas]. But I'm a fighter and I feel like I need to stay and fight,\" Zurawski said.", "source": {"uri": "huffpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HuffPost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Surrogacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Alabama", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of Alabama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Supreme_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Supreme Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Texas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of Texas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammy_Duckworth", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tammy Duckworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intensive care unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patty_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patty Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Embryo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fetus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HuffPost", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "HuffPost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medicaid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arson", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Birth control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Cruz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ted Cruz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_legislature_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State legislature (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

Wade.\n\nIn the past, Southern Baptists have passed resolutions opposing using frozen embryos as a source for stem cells, cloning or other experiments but have not considered a resolution on IVF itself.\n\nThe resolution passed Wednesday urged Southern Baptists \"to reaffirm the unconditional value and right to life of every human being, including those in an embryonic stage, and to only utilize reproductive technologies consistent with that affirmation, especially in the number of embryos generated in the IVF process.\"\n\nThe resolution also affirmed Southern Baptist belief that children are beloved by God from the moment of their conception, including those conceived through IVF. \"Though all children are to be fully respected and protected, not all technological means of assisting human reproduction are equally God-honoring or morally justified,\" the resolution states.\n\nDuring the brief but passionate debate before the resolution was passed in the annual meeting's closing session, Daniel Taylor, a messenger (as the SBC delegates are called) from Charity Baptist Church of Paris, Michigan, sought to soften the language of the resolution to emphasize that IVF can be used in ethical ways. Saying he thanked God for IVF, Taylor told of two church friends who were able to become pregnant using the treatment and give birth to a child who is now his godson.\n\n\"I request this resolution be amended, because in its original form, the resolution would castigate and condemn the entirely moral and ethical actions of these two friends of mine, calling their faithful sacrifice, struggle and blessing a wicked thing,\" he said.\n\nThat amendment was voted down.\n\nAnother messenger, Zach Sahadak from the First Baptist Church of Fairborn, Ohio, said he and his wife had one child through IVF and another on the way. They have retained an additional 10 embryos, he said, which the couple will either use for future attempts at pregnancy or will donate to another family. While he believes in the sanctity of life, he said, he opposed the resolution.\n\n\"I'm against the idea that this technology is so wicked that it cannot be employed,\" he said.\n\nMonica Hall, a messenger from Oak Grove Baptist Church in Paducah, Kentucky, who supported the resolution, told messengers that frozen embryos she had adopted did not survive the process. She said she now believes that IVF is immoral.\n\n\"There is no way to describe the treatment of embryos at any point of the idea process as ethical or dignified,\" she said.\n\nMembers of the SBC's resolution committee acknowledged that Southern Baptists have a wide range of views about IVF and said the resolution was intended to engender more in-depth conversations about the ethics of the treatment. SBC resolutions have no binding authority and are meant only to reflect the views of the messengers at the annual meeting where the resolution was approved.\n\nBut too many Christians, the committee said, use IVF without thinking about those ethics.\n\n\"We need to slow down,\" said Jason Thacker, an assistant professor of philosophy and ethics at Boyce College in Louisville, Kentucky, who served as an adviser to the committee. Thacker added that a long-term goal was \"the end of IVF as routinely practiced\" and said more regulation of IVF is needed.\n\nThacker is a fellow at the SBC's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, which has advocated for legal restrictions on IVF. Brent Leatherwood, president of the ERLC, recently wrote to the U.S. Senate, asking for more IVF regulation.\n\n\"We urge legislators to develop and implement a system of federal oversight that protects and informs women and ensures embryos are treated with care, even as we oppose the general practice of IVF,\" Leatherwood wrote.\n\nAl Mohler, the president of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary and a co-author of the IVF resolution, said he has sympathy for infertile couples who consider using IVF. Their longing for children, however, can't be answered by immoral means, Mohler told a gathering organized by the Danbury Institute on Monday, before the vote was taken.\n\nMohler condemned the procedure forcefully, calling it \"an engineered system whereby multiple embryos are created only for most of them, assuredly, to be destroyed.\"\n\n\"That is as immoral as anything we could imagine,\" he said, noting that LGBTQ couples use IVF to have children. He accused SBC churches of being unwilling to confront the immorality of IVF.\n\n\"We have compromise in our churches,\" Mohler said, calling support for IVF a sign that Christians who say they are pro-life don't truly believe in the sanctity of life.\n\nAt the Danbury Institute session, Mohler, who has become a proponent of the so-called abolition movement that seeks to jail women who have abortions, also took aim at the broader pro-life movement for not being committed enough to the cause.\n\n\"Restricting abortion is not a pro-life victory,\" he said. \"The pro-life victory is the elimination of the murder of the unborn. And that means in every stage of fertilization all the way to natural death.\"\n\nAndrew H\u00e9bert, pastor of Mobberly Baptist Church in Longview, Texas, criticized the resolution, saying it has already confused pastors and church members alike. While he agrees that there are ethical concerns with IVF, he thinks that the resolution was the wrong way to address them. \"It was unhelpful to bring that resolution to the floor,\" he said.\n\nH\u00e9bert said there are ethical issues involved with IVF, including what happens with any leftover frozen embryos and the possibility that parents will choose an embryo based on its gender. But he said these issues deserve more than a few minutes' discussion on the floor of a denominational business meeting.\n\nThe resolution also sends a message, H\u00e9bert said, to infertile Southern Baptist couples who may be considering IVF or who have children conceived by IVF. There have been such couples in every church he has served, he told Religion News Service.\n\n\"Because they are pro-life, they desire to have children and love them and they are looking for an opportunity to do that,\" he said. \"To have a statement that says we're against this is a confusing signal to many in our churches.\"\n\nThe Southern Baptists also passed resolutions condemning Hamas' terrorist attacks of Oct. 7 and opposing antisemitism. Another reaffirmed their commitment to religious liberty and rejected \"any suggestion that our historic, God-given distinctive of religious liberty should be abandoned in favor of a state-mandated religion.\" They also voiced support for \"just war\" theory and urged churches to cooperate on evangelism.\n\nOne resolution that flew under the radar seemed to address leadership scandals. In recent years, several SBC leaders, including past Presidents Paige Patterson and Paul Pressler, have been accused of sexual misconduct or covering up abuse. Another leader, former SBC Executive Committee President Frank Page, resigned in scandal in 2018 after being accused of a \"morally inappropriate relationship in the past.\"\n\nThe resolution this week called for SBC leaders to act with integrity and lamented the ethical failing of church leaders. While not naming names, the resolution instead said: \"we call to repentance leaders who have engaged in public or private sin, abused their power, misused Convention funds, committed crimes, engaged in deception, covered for the sin of others, resisted God-ordained authority, or violated trust.\"\n\nThat resolution passed overwhelmingly with no discussion but gained little attention due to the lack of debate.

Cory Booker, D-N.J.; Patty Murray, D-Wash.; and Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill. It includes four bills that aim to preserve access to IVF by prohibiting states from imposing restrictions on the treatment and making it more affordable.\n\nBut a majority of Republicans are expected to block the legislation on a procedural vote, deeming the bill unnecessary and politically motivated, despite saying they back access to IVF. Instead, Sens. Katie Britt, R-Ala., and Ted Cruz, R-Texas, attempted to pass their own, much narrower IVF bill Wednesday evening but Murray objected, blocking a vote after Democrats called the legislation \"dangerous\" and \"a step backwards.\"\n\nThe GOP bill, the IVF Protection Act, would withhold key Medicaid funding to any states that ban access to IVF, but it does not address the potential legal consequences of discarding nonviable embryos. That's the key issue, Democrats argue, and a major question for providers and doctors, particularly after an Alabama Supreme Court ruling earlier this year called into question whether frozen embryos created during fertility treatments should be considered children.\n\nMost Republican senators signed onto a statement led by Britt after Democrats blocked the GOP bill, accusing Democrats of engaging in \"a partisan campaign of false fear mongering intended to mislead and confuse the American people.\"\n\n\"In vitro fertilization is legal and available to every state across our nation,\" they said in the statement, which was first provided to NBC News. \"We strongly support continued nationwide access to IVF, which has allowed millions of aspiring parents to start and grow their families.\"\n\nDuckworth, who used IVF to have her two children, told NBC News in an exclusive interview Tuesday that conservatives who \"believe that a fertilized egg is a human being\" can endanger access to the procedure.\n\n\"Like in my case, we created five fertilized eggs; three were viable. If you were to implant one of those nonviable eggs, it would have caused a miscarriage. We discarded those three,\" she said, noting that could be considered manslaughter or murder under laws and decisions like the Alabama Supreme Court's.\n\nThe Alabama Legislature quickly acted in response to the Supreme Court's decision, restarting IVF treatments throughout the state in March and shielding providers with criminal and civil immunity. But the legislation that Republican Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey signed did not include a stipulation as to when life begins.\n\nAside from Alabama's legislating on the issue, the Southern Baptist Convention, the largest Protestant body in the U.S., voted Wednesday to oppose IVF and encourage the government to restrict the practice.\n\n\"You can't support fetal personhood or a fertilized egg as a person and also support IVF,\" Duckworth said. \"And that is the critical part that our Republican colleagues are trying to hide from the American people.\"\n\nThe Democrats' legislation would protect providers from legal liability for discarded embryos and require more health insurers to cover fertility care. Also included is the Veteran Families Health Services Act, which would expand access to IVF and other fertility treatments for veterans and allow service members to freeze their eggs before deployment. The Pentagon and Department of Veterans Affairs have covered fertility treatments for years, but strict eligibility rules have limited coverage for service members and veterans. The bill would increase the number of eligible individuals.\n\nFor Duckworth, enshrining the protection into law is personal and expanding access to service members and veterans is dire. After her deployment to Iraq, where she served as a Black Hawk helicopter pilot in 2004, the injured Army veteran tried unsuccessfully for a decade to become pregnant before she found success with IVF.\n\nInfertility in the military is understudied, but according to a 2018 survey, 37% of active-duty and veteran women said they struggled with infertility, a rate that is three times higher than the national average.\n\n\"So many families go through this pain of trying to conceive and not being able to conceive and trying to figure out what was happening,\" she shared. \"With IVF, I was finally able to hold my baby and have my children, and they are the joys of my life.\"\n\nDuckworth went through her IVF journey before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, ending the 50-year constitutional right to an abortion. Since then, conservative-led states have tried to undercut other reproductive health protections, including for fertility treatments, contraceptives and emergency contraceptives used to prevent pregnancies.\n\nIt's a significant concern for Julie Eshelman, a military spouse who had her first and only child using IVF. Military families are often moved to different states at the military's directive with limited input from the families themselves.\n\nAt one point earlier this year, Eshelman's family was asked to move to Alabama around the same time the state's Supreme Court restricted IVF. It didn't end up happening, but because they move so often -- every 11 to 24 months -- Eshelman worries that her reproductive health care could be affected in a red state with restrictions on abortion or IVF.\n\n\"When we moved from Washington to Arizona and from Arizona to Illinois, we didn't have to worry about whether we'd be able to access IVF or access care if I suffered another miscarriage, because I have experienced four of those,\" Eshelman told NBC News in an interview ahead of a news conference with the Democratic senators and IVF advocates Wednesday.\n\nWhile both sides have argued that they support protecting access to IVF, lawmakers have been at odds over the path forward to safeguarding the procedure, and bipartisan compromise looks unlikely in the closely divided Senate.\n\nWithout federal action, Eshelman said her family will have to consider whether her husband, who has served for 14 years, can continue serving if he is deployed to a state where access to IVF was restricted.\n\n\"My husband is so dedicated to his service,\" Eshleman said, \"but I think if we were put in a situation where we did decide we wanted to continue building our family and we were sent to a place where we might not be able to, we might have to have that conversation.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

That's the same position held by the Alabama Supreme Court in ruling that frozen embryos have the full rights of people.\n\nPeople are also reading...

What it did was denounce the routine practice of creating multiple embryos, frozen for potential use but often with surplus embryos destroyed. It also denounced the use of embryos for experiments, as well as \"dehumanizing methods for determining suitability for life and genetic sorting, based on notions of genetic fitness and parental preferences.\"\n\nKristen Ferguson, chair of the committee on resolutions, said after the vote that the resolution amounts to the SBC's first foray into a new ethnical frontier but rooted in their longstanding belief in \"the sanctity of the human embryo.\"\n\nIVF \"is not respecting the sanctity of the human embryo ... in the way it is routinely practiced,\" she said. \"Right now we're trying to open the conversation, remind Southern Baptists of our long-held beliefs of the sanctity of human life and allow them to begin to think through the ethical implications.\"\n\nShe anticipated there may be resolutions with \"much stronger language\" and more specific applications in the future, such as how these issues relate to the medical community, she said.\n\n\"But we are not speaking to that at this time, because Southern Baptists aren't ready to speak to that yet,\" she said. \"They wanted to say an affirmation of the human embryo and that it has implications for IVF. \"\n\nWhy is this an important issue for Southern Baptists?\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nEver since the nation's largest Protestant body took a conservative turn in the 1980s, it has made opposing abortion a top priority. With the overturning of the Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion, new issues have reached the forefront, including IVF.\n\nThis resolution makes clear that Southern Baptists' belief that life begins at conception extends to embryos generated via IVF.\n\nDo Southern Baptists and other conservative evangelicals have consensus on IVF?\n\nNo. On the convention floor, some delegates gave impassioned testimony to how IVF enabled couples to have long-sought children. Others said that despite that laudable goal, the practice is ethically unacceptable.\n\nSome believe it's ethical to use IVF to create only the number of embryos intended for implantation.\n\nAlbert Mohler, a prominent SBC seminary president and conservative activist, made a hardline denunciation of IVF at a sideline event before the SBC meeting on Monday, calling IVF a \"commodification of the embryo\" that assaults human dignity. He also criticized it for enabling people to have children outside of heterosexual marriage.\n\nDid the resolution call for a government ban on IVF?\n\nNo. It calls for government to \"restrain actions inconsistent with the dignity of ... frozen embryonic human beings.\" But it doesn't prescribe specific measures.\n\n\"I think especially after the Alabama Supreme Court decision, there's been a rush at state level as well as federal level to protect IVF or to even expand IVF access, often with very little thought to some of the other realities at stake,\" said Jason Thacker, a Southern Baptist ethicist who advised the resolutions committee.\n\n\"We're not naive enough to say that we can just ban this technology, full stop,\" he said. \"While that would be the goal, because that's consistent with dignity of the human embryo in many ways,\" he said he recognized that there are others who believe there are ethical ways to apply IVF technology.\n\nWhat's essential, he said, is laws that respect embryos' human dignity.\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP's collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

IVF often involves creating multiple embryos, since not all embryos may be viable. Some frozen embryos might also be discarded after a successful pregnancy, if the patient decides not to use them, or for other concerns, such as genetic abnormalities.\n\nJason Thacker, an advisor to the Southern Baptist Resolutions Committee, said at a news conference Wednesday that the resolution, \"unequivocally\" affirmed the Alabama Supreme Court's position that embryos are considered children, regardless of location.\n\nSome anti-abortion opponents who believe that life begins at conception have argued that these embryos should have the same rights as a person.\n\n\"There is a consistent belief, as our chair has already stated, that we believe that life begins at fertilization and is to be honored and cherished and protected at all stages, no matter the stage of development, nor location,\" Thacker said.\n\nThe SBC resolution argued, \"though all children are to be fully respected and protected, not all technological means of assisting human reproduction are equally God-honoring or morally justified.\"\n\nAlthough the resolution expresses grief for couples experiencing infertility, it encourages members to \"promote adoption\" and \"to consider adopting frozen embryos in order to rescue those who are eventually to be destroyed.\"\n\nThe measure's approval comes amid deep concerns that IVF is under increasing threat from the anti-abortion movement.\n\nThose fears have spurred legislation at the federal level from both parties. Last week, Democratic Sens. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, Patty Murray of Washington, and Cory Booker of New Jersey, introduced The Right to IVF Act, which seeks to protect access to IVF procedures.\n\nIVF has broad approval across political lines. In an election cycle, where opposing reproductive rights could be a political liability, some Republicans have voiced their support for fertility treatments.\n\nRepublican Sens. Katie Britt of Alabama and Ted Cruz of Texas introduced a bill in May with similar aims, but advocates have raised concerns that its scope is too narrow.\n\nIn February, an Alabama Supreme Court ruling on frozen embryos created through in vitro fertilization children set off fears across the nation. Though the court's decision concerned a case where embryos were accidentally destroyed at a sole clinic, it quickly ensnared patients across the state when several clinics stopped their services in the wake of the court's ruling.\n\nBusiness resumed after legislators scrambled to create a state law meant to protect IVF providers, but industry experts and IVF advocates have warned that might not be enough to resolve the broader implications of the court's ruling.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Democrats are highlighting the issue this month, which marks the two-year anniversary of the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\n\"Today, women and families across America are worried about more than Roe's demise. They're worried about what comes next, including the erosion of reproductive freedoms nobody thought were at risk. This includes access to services like IVF,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said earlier this week in remarks on the Senate floor.\n\nThe procedural vote is likely to fail due to GOP opposition. Republicans have criticized the Democrat-led legislation as unnecessary overreach and a political show vote.\n\n\"Why should we vote for a bill that fixes a non-existent problem? There's not a problem. There's no restrictions on IVF, nor should there be,\" Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, told reporters.\n\nThe legislation the Senate will take up - the Right to IVF Act - would enshrine into federal law a right for individuals to receive IVF treatment as well as for doctors to provide treatment, which would override any attempt at the state level to restrict access.\n\nThe bill seeks to make IVF treatment more affordable by mandating coverage for fertility treatments under employer-sponsored insurance and certain public insurance plans. It would also expand coverage of fertility treatments, including IVF, under US military service members and veterans' health care.\n\nThe IVF legislative package was introduced by Democratic Sens. Patty Murray of Washington state, Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and Cory Booker of New Jersey.\n\nThe vote comes after Alabama's Supreme Court said, in a first-of-its-kind ruling earlier this year, that frozen embryos are children and those who destroy them can be held liable for wrongful death - a decision that reproductive rights advocates warned could have a chilling effect on infertility treatments.\n\nWhile the state's legislature took action aimed at protecting IVF in the wake of the ruling, Democrats argue that this is only one example of how access to reproductive health care is under threat across the nation.\n\nSouthern Baptist delegates, for instance, expressed alarm Wednesday over the way in vitro fertilization is routinely being practiced, approving a resolution lamenting that the creation of surplus frozen embryos often results in \"destruction of embryonic human life.\"\n\nThe IVF vote is the latest move by Democrats to bring up a bill expected to be blocked by Republicans. Last week, Senate Republicans voted to block a Democrat-led bill that would guarantee access to contraception.\n\nMost Republicans dismissed the effort as a political messaging vote that was unnecessary and overly broad, though GOP Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine crossed over to vote with Democrats in favor of advancing the bill.\n\nRepublicans have introduced their own bills on IVF and contraception. GOP Sens. Katie Britt of Alabama and Ted Cruz of Texas have introduced a bill called the IVF Protection Act and Republican Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa has put forward a separate bill to promote access to contraception.\n\nCruz and Britt attempted to pass their IVF legislation on the Senate floor Wednesday through a unanimous consent request, but Democrats blocked the effort.\n\nMurray, who objected to the request, criticized the GOP bill, arguing that states could \"enact burdensome and unnecessary requirements and create the kind of legal uncertainty and risk that would force clinics to once again close their doors.\"\n\nUnder the IVF bill from Britt and Cruz, states would not be eligible for Medicaid funding if they prohibit access to IVF, but the legislation \"permits states to implement health and safety standards regarding the practice of IVF,\" according to a press release.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 CNN.

Sign up for the Morning Memo newsletter\n\nAs Senate Republicans sought to explain away why they wouldn't support the Democrats' in vitro fertilization bill -- an effort to protect and expand nationwide access to fertility treatment, including IVF -- they shrugged off the idea that a real threat existed. IVF, they claimed, was certainly not imperiled at the state level.\n\n\"I certainly don't hear that anywhere. I don't see it anywhere. I've never heard anybody ever suggest that,\" Sen. Roger Marshall (R-KS), an obstetrician, told TPM on Thursday when asked if he was worried about the possibility of states taking away access to IVF.\n\nWhen approached with the same question, both Sens. Josh Hawley (R-MO) and Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) also told TPM, \"no.\"\n\nYet in Marshall and Hawley's states, bills that would threaten IVF have been introduced in the state legislature. In Tuberville's state of Alabama, the Supreme Court handed down a decision earlier this year that put a halt to IVF treatment, sending the state legislature scrambling to respond.\n\nThe Senate took up a procedural vote on Democrats' Right to IVF Act on Thursday afternoon. Democrats needed 60 votes to overcome the filibuster and proceed to a vote.\n\nBut just like they did in last week's contraception vote, Senate Republicans blocked the consideration of the bill. Only Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) voted with the Democrats.\n\nAt the core of the issue is the concept of fetal personhood -- a decades old, conservative belief that fetuses (and, in some cases, embryos) are people, with all the same rights as children or adults. Versions of the concept have cropped up throughout conservative politics in recent years, from anti-abortion protests to state legislatures to the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision that allowed states to ban abortion.\n\nSome versions of fetal personhood ideology clash with IVF: In IVF, patients often create more fertilized embryos than they will use as a part of the medical process because some embryos may turn out to be unviable. Often, leftover embryos are donated for medical research or destroyed, as storing them in facilities indefinitely could be quite expensive.\n\nAt least five states -- Kentucky, Louisiana, Ohio, South Dakota, Texas -- already have language around personhood in state law, according to a tally by the legal and civil rights group Pregnancy Justice. And in 2024 alone, at least 12 states have introduced personhood bills that could give some of the same rights to embryos and fetuses that generally protect a person, according to the Center for Reproductive Rights.\n\nThe February Alabama ruling provides a prime example of the effects this interpretation of the law can have: After the state Supreme Court found that stored embryos can be afforded the same legal protections as children under the Wrongful Death of Minor Act of 1872, access to IVF was hindered.\n\nThe outcry in response to that decision led to state legislators passing a law that provided civil and criminal immunity to IVF providers. But during the two weeks between the court's decision to the passage of the legislation, many in the state were unable to access IVF treatment. Experts, meanwhile, worry that the exception carved out by the state legislature simply slaps a band-aid on the state court's ruling while its underlying legal interpretation remains.\n\n\"There very much is this a threat from the state level because when you define a fertilized egg as a human child, you make the process of IVF potentially manslaughter or murder,\" Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) told TPM when asked about Senate Republicans' dismissiveness on the issue. \"In Alabama, as you see, they felt the need to come out and say, 'Hey, we're just not going to prosecute you,' which is what allowed those IVF clinics to start up again, but that doesn't last beyond the current administration. They can change the rules anytime.\"\n\nWhen pressed on the ruling in Alabama and how quickly a new set of legislators could reverse that decision, Marshall told TPM he has \"faith in the American public\" to not elect a legislature that would reverse that law.\n\n\"It seems to me 80%, maybe, Americans support in vitro fertilization,\" Marshall said. \"I just can't imagine electing a state House or a state Senate that would support that. I just can't imagine it. And, you know, when in doubt, I like to leave things up to the state ... I think that this should be a state decision.\"\n\nSome Republican senators TPM spoke with ahead of the Thursday afternoon vote even claimed that the Democrats' bill is just an attempt to baselessly \"fearmonger\" ahead of the November elections.\n\n\"Many parents and hopeful parents are confused and frightened especially in the wake of the Alabama Supreme Court decision but also because more than a few Democrats are deliberately stoking those fears,\" Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) told reporters on Wednesday.\n\nHe also claimed that the bill is a purely political move for Democrat's as they only care about the bill because \"they want to spend millions of dollars running campaign ads suggesting the big bad Republicans want to take away IVF.\"\n\nExhibiting a similarly dismissive sentiment about the reality of the threat, Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) told reporters on Wednesday that he will not support Democrats' bill because \"IVF is legal everywhere.\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter,\" he added dismissively. \"IVF is legal everywhere.\"\n\nIn place of the Democrats' bill, Scott has offered a resolution attesting to the Senate's \"support for Americans who are starting and growing families through in vitro fertilization.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Sens. Cruz and Katie Britt (R-AL) put forward a bill that would make states ineligible to receive Medicaid funding if they ban IVF. Cruz and Britt even tried to one up Senate Democrats on Wednesday by bringing their bill to the floor, ahead of the Democrats, and asking for unanimous consent to pass it.\n\nBut Democrats blocked that effort, decrying the ways in which the bill fell short of actually protecting IVF.\n\nThe Republican \"bill allows for states to push for regulations that could severely reduce the standard of care for IVF treatment, such as restrictions on how many embryos are created and what individuals can do with these embryos -- decisions that should only be made between patients and their doctors, based on science and clinical guidelines,\" Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA) said on the Senate floor Wednesday as she objected.\n\nRepublicans are \"trying to mislead people and run away from the fact that their fundamental definition of a fertilized egg as a human child is at the core of the problem that we have here,\" Duckworth told TPM.", "source": {"uri": "talkingpointsmemo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Talking Points Memo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emine_yucel@talkingpointsmemo.com", "name": "Emine Y\u00fccel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Points_Memo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Talking Points Memo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Embryo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_legislature_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "State legislature (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beginning_of_human_personhood", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Beginning of human personhood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Cruz", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ted Cruz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fetus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Marshall_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roger Marshall (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Murkowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lisa Murkowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personhood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Personhood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Tuberville", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Tuberville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Collins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Susan Collins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filibuster", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Filibuster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Birth control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Obstetrics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hawley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hawley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

The ruling sparked a national debate, and Alabama lawmakers have since passed a bill that grants immunity to IVF providers in cases of death or injury to unborn babies during the IVF process.\n\nIVF is a medical procedure that fuses sperm and egg in a lab environment to conceive a child outside of the sexual act. The live embryo is then later implanted into a uterus to continue developing until birth.\n\nThe Catholic Church opposes the use of IVF on the grounds that it separates the marriage act from procreation and establishes \"the domination of technology\" over human life. The use of IVF, which necessarily includes a selection process of the \"best\" embryos, has led to millions of rejected human embryos being discarded and millions more frozen and stored in a state of limbo.\n\nThe SBC resolution passed on Wednesday echoes Catholic teaching in affirming that while \"all children are to be fully respected and protected, not all technological means of assisting human reproduction are equally God-honoring or morally justified.\" (Nearly a third of Alabamans are members of the Baptist faith.)\n\n\"The in vitro fertilization process routinely creates more embryos than can reasonably be implanted, thus resulting in the continued freezing, stockpiling, and ultimate destruction of human embryos, some of which may also be subjected to medical experimentation,\" the resolution continues.\n\n\"[W]e call on Southern Baptists to love all of their neighbors in accordance with their God-given dignity as image bearers and to advocate for the government to restrain actions inconsistent with the dignity and value of every human being, which necessarily includes frozen embryonic human beings.\"\n\nDebate on the floor of the SBC annual meeting, taking place in Indianapolis, saw several delegates from Baptist churches around the country -- known as \"messengers\" -- rise in support of and opposition to the resolution.\n\nOne messenger, Kentuckian Monica Hall, rose in support of the resolution, saying that there is \"no way to describe the treatment of embryos at any point on the IVF process as ethical or dignified.\" She endorsed a section of the resolution calling for the adoption of existing frozen embryos -- a practice that the Catholic Church has not definitively ruled on but has expressed serious moral reservations about.\n\nProminent Southern Baptist leaders had signaled opposition to IVF in recent weeks, with Albert Mohler, president of the flagship Southern Baptist Theological Seminary (SBTS) in Louisville, Kentucky, and a longtime critic of IVF, urging Christians to support the \"correct ruling and judgment by the Alabama Supreme Court.\" Mohler authored the SBC resolution along with SBTS professor Andrew Walker.\n\n\"Quite frankly, we know that in our churches we have compromised on this issue. But if we believe in the sanctity and dignity of every single human life from the moment of fertilization, we need to recognize any intervention with an embryo, any commodification of the embryo, any turn of the embryo into a consumer product is an assault upon human dignity,\" Mohler said as reported by AL.com.\n\nIn late May, the staff of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission (ERLC) of the SBC sent a letter to the U.S. Senate in which the commission, led by president Brent Leatherwood, noted that the IVF industry and the fertility industry at large \"currently operate in the U.S. free from basic regulations and requirements [with] few protections in place for parents or for the embryos created.\"\n\n\"A human embryo is a life. This life is as deserving of protection and all the standards of care we would give to a child or an adult. In the post-Roe moment we find ourselves in, we must make the most of this opportunity to stand for life in all its forms. We must redouble our efforts to create a culture where the preborn -- even at the earliest stage -- are seen as essential neighbors in our society worthy of being saved, where parents are served, and where families can flourish,\" the letter reads.\n\n\"Though I understand the political dynamics that have driven many lawmakers to advocate for IVF 'protections,' no political justification should prevail over preventing the destruction of innocent life and the development of robust ethical frameworks in this area.\"\n\nThe SBC vote comes ahead of an expected vote in the U.S. Senate on Thursday on a bill designed to establish a nationwide right to IVF, which has drawn criticism from some Republicans, who say it could have unintended consequences including the legalization of human cloning.",

That could threaten IVF", "body": "Fight disinformation: Sign up for the free Mother Jones Daily newsletter and follow the news that matters.\n\nIn February, the conservative Alabama Supreme Court delivered an unprecedented opinion, ruling that failing to protect an embryo from destruction is the legal equivalent of failing to prevent a human child from dying.\n\nThis implicated the state's in vitro fertilization providers because embryos are often disposed of in the process of IVF treatment.\n\nWhile Alabama's majority-Republican legislature moved quickly to protect fertility clinics -- several of which had paused treatment due to legal risk -- from future \"wrongful death of a minor\" lawsuits, the decision nonetheless caused a chilling effect around the reproductive community about the future of IVF in red states.\n\nAlabama's supreme court decision sent Republicans scrambling to clarify their views on IVF, which is supported by 86 percent of the population. But, in the wake of this uproar over reproductive freedom, the GOP in one battleground state is reaffirming a controversial position that may make IVF much more complicated. In its official 2024 platform, the North Carolina Republican Party says, without qualification, that it opposes the destruction of human embryos.\n\n\"We support developments in biomedical research that enhance and protect human life, including stem cell research. We oppose human cloning and the destruction of human embryos,\" the 17-page document states.\n\nUS House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said in March that policymakers, especially state lawmakers, need to grapple with these issues. Lawmakers \"need to look at the ethics surrounding\" IVF. \"If you do believe that life begins at conception, it's a really important question to wrestle with.\"\n\n\"It's something that every state has to wrestle with,\" he said, adding, \"Alabama has done a good job of it.\"\n\nWhile other state GOP organizations, such as those in Georgia and Mississippi, include the belief that life begins at conception in their respective platforms, North Carolina's platform appears unique in explicitly discussing embryos. The party's broad phrasing could encompass opposing embryo destruction in the research process alone, or those produced as a result of IVF.\n\nIf embryo use is regulated, IVF will become more complicated. \"Not all eggs will make embryos and not all the embryos will make babies,\" says Dr. Sigal Klipstein, a reproductive endocrinology and infertility specialist in Illinois. \"It's not really predictable. So invariably, in some cases, patients will have extra embryos.\"\n\nIVF patients will have to navigate what to do with their embryos that can't be implanted for various reasons.\n\n\"What happens if the embryo is not viable? What if we know it will miscarry or not implant -- is that an embryo that should be discarded? What about embryos that carry disease? There are a number of downstream effects. And I think the most interesting one is what happens to these embryos? Who pays for that storage? Who maintains that storage? Should patients be obligated to maintain embryos they no longer need? This places undue limits on their reproductive liberty,\" Klipstein says. She also notes that scientists need access to non-implanted embryos to achieve further advancements in reproductive medicine.\n\nThe North Carolina GOP's platform has included similar language about embryos in prior platforms, going back to at least 2010; however, it is notable that the state party did not amend their new platform to explicitly express support for IVF or expand on the embryo clause in the wake of Alabama's contentious supreme court decision and the resulting furor. A version of the platform with the track-changes feature enabled was obtained by Mother Jones, and it shows other edits -- such as the addition of a line asserting \"there are only two genders\" -- were made to the 2024 document, changing the version from 2022. The embryo language was unchanged.\n\nReproductive rights are a touchstone issue of the 2024 election, with several states attempting ballot measures to enshrine abortion access. Democrats are betting that such measures could buoy Democratic candidates in the process. North Carolina's Republican legislature has gone against popular opinion in the state and against their Democratic governor by overriding his veto of a 12-week abortion ban the GOP passed earlier this spring.\n\nDemocratic National Committee spokesperson Jackie Bush says the North Carolina GOP's position on embryos is another example of their war on reproductive autonomy. Republicans in North Carolina \"are attempting to rip away women's reproductive rights, including North Carolinians' ability to grow their families through IVF.\"\n\nA spokesperson for North Carolina Republicans, Matt Mercer, says the platform does not explicitly mention IVF because \"no one is trying to take away IVF,\" adding, \"this is a scare tactic pushed by NC Democrats to their allies in the liberal media to distract voters from their failed record and lack of enthusiasm for their candidates this year.\" (Shortly after Mercer sent this statement came news that the Southern Baptist Convention had voted to oppose IVF.)\n\nIt's possible, however, that GOP lawmakers, including in North Carolina, could limit the destruction of IVF-produced embryos without banning the treatment outright.\n\nAn extraordinary Louisiana statute is illustrative of how that could work.\n\nIn 1986, Louisiana banned the disposal of any embryo that continues developing 36 hours after fertilization -- regardless of whether a medical provider thinks the embryo could result in a healthy pregnancy.\n\nWhile IVF is still legal in Louisiana, patients there have additional barriers. They may have to attempt to implant all their embryos, pay for their storage in perpetuity, transfer them out of state for disposal at their own expense, or donate extras to married couples. (The law does not allow people to donate their embryos to science or to unmarried people.) The regulations can add costs to the already expensive treatment.\n\nAfter a wave of blowback to the Alabama court decision, congressional Democrats and Republicans introduced bills aimed at enshrining IVF protections nationwide.\n\nThe Democrats' bill specifically mentions a statutory right to autonomy over IVF byproducts, whereas Republicans' would merely strip states of federal funding if they impose outright IVF bans. The Republican bill allows states to regulate IVF, and thus could allow states to impose restrictions on embryo disposal mirroring Louisiana's.\n\nMeanwhile, congressional Republicans' widely backed Life at Conception Act defines a \"human being\" to \"include each member of the species homo sapiens at all stages of life, including the moment of fertilization or cloning, or other moment at which an individual member of the human species comes into being.\"\n\nThat bill provides any fertilized egg -- perhaps one in a petri dish -- protection under the 14th Amendment \"for the right to life of each born and preborn human person.\"\n\nIt's inconsistent to simultaneously hold that fertilized eggs are equivalent to children and can't be disposed of, and that a fertility treatment that routinely results in the disposal of some fertilized eggs is permitted.\n\nIf you're bewildered by that contradiction, so are fertility specialists.\n\n\"There are many religious and personal beliefs regarding when life begins, and these are by virtue of their nature unanswerable by science,\" Klipstein says. \"The practice of medicine should be guided by science.\"", "source": {"uri":

IVF often involves creating multiple embryos, since not all embryos may be viable. Some frozen embryos might also be discarded after a successful pregnancy, if the patient decides not to use them, or for other concerns, such as genetic abnormalities.\n\nJason Thacker, an advisor to the Southern Baptist Resolutions Committee, said at a news conference Wednesday that the resolution, \"unequivocally\" affirmed the Alabama Supreme Court's position that embryos are considered children, regardless of location.\n\nSome anti-abortion opponents who believe that life begins at conception have argued that these embryos should have the same rights as a person.\n\n\"There is a consistent belief, as our chair has already stated, that we believe that life begins at fertilization and is to be honored and cherished and protected at all stages, no matter the stage of development, nor location,\" Thacker said.\n\nThe SBC resolution argued, \"though all children are to be fully respected and protected, not all technological means of assisting human reproduction are equally God-honoring or morally justified.\"\n\nAlthough the resolution expresses grief for couples experiencing infertility, it encourages members to \"promote adoption\" and \"to consider adopting frozen embryos in order to rescue those who are eventually to be destroyed.\"\n\nThe measure's approval comes amid deep concerns that IVF is under increasing threat from the anti-abortion movement.\n\nThose fears have spurred legislation at the federal level from both parties. Last week, Democratic Sens. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, Patty Murray of Washington, and Cory Booker of New Jersey, introduced The Right to IVF Act, which seeks to protect access to IVF procedures.\n\nIVF has broad approval across political lines. In an election cycle, where opposing reproductive rights could be a political liability, some Republicans have voiced their support for fertility treatments.\n\nRepublican Sens. Katie Britt of Alabama and Ted Cruz of Texas introduced a bill in May with similar aims, but advocates have raised concerns that its scope is too narrow.\n\nIn February, an Alabama Supreme Court ruling on frozen embryos created through in vitro fertilization children set off fears across the nation. Though the court's decision concerned a case where embryos were accidentally destroyed at a sole clinic, it quickly ensnared patients across the state when several clinics stopped their services in the wake of the court's ruling.\n\nBusiness resumed after legislators scrambled to create a state law meant to protect IVF providers, but industry experts and IVF advocates have warned that might not be enough to resolve the broader implications of the court's ruling.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Following the Alabama court ruling, Southern Baptists said that they were \"opposed to the willful destruction or even donating to scientific experimentation of non-implanted human embryos wantonly created in the typical IVF process\" in a May 2024 press release.\n\nThe church has multiple grievances with the procedure, including the \"over fertilization of eggs without a clear plan for implantation, freezing of leftover embryos, and even the destruction of these human embryos once a couple has succeeded in getting pregnant or no longer desires to keep them.\" The church says that the destruction of fertilized embryos is similar to an abortion procedure.\n\nSouthern Baptists also said that the practice removes the act of procreation from the \"sexual union\" between a couple.\n\nThe Wednesday vote does not create a binding resolution within the Southern Baptist church, but does declare that IVF \"most often participates in the destruction of embryonic human life.\"", "source": {"uri": "time.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TIME"}, "authors": [{"uri": "solcyre_burga@time.com", "name": "Solcyr\u00e9 Burga", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Baptist_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Southern Baptist Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Embryo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axios_(website)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Axios (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sperm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Egg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pew_Research_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pew Research Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ovary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assisted reproductive technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infertility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implantation_(embryology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Implantation (embryology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personhood", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personhood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygote", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zygote"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reproduction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uterus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual intercourse"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society", "label": "dmoz/Society", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Infertility", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Infertility", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AP24163547807873.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9641932", "eventUri": "eng-9641932", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

Democrats are highlighting the issue this month, which marks the two-year anniversary of the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\n\"Today, women and families across America are worried about more than Roe's demise. They're worried about what comes next, including the erosion of reproductive freedoms nobody thought were at risk. This includes access to services like IVF,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said earlier this week in remarks on the Senate floor.\n\nThe procedural vote is likely to fail due to GOP opposition. Republicans have criticized the Democrat-led legislation as unnecessary overreach and a political show vote.\n\n\"Why should we vote for a bill that fixes a non-existent problem? There's not a problem. There's no restrictions on IVF, nor should there be,\" Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, told reporters.\n\nThe legislation the Senate will take up - the Right to IVF Act - would enshrine into federal law a right for individuals to receive IVF treatment as well as for doctors to provide treatment, which would override any attempt at the state level to restrict access.\n\nThe bill seeks to make IVF treatment more affordable by mandating coverage for fertility treatments under employer-sponsored insurance and certain public insurance plans. It would also expand coverage of fertility treatments, including IVF, under US military service members and veterans' health care.\n\nThe IVF legislative package was introduced by Democratic Sens. Patty Murray of Washington state, Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and Cory Booker of New Jersey.\n\nThe vote comes after Alabama's Supreme Court said, in a first-of-its-kind ruling earlier this year, that frozen embryos are children and those who destroy them can be held liable for wrongful death - a decision that reproductive rights advocates warned could have a chilling effect on infertility treatments.\n\nWhile the state's legislature took action aimed at protecting IVF in the wake of the ruling, Democrats argue that this is only one example of how access to reproductive health care is under threat across the nation.\n\nSouthern Baptist delegates, for instance, expressed alarm Wednesday over the way in vitro fertilization is routinely being practiced, approving a resolution lamenting that the creation of surplus frozen embryos often results in \"destruction of embryonic human life.\"\n\nThe IVF vote is the latest move by Democrats to bring up a bill expected to be blocked by Republicans. Last week, Senate Republicans voted to block a Democrat-led bill that would guarantee access to contraception.\n\nMost Republicans dismissed the effort as a political messaging vote that was unnecessary and overly broad, though GOP Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine crossed over to vote with Democrats in favor of advancing the bill.\n\nRepublicans have introduced their own bills on IVF and contraception. GOP Sens. Katie Britt of Alabama and Ted Cruz of Texas have introduced a bill called the IVF Protection Act and Republican Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa has put forward a separate bill to promote access to contraception.\n\nCruz and Britt attempted to pass their IVF legislation on the Senate floor Wednesday through a unanimous consent request, but Democrats blocked the effort.\n\nMurray, who objected to the request, criticized the GOP bill, arguing that states could \"enact burdensome and unnecessary requirements and create the kind of legal uncertainty and risk that would force clinics to once again close their doors.\"\n\nUnder the IVF bill from Britt and Cruz, states would not be eligible for Medicaid funding if they prohibit access to IVF, but the legislation \"permits states to implement health and safety standards regarding the practice of IVF,\" according to a press release.\n\nCNN's Morgan Rimmer contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

While it didn't demand a strict ban on IVF, the resolution called on the denomination's 13 million members to \"advocate for the government to restrain actions inconsistent with the dignity and value of every human being, which necessarily includes frozen embryonic human beings,\" while also encouraging infertile couples to find other ways to have children.\n\nThus, the nation's largest Evangelical Protestant community placed itself firmly to the right of the conservative Republicans who have been stampeding to proclaim their love for IVF in the wake of an Alabama Supreme Court decision that ruled IVF clinics might be subject to wrongful-death liability for discarding embryonic \"children\" under the state's radical anti-abortion laws. Indeed, the GOP legislature and governor of Alabama (right there in the Southern Baptist heartland) raced to enact a law to allow IVF clinics to continue treatments despite the grim court ruling. In addition, the very favorite politician of conservative Evangelicals, Donald Trump, said he would \"strongly support the availability of IVF\" as president.\n\nSo will the SBC resolution make a difference out there in the real world where laws are made and treatments are secured (generally at great cost and difficulty to the patients)? Politico's Megan Messerly thinks so:\n\nThe move may signal the beginning of a broad turn on the right against IVF, an issue that many evangelicals, anti-abortion advocates and other social conservatives see as the \"pro-life\" movement's next frontier -- one they hope will eventually lead to restrictions, or outright bans, on IVF at the state and federal levels.\n\nI don't know about that. It's not like the SBC delegates are pushing on an open door in attacking IVF as semi-homicidal. A Pew survey last month on IVF showed widespread support for IVF across all sorts of partisan, ideological, and religious lines. Republicans and Republican-leaning independents called access to IVF \"a good thing\" rather than \"a bad thing\" by a margin of 63 percent to 10 percent; Democrats and Democratic-leaning indies agreed by a margin of 79 percent to 5 percent. People who say they oppose allowing abortions \"in most cases\" backed IVF 60 percent to 11 percent; even those opposing abortion \"in all cases\" smiled on IVF by a two-to-one margin (40 percent to 20 percent). Most relevantly, white Evangelical Protestants, of which Southern Baptists are the largest single bloc, favored availability of IVF by a margin of 63 percent to 9 percent. That isn't much of a base for a counterrevolution on this subject.\n\nPerhaps it would be useful to look at the influence on this subject of another large religious denomination that has taken a hard line against IVF. The Roman Catholic Church, as noted by the National Catholic Register, has been clear about it: \"The Catechism of the Catholic Church states that IVF is 'morally unacceptable' because it separates the marriage act from procreation and establishes 'the domination of technology' over human life.\"\n\nNow it's well known that the Vatican's opposition to \"artificial\" birth control based on the idea that it \"separates the marriage act from procreation\" is widely disregarded by the folks in the pews. But the recent Pew data suggest the church's long-standing opposition to IVF isn't cutting much ice either: Self-identified Catholics says IVF is \"a good thing\" rather than \"a bad thing\" by a margin of 65 percent to 8 percent.\n\nAccording to Messerly, SBC opponents of IVF are playing the long game:\n\n\"It's going to be a long process. It took us 50 years to take down Roe,\" said Brent Leatherwood, president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, the public policy arm of the SBC. \"It may take us a similarly long time frame to get people to a place where they are thinking more deeply about something like this. It's okay. It takes time. We have to be patient.\"\n\nThat's one way of looking at the tides of history. Another is that the SBC itself has been engaged in a half-century devolution on reproductive rights since its 1971 resolution that \"call[ed] upon Southern Baptists to work for legislation that will allow the possibility of abortion under such conditions as rape, incest, clear evidence of severe fetal deformity, and carefully ascertained evidence of the likelihood of damage to the emotional, mental, and physical health of the mother.\" At some point, the gap between the denomination's official pronouncements on IVF and lay opinion could create a backlash rather than a confirmation of views that contradict the widespread belief that IVF is about as \"pro-family\" a practice as can be imagined.", "source": {"uri": "nymag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NYMag"}, "authors":

Tammy Duckworth, a military veteran who has used the fertility treatment to have her two children, has championed the bill, called the Right to IVF Act. The bill would also expand access through insurance as well as for military members and veterans.\n\n\"These are real solutions that would help tens of thousands of Americans every year build the families of their dreams,\" Duckworth, D-Ill., said this week.\n\nSee also: Katie Britt says Democrats blocked her IVF bill because 'they would lose a key scare tactic'\n\nBut most Republicans were expected to vote against advancing the measure, instead offering their own, alternative legislation that would discourage states from enacting outright bans on the treatment. Democrats in turn blocked it Wednesday.\n\nThe overtly political back-and-forth, with no attempt at finding a legislative compromise, showed how quickly Congress has shifted into a campaign mindset five months out from the fall election.\n\nAs Schumer seeks to protect a narrow Senate majority and buoy Democrats' hopes of holding the White House, he has sought to spotlight Republican intransigence to federal legislation that would guarantee women's rights to reproductive care. Democrats have campaigned heavily on the issue ever since the 2022 Supreme Court decision that ended a federal right to abortion.\n\nSchumer, a New York Democrat, also held a vote last week on legislation to protect access to contraception, but Republicans blocked it, arguing it was nothing more than a political stunt. Republicans have also blocked previous attempts to quickly pass IVF protections. They stressed that they support IVF and said Schumer was once again playing to the campaign trail with Thursday's vote.\n\n\"Despite some claims from my colleagues on the other side, protecting IVF is not a show vote at all. It's a show-us-who-you-are vote,\" Schumer said. \"This will be a chance for senators on both sides to show their support for strengthening treatments for people who start families.\"\n\nDemocrats say it is necessary for Congress to protect access to the fertility treatment after the Supreme Court in 2022 allowed states to ban abortions and the Alabama Supreme Court in February ruled that frozen embryos can be considered children under state law. Several clinics in the state suspended IVF treatments until the state enacted a law to provide legal protections for IVF clinics.\n\nSenate Democrats said it showed how all types of reproductive care could be upended in many parts of the country after Roe v. Wade was overturned.\n\nMost Republicans in Congress, meanwhile, have expressed support for IVF, but have also largely declined to tell states how to regulate reproductive care. Instead, two Republicans, Sens. Katie Britt of Alabama and Ted Cruz of Texas have sought to quickly pass a bill that would threaten to withhold Medicaid funding for states where IVF is banned. Democrats blocked that bill on Wednesday.\n\nCruz, who is running for reelection in Texas, said it showed Democrats were making a \"cynical political decision.\"\n\n\"They don't want to provide reassurance and comfort to millions of parents in America because instead, they want to spend millions of dollars running campaign ads suggesting the big, bad Republicans want to take away IVF,\" he said in a speech on the Senate floor.\n\nDemocrats argued that the GOP bill was insufficient because it would still allow states to enact laws that grant embryos or fetuses the same rights as a person. Abortion opponents in over a dozen states have advanced legislation based on the concept of fetal rights.\n\nSen. Patty Murray, the Washington Democrat who objected to quickly passing the GOP bill, dismissed it as \"nothing but a PR stunt.\"\n\nBut Republicans also criticized the Democratic bill. Britt said it \"extends far past IVF. It also treads on religious freedom and protection.\"\n\nIn the wake of the Alabama Supreme Court ruling, Christians, who have been a driving force in the anti-abortion movement based on the belief life begins at or around conception, have wrestled with the fertility treatment. The Southern Baptist Convention this week approved a nonbinding resolution that cautioned couples about using IVF.\n\nHere is full coverage of Alabama's IVF ruling\n\nWith the Senate deadlocked on the issue, advocates for access to the treatment said families would be left in uncertainty.\n\nJamie Heard, who lives in Birmingham and had to suspend her effort to have a second child using IVF when the state Supreme Court made its decision, said the ruling left her both scared and angry. She has been able to continue the treatment, yet spoke alongside other IVF advocates at the Capitol Wednesday to urge lawmakers to act.\n\n\"There are still a lot of questions that we have about how to move forward,\" Heard said.", "source": {"uri": "al.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "al"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammy_Duckworth", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tammy Duckworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assisted reproductive technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Britt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Katie Britt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veteran", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Veteran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Alabama", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of Alabama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Women's rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Embryo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Birth control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Cruz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ted Cruz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

Republicans have also blocked previous attempts to quickly pass IVF protections. They stressed that they support IVF and said Schumer was once again playing to the campaign trail with Thursday's vote.\n\nDemocrats took to the Senate floor Thursday to make a series of speeches that highlighted personal stories of how people have been able to have children using IVF. They say Congress must protect access to the fertility treatment after the Supreme Court in 2022 allowed states to ban abortions and the Alabama Supreme Court in February ruled that frozen embryos can be considered children under state law. Several clinics in the state suspended IVF treatments until the state enacted a law to provide legal protections for IVF clinics.\n\n\"After the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that a frozen embryo is the same, has the exact same rights as a living, breathing person, women who waited for months and spent tens of thousands of dollars and were days away from an IVF appointment were left to wonder if it was all for nothing when their treatment was abruptly canceled,\" said Sen.

Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican GOP presidential nominee, met with House lawmakers on Thursday morning and told them that abortion rules should be left to the states. He also said he supported exceptions for rape, incest and to save the life of the mother, according to Republicans in the meeting.\n\nRepublicans are seeking to come up with a response to voters' concerns about access to abortion and reproductive care -- an issue that is expected to figure largely in the November election. Following the Supreme Court's ruling Thursday that preserved access to the abortion pill mifepristone, anti-abortion groups expressed dismay while most Republicans remained quiet.\n\nIn the Senate this week, Republicans highlighted their efforts to expand access to fertility treatments, yet stopped short of endorsing the Democratic plan.\n\nSen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, said in a floor speech this week that his daughter was currently receiving IVF treatment and spoke of a proposal to expand the flexibility of health savings accounts. Two other GOP Republicans, Sens. Katie Britt of Alabama and Ted Cruz of Texas, also tried to quickly pass a bill that would threaten to withhold Medicaid funding for states where IVF is banned.\n\nDemocrats blocked that bill on Wednesday.\n\nCruz, who is running for reelection in Texas, said it showed Democrats were making a \"cynical political decision.\"\n\n\"They don't want to provide reassurance and comfort to millions of parents in America because instead, they want to spend millions of dollars running campaign ads suggesting the big, bad Republicans want to take away IVF,\" he said in a speech on the Senate floor.\n\nDemocrats argued that the GOP bill was insufficient because it would still allow states to enact laws that grant embryos or fetuses the same rights as a person.

That's how many Americans said IVF is morally acceptable in a Gallup poll released Thursday. Ten percent of respondents said IVF is morally wrong.\n\nThursday's vote was the latest in Republicans and Democrats battling over abortion and reproductive rights, which are expected to be key points in the November election. Last week, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said, \"Senate Democrats will put reproductive freedoms front and center before this chamber, so that the American people can see for themselves who will stand up to defend their fundamental liberties.\" In April, support for legal abortion reached a record high, according to a Quinnipiac University poll in which 66% of voters said abortion should be legal in all or most cases. Many elected Republicans have expressed support for keeping IVF legal, but Democrats warn some restrictions on abortion could also impact fertility treatments, and some groups have criticized IVF treatments, often on religious grounds. IVF restrictions made their way into the national spotlight earlier this year after the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos are children, meaning if embryos are discarded or damaged -- both of which can happen through the IVF process -- clinics could potentially face wrongful death lawsuits by parents. Alabama Republican Gov. Kay Ivey later signed a bill to protect providers of in-vitro fertilization from potential civil and criminal liability after the court ruling led some facilities in the state to stop offering IVF procedures.\n\nLast week, Democrats brought a bill seeking to enshrine the right to contraception nationwide that was blocked by Republicans.

Tammy Duckworth, a military veteran who has used the fertility treatment to have her two children, has championed the bill, called the Right to IVF Act. The bill would have also expanded access through insurance as well as for military members and veterans.\n\n\"As a mom who struggled with infertility for years, as a parent who needed IVF to have my two beautiful little girls, all I can say to my Republican colleagues in this moment is, 'How dare you,'\" Duckworth, D-Ill., said following the vote.\n\nAll Republicans except Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine voted against advancing the measure, ensuring that it only gained 48 votes -- well short of the 60 votes needed. Instead, GOP senators offered their own, alternative legislation that would discourage states from enacting explicit bans on the treatment. Democrats in turn blocked it Wednesday.\n\nThe overtly political back-and-forth, with no attempt at finding a legislative compromise, showed how quickly Congress has shifted into a campaign mindset five months out from the fall election.\n\nAs Schumer seeks to protect a narrow Senate majority and buoy Democrats' hopes of holding the White House, he has sought to spotlight Republican intransigence to federal legislation that would guarantee women's rights to reproductive care. Democrats have campaigned heavily on the issue ever since the 2022 Supreme Court decision that ended a federal right to abortion.\n\n\"The anti-abortion movement is not yet finished. Now that Roe is gone, they have set their sights to a new target -- in vitro fertilization,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor.\n\nSchumer, a New York Democrat, also held a vote last week on legislation to protect access to contraception, but Republicans blocked it, arguing it was nothing more than a political stunt. Republicans have also blocked previous attempts to quickly pass IVF protections. They stressed that they support IVF and said Schumer was once again playing to the campaign trail with Thursday's vote.\n\nSen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, said Democrats were trying to \"politicize a deeply personal issue for short term political gain.\" He added that Schumer had brought the bill to the floor without allowing the committee work and studies that usually mark a serious piece of legislation.\n\nStill, Schumer said he would continue to bring up legislation on reproductive care.\n\n\"Republicans are twisting themselves in knots trying to run away from their very record on reproductive freedom,\" he said at a news conference following the vote.\n\nDemocrats took to the Senate floor Thursday to make a series of speeches that highlighted personal stories of how people have been able to have children using IVF. They say Congress must protect access to the fertility treatment after the Supreme Court in 2022 allowed states to ban abortions and the Alabama Supreme Court in February ruled that frozen embryos can be considered children under state law. Several clinics in the state suspended IVF treatments until the state enacted a law to provide legal protections for IVF clinics.\n\n\"After the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that a frozen embryo is the same, has the exact same rights as a living, breathing person, women who waited for months and spent tens of thousands of dollars and were days away from an IVF appointment were left to wonder if it was all for nothing when their treatment was abruptly canceled,\" said Sen. Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat.\n\nMost Republicans in Congress, meanwhile, have expressed support for IVF, but have also largely declined to tell states how to regulate reproductive care. Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican GOP presidential nominee, met with lawmakers on Thursday and told them that abortion rules should be left to the states. He also said he supported exceptions for rape, incest and to save the life of the mother, according to Republicans in the meetings.\n\nRepublicans are seeking to come up with a response to voters' concerns about access to abortion and reproductive care -- an issue that is expected to figure largely in the November election. Following the Supreme Court's ruling Thursday that preserved access to the abortion pill mifepristone, anti-abortion groups expressed dismay while most Republicans remained quiet.\n\nIn the Senate this week, Republicans highlighted their efforts to expand access to fertility treatments, yet stopped short of endorsing the Democratic plan.\n\nSen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, said in a floor speech this week that his daughter was currently receiving IVF treatment and spoke of a proposal to expand the flexibility of health savings accounts. Two other GOP Republicans, Sens. Katie Britt of Alabama and Ted Cruz of Texas, also tried to quickly pass a bill that would threaten to withhold Medicaid funding for states where IVF is banned.\n\nDemocrats blocked that bill on Wednesday.\n\nCruz, who is running for reelection in Texas, said it showed Democrats were making a \"cynical political decision.\"\n\n\"They don't want to provide reassurance and comfort to millions of parents in America because instead, they want to spend millions of dollars running campaign ads suggesting the big, bad Republicans want to take away IVF,\" he said in a speech on the Senate floor.\n\nDemocrats argued that the GOP bill was insufficient because it would still allow states to enact laws that grant embryos or fetuses the same rights as a person. Abortion opponents in over a dozen states have advanced legislation based on the concept of fetal rights.\n\nMurray, who objected to quickly passing the GOP bill, said the bill was flawed because it is \"silent on whether parents should be allowed to have clinics dispose of unused embryos -- something that is a common and necessary part of the IVF process.\"\n\nBut Republicans also criticized the Democratic bill. Britt said it \"extends far past IVF. It also treads on religious freedom and protection.\"\n\nIn the wake of the Alabama Supreme Court ruling, Christians, who have been a driving force in the anti-abortion movement based on the belief life begins at or around conception, have wrestled with the fertility treatment.\n\nThe Southern Baptist Convention this week approved a nonbinding resolution that cautioned couples about using IVF. The resolution lamented that the creation of surplus frozen embryos often results in the \"destruction of embryonic human life.\"\n\nThe bill proposed by Britt and Cruz also came under criticism from the Heritage Foundation, a conservative group that has pushed for stringent regulations on IVF clinics.\n\nWith the Senate deadlocked on the issue, advocates for access to the treatment said families would still be left in uncertainty.\n\nJamie Heard, who lives in Birmingham and had to suspend her effort to have a second child using IVF when the state Supreme Court made its decision, said that ruling left her both scared and angry. She has been able to continue the treatment, yet spoke alongside other IVF advocates at the Capitol Wednesday to urge lawmakers to act.\n\n\"There are still a lot of questions that we have about how to move forward,\" Heard said.", "source": {"uri": "triblive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TribLIVE"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@triblive.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammy_Duckworth", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tammy Duckworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assisted reproductive technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Alabama", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of Alabama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Murkowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lisa Murkowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Collins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Susan Collins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

The court said frozen embryos are legally considered children and are protected under the state's Wrongful Death of a Minor Act, a ruling that sparked national debate.\n\nDebate on the floor of the convention over the resolution exhibited divisions within the nation's largest Protestant denomination over the issue. The statement is the first of its kind for the SBC but could reverberate across other conservative denominations.\n\n\"This resolution would castigate and condemn the entirely moral and ethical actions of these two friends of mine calling their faithful sacrifice, struggle and blessing a wicked thing,\" Michigan messenger Daniel Taylor said during the floor debate, alluding to friends who used IVF to have children. \"It would also unnecessarily make it more difficult for all of us to reach those who have gone through IVF as parents or children.\"\n\nTaylor proposed an amendment to the resolution to soften certain language. Messengers overwhelmingly voted against the amendment, leading to a vote immediately after to adopt the resolution in its original form.\n\nKentucky messenger Monica Hall spoke against Taylor's amendment, referencing her own experience with surrogacy, which ultimately led to embryos transferred to Hall's womb not reaching viability.\n\n\"There is no way to describe embryos at any point in the IVF process as ethical or dignified,\" Hall said during the floor debate. \"Nothing in the process of IVF upholds the sanctity of life.\"\n\nThe resolutions committee recommended the full convention adopt the statement after receiving a draft authored by Al Mohler, president of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, and Southern seminary professor Andrew Walker.\n\nMohler, a leading contemporary evangelical Christian voice in the U.S., has opposed IVF for two decades and has cited what he views as other potentially problematic components, such as how IVF can allow same-sex couples or a single woman to have children.\n\n\"In our churches, we have compromise on this issue,\" said Mohler during an address at a luncheon Monday ahead of the convention's expected vote on the resolution. \"A lot of evangelicals don't want to state the proposition clearly.\"\n\nMany conservatives, even those who oppose abortion, have supported IVF and how it has allowed countless Americans to start families who might otherwise be unable to do so. In the wake of the Alabama court's rulings, many in the GOP voiced their support and state lawmakers approved a legislative fix to protect IVF providers.\n\nAbout 2% of births a year involve IVF, a process by which multiple eggs are harvested, fertilized and implanted to create a pregnancy. The Alabama ruling and the stance by the SBC raise questions about what should happen with unused embryos.\n\nA Pew Research Center report in May said 63% of white evangelical Protestants believe IVF is good and 28% were unsure. The percentages were similar those of Catholics, a religious group that is more well-known for opposing IVF and surrogacy.\n\nThe SBC's resolution contends that IVF \"most often engages in the destruction of embryonic human life and increasingly engages in dehumanizing methods for determining suitability for life.\"\n\nIt calls on Southern Baptists to \"advocate for the government to restrain actions inconsistent with the dignity and value of every human being, which necessarily includes frozen embryonic human beings.\"\n\nThe debate on Wednesday echoed one from two years ago, when the convention fought over Southern Baptists' commitment to pro-life ideals. Opposition conservatives supported an abolitionist anti-abortion stance that supports charging women with crimes for having abortions. Proponents of the abolitionist stance decried Southern Baptists who align with an incrementalist anti-abortion view as insufficiently pro-life.\n\nThe 2022 SBC annual meeting also included an ultimately unsuccessful push to abolish the denomination's public policy arm, the Nashville-based Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission, for rejecting abolitionist proposals.\n\nBut with IVF, the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission drew a line in the sand in a May 24 letter urging Congress to limit access and funding for the medical procedure.\n\nA similar attempt to abolish the public policy arm at this year's SBC annual meeting failed on Wednesday morning.\n\nLiam Adams covers religion for The Tennessean.

With the vote on the use of in vitro fertilization, or IVF, the largest Protestant denomination in the US weighed in on an issue that conservatives across the US have seen can have political pitfalls in the volatile landscape created by the overturning of Roe v. Wade two years ago.\n\nThe IVF resolution before the thousands of leaders gathered in Indianapolis noted the searing pain infertile couples encounter, but made plain that \"not all technological means of assisting human reproduction are equally God-honoring or morally justified.\"\n\nThe SBC is the largest Protestant denomination in the US, with over 50,000 churches and over 14 million faithful, and has become a political force in recent decades.\n\nIVF involves combining eggs and sperm in a laboratory dish to create an embryo for couples having difficulty conceiving.\n\nThe resolution states that the IVF process routinely creates more embryos than can reasonably be implanted and that naturally leads to the ultimate destruction of hundreds of thousands of frozen embryos, which the church considers sacred life. The resolution called on \"Southern Baptists to reaffirm the unconditional value and right to life of every human being, including those in an embryonic stage, and to only utilize reproductive technologies consistent with that affirmation.\"\n\nAlso Read: | Trump will speak to a Christian group that calls for abortion to be 'eradicated entirely\n\nIn February, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos should be considered children. The ruling arose from lawsuits by three families against Alabama fertility procedure providers accused of failing to properly safeguard frozen embryos, resulting in their destruction when a patient improperly accessed them.\n\nThe court ruling was based on an amendment to the Alabama state constitution approved by voters in 2018 that made it official policy to uphold \"the sanctity of unborn life and the rights of unborn children.\" The court ruling left unclear how to legally store, transport and use embryos.\n\nDemocrats portrayed Alabama's all-Republican high court as bent on further restricting women's ability to make choices about reproduction following the US Supreme Court ruling that toppled Roe, abolishing women's constitutional right to abortion.\n\nRepublicans faced backlash nationwide, even as some particularly conservative members of the party continued to question IVF procedures.\n\nIn Alabama, the Republican-led state legislature passed measures aimed at protecting IVF providers from both criminal charges and civil lawsuits, and the Republican governor quickly signed them into law, prompting Alabama providers who had halted the IVF procedure following the court ruling to resume offering the treatment.\n\nAlso Read: | The complex journey of transgender rights in Christianity\n\nIn Washington, Republican senators blocked Democrats' attempt to guarantee access to IVF treatments, saying the proposal went too far.\n\nIn May, Brent Leatherwood, head of the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, wrote US senators to urge more robust oversight of the IVF process. \"A human embryo is a life. This life is as deserving of protection and all the standards of care we would give to a child or an adult,\" Leatherwood wrote. \"In the post-Roe moment we find ourselves in, we must make the most of this opportunity to stand for life in all its forms.\"\n\nFemale pastors\n\nThe proposed constitutional change banning women pastors, known as the Law Amendment, had been approved during last year's annual meeting.

The decision sparked outrage across the country - from both Republicans and Democrats - and put thousands of families trying to have children through IVF in limbo.\n\nSenate Democrats push bill protecting access to fertility treatment called the Access to Family Building Act after the Alabama Supreme Court ruled embryos are babies\n\nA month later, Alabama Republican Gov. Kay Ivey signed a law protecting access to IVF following the outcry.\n\nThe vote Thursday also occurred hours after the Supreme Court upheld access to the abortion pill mifepristone and rejected a lawsuit that would have impacted abortion access nationwide.\n\nIt is the conservative court's first major decision on reproductive rights since it overturned Roe v. Wade, ending the constitutional right to an abortion nationwide in 2022.\n\nMifepristone is used in more than half of abortions in the United States and has been used by more than 5.6 million women since its approval in 2000.\n\n'The anti-abortion movement is not yet finished,' Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Thursday.\n\n'Now that Roe is gone, they have set their sights on a new target: in vitro fertilization So today the question before the Senate is very simple: Do we agree that Americans should be free to use IVF if they want to?'\n\nEarlier this year, Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., along with Senators Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., introduced legislation that would protect a person's right to access fertility services such as IVF and healthcare providers that provide such services.\n\nThe bill would also protect a person's rights regarding the use or disposal of their reproductive genetic materials and would allow the Justice Department to pursue civil action against any state or government official that violates such protections.\n\nDuckworth noted the issue is very personal to her. The senator and mother of two daughters is the first sitting senator to have a baby while in office. She noted she was only able to become a mom through IVF after her military service in Iraq.\n\nDuckwoth blasted the ruling saying the people claiming to be 'defending family values' are actively trying to enact policies that would prevent Americans from creating those families.\n\nThe push by Senate Democrats to protect IVF is the latest effort as families, healthcare providers and officials have been scrambling in the wake of the bombshell Alabama ruling which raises concerns that clinics could be held liable for destroying fertilized eggs.\n\nSome fertility clinics in Alabama have already paused treatments amid fear of prosecution as the ruling opened the door to wrongful death lawsuits in all cases where embryos do not survive being thawed and transferred to the uterus.\n\nEmbryo selection for IVF shown under a light micrograph - the treatment is overwhelmingly popular with Americans\n\nThe highlighted states have laws on the books stipulating that life begins at the moment of fertilization. In Louisiana, the intentional disposal or destruction of a human embryo is illegal\n\nPresident Biden called the ruling 'outrageous and unacceptable' in a statement.\n\nDemocrats have slammed the decision as a direct result of the Supreme Court decision in 2022 to overturn Roe v Wade.\n\n'Make no mistake: this ruling is a direct result of Donald Trump's promise to overturn Roe v. Wade -- and I've been warning that IVF would be next for years,' Duckworth said on Tuesday.\n\nShe put the onus on Senate Republicans saying if they 'truly care about the sanctity of families, then they need to show it by not blocking this bill.'\n\nRepublicans have been scrambling to reject the Alabama ruling.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump said he would 'strongly support the availability of IVF' and called on Alabama to find an immediate solution.\n\nGOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley said she sees frozen embryos as babies but later attempted to clarify that she did not say she agreed with the Alabama ruling.\n\nFormer President Trump called on Alabama to find a solution following the ruling and said he supports the availability of IVF treatment. Democrats say the AL ruling is the direct result of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v Wade with the addition of three justices he appointed\n\nHaley, who has talked in general terms about her personal struggles with fertility, said she used artificial insemination to have her son Nalin, the second of her two children. She said she views embryos as babies but later clarified she does not agree with the Alabama ruling\n\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee also told DailyMail.com that none of their candidates support a ban on IVF.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said in a statement following the court ruling that he supports IVF treatment.\n\nBut he along with 124 other House Republicans backed the Life Begins at Conception bill last year. It does not include a carveout for IVF treatment, though it does state nothing in the bill should be 'construed to authorize the prosecution of any woman for the death of her unborn child.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assisted reproductive technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Embryo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fertility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Alabama", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of Alabama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mifepristone", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mifepristone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Britt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Katie Britt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kay_Ivey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kay Ivey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammy_Duckworth", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tammy Duckworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

The court said frozen embryos are legally considered children and are protected under the state's Wrongful Death of a Minor Act, a ruling that sparked national debate.\n\nDebate on the floor of the convention over the resolution exhibited divisions within the nation's largest Protestant denomination over the issue. The statement is the first of its kind for the SBC but could reverberate across other conservative denominations.\n\n\"This resolution would castigate and condemn the entirely moral and ethical actions of these two friends of mine calling their faithful sacrifice, struggle and blessing a wicked thing,\" Michigan messenger Daniel Taylor said during the floor debate, alluding to friends who used IVF to have children. \"It would also unnecessarily make it more difficult for all of us to reach those who have gone through IVF as parents or children.\"\n\nTaylor proposed an amendment to the resolution to soften certain language. Messengers overwhelmingly voted against the amendment, leading to a vote immediately after to adopt the resolution in its original form.\n\nKentucky messenger Monica Hall spoke against Taylor's amendment, referencing her own experience with surrogacy, which ultimately led to embryos transferred to Hall's womb not reaching viability.\n\n\"There is no way to describe embryos at any point in the IVF process as ethical or dignified,\" Hall said during the floor debate. \"Nothing in the process of IVF upholds the sanctity of life.\"\n\nThe resolutions committee recommended the full convention adopt the statement after receiving a draft authored by Al Mohler, president of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, and Southern seminary professor Andrew Walker.\n\nTuesday updates SBC live updates: Virginia church ousted over woman pastor\n\nMohler, a leading contemporary evangelical Christian voice in the U.S., has opposed IVF for two decades and has cited what he views as other potentially problematic components, such as how IVF can allow same-sex couples or a single woman to have children.\n\n\"In our churches, we have compromise on this issue,\" said Mohler during an address at a luncheon Monday ahead of the convention's expected vote on the resolution. \"A lot of evangelicals don't want to state the proposition clearly.\"\n\nMany conservatives, even those who oppose abortion, have supported IVF and how it has allowed countless Americans to start families who might otherwise be unable to do so. In the wake of the Alabama court's rulings, many in the GOP voiced their support and state lawmakers approved a legislative fix to protect IVF providers.\n\nAbout 2% of births a year involve IVF, a process by which multiple eggs are harvested, fertilized and implanted to create a pregnancy. The Alabama ruling and the stance by the SBC raise questions about what should happen with unused embryos.\n\nA Pew Research Center report in May said 63% of white evangelical Protestants believe IVF is good and 28% were unsure. The percentages were similar those of Catholics, a religious group that is more well-known for opposing IVF and surrogacy.\n\nThe SBC's resolution contends that IVF \"most often engages in the destruction of embryonic human life and increasingly engages in dehumanizing methods for determining suitability for life.\"\n\nIt calls on Southern Baptists to \"advocate for the government to restrain actions inconsistent with the dignity and value of every human being, which necessarily includes frozen embryonic human beings.\"\n\nThe debate on Wednesday echoed one from two years ago, when the convention fought over Southern Baptists' commitment to pro-life ideals. Opposition conservatives supported an abolitionist anti-abortion stance that supports charging women with crimes for having abortions. Proponents of the abolitionist stance decried Southern Baptists who align with an incrementalist anti-abortion view as insufficiently pro-life.\n\nThe 2022 SBC annual meeting also included an ultimately unsuccessful push to abolish the denomination's public policy arm, the Nashville-based Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission, for rejecting abolitionist proposals.\n\nBut with IVF, the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission drew a line in the sand in a May 24 letter urging Congress to limit access and funding for the medical procedure.\n\nA similar attempt to abolish the public policy arm at this year's SBC annual meeting failed on Wednesday morning.\n\nBackground: Southern Baptists to debate measure opposing IVF following Alabama court ruling", "source": {"uri":

Democrats in turn blocked it Wednesday.\n\nThe overtly political back-and-forth, with no attempt at finding a legislative compromise, showed how quickly Congress has shifted into a campaign mindset five months out from the fall election.\n\nAs Schumer seeks to protect a narrow Senate majority and buoy Democrats' hopes of holding the White House, he has sought to spotlight Republican intransigence to federal legislation that would guarantee women's rights to reproductive care. Democrats have campaigned heavily on the issue ever since the 2022 Supreme Court decision that ended a federal right to abortion.\n\nSchumer, a New York Democrat, also held a vote last week on legislation to protect access to contraception, but Republicans blocked it, arguing it was nothing more than a political stunt. Republicans have also blocked previous attempts to quickly pass IVF protections. They stressed that they support IVF and said Schumer was once again playing to the campaign trail with Thursday's vote.\n\n\"Despite some claims from my colleagues on the other side, protecting IVF is not a show vote at all. It's a show-us-who-you-are vote,\" Schumer said. \"This will be a chance for senators on both sides to show their support for strengthening treatments for people who start families.\"\n\nDemocrats say it is necessary for Congress to protect access to the fertility treatment after the Supreme Court in 2022 allowed states to ban abortions and the Alabama Supreme Court in February ruled that frozen embryos can be considered children under state law. Several clinics in the state suspended IVF treatments until the state enacted a law to provide legal protections for IVF clinics.\n\nSenate Democrats said it showed how all types of reproductive care could be upended in many parts of the country after Roe v. Wade was overturned.\n\nMost Republicans in Congress, meanwhile, have expressed support for IVF, but have also largely declined to tell states how to regulate reproductive care. Instead, two Republicans, Sens. Katie Britt of Alabama and Ted Cruz of Texas have sought to quickly pass a bill that would threaten to withhold Medicaid funding for states where IVF is banned. Democrats blocked that bill on Wednesday.\n\nCruz, who is running for reelection in Texas, said it showed Democrats were making a \"cynical political decision.\"\n\n\"They don't want to provide reassurance and comfort to millions of parents in America because instead, they want to spend millions of dollars running campaign ads suggesting the big, bad Republicans want to take away IVF,\" he said in a speech on the Senate floor.\n\nDemocrats argued that the GOP bill was insufficient because it would still allow states to enact laws that grant embryos or fetuses the same rights as a person. Abortion opponents in over a dozen states have advanced legislation based on the concept of fetal rights.\n\nSen. Patty Murray, the Washington Democrat who objected to quickly passing the GOP bill, dismissed it as \"nothing but a PR stunt.\"\n\nBut Republicans also criticized the Democratic bill. Britt said it \"extends far past IVF. It also treads on religious freedom and protection.\"\n\nIn the wake of the Alabama Supreme Court ruling, Christians, who have been a driving force in the anti-abortion movement based on the belief life begins at or around conception, have wrestled with the fertility treatment. The Southern Baptist Convention this week approved a nonbinding resolution that cautioned couples about using IVF.\n\nWith the Senate deadlocked on the issue, advocates for access to the treatment said families would be left in uncertainty.\n\nJamie Heard, who lives in Birmingham and had to suspend her effort to have a second child using IVF when the state Supreme Court made its decision, said the ruling left her both scared and angry.

(Scripps News)\n\nThe Senate will take a procedural vote Thursday on the IVF Act, a measure intended to \"protect and expand access\" to in vitro fertilization services nationwide. The act is in response to a February 2024 ruling by the Alabama Supreme Court that prompted hospitals in the state to briefly pause IVF services.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced Wednesday that the vote would come on Thursday.\n\n\"Just a few years ago, it would have been unthinkable, unimaginable even that access to a safe and widely used reproductive service like IVF would be put at risk. But sadly, after frightening decisions, like the one from Alabama, not even IVF is safe in the aftermath of Roe,\" he said.\n\nThe procedural vote is not expected to pass as all 49 Senate Republicans issued a joint statement saying that Democrats are engaging in \"scare tactics.\"\n\n\"Senate Democrats have embraced a Summer of Scare Tactics -- a partisan campaign of false fearmongering intended to mislead and confuse the American people. In vitro fertilization is legal and available in every state across our nation. We strongly support continued nationwide access to IVF, which has allowed millions of aspiring parents to start and grow their families,\" the Republican senators said in a joint statement.\n\nWomen's Issues\n\nWhy is access to birth control controversial? Stephanie Liebergen 11:19 AM, Jun 05, 2024\n\nProponents of the IVF Act say it would establish a \"statutory right\" for people to access IVF services, and authorize the Department of Justice to enforce those rights. The act would also \"increase affordability of fertility care, including IVF, by requiring employer-sponsored insurance plans and other public insurance plans, cover fertility treatments,\" proponents say.\n\n\"For decades, millions of women have used IVF to start or grow their families and make their dreams come true,\" said Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia. \"It's clear that lawmakers and judges across the country won't stop at banning abortion -- we're witnessing a broad-scale attack on reproductive freedom that includes access to assisted reproductive technology and contraception, too. I'm glad to be standing up to these attacks by introducing the Right to IVF Act and other comprehensive measures to protect reproductive care.\"\n\nRepublican Sens. Katie Britt and Ted Cruz in May introduced more narrowly crafted legislation that would make states that ban IVF procedures ineligible for Medicaid funding. Britt and Cruz said that Democrats have stood in the way of their proposal.\n\nIn February, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled in favor of a group of couples who sued a hospital that had their frozen embryos at the time they were destroyed.\n\nThe couples sued the hospital under Alabama's Wrongful Death of a Minor Act. The court said that the act applies to all children, born and unborn, and without limitation.

Ted Cruz and Katie Britt join 'Fox & Friends' to discuss their proposed legislation to protect IVF at the federal level after a Fox News poll revealed abortion as the top 'deal-breaker issue.'\n\nA Democrat-backed bill that would have expanded access to and provide a \"nationwide right\" to in vitro fertilization (IVF) services failed to garner enough votes to get past a key test vote on Thursday.\n\nThe Senate voted 48 to 47, falling short of the necessary 60 votes needed to move forward. The package's failure came as no surprise, as Republicans were anticipated to block the legislation and said the bill was too broad as Democrats work to amplify abortion access and reproductive issues ahead of the 2024 election.\n\nRepublicans Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine were the only two GOP lawmakers to vote in favor of the bill.\n\nThe vote comes after the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos are legally people and ruled that those who destroy them are liable.

Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and Cory Booker of New Jersey. It included measures such as a statutory right to access to reproductive services such as IVF and would have lowered costs for IVF treatments.\n\nRepublican Sens. Ted Cruz and Katie Britt released a statement earlier Thursday reaffirming their support of IVF access across the nation, but they slammed the legislation as \"scare tactics.\"\n\n\"Senate Democrats have embraced a Summer of Scare Tactics -- a partisan campaign of false fearmongering intended to mislead and confuse the American people.

Ted Cruz and Katie Britt join 'Fox & Friends' to discuss their proposed legislation to protect IVF at a federal level after a Fox News poll revealed abortion as the top 'deal-breaker issue.'\n\nThe Senate voted against a Democratic-backed bill that would expand access to and provide a \"nationwide right\" to in vitro fertilization (IVF) services.\n\nThe Senate voted 48 to 47 Thursday afternoon. The package's failure came as no surprise, as Republicans were anticipated to block the legislation, who said the bill was too broad as Democrats work to amplify abortion access and reproductive issues ahead of the 2024 election.\n\nRepublicans Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine were the only two GOP lawmakers to vote in favor of the bill.\n\nThe vote comes after the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos are legally people and ruled that those who destroy the embryos are liable. Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey subsequently signed legislation into law in March that protects medical professionals from civil and criminal immunity in case of unintentional death or damage to an embryo.\n\nALABAMA IVF RULING REIGNITES DEBATE ON ABORTION, A MOTIVATING ISSUE FOR DEMOCRATS AHEAD OF ELECTION\n\n\"Protecting IVF should be the easiest yes vote senators have taken all year. All this bill does is establish a nationwide right to IVF and eliminate barriers for millions of Americans who seek IVF,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor in support of the legislation Thursday.\n\n\"It's personal to me. I have a beautiful one-year-old grandson because of the miracle of IVF. And so, in a perfect world, a bill like this would not be necessary. But after the fiasco of the Alabama Supreme Court decision and the generally MAGA views of some on the Supreme Court, Americans are genuinely worried that IVF is the next target of anti-choice extremists.\"\n\nSchumer notably changed his vote from yay to nay on Thursday, which will allow him to readdress the bill sooner in the future.\n\nThe bill was introduced by Democratic Sens. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and Cory Booker of New Jersey. It included measures such as a statutory right to access to reproductive services such as IVF and would have lowered costs for IVF treatments.\n\nRepublican Sens. Ted Cruz and Katie Britt released a statement earlier Thursday reaffirming their support of IVF access across the nation, but slammed the legislation as \"scare tactics.\"\n\n\"Senate Democrats have embraced a Summer of Scare Tactics -- a partisan campaign of false fearmongering intended to mislead and confuse the American people. In vitro fertilization is legal and available in every state across our nation. We strongly support continued nationwide access to IVF, which has allowed millions of aspiring parents to start and grow their families,\" they wrote.\n\nTEXAS READY TO PICK UP IVF DEBATE FOLLOWING ALABAMA EMBRYO RULING: 'PRO-LIFE STATE'\n\nBritt and Cruz offered their own version of the legislation Wednesday, which would have barred states from Medicaid funding if they banned IVF treatments. Democrats blocked their efforts to pass the legislation through a unanimous consent request, arguing the legislation failed to broadly protect access to IVF services.\n\nDUELING IVF BILLS TAKE CENTER STAGE AS PARTIES BUTT HEADS ON REPRODUCTIVE TECH REGULATION\n\nPro-life groups, such as Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, slammed the bill in the lead-up to the vote for its broad language they said combined \"four extreme bills that take an 'anything goes' approach to fertility treatment.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"This bill is a solution in search of a problem -- fertility treatments are widely available and there are no serious efforts to curb thoughtful care for those experiencing infertility. This is a sweeping bill that protects the industry without protections for parents or their embryos. The bill would allow for genetic testing of embryos, selective reduction abortions and even treatments using human cloning. Instead of serious legislation that balances complex issues, this is a free-for-all for the fertility industry. This bill funnels more money into their billion-dollar business and forces taxpayers to foot the bill,\" Susan B.

The court said frozen embryos are legally considered children and are protected under the state's Wrongful Death of a Minor Act, a ruling that sparked national debate.\n\nDebate on the floor of the convention over the resolution exhibited divisions within the nation's largest Protestant denomination over the issue. The statement is the first of its kind for the SBC but could reverberate across other conservative denominations.\n\n\"This resolution would castigate and condemn the entirely moral and ethical actions of these two friends of mine calling their faithful sacrifice, struggle and blessing a wicked thing,\" Michigan messenger Daniel Taylor said during the floor debate, alluding to friends who used IVF to have children. \"It would also unnecessarily make it more difficult for all of us to reach those who have gone through IVF as parents or children.\"\n\nTaylor proposed an amendment to the resolution to soften certain language. Messengers overwhelmingly voted against the amendment, leading to a vote immediately after to adopt the resolution in its original form.\n\nKentucky messenger Monica Hall spoke against Taylor's amendment, referencing her own experience with surrogacy, which ultimately led to embryos transferred to Hall's womb not reaching viability.\n\n\"There is no way to describe embryos at any point in the IVF process as ethical or dignified,\" Hall said during the floor debate. \"Nothing in the process of IVF upholds the sanctity of life.\"\n\nThe resolutions committee recommended the full convention adopt the statement after receiving a draft authored by Al Mohler, president of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, and Southern seminary professor Andrew Walker.\n\nMohler, a leading contemporary evangelical Christian voice in the U.S., has opposed IVF for two decades and has cited what he views as other potentially problematic components, such as how IVF can allow same-sex couples or a single woman to have children.\n\n\"In our churches, we have compromise on this issue,\" said Mohler during an address at a luncheon Monday ahead of the convention's expected vote on the resolution. \"A lot of evangelicals don't want to state the proposition clearly.\"\n\nMany conservatives, even those who oppose abortion, have supported IVF and how it has allowed countless Americans to start families who might otherwise be unable to do so. In the wake of the Alabama court's rulings, many in the GOP voiced their support and state lawmakers approved a legislative fix to protect IVF providers.\n\nAbout 2% of births a year involve IVF, a process by which multiple eggs are harvested, fertilized and implanted to create a pregnancy. The Alabama ruling and the stance by the SBC raise questions about what should happen with unused embryos.\n\nA Pew Research Center report in May said 63% of white evangelical Protestants believe IVF is good and 28% were unsure. The percentages were similar those of Catholics, a religious group that is more well-known for opposing IVF and surrogacy.\n\nThe SBC's resolution contends that IVF \"most often engages in the destruction of embryonic human life and increasingly engages in dehumanizing methods for determining suitability for life.\"\n\nIt calls on Southern Baptists to \"advocate for the government to restrain actions inconsistent with the dignity and value of every human being, which necessarily includes frozen embryonic human beings.\"\n\nThe debate on Wednesday echoed one from two years ago, when the convention fought over Southern Baptists' commitment to pro-life ideals. Opposition conservatives supported an abolitionist anti-abortion stance that supports charging women with crimes for having abortions. Proponents of the abolitionist stance decried Southern Baptists who align with an incrementalist anti-abortion view as insufficiently pro-life.\n\nThe 2022 SBC annual meeting also included an ultimately unsuccessful push to abolish the denomination's public policy arm, the Nashville-based Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission, for rejecting abolitionist proposals.\n\nBut with IVF, the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission drew a line in the sand in a May 24 letter urging Congress to limit access and funding for the medical procedure.\n\nA similar attempt to abolish the public policy arm at this year's SBC annual meeting failed on Wednesday morning.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Congress has a chance to change that.", "body": "In 2022, nearly 92,000 babies were born in the United States thanks to in vitro fertilization (IVF). These babies have brought incalculable joy to their families. Some of them were born to parents who were diagnosed with infertility or cancer survivors unable to conceive after chemotherapy. Others are the dreams of LGBTQ+ parents who would have no other way of having their own biological children. All of them are miracles of science and the fulfillment of their parents' hopes and prayers.\n\nWhile every single American should have access to IVF, this life-changing medical care has remained out of reach for millions. This could change dramatically with the \"Right to IVF\" legislation introduced in the Senate this month. It would establish a statutory right for patients to access IVF, require more insurance providers to cover fertility care, and ensure our service members and veterans have access to this treatment.\n\nFor the 85% of American adults who support family building through in vitro fertilization, this legislation is a lifeline to help millions of families have a baby and end this war on family building.\n\nWhy is IVF so expensive? I was diagnosed with cancer and couldn't afford fertility treatment. IVF should be free.\n\nAlabama's 'unborn children' ruling raised the stakes for IVF\n\nIn February, the world watched in horror as Alabama's IVF clinics paused care to patients following the state Supreme Court's ruling that frozen embryos are \"unborn children\" under the state's Wrongful Death of a Minor Act. This ruling was devastating for thousands of families trying to build their families using IVF, many of whom had taken additional jobs and drained their savings for a chance to have a baby.\n\nIt also created widespread uncertainty throughout the country on which states were next to harm access to IVF. The Right to IVF Act would provide much-needed federal protection for this health care; it would safeguard people's right to build their families without fear of government restrictions on this practice or future legal recourse against them.\n\nIt also would protect doctors who specialize in IVF treatment and ensures they can adhere to best medical practices, which are absolutely critical for patient safety and optimizing outcomes.\n\nFear of government restrictions on IVF is not the only hurdle people face when considering undergoing IVF treatment. Out-of-pocket costs - and lack of insurance coverage - continue to be a major barrier.\n\nToday, employees of the U.S. federal government, the largest employer in the country, do not have a guaranteed benefit to IVF through their health insurance plans.\n\nI want to be a mom. Abortion policies and IVF choices limit my options - and my future.\n\nInsurance should cover IVF treatment to build families\n\nThe Right to IVF Act would change this by requiring IVF and other assisted reproductive technology to be covered by the Federal Employees Health Benefits program.\n\nFederal employees, the backbone of this country, would then be able to build their families without fear of crushing health care debt.\n\nOpinion alerts: Get columns from your favorite columnists + expert analysis on top issues, delivered straight to your device through the USA TODAY app. Don't have the app? Download it for free from your app store.\n\nThe Right to IVF Act also would radically transform insurance coverage for service members and veterans, including providing IVF coverage for those who are unable to conceive without assistance and the option to freeze sperm or eggs before deploying into a combat zone.\n\nCurrently, only those who can prove that their infertility is attributed to a service-related injury or illness are eligible for coverage, leaving too many military members and their loved ones without access to the fertility care they need. Providing this coverage is the best way to show how important families are in our country, ensuring that the brave men and women who defend our country don't have to sacrifice their dream of having a family.\n\nIn addition to federal employees, service members and veterans, Americans who are employed by private companies also would benefit from the Right to IVF Act. This legislation would ensure that high-quality fertility treatment coverage is standardized under private health insurance plans.\n\nThe emotional anguish of trying - and failing - to get pregnant is heartbreaking. We need the federal government to make it easier for people to navigate this fraught and uncertain time. Passing the Right to IVF Act would create a far smoother road for would-be parents to travel and help families welcome home more babies.\n\nWe urge every member of the Senate to support this transformative legislation and pass it without delay.\n\nBarbara Collura is the president and CEO of RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association.

Wade -- despite near-certain opposition from Republicans.\n\nThe issue came to the national attention after the Alabama Supreme Court earlier this year ruled that embryos are considered children under state law, prompting providers to halt fertility treatments. (The Legislature later approved legislation to protect IVF in the state.)\n\nAcross the nation, Democrats put the blame on Republicans as the development raised concern about similar moves elsewhere, warning of a new front in the fight over reproductive rights.\n\n\"In the aftermath of Roe and after frightening decisions like the one from Alabama, many families fear that this basic service cannot be taken for granted,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Tuesday. \"The Senate can ease people's worries and protect their freedoms through legislation.\"\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, the upper chamber is scheduled to take a procedural vote on the package, called the Right to IVF Act, made up of four bills, some of which have previously been blocked by Senate Republicans. The package, which has almost no chance of being approved, is sponsored by Sens. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, Patty Murray of Washington and Cory Booker of New Jersey, and centers on a right to receive and provide IVF services, while working to make the treatments more affordable.\n\nOne measure would create a statutory right for access to assisted reproductive services like IVF. Duckworth tried to secure passage of the bill in February under unanimous consent, but one Republican senator objected, claiming that it would go too far. The package also includes a measure geared toward expanding access to the fertility treatments for veterans, which was likewise blocked by a Republican senator earlier this year. Other provisions are aimed at lowering costs for Americans by requiring insurance plans to cover IVF.\n\nAnother push related to reproductive rights fell short in the Senate last week, when Democrats tried to advance legislation protecting access to contraception ,with most Republicans opposing the measure. The two votes come as part of an effort by Democrats to highlight reproductive rights this month, with an eye toward the November elections, which Republicans have criticized. But Schumer argues that the votes aren't mere messaging votes.\n\n\"Protecting IVF, like protecting contraception, is not a show vote,\" Schumer said at a news conference on Wednesday. \"It's a show-us-who-you-are vote.\"\n\nHowever, Senate Democrats want to put Republicans on the record over the issues related to reproductive rights issues, which has been a driving force at the polls.\n\n\"Every single Republican needs to answer clearly for the record: do you want our laws to protect IVF or do you want laws that say frozen embryos have the same rights as living, breathing human beings?\" Murray said at a news conference on Wednesday. \"You cannot have both.\"\n\nAnd when it comes to IVF, although Senate Republicans have largely expressed support for the fertility treatments in the wake of the Alabama ruling, lawmakers appear to be at odds over a path forward that would satisfy both parties.\n\nLast month, two Senate Republicans, Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Katie Britt of Alabama, introduced legislation to protect access to IVF, urging bipartisan support. But Democrats quickly pushed back on the legislation, questioning its scope and mechanism.\n\nThe GOP bill, called the IVF Protection Act, the would require that states \"do not prohibit in vitro fertilization\" as a condition for the states to receive federal funding for Medicaid, which provides health insurance for low-income Americans. The bill doesn't compel an organization or individual to provide IVF services, and it doesn't preclude states from otherwise regulating IVF -- which Democrats generally oppose.\n\nOn Wednesday, Cruz and Britt attempted to approve the legislation under unanimous consent, in order to preempt the Democrat-led vote on Thursday. But Murray blocked the move, calling it a \"PR tool\" and argued that it's \"ridiculous to claim that this bill protects IVF when it does nothing of the sort.\"\n\nThough the Democrats' IVF package isn't likely to advance, at least one Republican, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, said she intends to vote to advance the IVF package. She told reporters she doesn't want \"the message to be that Republicans are against IVF,\" but she also noted that the move is \"clearly not a serious attempt at legislating.\"\n\nAnd Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, said she's still looking at the components of the package.

On the other hand, GOP lawmakers keep voting against federal IVF protections.\n\nCongressional Republicans are well are of the broad public support for in vitro fertilization. With one recent poll showing that a whopping 86% of Americans want IVF treatments to be legal, GOP officials realize that it'd be politically dangerous to oppose this popular, safe, and effective pro-family policy.\n\nWith this in mind, every member of the Senate Republican conference -- literally, all 49 members -- signed onto a joint statement, issued this morning, expressing their collective support for IVF access. \"We strongly support continued nationwide access to IVF, which has allowed millions of aspiring parents to start and grow their families,\" the GOP senators said.\n\nBut the phrase \"watch what they do, not what they say\" comes to mind. It's one thing for Senate Republicans to express support for IVF in the abstract; it's something else for them to actually vote for federal legislation that would protect IVF in practice. NBC News reported on the latest effort to govern on the issue, and the number of GOP officials who balked.\n\nThe legislation was written three Senate Democrats -- Washington's Patty Murray, Illinois' Tammy Duckworth, and New Jersey's Cory Booker -- and it would prohibit states from imposing restrictions on the treatments, while also making IVF more affordable.\n\nTwo Republican senators -- Alaska's Lisa Murkowski and Maine's Susan Collins -- voted with the Democratic majority in today's procedural vote, but every other GOP member balked. The final tally was 48 to 47, with some senators missing the vote. To advance, proponents needed 60 votes, and they obviously didn't come especially close.\n\nIf these circumstances sound at all familiar, it's not your imagination. In late February, Duckworth sought unanimous consent -- a procedural move designed to help quickly advance uncontroversial measures -- on the \"Access to Family Building Act,\" which would create legal protections for IVF at the national level. It also failed in response to Republican opposition.\n\nTwo weeks later, Murray tried to pass a bill to expand access to in vitro fertilization for military service members and veterans. It, too, was derailed by Republican opposition.\n\n\"Today, senators face a very simple question: Do you agree Americans should have access to IVF, yes or no? If yes, the only correct answer is to vote yes on the Right to IVF Act,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said shortly before the procedural vote. \"Protecting IVF should be the easiest 'yes' vote senators have taken all year. All this bill does is establish a nationwide right to IVF and eliminates barriers for millions of Americans who seek IVF to have kids.\"\n\nThe New York Democrat added, \"To my Republican colleagues who say they're pro-family, today's bill protecting IVF is as pro-family as it gets, and we should vote yes today. It is a contradiction to claim you are pro-family but then turn around and block protections for IVF.\"\n\nSoon after, the vast majority of GOP senators opposed the measure anyway. The vote came one day after the Southern Baptist Convention, the nation's largest and most politically powerful Protestant denomination, became the latest conservative institution to come out against in vitro fertilization.\n\nIf you're thinking this is shaping up to be an unexpected 2024 campaign issue, you're not alone.", "source": {"uri": "msnbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MSNBC.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_values", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Family values"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammy_Duckworth", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tammy Duckworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patty_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patty Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Murkowski", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lisa Murkowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unanimous_consent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unanimous consent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Collins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Susan Collins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Booker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cory Booker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maine"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maine"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Baptist_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southern Baptist Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Protestantism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Infertility", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Infertility", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family_Resources_and_Support", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family Resources and Support", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-06/240613-ivf-se-302p-ccb689.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9641932", "eventUri": "eng-9641932", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Over the following years, Judy suffered three ectopic pregnancies that left her unable to conceive the traditional way.\n\nThis was 40 years ago -- the earliest days of in vitro fertilization (IVF). At the end of 1980, only a handful of babies had been born via IVF worldwide, and none in the United States.\n\nThe Carrs were destined to have the first in America. After their difficulties conceiving, they came to innovative doctors Howard and Georgeanna Jones, who had opened a fertility clinic at Eastern Virginia Medical School after working with IVF pioneer Robert Edwards. On Dec. 28, 1981, Elizabeth Carr came into the world in Norfolk.\n\nThat day, Dr. Howard Jones told The Virginian-Pilot, \"I think this day is a day of hope.\"\n\nIn the four decades since her birth, millions of children have been born via IVF worldwide. The number of babies born via assisted reproductive technology (ART) in the U.S. has steadily increased, with more than 86,000 infants in 2021.\n\nIt was a shock to many when the Alabama Supreme Court in February, citing the Supreme Court's ruling overturning Roe v. Wade, held that embryos stored to get implanted in IVF procedures have the same rights as children -- and that any embryos that don't result in pregnancy and are destroyed could be considered murdered children under state law.\n\nThis ruling put an immediate halt to IVF in Alabama. Fertility treatments are often an expensive endeavor, and increased liability costs would put them further out of reach for many patients. Others would have to travel out-of-state to get fertility care.\n\nWhile the Alabama legislature has since taken some steps to protect IVF access in the state, this episode should be taken as a warning sign of things to come and a key reason to take steps at the federal level to protect ART procedures. That's why I've introduced the Right to IVF Act, a comprehensive bill which includes the Access to Family Building Act, a bill I cosponsored to establish a statutory right to access IVF.\n\nIn addition to making IVF treatment more accessible and affordable, the Right to IVF Act also includes the Veteran Families Health Services Act, legislation I cosponsored to enhance fertility treatment options for veterans and service members and expand service members' access to fertility services after an injury or illness.\n\nWomen with military service often struggle to conceive, including my colleague Sen. Tammy Duckworth, who has spoken poignantly about her 10-year journey to have a child which culminated in her having two children via IVF. The people who serve in our military protecting and defending our Constitution shouldn't have to face unnecessary additional barriers to starting families when they come home.\n\nIVF can provide servicemembers with the opportunity to balance their service to our country with their desire to start a family when and how they choose to do so. This bill would make sure our veterans have access to fertility care without needing to jump through a long series of hoops.\n\nUnfortunately, despite statements of support for IVF in the wake of the Alabama ruling, my Republican colleagues have already blocked the Access to Family Building Act this year. I hope that changes as the Right to IVF Act soon comes to the Senate floor for a vote -- especially as we approach the second anniversary of the Supreme Court striking down Roe's protections for reproductive rights and as more and more stories come to light about miscarrying women being turned away from hospitals, IVF clinics closing and far-right groups lobbying to ban contraceptives.\n\nElizabeth Carr, now a mother herself, wrote after the Alabama ruling, \"For the first time in my 42 years of life, I feel like an endangered species.\" I hope my colleagues will join me in passing the Right to IVF Act to ensure she isn't.", "source": {"uri": "pilotonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Virginian Pilot"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Jordan_Carr", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth Jordan Carr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fertility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgeanna_Seegar_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgeanna Seegar Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Virginia_Medical_School", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Virginia Medical School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Edwards_(physiologist)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert Edwards (physiologist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Virginian-Pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Virginian-Pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectopic_pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ectopic pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assisted reproductive technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Embryo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Norfolk, Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Norfolk, Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Alabama", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of Alabama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

Now that Roe is gone, they have set their sights to a new target -- in vitro fertilization,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor Thursday. \"So today, the question before the Senate is very simple. Do we agree that Americans should be free to use IVF if they want to, yes or no?\"\n\nSchumer, a New York Democrat, also held a vote last week on legislation to protect access to contraception, but Republicans blocked it, arguing it was nothing more than a political stunt. Republicans have also blocked previous attempts to quickly pass IVF protections. They stressed that they support IVF and said Schumer was once again playing to the campaign trail with Thursday's vote.\n\nDemocrats took to the Senate floor Thursday to make a series of speeches that highlighted personal stories of how people have been able to have children using IVF. They say Congress must protect access to the fertility treatment after the Supreme Court in 2022 allowed states to ban abortions and the Alabama Supreme Court in February ruled that frozen embryos can be considered children under state law. Several clinics in the state suspended IVF treatments until the state enacted a law to provide legal protections for IVF clinics.\n\nREAD MORE: Alabama clinic resumes IVF treatments under new law shielding providers from liability\n\n\"After the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that a frozen embryo is the same, has the exact same rights as a living, breathing person, women who waited for months and spent tens of thousands of dollars and were days away from an IVF appointment were left to wonder if it was all for nothing when their treatment was abruptly canceled,\" said Sen. Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat.\n\nSenate Democrats said it showed how all types of reproductive care could be upended in many parts of the country after Roe v. Wade was overturned.\n\nMost Republicans in Congress, meanwhile, have expressed support for IVF, but have also largely declined to tell states how to regulate reproductive care. Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican GOP presidential nominee, met with House lawmakers on Thursday morning and told them that abortion rules should be left to the states. He also said he supported exceptions for rape, incest and to save the life of the mother, according to Republicans in the meeting.\n\nRepublicans are seeking to come up with a response to voters' concerns about access to abortion and reproductive care -- an issue that is expected to figure largely in the November election. Following the Supreme Court's ruling Thursday that preserved access to the abortion pill mifepristone, anti-abortion groups expressed dismay while most Republicans remained quiet.\n\nIn the Senate this week, Republicans highlighted their efforts to expand access to fertility treatments, yet stopped short of endorsing the Democratic plan.\n\nSen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, said in a floor speech this week that his daughter was currently receiving IVF treatment and spoke of a proposal to expand the flexibility of health savings accounts. Two other GOP Republicans, Sens. Katie Britt of Alabama and Ted Cruz of Texas, also tried to quickly pass a bill that would threaten to withhold Medicaid funding for states where IVF is banned.\n\nDemocrats blocked that bill on Wednesday.\n\nCruz, who is running for reelection in Texas, said it showed Democrats were making a \"cynical political decision.\"\n\n\"They don't want to provide reassurance and comfort to millions of parents in America because instead, they want to spend millions of dollars running campaign ads suggesting the big, bad Republicans want to take away IVF,\" he said in a speech on the Senate floor.\n\nDemocrats argued that the GOP bill was insufficient because it would still allow states to enact laws that grant embryos or fetuses the same rights as a person. Abortion opponents in over a dozen states have advanced legislation based on the concept of fetal rights.\n\nWATCH: The role of fetal personhood in the anti-abortion movement and legislation\n\nSen. Patty Murray, the Washington Democrat who objected to quickly passing the GOP bill, dismissed it as \"nothing but a PR stunt.\"\n\nBut Republicans also criticized the Democratic bill. Britt said it \"extends far past IVF. It also treads on religious freedom and protection.\"\n\nIn the wake of the Alabama Supreme Court ruling, Christians, who have been a driving force in the anti-abortion movement based on the belief life begins at or around conception, have wrestled with the fertility treatment. The Southern Baptist Convention this week approved a nonbinding resolution that cautioned couples about using IVF.\n\nWith the Senate deadlocked on the issue, advocates for access to the treatment said families would be left in uncertainty.\n\nJamie Heard, who lives in Birmingham and had to suspend her effort to have a second child using IVF when the state Supreme Court made its decision, said the ruling left her both scared and angry. She has been able to continue the treatment, yet spoke alongside other IVF advocates at the Capitol Wednesday to urge lawmakers to act.\n\n\"There are still a lot of questions that we have about how to move forward,\" Heard said.", "source": {"uri": "pbs.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "PBS.org"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@pbs.org", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "stephen_groves@pbs.org", "name": "Stephen Groves", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammy_Duckworth", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tammy Duckworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assisted reproductive technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Alabama", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of Alabama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reproductive rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veteran", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Veteran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Embryo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

The resolution underscored the destruction of embryos as a key concern, reaffirming the church's stance on the sanctity of life. The decision reflects complex political dynamics post-Roe v. Wade.\n\nThe Southern Baptist Convention on Wednesday voted at its annual meeting to condemn the use of in vitro fertilization and commend its congregants who use alternative fertility therapies or adopt frozen embryos. With the vote on the use of in vitro fertilization, the largest Protestant denomination in the U.S. weighed in on an issue that conservatives across the United States have seen can have political pitfalls in the volatile landscape created by the overturning of Roe v. Wade two years ago.\n\nEarlier at the meeting at which issues affecting women have been prominent, a proposed amendment to the church's constitution that would have banned women as pastors fell just short of the two-thirds majority vote it needed to pass. The IVF resolution before the thousands of leaders gathered in Indianapolis noted the searing pain infertile couples encounter, but made plain that \"not all technological means of assisting human reproduction are equally God-honoring or morally justified.\"\n\nIVF involves combining eggs and sperm in a laboratory dish to create an embryo for couples having difficulty conceiving. The resolution states that the IVF process routinely creates more embryos than can reasonably be implanted and that naturally leads to the ultimate destruction of hundreds of thousands of frozen embryos, which the church considers sacred life.\n\nThe resolution called on \"Southern Baptists to reaffirm the unconditional value and right to life of every human being, including those in an embryonic stage, and to only utilize reproductive technologies consistent with that affirmation ...\" In February, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos should be considered children. The ruling arose from lawsuits by three families against Alabama fertility procedure providers accused of failing to properly safeguard frozen embryos, resulting in their destruction when a patient improperly accessed them.\n\nThe court ruling was based on an amendment to the Alabama state constitution approved by voters in 2018 that made it official policy to uphold \"the sanctity of unborn life and the rights of unborn children.\" The court ruling left unclear how to legally store, transport and use embryos. Democrats portrayed Alabama's all-Republican high court as bent on further restricting women's ability to make choices about reproduction following the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that toppled Roe, abolishing women's constitutional right to abortion.\n\nRepublicans faced backlash nationwide, even as some particularly conservative members of the party continued to question IVF procedures. In Alabama, the Republican-led state legislature passed measures aimed at protecting IVF providers from both criminal charges and civil lawsuits, and the Republican governor quickly signed them into law, prompting Alabama providers who had halted the IVF procedure following the court ruling to resume offering the treatment.\n\nIn Washington, Republican senators blocked Democrats' attempt to guarantee access to IVF treatments, saying the proposal went too far. In May, Brent Leatherwood, head of the Southern Baptist Convention's public policy Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, wrote U.S. senators to urge more robust oversight of the IVF process.\n\n\"A human embryo is a life. This life is as deserving of protection and all the standards of care we would give to a child or an adult,\" Leatherwood wrote. \"In the post-Roe moment we find ourselves in, we must make the most of this opportunity to stand for life in all its forms.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Baptist_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southern Baptist Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Embryo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fertility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

Following Alabama's Supreme Court ruling that embryos should be considered children, freezing embryos was disrupted, prompting new protective laws. IVF experts emphasize the benefits and complexities of embryo freezing.\n\nThe Southern Baptist Convention voted Wednesday to\n\ncondemn the use of in vitro fertilization and commend congregants who use alternative fertility therapies or adopt frozen embryos.\n\nIn February, the practice of freezing embryos was thrown into chaos in Alabama. The state supreme court ruled that such embryos should be considered children, exposing clinics to wrongful death claims in the event they are destroyed in the thawing process. The state later passed a law protecting IVF and allowing clinics to resume operations. In 2021, more than 80% of U.S. IVF procedures involved the transfer of frozen embryos, according to a recent report by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nUndermining use of frozen embryos in IVF would introduce many uncertainties, delays and possible additional expenses, according to fertility experts. Here is what you need to know about the process and its benefits: HOW IS EMBRYO FREEZING USED IN IVF?\n\nIVF uses high doses of hormones to stimulate ovaries to produce as many eggs as possible. Once the eggs are extracted, the most mature are selected for attempts at fertilization with sperm. Over the next five to six days, healthy fertilized eggs grow into blastocysts - the earliest stage of embryo - containing roughly 100-200 cells. Blastocysts can be transferred into the uterus or frozen to be thawed for later use.\n\nAfter transfer into the uterus, if all goes well, the blastocyst implants itself in the wall of the womb and continues to grow. Typically, if 20 eggs are retrieved after ovarian stimulation, about 16 will be mature, about 12 of those will fertilize when combined with sperm, and perhaps six will grow into healthy blastocysts with good potential for implanting and resulting in a successful pregnancy, said Dr. Zev Williams, chief of the division of reproductive endocrinology and infertility at Columbia University Fertility Center in New York.\n\nWHAT ARE SOME BENEFITS OF USING FROZEN EMBRYOS IN IVF? For some patients, freezing embryos and then waiting several weeks before a transfer into the uterus is more likely to lead to successful implantation, depending on their age, underlying health or hormone levels.\n\nThe pause allows the body's hormone levels to normalize following ovarian stimulation. It also reduces the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, a potentially life-threatening effect of intense hormone use. More broadly, freezing embryos often means that only one course of painful, expensive ovarian stimulation and egg retrieval is needed. If an embryo transfer fails, additional embryos can be thawed and used.\n\nPregnancies with twins or triplets were more common with IVF before embryo freezing, as doctors would transfer more than one embryo at a time to increase the chances of a successful pregnancy. Freezing of embryos also allows patients to preserve fertility in advance of chemotherapy or other treatments that can damage the reproductive organs.\n\nGenetic screening of embryos before a transfer is only possible with freezing because it can take several weeks to get results. It is often employed when there is a history of recurrent miscarriages, previous IVF failures and maternal age over 35 or a family history of genetic diseases. WHAT IF FREEZING EMBRYOS FOR IVF BECAME UNAVAILABLE?\n\nThe loss of the option to freeze embryos for later usage would represent a significant setback for the field, said Dr. Steven Spandorfer of Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City, president of the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology. A single pregnancy is the best way to promote the birth of a healthy child after IVF, so clinics are unlikely to return to the practice of transferring multiple embryos into the womb, Spandorfer said.\n\nClinics could freeze eggs instead of embryos, but that approach has many limitations that would lower the overall success of IVF. The viability of those eggs would not be clear until they are individually thawed and IVF is attempted, creating the potential for delayed embryo transfers and the need for additional hormone use and retrievals.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Baptist_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southern Baptist Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Egg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Embryo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uterus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fertility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blastocyst", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Blastocyst"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hormone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implantation_(embryology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Implantation (embryology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovulation_induction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ovulation induction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sperm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Health and Human Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_endocrinology_and_infertility", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reproductive endocrinology and infertility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ovary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_hyperstimulation_syndrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transvaginal_oocyte_retrieval", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transvaginal oocyte retrieval"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo_transfer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Embryo transfer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_maternal_age", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advanced maternal age"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cornell University"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Cryobiology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Cryobiology", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Agrochemicals", "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Agrochemicals", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Infertility", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Infertility", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Developmental_Biology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Developmental Biology", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/11_06_2024_16_36_15_4479616.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9641932", "eventUri": "eng-9641932", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

The meeting also narrowly missed banning women as pastors. The resolution emphasized the sanctity of embryos, influenced by recent political and legal changes post-Roe v. Wade.\n\nThe Southern Baptist Convention on Wednesday voted at its annual meeting to condemn the use of in vitro fertilization and commend its congregants who use alternative fertility therapies or adopt frozen embryos. Earlier at the meeting, a proposed amendment to the church's constitution that would have banned women as pastors fell just short of the two-thirds majority vote it needed to pass.\n\nWith the vote on the use of in vitro fertilization, or IVF, the largest Protestant denomination in the U.S. weighed in on an issue that conservatives across the U.S. have seen can have political pitfalls in the volatile landscape created by the overturning of Roe v. Wade two years ago. The IVF resolution before the thousands of leaders gathered in Indianapolis noted the searing pain infertile couples encounter, but made plain that \"not all technological means of assisting human reproduction are equally God-honoring or morally justified.\"\n\nThe SBC is the largest Protestant denomination in the U.S., with over 50,000 churches and over 14 million faithful, and has become a political force in recent decades. IVF involves combining eggs and sperm in a laboratory dish to create an embryo for couples having difficulty conceiving.\n\nThe resolution states that the IVF process routinely creates more embryos than can reasonably be implanted and that naturally leads to the ultimate destruction of hundreds of thousands of frozen embryos, which the church considers sacred life. The resolution called on \"Southern Baptists to reaffirm the unconditional value and right to life of every human being, including those in an embryonic stage, and to only utilize reproductive technologies consistent with that affirmation.\"\n\nIn February, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos should be considered children. The ruling arose from lawsuits by three families against Alabama fertility procedure providers accused of failing to properly safeguard frozen embryos, resulting in their destruction when a patient improperly accessed them. The court ruling was based on an amendment to the Alabama state constitution approved by voters in 2018 that made it official policy to uphold \"the sanctity of unborn life and the rights of unborn children.\" The court ruling left unclear how to legally store, transport and use embryos.\n\nDemocrats portrayed Alabama's all-Republican high court as bent on further restricting women's ability to make choices about reproduction following the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that toppled Roe, abolishing women's constitutional right to abortion. Republicans faced backlash nationwide, even as some particularly conservative members of the party continued to question IVF procedures.\n\nIn Alabama, the Republican-led state legislature passed measures aimed at protecting IVF providers from both criminal charges and civil lawsuits, and the Republican governor quickly signed them into law, prompting Alabama providers who had halted the IVF procedure following the court ruling to resume offering the treatment. In Washington, Republican senators blocked Democrats' attempt to guarantee access to IVF treatments, saying the proposal went too far.\n\nIn May, Brent Leatherwood, head of the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, wrote U.S. senators to urge more robust oversight of the IVF process. \"A human embryo is a life. This life is as deserving of protection and all the standards of care we would give to a child or an adult,\" Leatherwood wrote. \"In the post-Roe moment we find ourselves in, we must make the most of this opportunity to stand for life in all its forms.\"\n\nFEMALE PASTORS The proposed constitutional change banning women pastors, known as the Law Amendment, had been approved during last year's annual meeting. By church rules, any such change must be approved at two consecutive annual meetings, and this year it was approved by 61.45% of church leaders who voted - short of the 2/3 majority required.\n\nThe denomination has in recent annual meetings voted that individual churches that have female leaders were no longer in \"friendly cooperation\" with the organization, citing the denomination's doctrine and scriptures as indicating that only men can lead a church. The over 10,000 church leaders - known as \"messengers\" - attending the meeting and voting on an array of issues, fell just short of officially changing the SBC's constitution to assert that a church can only employ \"men as any kind of pastor or elder as qualified by the scripture.\"\n\nIndividual Baptist churches are largely autonomous, typically locally own their own facilities and make their own decisions on how to worship.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Baptist_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southern Baptist Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_denomination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Christian denomination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Embryo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pastor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fertility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

The battle over IVF in 2024.", "body": "Nearly two years after the Supreme Court overturned the right to an abortion, access to in vitro fertilization could be at risk.\n\nIVF is the process of combining a sperm and egg in a laboratory and transferring them to a uterus, commonly used to aid conception for someone with fertility issues. Advocates for the treatment were worried that access to the treatment could come under threat after the Dobbs decision in June 2022.\n\nThat fear was somewhat realized in February when the Alabama Supreme Court decided embryos had the legal status of children in a landmark case. Since then, IVF has taken the spotlight in the fight for reproductive rights.\n\nHere is a look back at key moments for IVF access this year:\n\nMore: Supreme Court preserves access to widely used abortion medication mifepristone\n\nApproximately 2% of births in the U.S. each year come from IVF pregnancies, and it can be a life changing procedure for people experiencing infertility who want to start a family.\n\nBut the procedure is opposed by some religious groups, many conservative Christians, who argue that life begins the moment an egg is fertilized and that humans should leave procreation to God not science.\n\nWhen the first IVF baby was born in 1979, a coalition of anti-abortion groups spoke out against the procedure. But that was after the Roe v. Wade decision, so embryos were treated as private property that the respective egg and sperm donors could decide if they wanted to implant, destroy or pass on the embryo without consequence.\n\nOn Wednesday, Delegates at the Southern Baptist Convention approved a resolution condemning IVF.\n\nIt is a non-binding proclamation that calls on followers to only support reproductive methodologies that affirm the \"unconditional value and right to life of every human being, including those in an embryonic stage.\"\n\nDebate on the floor about the measure was fraught, but the vote could signal similar measures throughout other conservative denominations.\n\nMore: Southern Baptists condemn use of IVF in high-profile debate over reproductive rights\n\nThe Southern Baptists resolution comes in the wake of a February decision from the Alabama Supreme Court that frozen embryos could be legally treated as children.\n\nThe court sided with two couples who sued after their frozen embryos stored in liquid nitrogen were accidentally destroyed. The Alabama high court invoked Christian faith and the Alabama Constitution in their decision which determined they were \"extrauterine children.\" Justices acknowledged the decision could reshape or halt IVF, and major providers temporarily stopped providing the procedure.\n\nThe Alabama legislature later passed a bill to protect IVF patients and providers.\n\nBut the decision stoked concerns over fetal personhood arguments, which carried into other states despite outcry from both Democrats and Republicans.\n\nAccording to the Guttmacher Institute, 23 bills seeking to ban abortion by establishing fetal personhood were introduced in 13 different states in 2024 so far, but none passed even one chamber.\n\nOne of those bills in Florida would have allowed a parent to sue for damages in a wrongful death suit of an \"unborn child.\" The bill was sidelined in the wake of Alabama's decision, as the bill sponsor acknowledged there was still \"work that needs to be done.\"\n\nHere are other states where abortion bans by fetal personhood were introduced in 2024:\n\nTen states, including Alabama, introduced bills to protect IVF providers and patients after the Alabama decision, according to a report by the Guttmacher Institute.\n\nIn the weeks after the Alabama ruling, Sen.

There's a hidden compartment in my jewelry box that, for as long as I can remember, has held pieces with sentimental value -- my first locket, the Pinocchio watch I learned to tell time on and my half of the BFF necklace I shared with my elementary school friend. I'd kept them for decades because I had always hoped that one day I would give them to my daughter. Motherhood was a part of my identity even before I met my husband. My daughter wouldn't be here today without access to IVF, as we are one of the millions of families that required assistance to conceive and bring a child into this world.\n\nThat's why this week, I traveled from my home state of New York to Washington, DC, where I shared my story and advocated in support of the Right to IVF Act, which Senate Republicans blocked in a vote on Thursday. The act would have established a clear and enforceable nationwide right to receive or provide IVF services. It would also have made IVF treatment more affordable by mandating insurance coverage under employer-sponsored insurance and certain public plans while expanding coverage for millions of Americans, including veterans and those serving in the military. Access to IVF is a lifeline for countless Americans who want to build their families, as it was for me.\n\nChances are you or someone you know has experienced infertility -- roughly 1 in 6 people worldwide do. Despite the widespread need for medical assistance to build a family, access to affordable care is inconsistent and unattainable for many. My own path to motherhood was a tremendous struggle, both emotionally and financially. But it's not only a highly personal matter; it's critical to the future of our country. The United States' birth rate is declining at an alarming rate, down 2% last year. Birth statistics show babies are being born to older mothers. Many people are delaying starting their families until after they have established their careers, and fertility declines as women enter their 30s. An aging and shrinking population raises concerns about a sufficient workforce to support elder care and pay into Social Security.\n\nInfertility impacts Americans on both sides of aisle and the ability to access this medical assistance should be met with bipartisan support, particularly given the widespread backing for IVF and insurance coverage for fertility treatments. And yet Senate Republicans opposed the Right to IVF Act, deeming it unnecessary overreach and a political show vote.\n\nSome GOP lawmakers argue that life begins at conception. This is the same premise that underpinned the Alabama Supreme Court ruling that embryos used in IVF are children and that those who destroy them can be held liable for wrongful death -- a decision that threw fertility patients in limbo before the swift backlash led Republican lawmakers in the state to back a law aimed at protecting IVF patients. But this line of thinking is still common among certain groups. Just yesterday, Southern Baptists voted to condemn IVF procedures.\n\nRepublican lawmakers should instead listen to their constituents and join Democratic Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and Patty Murray of Washington -- who introduced the Right to IVF Act -- to provide more support for IVF.\n\nAs of 2023, only 21 states and Washington, DC, had enacted laws requiring at least some insurance coverage for infertility services. Most plans that include coverage have limitations. In my home state of New York, coverage is only mandated for large corporate plans. Tricare, the plan that provides health insurance for military members and their families -- covering more than 10 million people -- doesn't cover assisted reproductive technology services, including IVF. The Affordable Care Act defines 10 essential health benefits that must be covered, including pregnancy, maternity and newborn care. However, assisted reproductive care is excluded.\n\nWe should support Americans who want children, and no one should have to choose between financial security and building a family. I know firsthand how difficult it can be. My husband and I went through several rounds of IVF, which drained our savings account because it wasn't covered by our corporate health care plan at the time. By our fourth round of IVF, I had a new job with a company based out of Seattle that offered IVF coverage. It's because of that coverage that we were able to try one more time. That last round brought us our daughter, Carolina, who will be [six] years old next month.\n\nIf you're someone, especially a Republican, who cares about this matter, I urge you to reach out to your elected representatives and express your support for the Right to IVF Act. Give your fellow Americans the joy of hearing the four words that mean everything to me: \"I love you, Mommy.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Democrats who supported the bill said that in a post-Dobbs-decision America, other types of reproductive services are now being targeted.\n\nIn February, Alabama's Supreme Court ruled embryos created through IVF would be considered children, making destroying unused or unsuccessful embryos a crime. While Alabama state lawmakers passed a bill to protect providers - allowing IVF procedures to continue - many Democratic legislators, like Wisconsin U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin, said this was only the beginning.\n\n\"This shows just how quickly this freedom could be ripped away,\" Baldwin said.\n\nBefore the vote on Thursday, Baldwin held a press call explaining the act. She said it would have created an enforceable right to revive, provide, or cover IVF services while making it more affordable.\n\n\"Many people have said that we are being alarmist when we said the ramifications of the Dobbs decision would go far beyond abortion care but look no further than the state of Alabama to see that we were not being alarmist,\" she said.\n\nBaldwin was joined by two Wisconsin women who successfully had children through IVF. Jamie Haynes said she was grateful for the family she was able to create through the process.\n\n\"IVF was a huge beacon of hope that someday I was going to become a parent,\" she said. \"It's truly the only reason we have our two children. Without science and IVF, they would not be here, and they are my dream come true.\"\n\nThe procedural vote was likely to fail due to GOP opposition, with some Republicans calling it a \"political show vote\" by Democrats. The bill needed 60 votes to advance and failed by a vote of 48-47.\n\nBefore voting to block the act, all 49 U.S. Senate Republicans signed a joint statement about it.\n\nThe senators wrote, \"Senate Democrats have embraced a Summer of Scare Tactics -- a partisan campaign of false fearmongering intended to mislead and confuse the American people.

Tammy Duckworth, a military veteran who has used fertility treatment to have her two children, has championed the bill, called the Right to IVF Act. The bill would also expand access through insurance as well as for military members and veterans.\n\n\"These are real solutions that would help tens of thousands of Americans every year build the families of their dreams,\" Duckworth, D-Ill., said this week.\n\nBut most Republicans were expected to vote against advancing the measure, instead offering their own, alternative legislation that would discourage states from enacting outright bans on the treatment. Democrats in turn blocked it Wednesday.\n\nThe overtly political back-and-forth, with no attempt at finding a legislative compromise, showed how quickly Congress has shifted into a campaign mindset five months out from the fall election.\n\nAs Schumer seeks to protect a narrow Senate majority and buoy Democrats' hopes of holding the White House, he has sought to spotlight Republican intransigence to federal legislation that would guarantee women's rights to reproductive care. Democrats have campaigned heavily on the issue ever since the 2022 Supreme Court decision that ended a federal right to abortion.\n\n\"The anti-abortion movement is not yet finished. Now that Roe is gone, they have set their sights to a new target -- in vitro fertilization,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor Thursday. \"So today, the question before the Senate is very simple. Do we agree that Americans should be free to use IVF if they want to, yes or no?\"\n\nSchumer, a New York Democrat, also held a vote last week on legislation to protect access to contraception, but Republicans blocked it, arguing it was nothing more than a political stunt. Republicans have also blocked previous attempts to quickly pass IVF protections. They stressed that they support IVF and said Schumer was once again playing to the campaign trail with Thursday's vote.\n\nDemocrats took to the Senate floor Thursday to make a series of speeches that highlighted personal stories of how people have been able to have children using IVF. They say it is necessary for Congress to protect access to fertility treatment after the Supreme Court in 2022 allowed states to ban abortions and the Alabama Supreme Court in February ruled that frozen embryos can be considered children under state law. Several clinics in the state suspended IVF treatments until the state enacted a law to provide legal protections for IVF clinics.\n\n\"After the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that a frozen embryo is the same, has the exact same rights as a living, breathing person, women who waited for months and spent tens of thousands of dollars and were days away from an IVF appointment were left to wonder if it was all for nothing when their treatment was abruptly canceled,\" said Sen. Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat.\n\nSenate Democrats said it showed how all types of reproductive care could be upended in many parts of the country after Roe v. Wade was overturned.\n\nMost Republicans in Congress, meanwhile, have expressed support for IVF, but have also largely declined to tell states how to regulate reproductive care. Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican GOP presidential nominee, met with House lawmakers on Thursday morning and told them that abortion rules should be left to the states. He also said he supported exceptions for rape, incest and to save the life of the mother, according to Republicans in the meeting.\n\nRepublicans are seeking to come up with a response to voters' concerns about access to abortion and reproductive care -- an issue that is expected to figure largely in the November election. Following the Supreme Court's ruling Thursday that preserved access to the abortion pill mifepristone, anti-abortion groups expressed dismay while most Republicans remained quiet.\n\nIn the Senate this week, Republicans highlighted their efforts to expand access to fertility treatments, yet stopped short of endorsing the Democratic plan.\n\nSen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, said in a floor speech this week that his daughter was currently receiving IVF treatment and spoke of a proposal to expand the flexibility of health savings accounts. Two other GOP Republicans, Sens. Katie Britt of Alabama and Ted Cruz of Texas, also tried to quickly pass a bill that would threaten to withhold Medicaid funding for states where IVF is banned.\n\nDemocrats blocked that bill on Wednesday.\n\nCruz, who is running for reelection in Texas, said it showed Democrats were making a \"cynical political decision.\"\n\n\"They don't want to provide reassurance and comfort to millions of parents in America because instead, they want to spend millions of dollars running campaign ads suggesting the big, bad Republicans want to take away IVF,\" he said in a speech on the Senate floor.\n\nDemocrats argued that the GOP bill was insufficient because it would still allow states to enact laws that grant embryos or fetuses the same rights as a person. Abortion opponents in over a dozen states have advanced legislation based on the concept of fetal rights.\n\nSen. Patty Murray, the Washington Democrat who objected to quickly passing the GOP bill, dismissed it as \"nothing but a PR stunt.\"\n\nBut Republicans also criticized the Democratic bill. Britt said it \"extends far past IVF. It also treads on religious freedom and protection.\"\n\nIn the wake of the Alabama Supreme Court ruling, Christians, who have been a driving force in the anti-abortion movement based on the belief life begins at or around conception, have wrestled with the fertility treatment. The Southern Baptist Convention this week approved a nonbinding resolution that cautioned couples about using IVF.\n\nWith the Senate deadlocked on the issue, advocates for access to the treatment said families would be left in uncertainty.\n\nJamie Heard, who lives in Birmingham and had to suspend her effort to have a second child using IVF when the state Supreme Court made its decision, said the ruling left her both scared and angry. She has been able to continue the treatment, yet spoke alongside other IVF advocates at the Capitol Wednesday to urge lawmakers to act.\n\n\"There are still a lot of questions that we have about how to move forward,\" Heard said.", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammy_Duckworth", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tammy Duckworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assisted reproductive technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Alabama", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of Alabama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

At the press conference today, Senator Murray spoke about the importance of the legislation to expand access and bring down the cost of IVF, especially in light of continued Republican attacks on IVF and reproductive health care at large. Access to IVF is overwhelmingly popular: 86% of Americans, including 89% of Democrats, 85% of independents, and 86% of Republicans, support continued access to IVF. High-quality video of today's virtual press conference is available HERE.\n\nIn 2021, approximately 2.6 percent of babies born in Washington state were conceived through assisted reproductive technology; slightly higher than the nationwide average of approximately 2.3 percent. Costs for a single cycle of IVF range from $15,000 to $20,000 and can exceed $30,000. The average number of cycles needed to become pregnant from IVF is 2.5, meaning that the cost to conceive successfully through IVF can easily exceed $40,000. Washington state is one of 29 states that does not require private insurance issuers to cover any fertility services, and as a result, many families who need these vital services simply don't have access. The Right to IVF Act would change this -- helping more middle-class Americans afford critical fertility treatments that have, for far too long, been out of reach.\n\n\"Tomorrow we are going to be holding a vote to put every single Republican Senator on the record as to whether they genuinely support IVF. We cannot pretend this threat isn't real -- not after what happened in Alabama. I know folks in Washington state are deeply concerned that, unless we take action -- that may well just be the start,\" said Senator Murray. \"The fact of the matter is, Republicans have a bill right now that would enshrine into national law the idea that a frozen embryo is the same -- has the exact same rights -- as a living, breathing, human person. In other words, a bill that would take the chaos like we saw in Alabama nationwide, and jeopardize IVF access everywhere -- including in Washington state.\"\n\n\"I am really glad to be joined by Dr. Ryan, who has a firsthand perspective on why getting patients access to IVF is important and what sort of threat fetal personhood poses. We are not going to let anyone off the hook at just saying they support IVF -- not when there is so much at stake for families. Instead, every Senator is going to go on the record, and put down their vote on the Right to IVF Act, and show whether they will work to pass a serious bill to protect, and expand, IVF access for patients. Families, providers, and people across the country will be watching closely,\" Murray continued.\n\n\"I love being a Washingtonian and recognize how fortunate my patients are to have a champion in Senator Murray. Leading this charge to protect IVF and assure patients can access the reproductive healthcare they need is just the latest effort in her long fight to promote health care for all of us,\" said Dr. Ryan.\n\nBuilding on the lawmakers' previous efforts to protect and strengthen access to IVF, this pro-family, pro-freedom legislative package includes:\n\nSenator Murray and Duckworth's Access to Family Building Act, which would establish a nationwide right for patients to access IVF and other assisted reproductive technology (ART) services, a right for doctors to provide IVF treatment in accordance with medical standards as well as a right for insurance carriers to cover IVF without prohibition, limitation, interference or impediment. By establishing a statutory right, this would pre-empt any state effort to limit such access and ensuring no hopeful parent -- or their doctors -- are punished for trying to start or grow a family.\n\nIn February, Senator Duckworth sought unanimous consent to pass this legislation and Republican U.S. Senator of Mississippi Cindy Hyde-Smith blocked it.\n\nSenator Murray's Veteran Families Health Services Act, which would expand the fertility treatments and family-building services that are covered under servicemembers' and veterans' health care to include -- among other things -- the option for individuals to cryopreserve their gametes (freeze their eggs or sperm) ahead of deployment to a combat zone and IVF for servicemembers and veterans who are unable to conceive without assistance.\n\nIn March, Senator Murray sought unanimous consent to pass this legislation and Republican U.S. Senator of Oklahoma James Lankford blocked it.\n\nSenator Booker's Access to Infertility Treatment and Care Act, which would increase the affordability of fertility care -- including IVF -- by requiring employer-sponsored insurance plans and other public insurance plans to cover fertility treatments. Additionally, it would standardize a baseline of high-quality fertility treatment coverage under private health insurance plans, while protecting Americans against excessive out-of-pocket costs.\n\nSenator Duckworth's Family Building FEHB Fairness Act, which would require health insurers in the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program -- the largest employer-sponsored health insurance plan in the world -- to cover IVF and ART to help more hardworking Americans start and grow their families.\n\nA summary of the bill can be found HERE.\n\nSenator Murray's full remarks, as delivered, are below:\n\n\"Tomorrow we are going to be holding a vote to put every single Republican Senator on the record as to whether they genuinely support IVF and want to make sure we avoid more heartbreak and chaos like we saw earlier this year.\n\n\"We cannot pretend this threat isn't real -- not after what happened in Alabama.\n\n\"But I know folks in Washington state are deeply concerned that, unless we take action -- that may well just be the start!\n\n\"Because the fact of the matter is, Republicans have a bill right now that would enshrine into national law the idea that a frozen embryo is the same -- has the exact same rights -- as a living, breathing, human person.\n\n\"In other words -- a bill that would take the chaos like we saw in Alabama nationwide, and jeopardize IVF access everywhere -- including in Washington state.\n\n\"This is not some fringe bill either -- the Life at Conception Act has the support of half of the House Republicans! Including the Speaker of the House, and including some Republicans who claim to support IVF!\n\n\"That just does not add up. IVF and fetal personhood laws are fundamentally incompatible.\n\n\"That's why we are holding a vote tomorrow that will put every single Senator on the record as to whether they actually want to protect IVF and whether they actually want to help people get it.\n\n\"Our bill is the Right to IVF Act. It protects the right to IVF nationally, and lowers the cost of IVF for families with stronger insurance coverage requirements. And it includes my law to make sure more veterans and servicemembers can access the IVF services that they need.\n\n\"As we discuss these issues, I am really glad to be joined by Dr. Ryan, who has a firsthand perspective on why getting patients access to IVF is important and what sort of threat fetal personhood poses.\n\n\"IVF is already painfully expensive, and inaccessible, for too many families.\n\n\"That's why it is so important we pass legislation that protects IVF care from new restrictions and bans, and will help make sure this care is more affordable to families.\n\n\"When you talk to any who has gone through IVF, or who is hoping to go through it, it is clear how important this is to people. It is personal. It is emotional.\n\n\"It is their entire hopes for growing their family.\n\n\"We need to be taking down barriers like cost -- and not letting anyone put up new, completely unnecessary restrictions.\n\n\"So we are not going to let anyone off the hook at just saying they support IVF -- not when there is so much at stake for our families.\n\n\"Instead, every Senator is going to go on the record, and put down their vote on the Right to IVF Act -- and show whether they will work to pass a serious bill to protect, and expand, IVF access for patients.\n\n\"And families, providers, and people across the country will be watching closely.\n\n\"It is my pleasure to turn it over to Dr. Ginny Ryan, who knows better than anyone exactly why IVF is a medical procedure that has to be protected.\"", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi

Once the embryo grows, it is implanted into the uterus and results in pregnancy.\n\nSenator Schumer brought the Right to IVF Act to the Senate floor for a vote Thursday afternoon, where it failed to pass with 48 votes in favor to 47 opposed. The legislation needed 60 votes to pass.\n\nSchumer says the Right to IVF Act focuses on increasing access to IVF services, including making treatment more affordable. He says everybody knows someone who has been impacted by IVF.\n\n\"This is deeply personal to me. I've seen the miracle of IVF in my own family.

The state supreme court ruled that such embryos should be considered children, exposing clinics to wrongful death claims in the event they are destroyed in the thawing process. The state later passed a law protecting IVF and allowing clinics to resume operations.\n\nIn 2021, more than 80% of U.S. IVF procedures involved the transfer of frozen embryos, according to a recent report by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nUndermining use of frozen embryos in IVF would introduce many uncertainties, delays and possible additional expenses, according to fertility experts. Here is what you need to know about the process and its benefits:\n\nHOW IS EMBRYO FREEZING USED IN IVF?\n\nIVF uses high doses of hormones to stimulate ovaries to produce as many eggs as possible. Once the eggs are extracted, the most mature are selected for attempts at fertilization with sperm.\n\nOver the next five to six days, healthy fertilized eggs grow into blastocysts - the earliest stage of embryo - containing roughly 100-200 cells. Blastocysts can be transferred into the uterus or frozen to be thawed for later use.\n\nAfter transfer into the uterus, if all goes well, the blastocyst implants itself in the wall of the womb and continues to grow.\n\nTypically, if 20 eggs are retrieved after ovarian stimulation, about 16 will be mature, about 12 of those will fertilize when combined with sperm, and perhaps six will grow into healthy blastocysts with good potential for implanting and resulting in a successful pregnancy, said Dr. Zev Williams, chief of the division of reproductive endocrinology and infertility at Columbia University Fertility Center in New York.\n\nWHAT ARE SOME BENEFITS OF USING FROZEN EMBRYOS IN IVF?\n\nFor some patients, freezing embryos and then waiting several weeks before a transfer into the uterus is more likely to lead to successful implantation, depending on their age, underlying health or hormone levels.\n\nThe pause allows the body's hormone levels to normalize following ovarian stimulation. It also reduces the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, a potentially life-threatening effect of intense hormone use.\n\nMore broadly, freezing embryos often means that only one course of painful, expensive ovarian stimulation and egg retrieval is needed. If an embryo transfer fails, additional embryos can be thawed and used.\n\nPregnancies with twins or triplets were more common with IVF before embryo freezing, as doctors would transfer more than one embryo at a time to increase the chances of a successful pregnancy.\n\nFreezing of embryos also allows patients to preserve fertility in advance of chemotherapy or other treatments that can damage the reproductive organs.\n\nGenetic screening of embryos before a transfer is only possible with freezing because it can take several weeks to get results. It is often employed when there is a history of recurrent miscarriages, previous IVF failures and maternal age over 35 or a family history of genetic diseases.\n\nWHAT IF FREEZING EMBRYOS FOR IVF BECAME UNAVAILABLE?\n\nThe loss of the option to freeze embryos for later usage would represent a significant setback for the field, said Dr. Steven Spandorfer of Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City, president of the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology.\n\nA single pregnancy is the best way to promote the birth of a healthy child after IVF, so clinics are unlikely to return to the practice of transferring multiple embryos into the womb, Spandorfer said.\n\nClinics could freeze eggs instead of embryos, but that approach has many limitations that would lower the overall success of IVF.\n\nThe viability of those eggs would not be clear until they are individually thawed and IVF is attempted, creating the potential for delayed embryo transfers and the need for additional hormone use and retrievals.

Sign up for the Morning Memo newsletter\n\nSenate Democrats are continuing their efforts to put their colleagues across the aisle on record for their unwillingness to support reproductive rights in the wake of the Supreme Court's Dobbs ruling, which opened the door to a flood of state-level abortion bans. Last week, Democrats brought forward a bill to protect access to contraception. This week it will be a bill to protect access to in vitro fertilization.\n\nIn response, Republicans have clung to two legislative gambits of their own that they say are just as good. Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) offered a simple resolution demonstrating the Senate's \"support for Americans who are starting and growing families through in vitro fertilization.\" Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Katie Britt (R-AL) put forward a bill that would make states ineligible to receive Medicaid funding if they ban IVF.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, Cruz asked for unanimous consent to pass that bill.\n\nAhead of the vote, Cruz, somewhat comically, tried to frame it as an effort to get Democrats on the record on IVF, seemingly one upping them by getting his bill on the floor quicker.\n\n\"Understand, if the remarks end with the words 'I object' than Senate Democrats will have made the cynical political decision that Democrats don't want IVF protected in federal law ... because instead they want to spend millions of dollars running campaign ads suggesting the big bad Republicans want to take away IVF,\" Cruz said on the Senate floor.\n\nSen. Patty Murray (D-WA) blocked the Republican bill, calling it a \"PR tool.\"\n\n\"[This is] just another way for Republicans to pretend they are not the extremists that they keep proving they are,\" Murray said on the Senate floor as she objected to unanimous consent.\n\n\"The bill allows for states to push for regulations that could severely reduce the standard of care for IVF treatment, such as restrictions on how many embryos are created and what individuals can do with these embryos -- decisions that should only be made between patients and their doctors, based on science and clinical guidelines,\" she added of the Cruz-Britt bill.\n\nThe Senate is expected to take up a procedural vote on Democrats' Right to IVF Act, a bill that would protect and expand nationwide access to fertility treatment, including in vitro fertilization, on Thursday. Democrats will need 60 votes to overcome the filibuster and proceed to a vote. But just like they did in last week's contraception vote, Senate Republicans are expected to block the consideration of the bill.\n\nAhead of Thursday's vote, they tried to walk a fine line -- claiming they support access to IVF while squirming to find ways to explain away why they will not be supporting the Democrats' bill.\n\n\"I think it serves no useful purpose other than partisan politics,\" Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) told reporters Wednesday morning when asked about the IVF bill.\n\n\"IVF is legal everywhere,\" Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) told reporters, dismissing a question about what parts of the Democrat bill he does not support.\n\nDuring an election year, where reproductive rights have taken center stage as a mobilizing issue among so many voters, following the playbook of getting Senate Republicans on the record refusing to support issues related to reproductive rights is a purposeful choice on Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and the Democratic leaderships part.\n\nBut it does much more than just that. It also opens up a window into the way in which support for the concept of fetal personhood, post Dobbs, has caught Republicans between a rock and a hard place, as evidenced by the party's shambolic response to an Alabama state Supreme Court ruling earlier this year that shut down IVF treatment in the state.\n\nSome Republican senators TPM spoke with Wednesday leaned hard on the why protect something that is not endangered? argument that Scott advanced.\n\nThat argument of course is downplaying how quickly, just like when Roe v. Wade was overturned, Americans can lose their right to access IVF. The Alabama ruling was an example: it found that stored embryos can be afforded the same legal protections as children under the Wrongful Death of Minor Act of 1872, the first decision of its kind but, potentially, not the last.\n\nThe outcry in response to that state Supreme Court decision led to state legislators passing a law that provided civil and criminal immunity to IVF providers. But during the two weeks between the court's decision to the passage of the legislation, many in the state were unable to access IVF treatment.\n\nWhen pressed on why he would not support Democrats' IVF bill, Scott claimed to TPM that Democrats were \"taking away religious freedoms,\" an argument advanced earlier this year by the Heritage Foundation and other conservative groups, which expressed concern that Democrats' IVF bill would force religious institutions to provide IVF coverage for employees even if it goes against their beliefs.\n\nSen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) pushed that argument, too, saying he supports IVF but not the Democrats' bill.\n\n\"The Democrat bill is not about IVF, it's about repealing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act,\" Hawley claimed to TPM. \"It seems to me like there's some other agenda,\" he intoned, \"It's like an anti-religious agenda at work.\"\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) also echoed that sentiment when asked about the bill.\n\n\"The [Democrat] bill very deliberately attacks religious liberty and forces people and organizations that have their own religious objections to IVF to participate,\" Cruz told TPM. \"That's not right. What we should do is protect IVF for anyone who wants it, but we shouldn't force it on people who have religious objections to it.\"\n\nThe issue is a fraught one for Republicans, who are caught between appearing to support IVF -- as most Americans do -- and opposition to the procedure from their Christian conservative base. As if to underscore the dynamic, the Southern Baptist Convention, a powerful evangelical organization, voted to condemn IVF on Wednesday.\n\n\"This isn't about religion, it's about control,\" Colin Seeberger, senior advisor at The Center for American Progress Action, told TPM in a statement, addressing Republican refusal to support Democrats' bill. \"Senate Republicans want to weaponize religion to give a license for states to strip people of the freedom to grow their families as they so desire.\"", "source": {"uri": "talkingpointsmemo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Talking Points Memo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emine_yucel@talkingpointsmemo.com", "name": "Emine Y\u00fccel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Cruz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ted Cruz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Points_Memo", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Talking Points Memo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unanimous_consent", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Unanimous consent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rick Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reproductive rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patty_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Patty Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Embryo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Birth control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Britt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Katie Britt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medicaid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abortion law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personhood", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Personhood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cornyn", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Cornyn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filibuster", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Filibuster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fetus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

Tammy Duckworth, a military veteran who has used the fertility treatment to have her two children, has championed the bill, called the Right to IVF Act. The bill would also expand access through insurance as well as for military members and veterans.\n\n\"These are real solutions that would help tens of thousands of Americans every year build the families of their dreams,\" Duckworth, D-Ill., said this week.\n\nBut almost all Republicans voted against advancing the measure, ensuring that it fell short of the 60 votes needed. Instead, GOP senators offered their own, alternative legislation that would discourage states from enacting outright bans on the treatment. Democrats in turn blocked it Wednesday.\n\nThe overtly political back-and-forth, with no attempt at finding a legislative compromise, showed how quickly Congress has shifted into a campaign mindset five months out from the fall election.\n\nAs Schumer seeks to protect a narrow Senate majority and buoy Democrats' hopes of holding the White House, he has sought to spotlight Republican intransigence to federal legislation that would guarantee women's rights to reproductive care. Democrats have campaigned heavily on the issue ever since the 2022 Supreme Court decision that ended a federal right to abortion.\n\n\"The anti-abortion movement is not yet finished. Now that Roe is gone, they have set their sights to a new target -- in vitro fertilization,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor Thursday. \"So today, the question before the Senate is very simple. Do we agree that Americans should be free to use IVF if they want to, yes or no?\"\n\nSchumer, a New York Democrat, also held a vote last week on legislation to protect access to contraception, but Republicans blocked it, arguing it was nothing more than a political stunt. Republicans have also blocked previous attempts to quickly pass IVF protections. They stressed that they support IVF and said Schumer was once again playing to the campaign trail with Thursday's vote.\n\nDemocrats took to the Senate floor Thursday to make a series of speeches that highlighted personal stories of how people have been able to have children using IVF. They say Congress must protect access to the fertility treatment after the Supreme Court in 2022 allowed states to ban abortions and the Alabama Supreme Court in February ruled that frozen embryos can be considered children under state law. Several clinics in the state suspended IVF treatments until the state enacted a law to provide legal protections for IVF clinics.\n\n\"After the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that a frozen embryo is the same, has the exact same rights as a living, breathing person, women who waited for months and spent tens of thousands of dollars and were days away from an IVF appointment were left to wonder if it was all for nothing when their treatment was abruptly canceled,\" said Sen. Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat.\n\nSenate Democrats said it showed how all types of reproductive care could be upended in many parts of the country after Roe v. Wade was overturned.\n\nMost Republicans in Congress, meanwhile, have expressed support for IVF, but have also largely declined to tell states how to regulate reproductive care. Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican GOP presidential nominee, met with House lawmakers on Thursday morning and told them that abortion rules should be left to the states. He also said he supported exceptions for rape, incest and to save the life of the mother, according to Republicans in the meeting.\n\nRepublicans are seeking to come up with a response to voters' concerns about access to abortion and reproductive care -- an issue that is expected to figure largely in the November election. Following the Supreme Court's ruling Thursday that preserved access to the abortion pill mifepristone, anti-abortion groups expressed dismay while most Republicans remained quiet.\n\nIn the Senate this week, Republicans highlighted their efforts to expand access to fertility treatments, yet stopped short of endorsing the Democratic plan.\n\nSen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, said in a floor speech this week that his daughter was currently receiving IVF treatment and spoke of a proposal to expand the flexibility of health savings accounts. Two other GOP Republicans, Sens. Katie Britt of Alabama and Ted Cruz of Texas, also tried to quickly pass a bill that would threaten to withhold Medicaid funding for states where IVF is banned.\n\nDemocrats blocked that bill on Wednesday.\n\nCruz, who is running for reelection in Texas, said it showed Democrats were making a \"cynical political decision.\"\n\n\"They don't want to provide reassurance and comfort to millions of parents in America because instead, they want to spend millions of dollars running campaign ads suggesting the big, bad Republicans want to take away IVF,\" he said in a speech on the Senate floor.\n\nDemocrats argued that the GOP bill was insufficient because it would still allow states to enact laws that grant embryos or fetuses the same rights as a person. Abortion opponents in over a dozen states have advanced legislation based on the concept of fetal rights.\n\nSen. Patty Murray, the Washington Democrat who objected to quickly passing the GOP bill, dismissed it as \"nothing but a PR stunt.\"\n\nBut Republicans also criticized the Democratic bill. Britt said it \"extends far past IVF. It also treads on religious freedom and protection.\"\n\nIn the wake of the Alabama Supreme Court ruling, Christians, who have been a driving force in the anti-abortion movement based on the belief life begins at or around conception, have wrestled with the fertility treatment. The Southern Baptist Convention this week approved a nonbinding resolution that cautioned couples about using IVF.\n\nWith the Senate deadlocked on the issue, advocates for access to the treatment said families would be left in uncertainty.\n\nJamie Heard, who lives in Birmingham and had to suspend her effort to have a second child using IVF when the state Supreme Court made its decision, said the ruling left her both scared and angry. She has been able to continue the treatment, yet spoke alongside other IVF advocates at the Capitol Wednesday to urge lawmakers to act.\n\n\"There are still a lot of questions that we have about how to move forward,\" Heard said.", "source": {"uri": "hosted.ap.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Associated Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammy_Duckworth", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tammy Duckworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assisted reproductive technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Alabama", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of Alabama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

With one recent poll showing that a whopping 86% of Americans want IVF treatments to be legal, GOP officials realize that it'd be politically dangerous to oppose this popular, safe, and effective pro-family policy.\n\nWith this in mind, every member of the Senate Republican conference -- literally, all 49 members -- signed onto a joint statement, issued this morning, expressing their collective support for IVF access. \"We strongly support continued nationwide access to IVF, which has allowed millions of aspiring parents to start and grow their families,\" the GOP senators said.\n\nBut the phrase \"watch what they do, not what they say\" comes to mind. It's one thing for Senate Republicans to express support for IVF in the abstract; it's something else for them to actually vote for federal legislation that would protect IVF in practice. NBC News reported on the latest effort to govern on the issue, and the number of GOP officials who balked.\n\nThe legislation was written three Senate Democrats -- Washington's Patty Murray, Illinois' Tammy Duckworth, and New Jersey's Cory Booker -- and it would prohibit states from imposing restrictions on the treatments, while also making IVF more affordable.\n\nTwo Republican senators -- Alaska's Lisa Murkowski and Maine's Susan Collins -- voted with the Democratic majority in today's procedural vote, but every other GOP member balked. The final tally was 48 to 47, with some senators missing the vote. To advance, proponents needed 60 votes, and they obviously didn't come especially close.\n\nIf these circumstances sound at all familiar, it's not your imagination. In late February, Duckworth sought unanimous consent -- a procedural move designed to help quickly advance uncontroversial measures -- on the \"Access to Family Building Act,\" which would create legal protections for IVF at the national level. It also failed in response to Republican opposition.\n\nTwo weeks later, Murray tried to pass a bill to expand access to in vitro fertilization for military service members and veterans. It, too, was derailed by Republican opposition.\n\n\"Today, senators face a very simple question: Do you agree Americans should have access to IVF, yes or no? If yes, the only correct answer is to vote yes on the Right to IVF Act,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said shortly before the procedural vote. \"Protecting IVF should be the easiest 'yes' vote senators have taken all year. All this bill does is establish a nationwide right to IVF and eliminates barriers for millions of Americans who seek IVF to have kids.\"\n\nThe New York Democrat added, \"To my Republican colleagues who say they're pro-family, today's bill protecting IVF is as pro-family as it gets, and we should vote yes today. It is a contradiction to claim you are pro-family but then turn around and block protections for IVF.\"\n\nSoon after, the vast majority of GOP senators opposed the measure anyway. The vote came one day after the Southern Baptist Convention, the nation's largest and most politically powerful Protestant denomination, became the latest conservative institution to come out against in vitro fertilization.\n\nIf you're thinking this is shaping up to be an unexpected 2024 campaign issue, you're not alone.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_values", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Family values"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammy_Duckworth", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tammy Duckworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patty_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patty Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Murkowski", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lisa Murkowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unanimous_consent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unanimous consent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Collins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Susan Collins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Booker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cory Booker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maine"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maine"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Baptist_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southern Baptist Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Protestantism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Infertility", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Infertility", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family_Resources_and_Support", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family Resources and Support", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/2p6Zl4caAUwqsDhvZYNeBA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/msnbc_articles_593/b23a03ab5453146be28b5240559a136d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9641932", "eventUri": "eng-9641932", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Tammy Duckworth, a military veteran who has used the fertility treatment to have her two children, has championed the bill, called the Right to IVF Act. The bill would also expand access through insurance as well as for military members and veterans.\n\n\"These are real solutions that would help tens of thousands of Americans every year build the families of their dreams,\" Duckworth, D-Ill., said this week.\n\nBut most Republicans were expected to vote against advancing the measure, instead offering their own, alternative legislation that would discourage states from enacting outright bans on the treatment. Democrats in turn blocked it Wednesday.\n\nThe overtly political back-and-forth, with no attempt at finding a legislative compromise, showed how quickly Congress has shifted into a campaign mindset five months out from the fall election.\n\nAs Schumer seeks to protect a narrow Senate majority and buoy Democrats' hopes of holding the White House, he has sought to spotlight Republican intransigence to federal legislation that would guarantee women's rights to reproductive care. Democrats have campaigned heavily on the issue ever since the 2022 Supreme Court decision that ended a federal right to abortion.\n\nSchumer, a New York Democrat, also held a vote last week on legislation to protect access to contraception, but Republicans blocked it, arguing it was nothing more than a political stunt. Republicans have also blocked previous attempts to quickly pass IVF protections. They stressed that they support IVF and said Schumer was once again playing to the campaign trail with Thursday's vote.\n\n\"Despite some claims from my colleagues on the other side, protecting IVF is not a show vote at all. It's a show-us-who-you-are vote,\" Schumer said. \"This will be a chance for senators on both sides to show their support for strengthening treatments for people who start families.\"\n\nDemocrats say it is necessary for Congress to protect access to the fertility treatment after the Supreme Court in 2022 allowed states to ban abortions and the Alabama Supreme Court in February ruled that frozen embryos can be considered children under state law. Several clinics in the state suspended IVF treatments until the state enacted a law to provide legal protections for IVF clinics.\n\nSenate Democrats said it showed how all types of reproductive care could be upended in many parts of the country after Roe v. Wade was overturned.\n\nMost Republicans in Congress, meanwhile, have expressed support for IVF, but have also largely declined to tell states how to regulate reproductive care. Instead, two Republicans, Sens. Katie Britt of Alabama and Ted Cruz of Texas have sought to quickly pass a bill that would threaten to withhold Medicaid funding for states where IVF is banned. Democrats blocked that bill on Wednesday.\n\nCruz, who is running for reelection in Texas, said it showed Democrats were making a \"cynical political decision.\"\n\n\"They don't want to provide reassurance and comfort to millions of parents in America because instead, they want to spend millions of dollars running campaign ads suggesting the big, bad Republicans want to take away IVF,\" he said in a speech on the Senate floor.\n\nDemocrats argued that the GOP bill was insufficient because it would still allow states to enact laws that grant embryos or fetuses the same rights as a person. Abortion opponents in over a dozen states have advanced legislation based on the concept of fetal rights.\n\nSen. Patty Murray, the Washington Democrat who objected to quickly passing the GOP bill, dismissed it as \"nothing but a PR stunt.\"\n\nBut Republicans also criticized the Democratic bill. Britt said it \"extends far past IVF. It also treads on religious freedom and protection.\"\n\nIn the wake of the Alabama Supreme Court ruling, Christians, who have been a driving force in the anti-abortion movement based on the belief life begins at or around conception, have wrestled with the fertility treatment. The Southern Baptist Convention this week approved a nonbinding resolution that cautioned couples about using IVF.\n\nWith the Senate deadlocked on the issue, advocates for access to the treatment said families would be left in uncertainty.\n\nJamie Heard, who lives in Birmingham and had to suspend her effort to have a second child using IVF when the state Supreme Court made its decision, said the ruling left her both scared and angry. She has been able to continue the treatment, yet spoke alongside other IVF advocates at the Capitol Wednesday to urge lawmakers to act.\n\n\"There are still a lot of questions that we have about how to move forward,\" Heard said.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Patti Murray (D-Washington). \"The threat to IVF is very real.\"\n\nThe bill likely faces the same fate as a similar bill protecting the right to contraception. That measure failed last week as only a couple of moderate Republicans broke ranks.\n\nDemocrats want to keep voters focused on reproductive rights, which has become a hugely effective wedge issue for them since the Supreme Court rolled back the landmark Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide.\n\nGOP lawmakers say Democrats are playing political games and that neither contraception nor IVF faces any serious threat.\n\nFamilies in Alabama may disagree. The future of IVF was recently thrown into doubt by an Alabama Supreme Court ruling that frozen embryos are people and covered by the state's anti-abortion constitutional amendment declaring that life begins at conception.\n\nThe Republican-controlled state government scrambled to pass a law explicitly permitting IVF, but it's unclear if the law will pass muster under planned challenge by evangelical Christians.\n\nMany Republican members of Congress have signed on to a proposed similar federal law declaring that life starts at conception.\n\nThe law aims to outlaw abortion as murder. But it could also have the side effect of endangering IVF because of the way the practice works.\n\nOn its face, IVF, like contraception, enjoys broad support among Americans of all walks of life. Recent polls show 86% support keeping IVF legal and even 83% of evangelical Christians support the practice.\n\nBut fears over IVF grew dramatically Wednesday as the Southern Baptist Convention, the nation's largest Protestant denomination, voted to oppose the practice.\n\nIVF \"most often participates in the destruction of embryonic human life,\" reads the resolution passed by 11,000 delegates to the Baptist gathering.\n\nThe group represents 13 million parishioners in 45,000 churches. The move isn't binding but church leaders made no secret that they hope to open a new front in the conservative culture wars after abortion opponents eventually won their long battle to end legal abortion.\n\n\"It took us 50 years to take down (Roe v.

Ted Cruz's effort to protect access to in vitro fertilization was blocked on Wednesday as Democrats instead rallied around their own version of the legislation.\n\nThe bill, first introduced last month by Cruz and fellow conservative Sen. Katie Britt of Alabama, would have withheld Medicaid funding from any state that passes a ban on IVF, emphasizing a \"need to protect both life and access to IVF treatments.\" The Democrats' version, however, aims to establish IVF as a federal right.\n\n\"Recent developments have caused some confusion and concern among parents and among those who wish to be parents,\" Cruz said on the Senate floor. \"This should be a clear and unmistakable federal law.\"\n\nQuestions about IVF's legal status first emerged after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and allowed states to ban abortion. A ruling from the Alabama Supreme Court earlier this year said embryos are protected human life, causing some IVF clinics in that state to pause services.\n\nRepublicans have since scrambled to address IVF, which has widespread public support and could become a liability for the GOP in the anti-abortion legal landscape.\n\nOn Wednesday, Cruz and Britt requested a vote on their bill. Democrats blocked the effort, saying Cruz's bill leaves too many legal loopholes and still allows states to restrict IVF.\n\n\"It is ridiculous to claim that this bill protects IVF when it does nothing of the sort,\" said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington. \"In fact, it explicitly allows states to restrict IVF in all sorts of ways. It's literally in the bill text.\"\n\nThe bill was criticized from the right as well. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, called Cruz's approach a \"solution in search of a problem\" and an attempt to prop up the fertility industry. Cruz and other Republican supporters were simply \"looking for ways to inoculate themselves against potential political attacks,\" the group said.\n\nIt is also unclear whether the Cruz bill would have protected IVF, if it was restricted via a court ruling. The Texas Supreme Court is currently considering taking up a case that experts say could \"upend IVF in Texas.\" Plaintiffs argue that Texas' new anti-abortion laws define life as beginning at conception, therefore granting embryos the same rights as living children.\n\nDemocrats are hoping to instead pass their own IVF bill led by Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, which aims to establish IVF and other assisted reproductive technologies as federal rights. That bill, which was first blocked by Republicans in February, is expected to receive a vote Thursday, though it is not expected to pick up enough Republican votes to pass. Two other Democratic efforts to give IVF federal protection failed earlier this year.\n\nCruz has previously criticized Democrats' approach as \"very broad\" and claimed it would give the federal government authority over abortion.\n\n\"There's a reason that no Republican supported it,\" he said in an interview last month with Bloomberg, adding that Democrats would not support his own bill because they wanted to use IVF as a campaign issue.\n\n\"Every Democrat is going to tell voters that if you don't vote for me, a Democrat, mean Republicans are going to come take away IVF,\" Cruz said.\n\nU.S. Rep. Colin Allred, D-Dallas, who is running against Cruz in November, has sought to tie the legal limbo of IVF to Cruz's anti-abortion stance and the fall of federal abortion rights.\n\n\"We are here because of Ted Cruz, because of extremists like him, who placed technology like IVF at risk,\" Allred said in a CBS interview last week. \"It's like the thief trying to sell you locks after they've robbed your house.\"\n\nTexas' senior Sen. John Cornyn blasted the Democrats' bill as unnecessary, saying he supports IVF but that the procedure is not under legal risk and does not require federal protection.", "source": {"uri": "texastribune.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Texas Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Cruz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ted Cruz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

(WKRG) -- Nearly 11,000 voters at the Southern Baptist Convention voted to oppose in vitro fertilization.\n\nThe results of that vote could be used to lobby for legislative actions to reflect the church's current views, according to the convention.\n\nBefore voters, known as \"messengers,\" raised their paddles, they were asked to weigh the ethics of the technology used in the process while also expressing sympathy for the couples who are affected by infertility.\n\nThe convention criticized IVF because frozen embryos are often destroyed in the process.\n\nBSC said the results do not prohibit church members from receiving IVF treatments. If anything, they said it's just a snapshot of the church's beliefs at that particular time.\n\nThose results, according to BSC, give the Ethics and Religious Liberties Commission the ability to approach legislators with the general opinions of the church.\n\nIn the past 20 years, the convention has voted on 41 other anti-abortion subjects. The IVF vote is the first time BSC has addressed the process.\n\nThe vote comes in the wake of an Alabama Supreme Court ruling in February that frozen embryos are human beings. In response to the ruling, many IVF clinics across Alabama paused IVF treatments to avoid liability.\n\nIn a 7-2 decision, the State Supreme Court decided not to reconsider that ruling.\n\nIn March, Gov. Kay Ivey signed an IVF protection bill that allowed a majority of the state's IVF clinics to resume their treatments. The Center for Reproductive Medicine in Mobile did not reopen due to ongoing litigation.\n\nIn September, the Pew Research Center estimated about 42% of American adults use some form of fertility treatment. That number is up from the 33% it was in 2018.\n\nGeorge Gigicos, Spokesman for the Center of Reproductive Medicine in Mobile, released a statement.\n\n\"We were disappointed to hear about the vote taken at the Southern Baptist Convention in Indianapolis regarding IVF,\" Gigicos said. \"It does a great disservice to the 15% of Americans who face fertility problems and rely on IVF to build their families.\"\n\nGigicos said 2% of babies in the United States are born through IVF.\n\nThe Southern Baptist Church has more than 13 million members nationwide.", "source": {"uri": "wkrg.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WKRG News 5"}, "authors": [{"uri": "asher_redd@wkrg.com", "name": "Asher Redd", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Baptist_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southern Baptist Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Embryo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mobile, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Alabama", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of Alabama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infertility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kay_Ivey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kay Ivey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pew_Research_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pew Research Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assisted reproductive technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society", "label": "dmoz/Society", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Infertility", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Infertility", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://www.wkrg.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/49/2024/06/WKRG-SBC-IVF-Vote-VO.00_01_03_10.Still001.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9641932", "eventUri": "eng-9641932", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mobile, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Major growth drivers for the United Kingdom in vitro fertilization market include increasing awareness regarding assisted reproductive technology, growing favorable regulatory measures supporting IVF treatments, and the introduction of commercialized three-parent IVF procedures. The country has numerous fertility clinics and centers that offer a range of ART treatments, including IVF, intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), and preimplantation genetic testing (PGT). The increasing prevalence of infertility and a rise in the average age of parenthood have fueled the demand for IVF services in the United Kingdom. Changing social attitudes, advancements in IVF technologies, and improving success rates have also played a crucial role in the market's expansion. The United Kingdom has a supportive legal framework regarding ART and fertility treatment, ensuring the rights and safety of patients and regulating the practices of fertility clinics. The National Health Service (NHS) offers IVF treatment to eligible couples, also contributing to the accessibility and adoption of IVF services. The advancements in reproductive technologies, such as the utilization of time-lapse imaging, genetic screening, and embryo freezing, have improved success rates and expanded treatment options, attracting both domestic and international patients to seek IVF services in the United Kingdom. The market is further influenced by factors such as increasing public awareness about infertility treatments, higher disposable income levels, and the willingness of individuals to invest in fertility treatments to fulfill their desire for parenthood. However, high cost associated with IVF procedures and restrictive regulations and ethical concerns are anticipated to restrain the overall market growth during the period in analysis.\n\nUnited Kingdom In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) Market - Overview:\n\nIn vitro fertilization (IVF) is a widely practiced laboratory-based treatment for infertility. This assisted reproductive technology involves the extraction of one or more eggs from the ovaries, which are then fertilized by sperm in a controlled environment outside the body. It is a prominent fertility treatment within the clinical field. The IVF process encompasses several stages, including ovarian stimulation, egg retrieval, fertilization through insemination, embryo culture, and ultimately, the transfer of the developed embryo into the uterus. The duration of the treatment spans several months. In cases where natural methods have been unsuccessful, IVF offers an alternative approach to achieving conception.\n\nDownload Sample Report, SPECIAL OFFER (Avail an Up-to 30% discount on this report ) -https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=bwcc17986\n\nImpact of COVID-19 on United Kingdom In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) Market\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic adversely affected United Kingdom in vitro fertilization (IVF) market. The restrictions and disruptions caused by the crisis have led to the postponement and cancellation of IVF treatments, creating delays for individuals and couples seeking fertility assistance. Financial constraints resulting from job losses and economic downturn have also affected the accessibility of IVF services. Psychological factors such as stress and concerns about the health risks associated with COVID-19 have influenced individuals' decisions regarding pursuing or delaying IVF treatments. However, with the implementation of safety protocols and the progress of vaccination efforts, it is anticipated that the IVF market will gradually recover as the demand for fertility treatments persists.\n\nUnited Kingdom In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) Market - By Cycle Type:\n\nBased on cycle type, the United Kingdom in vitro fertilization (IVF) market is divided into Fresh Donor, Frozen Donor, Fresh Non-donor, and Frozen Non-donor segments. The frozen non-donor segment held the highest share in the IVF market in 2022. This segment's dominance can be attributed to several factors, including its cost-effectiveness compared to fresh non-donor procedures and its minimally invasive nature. The fresh non-donor segment held the second-highest revenue share in 2021. The implementation of the vitrification process, endorsed by the International Federation of Fertility Societies, has enabled sperm donation even for HIV-positive patients by directly isolating sperm from plasma. Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) offers hope to individuals with azoospermia in achieving conception. As women age, the success rate of IVF declines significantly, particularly in those over 40 years old. Consequently, donor eggs are commonly employed in this demographic. The shared donor egg program allows a single donor to contribute eggs to multiple recipients, ensuring fertility rates are not compromised. This program is not only cost-effective but also beneficial for the recipients.\n\nCompetitive Landscape:\n\nMajor players operating in the United Kingdom in vitro fertilization (IVF) market include: Bourn Hall Clinic, CARE Fertility Group, HCA International Limited, TFP Fertility Group, CREATE Fertility, The Centre for Reproductive & Genetic Health, London Women's Clinic, Manchester Fertility, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, and The Bridge Centre.

Scott Applewhite / AP\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., speaks to reporters about a vote to protect rights for access to in vitro fertilization to achieve pregnancy, at the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, June 12, 2024.\n\nBy Stephen Groves, Associated Press\n\nWednesday, June 12, 2024 | 10:34 p.m.\n\nWASHINGTON -- Senate Democrats are seeking to highlight Republicans' resistance to legislation that would make it a right nationwide for women to access in vitro fertilization and other fertility treatments, holding a vote on the matter Thursday as part of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's effort to drive an election-year contrast on reproductive care.\n\nSen. Tammy Duckworth, a military veteran who has used the fertility treatment to have her two children, has championed the bill, called the Right to IVF Act. The bill would also expand access through insurance as well as for military members and veterans.\n\n\"These are real solutions that would help tens of thousands of Americans every year build the families of their dreams,\" Duckworth, D-Ill., said this week.\n\nBut most Republicans were expected to vote against advancing the measure, instead offering their own, alternative legislation that would discourage states from enacting outright bans on the treatment. Democrats in turn blocked it Wednesday.\n\nThe overtly political back-and-forth, with no attempt at finding a legislative compromise, showed how quickly Congress has shifted into a campaign mindset five months out from the fall election.\n\nAs Schumer seeks to protect a narrow Senate majority and buoy Democrats' hopes of holding the White House, he has sought to spotlight Republican intransigence to federal legislation that would guarantee women's rights to reproductive care. Democrats have campaigned heavily on the issue ever since the 2022 Supreme Court decision that ended a federal right to abortion.\n\nSchumer, a New York Democrat, also held a vote last week on legislation to protect access to contraception, but Republicans blocked it, arguing it was nothing more than a political stunt. Republicans have also blocked previous attempts to quickly pass IVF protections. They stressed that they support IVF and said Schumer was once again playing to the campaign trail with Thursday's vote.\n\n\"Despite some claims from my colleagues on the other side, protecting IVF is not a show vote at all. It's a show-us-who-you-are vote,\" Schumer said. \"This will be a chance for senators on both sides to show their support for strengthening treatments for people who start families.\"\n\nDemocrats say it is necessary for Congress to protect access to the fertility treatment after the Supreme Court in 2022 allowed states to ban abortions and the Alabama Supreme Court in February ruled that frozen embryos can be considered children under state law. Several clinics in the state suspended IVF treatments until the state enacted a law to provide legal protections for IVF clinics.\n\nSenate Democrats said it showed how all types of reproductive care could be upended in many parts of the country after Roe v. Wade was overturned.\n\nMost Republicans in Congress, meanwhile, have expressed support for IVF, but have also largely declined to tell states how to regulate reproductive care. Instead, two Republicans, Sens. Katie Britt of Alabama and Ted Cruz of Texas have sought to quickly pass a bill that would threaten to withhold Medicaid funding for states where IVF is banned. Democrats blocked that bill on Wednesday.\n\nCruz, who is running for reelection in Texas, said it showed Democrats were making a \"cynical political decision.\"\n\n\"They don't want to provide reassurance and comfort to millions of parents in America because instead, they want to spend millions of dollars running campaign ads suggesting the big, bad Republicans want to take away IVF,\" he said in a speech on the Senate floor.\n\nDemocrats argued that the GOP bill was insufficient because it would still allow states to enact laws that grant embryos or fetuses the same rights as a person. Abortion opponents in over a dozen states have advanced legislation based on the concept of fetal rights.\n\nSen. Patty Murray, the Washington Democrat who objected to quickly passing the GOP bill, dismissed it as \"nothing but a PR stunt.\"\n\nBut Republicans also criticized the Democratic bill. Britt said it \"extends far past IVF. It also treads on religious freedom and protection.\"\n\nIn the wake of the Alabama Supreme Court ruling, Christians, who have been a driving force in the anti-abortion movement based on the belief life begins at or around conception, have wrestled with the fertility treatment. The Southern Baptist Convention this week approved a nonbinding resolution that cautioned couples about using IVF.\n\nWith the Senate deadlocked on the issue, advocates for access to the treatment said families would be left in uncertainty.\n\nJamie Heard, who lives in Birmingham and had to suspend her effort to have a second child using IVF when the state Supreme Court made its decision, said the ruling left her both scared and angry. She has been able to continue the treatment, yet spoke alongside other IVF advocates at the Capitol Wednesday to urge lawmakers to act.\n\n\"There are still a lot of questions that we have about how to move forward,\" Heard said.", "source": {"uri": "lasvegassun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Las Vegas Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@lasvegassun.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "stephen_groves@lasvegassun.com", "name": "Stephen Groves", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assisted reproductive technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammy_Duckworth", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tammy Duckworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veteran", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Veteran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Alabama", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of Alabama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Women's rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Embryo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Birth control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Cruz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ted Cruz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Britt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Katie Britt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

It also advances the tenets of \"fetal personhood\", a movement to enshrine embryos and fetuses with full legal rights and protections that, if fully enacted, would rewrite vast swaths of US law.\n\nThe Catholic church already officially opposes IVF, but the issue has not historically loomed as large among Protestants. Majorities of both white non-evangelical Protestants, white evangelical Protestants, and Black Protestants all support access to IVF.\n\nThe Wednesday resolution suggests that this support may be in flux, since the Southern Baptist Convention has long been seen as a barometer of US evangelicalism and its future.\n\nIVF has been in the national spotlight since the Alabama state supreme court ruled earlier this year frozen embryos qualify as \"extrauterine children\", a decision that led many IVF providers in the state to temporarily cease work. Although the 2022 overturning of Roe v Wade cleared the way for attacks on IVF, many in the state and across the country were shocked by the ruling and its implications.\n\nRelated: 'They have no options': Texas court dims hope of timely abortion care for high-risk patients\n\nThis week, the US Senate is expected to vote on a bill that would codify a federal right to IVF.

This decision was based not on the merits, but on a lack of standing.\"\n\nSchumer then quickly pivoted to IVF, saying the question before lawmakers is \"very simple.\"\n\n\"Do we agree that Americans should be free to use IVF if they want to? Yes or no?\" Schumer continued. \"If yes, then the only right answer is to vote in favor of today's bill.\"\n\nThe legislation, authored by Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth, includes four bills that aim to preserve access to IVF by prohibiting states from imposing restrictions on the treatment and making it more affordable. It would also expand access through insurance as well as for military members and veterans.\n\nDemocrats argue it's necessary for Congress to protect access to the fertility treatment after the Supreme Court in 2022 allowed states to ban abortions and the Alabama Supreme Court in February ruled that frozen embryos can be considered children under state law.\n\nRepublicans, who maintain they are supportive of IVF, criticized Thursday's vote as a political stunt and oppose the legislation as being an overreach.\n\nOn Wednesday, Republicans offered their own legislation that would ban states from getting access to Medicaid funding if they bar IVF services. The bill was co-sponsored by Sens. Katie Britt of Alabama and Ted Cruz of Texas.\n\nTheir attempt to pass the bill through unanimous request was blocked by Democrats who said it didn't go far enough to protect access.\n\nBritt and Cruz, in a joint statement on behalf of all 49 Republican senators, said ahead of Thursday's vote that Democrats were trying to \"mislead\" the public on this issue.\n\n\"Senate Democrats have embraced a Summer of Scare Tactics -- a partisan campaign of false fearmongering intended to mislead and confuse the American people,\" the statement read. \"In vitro fertilization is legal and available in every state across our nation.

Now that's just a whole other matter, and it's, I think, a tragedy.\"\n\nDr. Barrows recommends creating no more than four embryos.\n\n\"We aren't in a position to decide which embryo is going to survive and which embryo is not. Only God can decide that,\" Dr. Barrows said.\n\nSome, such as the Catholic Church, say the practice should be avoided altogether.\n\n\"The reason for this is because you can't justify evil means to achieve a good end, and IVF involves many, many evil things going on in those clinics,\" Former Trump medical advisor, CEO of AllBetter Health, and Executive Director of the Alliance of Health Care Sharing Ministries Katy Talento, ND, told CBN News, adding, \"The IVF industry, it feeds this cultural entitlement that we have to God-like powers over life and death. And that sense of entitlement is precisely what has fueled the abortion industry.\"\n\nTalento said while the treatment of IVF-generated embryos is inhumane, \"There are millions of human embryos. Every year these little embryos are discarded or they're frozen in limbo indefinitely.\n\nShe adds that's only the beginning of problems associated with the practice.\n\n\"When you support in vitro fertilization, you are supporting an industry that expands a commercial surrogacy market that commodifies and sells the wombs of poor and desperate women, often women of color or women in developing countries that are serving as surrogates. There are surrogate farms in developing countries,\" Talento said.\n\nTalento also adds the IVF industry is expanding pornography.\n\n\"How does one obtain sperm? It's usually through masturbation rooms and pornography in those rooms for the male donors to provide their sperm,\" adding sperm donors often sell their sperm.\n\n\"It generates a eugenics market for the sperm and egg sellers who are advertised to infertile parents based on attractiveness or IQ, academic achievement, and often white skin. It harms children by intentionally creating motherless children and intentionally creating fatherless children for gay couples,\" she said.\n\nWhile the Southern Baptist Convention deems IVF an immoral practice, other faith leaders, such as Ralph Reed, founder and chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition believe it has value but some reforms are necessary.\n\n\"We don't really have an objection to in vitro fertilization at all,\" Reed told the Washington Post, \"As long as it's conducted in a way that shows respect for ethical and moral considerations. That is to say, we don't think there should be an unregulated practice of just willy-nilly randomly fertilizing eggs, and then keeping them, and using them in a way that would almost be harvesting embryos,\" he said, adding, \"As long as it's couples desiring to have a child, we support that and we don't have any desire for a legal prohibition of that.\"\n\nThe issue became a political hot-button earlier this year, when the Alabama Supreme Court ruled embryos are children deserving of protection under the law.\n\nThe state legislature quickly changed the law to protect IVF. Now, on Capitol Hill, there's a bi-partisan push to safeguard IVF, with Democrats taking it a step further by introducing legislation calling for most employer-sponsored insurance to cover it.\n\n\"It's very unclear exactly who this does and does not apply to. Is it for gay couples? Is it for only married couples? Do single parents get this benefit? Does it include commercial surrogacy? Does it include transgender couples or parents?\" Talento said, \"All of these questions are left sort of vague and nebulous or unanswered.\"\n\nMeanwhile, faced with infertility, Amanda and Ryan Visser considered IVF, but rejected it.\n\n\"I do have an ethical issue with creating lots of embryos that you don't intend to use,\" said Amanda.\n\nTheir compassion for leftover frozen embryos prompted them to adopt three of the ones someone else no longer wanted. Two of those embryos were implanted into Amanda's womb and became the couple's twin sons, who are now six months old.\n\n\"Even in the freezer they weren't dead,\" said Ryan, \"So I look at that and go, there's human life, even at a microscopic level.\"\n\nThe couple plans to implant their third embryo or put it up for adoption.\n\nDr. Barrows said CMDA strongly supports the adoption of frozen embryos and said the organization works closely with the National Embryo Donation Center, which is located in Knoxville, Tennessee.\n\n\"The people that run that clinic are actually our members, and we are fully supportive of couples that make the decision to adopt out one of these frozen embryos,\" he said.\n\nSo while the debate continues over how, or whether, to regulate IVF, more Americans are becoming educated about the practice, as well as the alternatives.", "source": {"uri": "cbn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBN.com - The Christian Broadcasting Network"}, "authors": [],

Wednesday's vote came a day after messengers voted to expel a Virginia church from the denomination for subscribing to the belief women can serve as pastors within the Southern Baptist church.\n\nDespite Tuesday's move involving the Virginia congregation, messengers voted to reject a formal ban on women clergy, although the denomination informally does not allow women to serve in that role.\n\nOn Wednesday, messengers approved the IVF measure, which encourages Southern Baptists to only use reproductive technologies that affirm the \"unconditional value and right to life of every human being, including those in the embryonic stage.\"\n\nAs with the measure involving female church leaders, the IVF proclamation does not formally ban those within the denomination from using the reproductive technology. Those who choose to pursue IVF treatments will not face any punishment from the denomination, the measure concludes.\n\nRather, the amendment expresses empathy for couples experiencing infertility and says that \"all children are a gift from God, no matter the circumstances of their conception.\"\n\nWednesday's vote comes four months after the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that embryos are children -- a ruling that halted the state's IVF clinics from operating. The Alabama court decision came after grievances were filed by multiple IVF patients whose embryos were taken out of freezing, dropped on the floor and destroyed.\n\nThe ruling declared that frozen embryos are legally considered children and are, therefore, protected under Alabama's Wrongful Death of a Minor Act. Immediately after the high court's decision, former President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, said he would \"strongly support\" IVF availability.\n\nTrump has also declined to suppport a national ban on abortion, saying each state should have its own laws.\n\nEarlier this week, Trump told anti-abortion Christian groups to stand up for \"innocent life.\" In recorded remarks, the former president said that everyone needs to pull together to preserve their values, including religious liberty, free speech, innocent life and America's heritage and traditions.\n\nWednesday's vote marked the first time that Southern Baptists have addressed the topic of IVF technology, The New York Times reported. However, in 2021 Southern Baptists at the annual meeting passed a resolution declaring \"unequivocally that abortion is murder.\"\n\nBefore the vote, the debate exhibited the divisions that exist within Southern Baptists on the issue of IVF technology. Although the vast majority of evangelicals are morally opposed to abortion, many are open to the use of IVF technology,\n\nThose at the Indianapolis conference who opposed the resolution said that the measure could prove harmful to some Southern Baptists.\n\n\"This resolution would castigate and condemn the entirely moral and ethical actions of these two friends of mine calling their faithful sacrifice, struggle, and blessing a wicked thing,\" Michigan messenger Daniel Taylor said, according to The Tennessean. \"It would also unnecessarily make it more difficult for all of us to reach those who have gone through IVF as parents or children.\"\n\nIn passing the measure, messengers also called on their fellow Southern Baptists to \"advocate for the government to restrain\" actions inconsistent with the dignity of \"every human being, which necessarily includes frozen embryonic human beings,\" The New York Times reported.\n\nThe report said that last month, the denomination's public policy arm sent a letter to U.S. senators, asking lawmakers to clamp down on the use of IVF. The newspaper reported that the authors of the resolution that was passed Wednesday said that the topic of IVF technology is still debated among anti-abortion Christians.\n\n\"I want to do more than nudge Republicans who are against us on this. I want to call them out for their error and inconsistency,\" R. Albert Mohler Jr., president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, told the Times this week.", "source": {"uri": "newsnationnow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsNation"}, "authors":

Wade two years ago.\n\nEarlier at the meeting at which issues affecting women have been prominent, a proposed amendment to the church's constitution that would have banned women as pastors fell just short of the two-thirds majority vote it needed to pass.\n\nThe IVF resolution before the thousands of leaders gathered in Indianapolis noted the searing pain infertile couples encounter, but made plain that \"not all technological means of assisting human reproduction are equally God-honoring or morally justified.\"\n\nIVF involves combining eggs and sperm in a laboratory dish to create an embryo for couples having difficulty conceiving.\n\nThe resolution states that the IVF process routinely creates more embryos than can reasonably be implanted and that naturally leads to the ultimate destruction of hundreds of thousands of frozen embryos, which the church considers sacred life.\n\nThe resolution called on \"Southern Baptists to reaffirm the unconditional value and right to life of every human being, including those in an embryonic stage, and to only utilize reproductive technologies consistent with that affirmation ...\"\n\nIn February, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos should be considered children. The ruling arose from lawsuits by three families against Alabama fertility procedure providers accused of failing to properly safeguard frozen embryos, resulting in their destruction when a patient improperly accessed them.\n\nThe court ruling was based on an amendment to the Alabama state constitution approved by voters in 2018 that made it official policy to uphold \"the sanctity of unborn life and the rights of unborn children.\" The court ruling left unclear how to legally store, transport and use embryos.\n\nDemocrats portrayed Alabama's all-Republican high court as bent on further restricting women's ability to make choices about reproduction following the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that toppled Roe, abolishing women's constitutional right to abortion.\n\nRepublicans faced backlash nationwide, even as some particularly conservative members of the party continued to question IVF procedures.\n\nIn Alabama, the Republican-led state legislature passed measures aimed at protecting IVF providers from both criminal charges and civil lawsuits, and the Republican governor quickly signed them into law, prompting Alabama providers who had halted the IVF procedure following the court ruling to resume offering the treatment.\n\nIn Washington, Republican senators blocked Democrats' attempt to guarantee access to IVF treatments, saying the proposal went too far.\n\nIn May, Brent Leatherwood, head of the Southern Baptist Convention's public policy Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, wrote U.S. senators to urge more robust oversight of the IVF process.\n\n\"A human embryo is a life. This life is as deserving of protection and all the standards of care we would give to a child or an adult,\" Leatherwood wrote. \"In the post-Roe moment we find ourselves in, we must make the most of this opportunity to stand for life in all its forms.\"", "source": {"uri": "cyprus-mail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cyprus Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Embryo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Baptist_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Southern Baptist Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fertility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

Ted Cruz (R-Texas), along with his colleagues Sens. Katie Britt (R-Ala.) and Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), went to the Senate floor to ask for unanimous consent to pass their bill the IVF Protection Act. Senate Democrats blocked their legislation to ensure IVF was protected at the federal level.On the floor, Sen. Cruz said, \"IVF is a medical miracle that has brought the joy of parenthood to millions of families who might otherwise have never experienced it. I am a strong supporter of IVF, and I am incredibly grateful for the technology that has enabled parents, moms and dads desperate to bring into the world little boys and little girls to finally hold a child in their arms. ...\"IVF is profoundly, pro-family, it is an avenue of hope for millions struggling with infertility. To every mom and every dad at home and to every woman and man desperately hoping to be a parent, know that our bill will ensure that IVF remains 100 percent protected by law, and this should not just be a policy or a general affirmation. This should be a clear and unmistakable federal law. We invite our colleagues in the Senate from both sides of the aisle to join together in supporting this crucial legislation. This should be a measure that transcends political divides. A recent poll shows that 86 percent of Americans believe IVF should be legal and protected. This is an opportunity for us to put partisan divisions aside and to come together and unite on a shared commitment to protecting IVF.\"After Senate Democrats objected, Sen. Cruz said, \"The Democrats just cynically objected to [a bill that] would protect IVF for every parent in the country, and it would become federal law. Except for one thing, the Democrats do not want it to because if we pass clear [and] strong federal protections for IVF, the issue that they're planning to campaign on would go away. What we've just seen is one of the most cynical displays of partisan politics to ever occur on the Senate floor. It's designed deliberately to deceive the American voters. It's unfortunate that Democrats put politics above protecting parents and above protecting IVF.\"Watch the full floor speech here.BACKGROUNDRead the full text of the Cruz-Britt bill here.\n\nSince its development in the 1970s, in vitro fertilization (IVF) has proven itself to be a safe, effective, and reliable means to achieving pregnancy.IVF has allowed millions of aspiring parents to experience the miracle of childbirth.IVF is a pro-woman and pro-family solution for those struggling to have children.IVF has become a symbol of hope for those aspiring to conceive.It is now estimated that nearly 2 percent of all live births in the United States are the result of IVF, resulting in tens of thousands of happy, healthy babies being born annually.The use of IVF has strengthened our communities and our nation by promoting generations of children and families that otherwise may not have come to be.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Cruz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ted Cruz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Britt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Katie Britt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Marshall_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roger Marshall (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marshall University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unanimous_consent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unanimous consent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partisan_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Partisan (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_values", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Family values"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infertility"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Infertility", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Infertility", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Parenting", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family_Resources_and_Support", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family Resources and Support", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9641932", "eventUri": "eng-9641932", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

This decision was based not on the merits, but on a lack of standing.\"\n\nMORE: Supreme Court unanimously strikes down legal challenge to abortion pill mifepristone\n\nSchumer then quickly pivoted to IVF, saying the question before lawmakers is \"very simple.\"\n\n\"Do we agree that Americans should be free to use IVF if they want to? Yes or no?\" Schumer continued. \"If yes, then the only right answer is to vote in favor of today's bill.\"\n\nThe legislation, authored by Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth, includes four bills that aim to preserve access to IVF by prohibiting states from imposing restrictions on the treatment and making it more affordable. It would also expand access through insurance as well as for military members and veterans.\n\nDemocrats argue it's necessary for Congress to protect access to the fertility treatment after the Supreme Court in 2022 allowed states to ban abortions and the Alabama Supreme Court in February ruled that frozen embryos can be considered children under state law.\n\nRepublicans, who maintain they are supportive of IVF, criticized Thursday's vote as a political stunt and oppose the legislation as being an overreach.\n\nMORE: National Republican Senate Committee instructs GOP candidates to support birth control ahead of vote on contraception bill\n\nOn Wednesday, Republicans offered their own legislation that would ban states from getting access to Medicaid funding if they bar IVF services. The bill was co-sponsored by Sens. Katie Britt of Alabama and Ted Cruz of Texas.\n\nTheir attempt to pass the bill through unanimous request was blocked by Democrats who said it didn't go far enough to protect access.\n\nBritt and Cruz, in a joint statement on behalf of all 49 Republican senators, said ahead of Thursday's vote that Democrats were trying to \"mislead\" the public on this issue.\n\n\"Senate Democrats have embraced a Summer of Scare Tactics -- a partisan campaign of false fearmongering intended to mislead and confuse the American people,\" the statement read. \"In vitro fertilization is legal and available in every state across our nation.

This decision was based not on the merits, but on a lack of standing.\"\n\nSchumer then quickly pivoted to IVF, saying the question before lawmakers is \"very simple.\"\n\n\"Do we agree that Americans should be free to use IVF if they want to? Yes or no?\" Schumer continued. \"If yes, then the only right answer is to vote in favor of today's bill.\"\n\nThe legislation, authored by Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth, includes four bills that aim to preserve access to IVF by prohibiting states from imposing restrictions on the treatment and making it more affordable. It would also expand access through insurance as well as for military members and veterans.\n\nDemocrats argue it's necessary for Congress to protect access to the fertility treatment after the Supreme Court in 2022 allowed states to ban abortions and the Alabama Supreme Court in February ruled that frozen embryos can be considered children under state law.\n\nRepublicans, who maintain they are supportive of IVF, have criticized Thursday's vote as a political stunt and oppose the legislation as being an overreach.\n\nOn Wednesday, Republicans offered their own legislation that would ban states from getting access to Medicaid funding if they bar IVF services. The bill was co-sponsored by Sens. Katie Britt of Alabama and Ted Cruz of Texas.\n\nTheir attempt to pass the bill through unanimous request was blocked by Democrats who said it didn't go far enough to protect access.\n\nBritt and Cruz, in a joint statement on behalf of all 49 Republican senators, said ahead of Thursday's vote that Democrats were trying to \"mislead\" the public on this issue.\n\n\"Senate Democrats have embraced a Summer of Scare Tactics -- a partisan campaign of false fearmongering intended to mislead and confuse the American people,\" the statement read. \"In vitro fertilization is legal and available in every state across our nation.

Schumer today announced a new Senate vote will take place tomorrow on the Right To IVF Act. Schumer said the hard-right has threatened IVF clinics in Alabama and that worry is spreading across the country that reproductive freedoms will be ripped away from millions of Americans.\n\nSchumer said that's why he's putting this new legislation on the floor and a successful vote on the Right to IVF Act would establish a nationwide right to receive, provide, and cover this miracle treatment for families so they can have children even if experiencing fertility challenges.\n\n\"In-vitro fertilization is the reason millions of parents experience the joy of having a child, but unfortunately, the hard-right is attacking IVF access, and the treatment remains inaccessible to many families because of its high cost. That's why I'm bringing new legislation to the Senate floor to not only protect IVF access, but make it more affordable for Americans and New Yorkers so all families can achieve their dream of starting or growing a family,\" said Senator Schumer. \"Right now, want-to-be parents are worried about the financial burden of IVF treatment and terrified the far right is going to take away their path to starting a family. The Right to IVF Act would take historic steps to protect IVF access from extremist attempts to restrict fertility treatment while allowing people to access reproductive care without extraordinary out-of-pocket costs. It's urgent we protect IVF as a right for our families and pass this legislation ASAP to lower costs for family and make the treatment accessible for all.\"\n\nSchumer said since the overturning of Roe v. Wade, there has been attack after attack on one of the most pro-life medical breakthroughs in modern times that boasts overwhelming support among the American people: IVF. According to a new CBS News/YouGov poll, eighty-six percent of Americans support protecting IVF and say IVF should be legal. Schumer said protecting IVF is a no-brainer, commonsense action with broad support and it's imperative that families have the right to this treatment - while ensuring IVF is affordable and accessible to Americans and New Yorkers experiencing infertility. A summary of the legislation can be found here.\n\nSchumer explained sometimes IVF is the only option for families to have a child, but currently many people struggle to obtain these vital services because they don't have access or can't afford reproductive healthcare. Right now, the cost of IVF for families struggling to conceive is enormous -- costing tens of thousands of dollars for just one cycle of treatment. Costs for a single cycle of IVF are estimated to range from $15,000 to $20,000 and cost for the number of treatments needed to successfully conceive can easily exceed $40,000. Furthermore, IVF treatment is often not covered by insurance, so the cost of treatment can pose a significant access challenge for lower income individuals.\n\nSchumer said this legislation is also paramount as the hard-right tries to curtail IVF treatment across the country. The Alabama Supreme Court recently ruled to limit IVF treatment across the state, causing fertility clinics to shut down due to concerns about the legal repercussions of offering a full suite of fertility services. As extremists push for IVF access to be taken away across the country, families are facing barriers to reproductive care and are terrified that their only option to start a family could be jeopardized. Schumer said across Upstate NY, there are several fertility clinics working with families and using IVF, and that while New York may not seem like a state with IVF risks, federal roadblocks, or insurance industry changes could absolutely create problems for families, perhaps even dead ends.\n\nSchumer also said that struggling with infertility is painful enough and should not be made harder by families struggling to access vital treatment. The senator said every American deserves the right to have a child through IVF and should be able to access to tools they need to build the family of their dreams without fear or worry. Schumer said in New York alone, 10,502 infants were born in 2022 thanks to IVF and all New Yorkers should be able to experience this joy no matter their background.\n\nSchumer is a strong supporter in protecting and expanding access to IVF. In March, the senator brought Hudson Valley resident Kate Farley, who at the time was pregnant thanks to the miracle of IVF recently and recently had her second child via IVF, as his guest to attend President Biden's State of the Union address. Due to a genetic abnormality, IVF was the only option for Kate to get pregnant and avoid experiencing multiple miscarriages. Without IVF, Kate and her husband might never have had children, and would have endured years of emotionally and physically painful miscarriages in their attempts. Schumer said Kate's story exemplifies how vital it is that we ensure IVF treatment is accessible for families across the country.\n\nSchumer has been a relentless advocate for reproductive freedoms and is vowing to support protecting the right to reproductive technology like IVF. Following the Alabama SCOTUS decision, Schumer stood with Senators Duckworth, Murray, Klobuchar and Baldwin to express his support for protecting the right to IVF. In 2023, a year following the Supreme Court overturning Roe vs. Wade, Schumer re-introduced the Women's Health Protection Act, the federal legislation to guarantee access to abortion, everywhere across the country and restore the right to comprehensive reproductive health care for millions of Americans.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fertility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

Tammy Duckworth, a military veteran who has used the fertility treatment to have her two children, has championed the bill, called the Right to IVF Act. The bill would also expand access through insurance as well as for military members and veterans.\n\n\"These are real solutions that would help tens of thousands of Americans every year build the families of their dreams,\" Duckworth, D-Ill., said this week.\n\nBut most Republicans were expected to vote against advancing the measure, instead offering their own, alternative legislation that would discourage states from enacting outright bans on the treatment. Democrats in turn blocked it Wednesday.\n\nThe overtly political back-and-forth, with no attempt at finding a legislative compromise, showed how quickly Congress has shifted into a campaign mindset five months out from the fall election.\n\nAs Schumer seeks to protect a narrow Senate majority and buoy Democrats' hopes of holding the White House, he has sought to spotlight Republican intransigence to federal legislation that would guarantee women's rights to reproductive care. Democrats have campaigned heavily on the issue ever since the 2022 Supreme Court decision that ended a federal right to abortion.\n\nSchumer, a New York Democrat, also held a vote last week on legislation to protect access to contraception, but Republicans blocked it, arguing it was nothing more than a political stunt. Republicans have also blocked previous attempts to quickly pass IVF protections. They stressed that they support IVF and said Schumer was once again playing to the campaign trail with Thursday's vote.\n\n\"Despite some claims from my colleagues on the other side, protecting IVF is not a show vote at all. It's a show-us-who-you-are vote,\" Schumer said. \"This will be a chance for senators on both sides to show their support for strengthening treatments for people who start families.\"\n\nDemocrats say it is necessary for Congress to protect access to the fertility treatment after the Supreme Court in 2022 allowed states to ban abortions and the Alabama Supreme Court in February ruled that frozen embryos can be considered children under state law. Several clinics in the state suspended IVF treatments until the state enacted a law to provide legal protections for IVF clinics.\n\nSenate Democrats said it showed how all types of reproductive care could be upended in many parts of the country after Roe v. Wade was overturned.\n\nMost Republicans in Congress, meanwhile, have expressed support for IVF, but have also largely declined to tell states how to regulate reproductive care. Instead, two Republicans, Sens. Katie Britt of Alabama and Ted Cruz of Texas have sought to quickly pass a bill that would threaten to withhold Medicaid funding for states where IVF is banned. Democrats blocked that bill on Wednesday.\n\nCruz, who is running for reelection in Texas, said it showed Democrats were making a \"cynical political decision.\"\n\n\"They don't want to provide reassurance and comfort to millions of parents in America because instead, they want to spend millions of dollars running campaign ads suggesting the big, bad Republicans want to take away IVF,\" he said in a speech on the Senate floor.\n\nDemocrats argued that the GOP bill was insufficient because it would still allow states to enact laws that grant embryos or fetuses the same rights as a person. Abortion opponents in over a dozen states have advanced legislation based on the concept of fetal rights.\n\nSen. Patty Murray, the Washington Democrat who objected to quickly passing the GOP bill, dismissed it as \"nothing but a PR stunt.\"\n\nBut Republicans also criticized the Democratic bill. Britt said it \"extends far past IVF. It also treads on religious freedom and protection.\"\n\nIn the wake of the Alabama Supreme Court ruling, Christians, who have been a driving force in the anti-abortion movement based on the belief life begins at or around conception, have wrestled with the fertility treatment. The Southern Baptist Convention this week approved a nonbinding resolution that cautioned couples about using IVF.\n\nWith the Senate deadlocked on the issue, advocates for access to the treatment said families would be left in uncertainty.\n\nJamie Heard, who lives in Birmingham and had to suspend her effort to have a second child using IVF when the state Supreme Court made its decision, said the ruling left her both scared and angry. She has been able to continue the treatment, yet spoke alongside other IVF advocates at the Capitol Wednesday to urge lawmakers to act.\n\n\"There are still a lot of questions that we have about how to move forward,\" Heard said.\n\nTags Wire Senate Ivf Alabama Reproductive Care Women's Rights Legislation Politics Assisted Reproductive Technology Elections Health U.s.

Since the rightward-leaning Supreme Court abolished nationwide abortion rights two years ago, conservatives have sought to limit access to medication that helps prevent pregnancies and medication that helps end them, even though the drugs have long been shown to be safe and effective.\n\nSouthern Baptists are the largest protestant denomination in the country. As a demographic, they skew white and Republican.\n\nThe vote was held at an annual pastors' conference, which took place this year in Indianapolis.\n\nOne attendee, Daniel Taylor of Charity Baptist Church in Paris, Michigan, stood to recount how difficult -- but ultimately fulfilling -- it was for a Christian couple he knew to conceive their child through IVF.\n\n\"The child who was born was a gift from God,\" Taylor said. \"His life has so enriched us all ... because of him, I thank God for IVF.\"\n\nBut attendees rejected Taylor's proposed amendment to the resolution that would allow the procedure under certain circumstances in which embryos were not destroyed.\n\nThe process of IVF involves fertilizing an egg in a laboratory setting; the resulting embryo can then be frozen for transfer into a patient's uterus if it is deemed viable. Some religious conservatives, particularly those who believe life begins from the moment an egg is fertilized, have voiced opposition to the IVF process because it results in some embryos being either destroyed or used for medical research.\n\nAs a nation, though, Americans overwhelmingly support the widespread availability of IVF treatments.\n\nEarlier this year, Alabama's Supreme Court sparked a crisis in the Republican Party when it ruled that fertilized embryos are living children under state law -- forcing Alabama lawmakers to clarify in a bill that providers of IVF treatments have civil and criminal \"immunity.\"\n\nThe Southern Baptists' vote indicates that religious opposition to IVF is not dissipating.\n\n\"Couples who experience the searing pain of infertility can turn to God, look to Scripture for numerous examples of infertility, and know that their lament is heard by the Lord, who offers compassion and grace to those deeply afflicted by such realities,\" the measure states.\n\n\"Though all children are to be fully respected and protected, not all technological means of assisting human reproduction are equally God-honoring or morally justified,\" it says.\n\nThe Southern Baptists resolved to \"reaffirm the unconditional value and right to life of every human being, including those in an embryonic stage, and to only utilize reproductive technologies consistent with that affirmation.\"\n\nThey also called on congregants \"to advocate for the government to restrain actions inconsistent with the dignity and value of every human being, which necessarily includes frozen embryonic human beings.\"\n\nThe resolution offered adoption as an alternative to IVF.\n\nSouthern Baptists also narrowly rejected a proposal that would have cemented in their constitution a ban on churches led by women pastors.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Tammy Duckworth, a military veteran who has used the fertility treatment to have her two children, has championed the bill, called the Right to IVF Act. The bill would also expand access through insurance as well as for military members and veterans.\n\n\"These are real solutions that would help tens of thousands of Americans every year build the families of their dreams,\" Duckworth, D-Ill., said this week.\n\nBut most Republicans were expected to vote against advancing the measure, instead offering their own, alternative legislation that would discourage states from enacting outright bans on the treatment. Democrats in turn blocked it Wednesday.\n\nThe overtly political back-and-forth, with no attempt at finding a legislative compromise, showed how quickly Congress has shifted into a campaign mindset five months out from the fall election.\n\nAs Schumer seeks to protect a narrow Senate majority and buoy Democrats' hopes of holding the White House, he has sought to spotlight Republican intransigence to federal legislation that would guarantee women's rights to reproductive care. Democrats have campaigned heavily on the issue ever since the 2022 Supreme Court decision that ended a federal right to abortion.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., speaks to reporters about a vote to protect rights for access to in vitro fertilization to achieve pregnancy, at the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, June 12, 2024. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)\n\nSchumer, a New York Democrat, also held a vote last week on legislation to protect access to contraception, but Republicans blocked it, arguing it was nothing more than a political stunt. Republicans have also blocked previous attempts to quickly pass IVF protections. They stressed that they support IVF and said Schumer was once again playing to the campaign trail with Thursday's vote.\n\n\"Despite some claims from my colleagues on the other side, protecting IVF is not a show vote at all. It\u00b4s a show-us-who-you-are vote,\" Schumer said. \"This will be a chance for senators on both sides to show their support for strengthening treatments for people who start families.\"\n\nDemocrats say it is necessary for Congress to protect access to the fertility treatment after the Supreme Court in 2022 allowed states to ban abortions and the Alabama Supreme Court in February ruled that frozen embryos can be considered children under state law. Several clinics in the state suspended IVF treatments until the state enacted a law to provide legal protections for IVF clinics.\n\nSenate Democrats said it showed how all types of reproductive care could be upended in many parts of the country after Roe v. Wade was overturned.\n\nMost Republicans in Congress, meanwhile, have expressed support for IVF, but have also largely declined to tell states how to regulate reproductive care. Instead, two Republicans, Sens. Katie Britt of Alabama and Ted Cruz of Texas have sought to quickly pass a bill that would threaten to withhold Medicaid funding for states where IVF is banned. Democrats blocked that bill on Wednesday.\n\nCruz, who is running for reelection in Texas, said it showed Democrats were making a \"cynical political decision.\"\n\n\"They don\u00b4t want to provide reassurance and comfort to millions of parents in America because instead, they want to spend millions of dollars running campaign ads suggesting the big, bad Republicans want to take away IVF,\" he said in a speech on the Senate floor.\n\nDemocrats argued that the GOP bill was insufficient because it would still allow states to enact laws that grant embryos or fetuses the same rights as a person. Abortion opponents in over a dozen states have advanced legislation based on the concept of fetal rights.\n\nSen. Patty Murray, the Washington Democrat who objected to quickly passing the GOP bill, dismissed it as \"nothing but a PR stunt.\"\n\nBut Republicans also criticized the Democratic bill. Britt said it \"extends far past IVF. It also treads on religious freedom and protection.\"\n\nIn the wake of the Alabama Supreme Court ruling, Christians, who have been a driving force in the anti-abortion movement based on the belief life begins at or around conception, have wrestled with the fertility treatment. The Southern Baptist Convention this week approved a nonbinding resolution that cautioned couples about using IVF.\n\nWith the Senate deadlocked on the issue, advocates for access to the treatment said families would be left in uncertainty.\n\nJamie Heard, who lives in Birmingham and had to suspend her effort to have a second child using IVF when the state Supreme Court made its decision, said the ruling left her both scared and angry. She has been able to continue the treatment, yet spoke alongside other IVF advocates at the Capitol Wednesday to urge lawmakers to act.\n\n\"There are still a lot of questions that we have about how to move forward,\" Heard said.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammy_Duckworth", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tammy Duckworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assisted reproductive technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veteran", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Veteran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Alabama", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of Alabama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Women's rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Embryo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Birth control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Cruz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ted Cruz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Britt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Katie Britt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

Lisa Murkowski and Maine Sen. Susan Collins -- crossed party lines to support the bill, with other members of the GOP arguing that it went too far and decrying the effort as a show vote. The measure needed 60 votes to pass, but fell far short, failing in a 48-47 vote.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers say legislation is necessary after the Alabama Supreme Court ruled in February frozen embryos can be considered children under state law and that someone could be held liable for destroying them, prompting fertility clinics to pause IVF treatments. Alabama later passed a law granting clinics and health care workers criminal and civil immunity.\n\nThe bill Democrats put on the floor packages together four proposals:\n\nOne, sponsored by Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, would prohibit restricting access to assisted reproductive technology such as IVF. It would allow the U.S. attorney general, private citizens and health care providers to sue any state or local governments that interfere with someone seeking fertility treatments.\n\nDuckworth unsuccessfully sought unanimous consent -- a procedure that can expedite Senate business -- for the proposal in February. She also wants to require the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program to cover IVF and other assisted reproductive technology.\n\nAnother proposal, from Washington Sen. Patty Murray, would expand fertility treatments covered by service members' and veterans' health care plans to include the option to freeze their eggs or sperm before deployment to combat zones or when unable to conceive without assistance.\n\nAnd a plan by Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey would require employer-sponsored and public insurance plans to cover fertility treatments and standardize a baseline level of fertility treatment coverage under private plans.\n\nDemocrats blame Republicans for opening the door to questions about IVF by successfully pushing to overturn Roe v. Wade in the Supreme Court two years ago. The vote came hours after the Supreme Court unanimously rejected a bid to restrict access to abortion medication mifepristone.\n\nSenate Republicans largely say they, too, support IVF. They sought to counter the bill on Wednesday with legislation of their own -- a measure from GOP Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Katie Britt of Alabama would pull Medicaid funding from states that ban the treatment.\n\n\"Our goal is to make sure that any family's path to bringing a child into the world isn't compromised by preventable legal confusion,\" Cruz and Britt wrote in an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThey sought to pass the bill unanimously on Wednesday night, but it was blocked by Democrats who argued that it didn't go far enough. In a video posted on social media on Tuesday, Duckworth argued the Cruz-Britt bill would not protect IVF treatments that require an egg donor and opens an escape hatch for states that don't want to participate in Medicaid.\n\nRepublicans say there is no real threat to IVF and dismiss the Democrats' bill as an election-year political ploy. In a statement, 49 Republican senators, led by Cruz and Britt, accused their Democratic counterparts of embracing \"a Summer of Scare Tactics -- a partisan campaign of false fearmongering intended to mislead and confuse the American people.\"\n\n\"In vitro fertilization is legal and available in every state across our nation,\" the GOP lawmakers said. \"We strongly support continued nationwide access to IVF, which has allowed millions of aspiring parents to start and grow their families\n\nSenate Republicans last week blocked Democratic legislation that would have protected women's access to contraception, arguing that bill, too, was a political stunt.

In order to comprehend a market holistically, a variety of factors must be evaluated, including demographics, business cycles, and microeconomic requirements that pertain precisely to the market under study. In addition, the India In-Vitro Fertilization Services Market study demonstrates a detailed examination of the business state, which represents creative ways for company growth, financial factors such as production value, key regions, and growth rate. [Download Free Sample]\n\nReport Ocean, a leading strategic consulting and market research firm, in its recent study, estimated India in-vitro fertilization (IVF) services market size at USD 915.83 million in 2022.\n\nRead the Market Summary Here: -https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=bwcc17990\n\nDuring the forecast period between 2023 and 2029, Report Ocean expects India in-vitro fertilization (IVF) services market size to expand at a robust CAGR of 16.53% reaching a value of USD 2,652.9 million by 2029. Major growth drivers for the India in-vitro fertilization (IVF) services market include an increasing prevalence of delayed pregnancies, growing infertility cases, rising advancements in assisted reproductive technology (ART), surging IVF success rates, and high disposable income. Also, growing awareness about IVF treatments, coupled with changing societal attitudes towards infertility, has reduced the stigma associated with seeking assistance. This has led to a greater acceptance of IVF services and an increase in the number of individuals and couples opting for such treatments. Government initiatives, such as the provision of financial support and the implementation of regulations to ensure the safety and quality of IVF services, also play a significant role in driving the market forward. Notably, the prevalence of infertility rises due to an increase in various risk factors, including obesity, stress, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), sexually transmitted infections, endometrial tuberculosis, and other medical conditions. The expanding occurrence of these factors contributes to the growing demand for infertility treatments, creating a favorable market landscape during the forecast period. However, high cost of IVF treatments and lack of insurance coverage are anticipated to restrain the overall market growth during the period in analysis.\n\nIndia In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF) Services Market - Overview:\n\nIn vitro fertilization (IVF) is a widely practiced laboratory-based treatment for infertility. This assisted reproductive technology involves the extraction of one or more eggs from the ovaries, which are then fertilized by sperm in a controlled environment outside the body. It is a prominent fertility treatment within the clinical field. The IVF process encompasses several stages, including ovarian stimulation, egg retrieval, fertilization through insemination, embryo culture, and ultimately, the transfer of the developed embryo into the uterus. The duration of the treatment spans several months. In cases where natural methods have been unsuccessful, IVF offers an alternative approach to achieving conception.\n\nDownload Sample Report, SPECIAL OFFER (Avail an Up-to 30% discount on this report ) -https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=bwcc17990\n\nImpact of COVID-19 on India In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF) Services Market\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic adversely affected India in-vitro fertilization (IVF) services market. Lockdown measures and disruptions in healthcare services had a temporary impact on the accessibility and availability of IVF treatments in India. Many clinics suspended or limited their operations, resulting in a decline in the number of treatment cycles. Travel restrictions and financial uncertainties also led some individuals and couples to postpone their fertility plans. However, as restrictions eased and safety protocols were implemented, the market began showing signs of recovery. The pandemic underscored the significance of maintaining strong healthcare systems and ensuring the uninterrupted provision of reproductive healthcare services during challenging times.\n\nIndia In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF) Services Market - By Cycle Type:\n\nBased on cycle type, the India in-vitro fertilization (IVF) services market is divided into Fresh IVF Cycles, Thawed IVF Cycles, and Donor Egg IVF Cycles segments. The fresh IVF cycles segment holds the highest share in the India in-vitro fertilization (IVF) services market. The fresh IVF cycles offer higher success rates compared to frozen cycles, as fresh embryos have better implantation potential. The fresh cycles allow for a more personalized approach, as the treatment plan can be tailored according to the patient's specific needs and response to stimulation. Also, fresh cycles provide a higher chance of obtaining multiple embryos, which increases the possibility of having surplus embryos for future use. Meanwhile, the thawed IVF cycles segment is expected to witness fastest growth rate during the forecast period due to advancements in cryopreservation techniques, improved success rates of frozen embryo transfers, and the convenience it offers in terms of scheduling and treatment planning for patients.\n\nCompetitive Landscape:\n\nMajor players operating in the India in-vitro fertilization services market include: ART Fertility Clinics, Bavishi Fertility Institute, Craft Hospital & Research Centre, Dr. Thomas Fertility Center/Chennai Fertility Centers, Gunasheela Hospital, Iswarya Fertility Center, Lifeline Hospitals, Nova IVI Fertility, and Oasis Centre.

Schumer (D-N.Y.) on the topic of reproductive rights, a political liability for Republicans ahead of the 2024 election. Last week, all but two Senate Republicans rejected a bill that would have created a federal right to access to contraception.\n\nSchumer is trying to protect his narrow majority ahead of a tough election in which Democrats are playing defense in several red and purple states.\n\nDuring remarks on the Senate floor Thursday morning, Schumer warned of a \"modern-day dark age for women's fundamental freedoms.\"\n\n\"The antiabortion movement is not yet finished. Now that Roe is gone, they have set their sights on a new target: in vitro fertilization,\" Schumer said, referring to the Supreme Court's 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade. \"So today the question before the Senate is very simple: Do we agree that Americans should be free to use IVF if they want to?\"\n\nIn a joint statement released Wednesday, all 49 GOP senators accused their Democratic colleagues of a \"Summer of Scare Tactics\" meant to mislead Americans.\n\n\"In vitro fertilization is legal and available in every state across our nation,\" the statement said. \"We strongly support continued nationwide access to IVF, which has allowed millions of aspiring parents to start and grow their families.\"\n\nRepublican Sens. Katie Boyd Britt (Ala.) and Ted Cruz (Tex.) have introduced their own bill that seeks to protect IVF, but Democrats blocked an effort to consider it Wednesday.\n\nIVF erupted as an election-year issue in February when the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos are people and that a person could be liable for destroying them, casting uncertainty over the future of IVF nationwide. Democrats called it the latest consequence of the overturning of Roe v. Wade, while most Republicans scrambled to show support for IVF.\n\nTrump issued a statement of support for IVF, saying Republicans \"want to make it easier for mothers and fathers to have babies, not harder.\"\n\nWithin weeks of the Alabama ruling, the state's GOP governor, Kay Ivey, signed a bill into law that shields IVF patients from legal liability if the embryos they create are damaged or destroyed.\n\nThe anticipated vote in the Senate comes a day after the Southern Baptist Convention voted to oppose IVF, calling it \"dehumanizing\" and asking the government to restrict the practice. On Monday, Trump addressed the Danbury Institute, a coalition of Christian groups that oppose abortion under any circumstance, and promised to be with them \"side by side.\"\n\nBiden's campaign pointed to Trump's Danbury Institute remarks Thursday ahead of the Senate vote to protect IVF.\n\n\"Donald Trump has been clear: He's proud to fight 'side by side' with anti-IVF extremists, and he's grateful for their 'tremendous support' of his campaign,\" Biden campaign spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said in a statement. \"He's 'proud' that he overturned Roe v. Wade, laying the groundwork for his anti-IVF allies to rip away women's access to care and their freedom to start a family when and how they choose.\"\n\nThe anticipated IVF vote is coming the same day that Trump is visiting Washington to hold meetings with House and Senate Republicans. In floor remarks Thursday morning, Schumer invoked Trump's visit while dismissing the seriousness of the pro-IVF statement signed by all GOP senators.\n\n\"It shows you how afraid they are of the issue, but how they're tied in a knot by the MAGA hard right on choice, and they can't do anything that the American people want,\" Schumer said.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "patrick_svitek@washingtonpost.com", "name": "Patrick Svitek", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

Tammy Duckworth, a military veteran who has used the fertility treatment to have her two children, has championed the bill, called the Right to IVF Act. The bill would also expand access through insurance as well as for military members and veterans.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\n\"These are real solutions that would help tens of thousands of Americans every year build the families of their dreams,\" Duckworth, D-Ill., said this week.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBut almost all Republicans voted against advancing the measure, ensuring that it fell short of the 60 votes needed. Instead, GOP senators offered their own, alternative legislation that would discourage states from enacting outright bans on the treatment. Democrats in turn blocked it Wednesday.\n\nThe overtly political back-and-forth, with no attempt at finding a legislative compromise, showed how quickly Congress has shifted into a campaign mindset five months out from the fall election.\n\nAs Schumer seeks to protect a narrow Senate majority and buoy Democrats' hopes of holding the White House, he has sought to spotlight Republican intransigence to federal legislation that would guarantee women's rights to reproductive care. Democrats have campaigned heavily on the issue ever since the 2022 Supreme Court decision that ended a federal right to abortion.\n\n\"The anti-abortion movement is not yet finished. Now that Roe is gone, they have set their sights to a new target -- in vitro fertilization,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor Thursday. \"So today, the question before the Senate is very simple. Do we agree that Americans should be free to use IVF if they want to, yes or no?\"\n\nSchumer, a New York Democrat, also held a vote last week on legislation to protect access to contraception, but Republicans blocked it, arguing it was nothing more than a political stunt. Republicans have also blocked previous attempts to quickly pass IVF protections. They stressed that they support IVF and said Schumer was once again playing to the campaign trail with Thursday's vote.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nDemocrats took to the Senate floor Thursday to make a series of speeches that highlighted personal stories of how people have been able to have children using IVF. They say Congress must protect access to the fertility treatment after the Supreme Court in 2022 allowed states to ban abortions and the Alabama Supreme Court in February ruled that frozen embryos can be considered children under state law. Several clinics in the state suspended IVF treatments until the state enacted a law to provide legal protections for IVF clinics.\n\n\"After the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that a frozen embryo is the same, has the exact same rights as a living, breathing person, women who waited for months and spent tens of thousands of dollars and were days away from an IVF appointment were left to wonder if it was all for nothing when their treatment was abruptly canceled,\" said Sen. Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat.\n\nSenate Democrats said it showed how all types of reproductive care could be upended in many parts of the country after Roe v. Wade was overturned.\n\nMost Republicans in Congress, meanwhile, have expressed support for IVF, but have also largely declined to tell states how to regulate reproductive care. Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican GOP presidential nominee, met with House lawmakers on Thursday morning and told them that abortion rules should be left to the states. He also said he supported exceptions for rape, incest and to save the life of the mother, according to Republicans in the meeting.\n\nRepublicans are seeking to come up with a response to voters' concerns about access to abortion and reproductive care -- an issue that is expected to figure largely in the November election. Following the Supreme Court's ruling Thursday that preserved access to the abortion pill mifepristone, anti-abortion groups expressed dismay while most Republicans remained quiet.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIn the Senate this week, Republicans highlighted their efforts to expand access to fertility treatments, yet stopped short of endorsing the Democratic plan.\n\nSen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, said in a floor speech this week that his daughter was currently receiving IVF treatment and spoke of a proposal to expand the flexibility of health savings accounts. Two other GOP Republicans, Sens. Katie Britt of Alabama and Ted Cruz of Texas, also tried to quickly pass a bill that would threaten to withhold Medicaid funding for states where IVF is banned.\n\nDemocrats blocked that bill on Wednesday.\n\nCruz, who is running for reelection in Texas, said it showed Democrats were making a \"cynical political decision.\"\n\n\"They don't want to provide reassurance and comfort to millions of parents in America because instead, they want to spend millions of dollars running campaign ads suggesting the big, bad Republicans want to take away IVF,\" he said in a speech on the Senate floor.\n\nDemocrats argued that the GOP bill was insufficient because it would still allow states to enact laws that grant embryos or fetuses the same rights as a person. Abortion opponents in over a dozen states have advanced legislation based on the concept of fetal rights.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nSen. Patty Murray, the Washington Democrat who objected to quickly passing the GOP bill, dismissed it as \"nothing but a PR stunt.\"\n\nBut Republicans also criticized the Democratic bill. Britt said it \"extends far past IVF. It also treads on religious freedom and protection.\"\n\nIn the wake of the Alabama Supreme Court ruling, Christians, who have been a driving force in the anti-abortion movement based on the belief life begins at or around conception, have wrestled with the fertility treatment. The Southern Baptist Convention this week approved a nonbinding resolution that cautioned couples about using IVF.\n\nWith the Senate deadlocked on the issue, advocates for access to the treatment said families would be left in uncertainty.\n\nJamie Heard, who lives in Birmingham and had to suspend her effort to have a second child using IVF when the state Supreme Court made its decision, said the ruling left her both scared and angry. She has been able to continue the treatment, yet spoke alongside other IVF advocates at the Capitol Wednesday to urge lawmakers to act.\n\n\"There are still a lot of questions that we have about how to move forward,\" Heard said.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammy_Duckworth", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tammy Duckworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assisted reproductive technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Alabama", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of Alabama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veteran", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Veteran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Embryo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

The court said frozen embryos are legally considered children and are protected under the state's Wrongful Death of a Minor Act, a ruling that sparked national debate.\n\nDebate on the floor of the convention over the resolution exhibited division within the nation's largest Protestant denomination is over the issue. The statement is the first of its kind for the SBC but could reverberate across other conservative denominations.\n\n\"This resolution would castigate and condemn the entirely moral and ethical actions of these two friends of mine calling their faithful sacrifice, struggle and blessing a wicked thing,\" Michigan messenger Daniel Taylor said during the floor debate, alluding to friends who used IVF to have children. \"It would also unnecessarily make it more difficult for all of us to reach those who have gone through IVF as parents or children.\"\n\nTaylor proposed an amendment to the resolution to soften certain language. Messengers overwhelmingly voted against the amendment, leading to a vote immediately after to adopt the resolution in its original form.\n\nThe resolutions committee recommended the full convention adopt the statement after receiving a draft authored by Al Mohler, president of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, and Southern seminary professor Andrew Walker.\n\nTuesday updates SBC live updates: Virginia church ousted over woman pastor\n\nMohler, a leading contemporary evangelical Christian voice in the U.S., has opposed IVF for two decades and has cited what he views as other potentially problematic components, such as how IVF can allow same-sex couples or a single woman to have children.\n\n\"In our churches, we have compromise on this issue,\" said Mohler during an address at a luncheon Monday ahead of the convention's expected vote on the resolution. \"A lot of evangelicals don't want to state the proposition clearly.\"\n\nMany conservatives, even those who oppose abortion, have supported IVF and how it has allowed countless Americans to start families who might otherwise be unable to do so. In the wake of the Alabama court's rulings, many in the GOP voiced their support and state lawmakers approved a legislative fix to protect IVF providers.\n\nAbout 2% of births a year involve IVF, a process by which multiple eggs are harvested, fertilized and implanted to create a pregnancy. The Alabama ruling and the stance by the SBC raise questions about what should happen with unused embryos.\n\nA Pew Research Center report in May said 63% of white evangelical Protestants believe IVF is good and 28% were unsure. The percentages were similar those of Catholics, a religious group that is more well-known for opposing IVF and surrogacy.\n\nThe SBC's resolution contends that IVF \"most often engages in the destruction of embryonic human life and increasingly engages in dehumanizing methods for determining suitability for life.\"\n\nIt calls on Southern Baptists to \"advocate for the government to restrain actions inconsistent with the dignity and value of every human being, which necessarily includes frozen embryonic human beings.\"\n\nThe debate on Wednesday echoed one from two years ago, when the convention fought over Southern Baptists' commitment to pro-life ideals. Opposition conservatives supported an abolitionist anti-abortion stance that supports charging women with crimes for having abortions. Proponents of the abolitionist stance decried Southern Baptists who align with an incrementalist anti-abortion view as insufficiently pro-life.\n\nThe 2022 SBC annual meeting also included an ultimately unsuccessful push to abolish the denomination's public policy arm, the Nashville-based Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission, for rejecting abolitionist proposals.\n\nBut with IVF, the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission drew a line in the sand in a May 24 letter urging Congress to limit access and funding for the medical procedure.\n\nA similar attempt to abolish the public policy arm at this year's SBC annual meeting failed on Wednesday morning.\n\nBackground: Southern Baptists to debate measure opposing IVF following Alabama court ruling", "source": {"uri":

Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Roger Marshall (R-KS) in support of the IVF Protection Act. The bill, which aims to ensure nationwide access to in vitro fertilization, was blocked by Senate Democrats.\n\n\"The entire Republican conference has signed a statement led by @SenKatieBritt on the eve of Democrats' IVF vote, calling it a 'partisan campaign of false fear mongering intended to mislead and confuse the American people,'\" Julie Tsirkin of NBC News tweeted.\n\nLast month, Sens. Britt (R-Montgomery) and Cruz introduced the IVF Protection Act and became more vocal than ever about protecting the practice into law.\n\nRELATED: Katie Britt blasts Democrat 'Summer of Scare Tactics' over misleading contraception debate\n\nWednesday, Sen. Britt passionately spoke about the joy of motherhood and the crucial role IVF plays in helping aspiring parents experience the miracle of life. \"As a mom, I know firsthand that there is no greater joy in this life than that of being a mother. IVF helps aspiring parents across our nation experience the miracle of life, and start and grow a family. That's why I strongly support continued nationwide IVF access,\" Britt said.\n\nShe highlighted the pro-family nature of IVF access and its importance to millions facing infertility. She pointed out that about 2% of U.S. babies are born via IVF. Britt stressed the need for continued nationwide IVF access, noting the millions born with IVF's help in recent decades. She also acknowledged Alabama's swift action earlier this year to protect IVF access.\n\n\"IVF is legal and available in every single state across America. That includes my home state, where Governor Ivey and the Alabama Legislature acted quickly and overwhelmingly earlier this year to protect IVF access for our state's families.\"\n\nThe IVF Protection Act aims to provide aspiring parents with certainty and peace of mind regarding IVF's legal status nationwide. Britt emphasized the bill's focus on protecting IVF access and safeguarding religious liberties, urging swift Senate support. Senator Britt expressed disappointment that Senate Democrats have blocked the IVF Protection Act, attributing their actions to partisan politics. She accused them of using scare tactics and emphasized the need for common-ground solutions rather than political show votes.\n\nRELATED: Britt says in vitro fertilization is pro-family, 'deserves protection'\n\nBritt commended Senator Cruz for his leadership on IVF access and reaffirmed her commitment to fighting for families.\n\n\"At the end of the day, the American people want secure borders, they want safe streets, they want stable prices, and they want strong families. My colleagues across the aisle know that they can't sell the Biden Administration's record on any of these topics. It's been failure after failure, yet again. So instead, they have to rely on distorting and misrepresenting Republicans' position on issues, including our support for IVF access. The bottom line is, the American people deserve better. And there is no better path out there than our bill. The path of common-ground solutions, not show votes or scare tactics.\"\n\nRepublican senators have highlighted IVF access as a top issue in the run-up to the fall general elections amidst ongoing political debates.\n\nGrayson Everett is the state and political editor for Yellowhammer News.

But the GOP says Democrats are playing politics -- and indicating they'll almost uniformly oppose the legislation, on the basis that it \"treads on religious freedom and protection,\" as Britt put it.\n\n\"The bottom line is the American people deserve better, Britt said, accusing Democrats of engaging in \"scare tactics.\"\n\nThough there is plenty of political messaging going on here with these dueling bills, the notion that Democratic warnings about the security of IVF under Republican rule amount only to \"scare tactics\" is laughable. Conservatives spent decades focused on overturning the abortion protections codified by Roe, and finally succeeded in 2022 with the right-wing Supreme Court's Dobbs decision. The right has sought to build on that victory since then, including with attacks on birth control and medication abortion. Access to the latter was upheld for now by the Supreme Court on Thursday, when it ruled that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the Food and Drug Administration's approach to mifepristone. But the threats to reproductive healthcare still loom: Donald Trump, the former president who appointed three of the six Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe, vowed in virtual remarks Monday to work \"side by side\" with the Danbury Institute, a radical anti-abortion Christian coalition. \"Your work is so important,\" Trump told the group, as members gathered in Indianapolis in conjunction with the annual meeting of the Southern Baptist Convention, which voted Wednesday to oppose IVF.\n\n\"It took us 50 years to take down Roe,\" Brent Leatherwood, president of the SBC's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, told Politico. \"It may take us a similarly long time frame to get people to a place where they are thinking more deeply about something like this. It's okay. It takes time. We have to be patient.\"\n\nDobbs, on its own, has been a major political liability for Republicans over the last two years, and they have every incentive to put some political distance between themselves and those in their movement seeking to take their crusade even further. But Democrats should continue to make clear what GOP leadership would mean for reproductive rights in America: \"The threat to IVF is not hypothetical,\" Murray told reporters Wednesday, citing the Alabama Supreme Court's decision in February to designate embryos as human beings. \"Republican efforts to dismiss this vote as fearmongering are simply not going to fly.\"", "source": {"uri": "vanityfair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vanity Fair"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conde_nast@vanityfair.com", "name": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammy_Duckworth", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tammy Duckworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arson", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Cruz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ted Cruz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Britt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Katie Britt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medicaid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

Cory Booker, D-N.J.; Patty Murray, D-Wash.; and Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill. It includes four bills that aim to preserve access to IVF by prohibiting states from imposing restrictions on the treatment and making it more affordable.\n\nBut a majority of Republicans are expected to block the legislation on a procedural vote, deeming the bill unnecessary and politically motivated, despite saying they back access to IVF. Instead, Sens. Katie Britt, R-Ala., and Ted Cruz, R-Texas, attempted to pass their own, much narrower IVF bill Wednesday evening but Murray objected, blocking a vote after Democrats called the legislation \"dangerous\" and \"a step backwards.\"\n\nThe GOP bill, the IVF Protection Act, would withhold key Medicaid funding to any states that ban access to IVF, but it does not address the potential legal consequences of discarding nonviable embryos. That's the key issue, Democrats argue, and a major question for providers and doctors, particularly after an Alabama Supreme Court ruling earlier this year called into question whether frozen embryos created during fertility treatments should be considered children.\n\nRead more: https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/democrats-force-vote-protections-ivf-election-year-messaging-heats-rcna156413", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patty_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patty Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Birth control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Britt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Katie Britt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammy_Duckworth", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tammy Duckworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Booker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cory Booker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Cruz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ted Cruz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Alabama", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of Alabama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medicaid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assisted reproductive technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Embryo"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Medical_Billing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Medical Billing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Infertility", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Infertility", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Universal_Design", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Universal Design", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9641932", "eventUri": "eng-9641932", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2012-06-", "textStart": 18, "textEnd": 25}], "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Wade nears.\n\nDemocrats have been pushing for reproductive rights-focused bills ahead of the anniversary, albeit unsuccessfully so far, in an effort to contrast themselves with Republicans ahead of the election.\n\nThough Democrats are likely to be unified behind the IVF package introduced by Democratic Sens. Patty Murray of Washington, Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and Cory Booker of New Jersey, Republicans have said they plan to oppose it.\n\n\"You never know, you don't give up till the end,\" Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a co-sponsor of the bill, said in an interview ahead of the vote when asked about the bill's chances of passing.\n\n\"We're making this point like, 'come on, if you say you're for this, then be for it,'\" Klobuchar continued, referring to Republicans. Fellow Minnesota Democratic Sen. Tina Smith also supports the legislation.\n\nThe bill would establish a statutory right for patients to access IVF, for providers to be able to provide IVF and for insurers to cover the procedure \"without prohibition, limitation, interference or impediment.\"\n\nLast week, Senate Republicans blocked a bill that would have protected the right to contraception access, characterizing the legislation as a political maneuver by Democrats in an election year.\n\nSenate Republicans also blocked similar IVF legislation led by Duckworth, which was brought forward in response to the Alabama Supreme Court's ruling that frozen embryos should be considered children.\n\nThe 2022 Dobbs decision helped Democrats in the midterms that year and may have prevented Republicans' chances of the red wave they had anticipated that year.\n\nAware of that vulnerability heading into 2024, the National Republican Senatorial Committee quickly called on GOP candidates to reject any government efforts to restrict IVF.\n\nRepublican Sens. Katie Britt of Alabama and Ted Cruz of Texas had introduced their own version of an IVF protections bill that would have barred states from receiving Medicaid funding if they banned access to IVF.\n\nBut Democrats said the GOP bill had loopholes that would have allowed states to restrict IVF and blocked the Republican-led legislation.\n\nAs in 2022, Klobuchar anticipates reproductive rights will again be a driving issue for voters at the polls.\n\n\"You could just sit back and say, 'oh, we can't pass this,' no, you want to make as good a bill so you're ready to go for the day when we can pass it,\" Klobuchar said. \"That's what we're doing with this.\"\n\n\"And then you make it very clear which side you're on when it comes to voting,\" Klobuchar continued. \"And eventually, you gain votes and that's how you pass anything, and I do think it'll be a major issue in the election.\"\n\nMeta Getman and Miraya Gran, two Minnesota mothers who underwent IVF, along with advocates from Resolve, a national infertility association, have been at the U.S. Capitol this week to meet with lawmakers and share their stories about the challenges they faced with accessing IVF.\n\nBoth were vocal in trying to pass legislation this session which would have put requirements on insurers to cover infertility treatment, but the bill did not pass.\n\n\"I hope it's an opportunity for anyone who's in the opposition to really hear these stories of factual, real life, things that are happening in Americans' lives,\" Gran said.\n\n\"Regardless of the outcome, I'm incredibly grateful that the conversation around infertility and IVF is more public because so many people are suffering in silence and so many people feel so alone.\" Getman said.", "source": {"uri": "startribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Star Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sydney_kashiwagi@startribune.com", "name": "Sydney Kashiwagi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Klobuchar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amy Klobuchar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammy_Duckworth", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tammy Duckworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Booker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cory Booker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patty_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patty Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

The state supreme court ruled that such embryos should be considered children, exposing clinics to wrongful death claims in the event they are destroyed in the thawing process. The state later passed a law protecting IVF and allowing clinics to resume operations.\n\nIn 2021, more than 80% of U.S. IVF procedures involved the transfer of frozen embryos, according to a recent report by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nUndermining use of frozen embryos in IVF would introduce many uncertainties, delays and possible additional expenses, according to fertility experts. Here is what you need to know about the process and its benefits:\n\nHow Is Embryo Freezing Used In IVF?\n\nIVF uses high doses of hormones to stimulate ovaries to produce as many eggs as possible. Once the eggs are extracted, the most mature are selected for attempts at fertilization with sperm.\n\nOver the next five to six days, healthy fertilized eggs grow into blastocysts - the earliest stage of embryo - containing roughly 100-200 cells. Blastocysts can be transferred into the uterus or frozen to be thawed for later use.\n\nAfter transfer into the uterus, if all goes well, the blastocyst implants itself in the wall of the womb and continues to grow.\n\nTypically, if 20 eggs are retrieved after ovarian stimulation, about 16 will be mature, about 12 of those will fertilize when combined with sperm, and perhaps six will grow into healthy blastocysts with good potential for implanting and resulting in a successful pregnancy, said Dr. Zev Williams, chief of the division of reproductive endocrinology and infertility at Columbia University Fertility Center in New York.\n\nWhat Are Some Benefits Of Using Frozen Embryos In IVF?\n\nFor some patients, freezing embryos and then waiting several weeks before a transfer into the uterus is more likely to lead to successful implantation, depending on their age, underlying health or hormone levels.\n\nThe pause allows the body's hormone levels to normalize following ovarian stimulation. It also reduces the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, a potentially life-threatening effect of intense hormone use.\n\nMore broadly, freezing embryos often means that only one course of painful, expensive ovarian stimulation and egg retrieval is needed. If an embryo transfer fails, additional embryos can be thawed and used.\n\nPregnancies with twins or triplets were more common with IVF before embryo freezing, as doctors would transfer more than one embryo at a time to increase the chances of a successful pregnancy.\n\nFreezing of embryos also allows patients to preserve fertility in advance of chemotherapy or other treatments that can damage the reproductive organs.\n\nGenetic screening of embryos before a transfer is only possible with freezing because it can take several weeks to get results. It is often employed when there is a history of recurrent miscarriages, previous IVF failures and maternal age over 35 or a family history of genetic diseases.\n\nWhat If Freezing Embryos For Ivf Became Unavailable?\n\nThe loss of the option to freeze embryos for later usage would represent a significant setback for the field, said Dr. Steven Spandorfer of Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City, president of the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology.\n\nA single pregnancy is the best way to promote the birth of a healthy child after IVF, so clinics are unlikely to return to the practice of transferring multiple embryos into the womb, Spandorfer said.\n\nClinics could freeze eggs instead of embryos, but that approach has many limitations that would lower the overall success of IVF.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nThe viability of those eggs would not be clear until they are individually thawed and IVF is attempted, creating the potential for delayed embryo transfers and the need for additional hormone use and retrievals.\n\n(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri":

There's not a problem,\" Sen. John Cornyn told reporters, per CNN. \"There's no restrictions on IVF, nor should there be.\" The bill needed 60 votes to proceed; the count was 48-47. Only two Republicans, Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins, voted in favor. The caucus has supported a bill with more limited protections.\n\nInstead, the entire GOP caucus signed onto a letter attesting its support for access to IVF. Sen. Patty Murray, who cosponsored the Democratic bill, was unimpressed. \"Their bill has huge loopholes that would let states restrict IVF in all different kinds of ways,\" Murray said, per NBC News. \"It purposefully ignores what happens to unused embryos, and it would do nothing to stop fetal personhood laws from totally upending IVF care.\"\n\nThe issue has heated up since the Alabama Supreme Court issued a ruling in February that led to clinics in the state suspending IVF services. On Wednesday, Southern Baptists voted in their annual convention to oppose IVF. Democrats are trying to put Republicans on the record on the issue; Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer did that last week with a bill to establish access to contraception as a right.

Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Susan Collins, R-Maine. Others in the GOP said the legislation went too far, instead signing on to a scaled-back version that Democrats said was ineffectual.\n\nThe Right To IVF Act was brought up for a vote by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., to put the GOP in a political predicament less than five months before the 2024 elections. Democrats say the conservative-led Supreme Court's decision in 2022 to eliminate federal abortion rights means that access to contraception and IVF are also at risk.\n\nIntroduced by Sens. Patty Murray, D-Wash., Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., and Cory Booker, D-N.J., it would establish a federal right for individuals to access IVF-assisted reproductive technology services, for providers to offer the procedure and for insurers to cover it. Those rights could not be hindered by states.\n\nAt the heart of the tension is a belief among many social conservatives that life begins at conception. If written into law, that could mean that embryos discarded as part of the IVF process -- a common occurrence -- are treated as murder or manslaughter. Many Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., have signed on to legislation that would give a fertilized egg the rights of a person.\n\nAhead of the vote, Senate Republicans moved to express their support for IVF. They sought to advance a narrower bill that would cut off Medicaid funding for states if they banned IVF. All 49 GOP senators signed a statement by Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., accusing Democrats of waging \"a partisan campaign of false fearmongering intended to mislead and confuse the American people.\"\n\n\"We strongly support continued nationwide access to IVF, which has allowed millions of aspiring parents to start and grow their families,\" the senators said in the statement.\n\nMurray said the GOP rhetoric is hollow as \"actions speak louder than words -- and the record here tells a very different story.\"\n\n\"Republicans have introduced their own legislation so they can pretend to address the same problem they say doesn't exist, but their bill has huge loopholes that would let states restrict IVF in all different kinds of ways,\" she told reporters. \"It purposefully ignores what happens to unused embryos, and it would do nothing to stop fetal personhood laws from totally upending IVF care.\"\n\nIn an interview before the vote, Murray argued that part of the goal is to convey to voters that the way to protect reproductive rights going forward is to elect more Democrats in the 2024 elections.\n\n\"I think it's pretty clear where the votes are in the current U.S. Senate,\" she said. \"And the next election

However, they are more divided about destroying frozen human embryos created by in-vitro fertilization, with 49% believing it is moral to do so and 43% disagreeing.\n\nThese results are based on Gallup's annual Values and Beliefs poll, conducted May 1-23, and mark the first time the survey has asked about IVF.\n\nIn February, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that embryos should be considered children under state law. IVF providers in the state responded by ceasing to offer services for fear of being held liable if embryos were destroyed. Weeks later, the Alabama government passed a law to exempt IVF providers from criminal prosecution, allowing them to reopen.\n\nBoth the Republican and Democratic parties have introduced bills in the U.S. Senate aimed at protecting access to IVF nationally, with the Democratic version expected to face a procedural vote this week.\n\nWithin the general public, large majorities of Democrats, independents and Republicans consider IVF morally acceptable. However, Democrats are the only partisan group that finds destroying frozen embryos to be moral, while independents and Republicans are more divided.\n\nReligiosity is another important factor in explaining views of IVF. The most religious Americans, defined as those who attend religious services every week, are much less inclined than others to say IVF is morally acceptable. Sixty-three percent of weekly churchgoers believe IVF is acceptable, compared with 77% who attend services nearly weekly or monthly, and 91% who seldom or never attend.\n\nFurther, a majority of the most religious Americans consider destroying frozen embryos created by IVF to be morally wrong. In contrast, 55% of those who seldom or never attend religious services believe destroying frozen embryos is acceptable. Those who attend nearly weekly or monthly are about evenly split in their views of its moral acceptability.\n\nEach year in its Values and Beliefs poll, Gallup asks Americans whether they believe a wide range of behaviors and practices are morally acceptable or morally wrong. IVF trails only birth control (90%) in moral acceptability.\n\nDiscarding frozen embryos resides near the middle of the list of 19 issues, rated similarly to medical testing on animals. Americans are most likely to say extramarital affairs, suicide and polygamy are morally wrong.\n\nNone of these items show meaningful change compared with last year, with the exception of the death penalty. Fewer people today than a year ago consider the death penalty moral, returning public attitudes on it to 2022 levels.\n\nOver time, Americans have become much more permissive in their views of these issues than they were when Gallup first asked about them, with many of the trends dating back to 2001.\n\nAlabama is one of four U.S. states having laws that grant legal protections to human embryos, and 12 more states have had bills introduced to do the same. Similar legislation has been introduced, but has yet to advance, in Congress. A slim majority of 51% of U.S. adults are opposed to granting embryos some legal rights, while 43% are in favor.\n\nMost Republicans (64%) are in favor of extending legal protections to embryos, while a larger majority of Democrats (73%) are opposed. Independents tilt more toward opposition (50%) than support (43%).\n\nViews by religiosity are mirror images of each other -- 62% of those who attend religious services every week favor such laws, while 62% of those who seldom or never attend are opposed. People who occasionally attend church are evenly divided.\n\nThere are also differences by education, with college graduates mostly opposed to legal protections, while those with a high school education or less show slight support, with 51% in favor.\n\nA majority of people residing in the South favor extending legal protections to human embryos, but majorities in the other U.S. regions are opposed.\n\nIn-vitro fertilization has been thrust into the political conversation this year after the Alabama Supreme Court ruling. Democrats portrayed the ruling as a direct result of the Supreme Court's 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade. Many elected Republicans who support laws to grant legal rights to human embryos voiced their support for the practice of IVF, generally, even though the practice commonly involves disposing of unused embryos.\n\nBroadly speaking, Americans from across the political spectrum favor IVF, although they are split over whether destroying human embryos created through IVF is appropriate and whether there should be laws giving them some of the same legal protections as people.", "source": {"uri": "news.gallup.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gallup.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Embryo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Alabama", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of Alabama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallup,_Inc.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gallup, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygamy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Polygamy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Birth control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Capital punishment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_spectrum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political spectrum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

John Hickenlooper of Colorado discussing the upcoming vote this week on the Right to IVF Act, introduced by Senate Democrats in response to the Alabama Supreme Court ruling that caused chaos for family planning clinics and the families that result on them by declaring frozen embryos to be legal persons under the state's constitutional abortion ban. From an explainer released last week by Sen. Patty Murray of Washington:\n\nRepealing Roe empowered extreme Republican legislators and judges to rewrite State Constitutions and laws to redefine the concept of a living, breathing human being to include frozen, extrauterine embryos -- a belief founded in theology, rather than medical science and basic commonsense. Laws defining an embryo as constituting a living, breathing human being render IVF, as provided in accordance with widely accepted and evidence-based medical standards of care, to constitute manslaughter or murder due to the disposal of fertilized eggs.\n\nThe fringe so-called personhood movement successfully shutdown all IVF clinics in Alabama without ever explicitly prohibiting the performance of IVF. This tragic incident was a chilling and heartbreaking manifestation of the cascading harms that directly flow from Donald Trump's destruction of Roe v. Wade. Even the Alabama Republican's so-called legislative \"fix\" perpetuated the offensive Republican view that IVF is a criminal and immoral act that requires patients and doctors to receive criminal and civil immunity to engage in it.\n\nAs NBC News reports, this Democratic legislation is much stronger than a competing bill offered by GOP Sens. Katie \"Serena Joy\" Britt and \"Cancun Ted\" Cruz:\n\nThe [GOP] legislation was quickly met with backlash from reproductive rights groups and Senate Democrats, who say that it falls short because of its vague definition of the procedure that excludes discarding frozen embryos and that it doesn't explicitly prohibit states from implementing restrictive policies surrounding IVF.\n\n\"Unlike GOP legislation that would not protect IVF and is only a PR tool for Republicans to hide their extremism, our Right to IVF Act would actually protect Americans from attempts to restrict IVF and would allow more people to access these vital services at a lower cost,\" Murray said in a statement. [Pols emphasis]\n\nThe standoff over protecting in vitro fertilization is similar to the conflict that resulted in Senate Republicans blocking a bill last week to protect contraception access after ex-President Donald Trump stated before walking it back that he was \"looking at\" limiting access to contraception-which Republicans working on Trump's \"Project 2025\" agenda have in fact proposed. In addition, Justice Clarence Thomas has said that the repeal of Roe should open other decisions like Griswold v. Connecticut protecting contraception to another look.\n\nPolitically, Republicans have fallen into a trap wherein they cannot help Democrats pass legislation that would remedy this concern, therefore taking ownership of the issue even if they claim they \"would never\" oppose access to birth control or in vitro fertilization. The nuance of differences between GOP and Democratic bills is irrelevant to voters who only see Republicans voting against legislation that would protect access to medicine most never imagined would ever be threatened again.

Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Katie Britt (R-AL) to protect access to in vitro fertilization.\n\nCruz sought unanimous consent to approve the measure in a bid to blunt Democratic-led legislation on the medical procedure that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) will hold a recorded vote for on Thursday.\n\nDemocrats' proposal, which will require 60 votes to overcome a GOP filibuster, is also expected to fail.\n\n\"We're the ones that want to protect IVF,\" Cruz said on the Senate floor. \"Understand we could have passed strong federal legislation today, but Senate Democrats don't want a protection of IVF. They want a campaign issue.\"\n\nThe GOP bill, dubbed the IVF Protection Act, is far more narrowly tailored than that of Democrats over religious liberty concerns. It would strip states of Medicaid funding if they prohibit IVF, a move that gives states broad discretion and does not bar them from passing restrictions on the fertility procedure.\n\nThe Democratic bill would enshrine a right to IVF into federal law but would not force providers to offer services over religious concerns. It would also shield providers from legal liability, safeguard access for service members and veterans, and require health insurance for federal employees to help pay for the procedure, which can cost up to tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nSenate Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray (D-WA), a co-author of the Democrats' IVF bill, blocked Cruz's bid to pass his bill.\n\n\"This Republican bill really is a PR tool, plain and simple,\" Murray said. \"It's just another way for Republicans to pretend they are not the extremists that they keep proving they are.\"\n\nDemocrats' focus on IVF comes amid the second anniversary of the overturning of Roe v. Wade and in the wake of the Alabama Supreme Court's February ruling that frozen embryos should be considered children. The decision forced state lawmakers to pass temporary legal protections for IVF providers.\n\nBut the move also comes amid a concerted effort by Senate Democrats to prioritize an election-year agenda on hot-button issues, including reproductive health and immigration, that they feel will hurt Republican chances with voters at the ballot box.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nDemocrats also argued the wording of the Republican proposal may actually entice states opposed to Medicaid funding to pass laws restricting IVF.\n\n\"The states most likely to ban IVF are the same states that refuse to expand Medicaid,\" said Sen.

Tammy Duckworth is renewing her push in Washington to ensure nationwide access to in-vitro fertilization treatment, ahead of a scheduled Thursday vote.\n\nThe latest attempt from the Chicago Democrat, a prior bill stalling in February, the Right to IVF Act would enshrine IVF access for civilians and service members, require insurance coverage for the treatment and protect providers from any liability.\n\nIVF is broadly protected in Illinois, state lawmakers taking action last month to expand insurance coverage for the treatment. Duckworth along with fellow Democratic Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Patty Murray of Washington wants those same protections at the federal level.\n\nMore: Illinois House moves to protect emergency abortions ahead of US Supreme Court ruling\n\n\"This is an existential moment in our nation,\" said Booker, a former presidential candidate, during a news conference in Washington. \"I believe that we have to secure these rights, and that you see a small amount of people trying to exercise and impose their will over the will of Americans across the spectrum.\"\n\nIVF entered the national spotlight earlier this year after the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that embryos created through the treatment are children. Republicans, in response, have tried to shore up protections as they have largely struggled in abortion-related elections in the post-Roe era.\n\nRepublican U.S. Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Katie Britt of Alabama are leading legislation, dubbed the IVF Protection Act, which would pull Medicaid funding from states if they banned the procedure. Duckworth countered this could actually encourage GOP-majority states to ban IVF since they have already tried cutting Medicaid spending in years past.\n\n\"Calling your bill the IVF Protection Act without doing anything to protect IVF is despicable,\" she said, conceiving her two children through IVF. \"It is akin to an arsonist selling you fire insurance that doesn't cover arson.\"\n\nThe vote comes as Senate Republicans blocked legislation last week that would guarantee access nationwide to contraception. The U.S. Supreme Court's Griswold v. Connecticut decision protects this right, but the legislation would have enshrined it into the U.S. Constitution. Both Duckworth and U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Springfield, expressed dismay at the failed vote.\n\nContact Patrick M.

Alabama voters enshrined into the state constitution that life begins at conception, which the ALSC determined extends to IVF embryos.\n\nMohler said politicians have flaked on their responsibilities due to the political consequences of taking a stance against current IVF practices.\n\n\"Even in the state of Alabama there was lack of political will to stand behind what was the correct ruling and judgment by the Alabama Supreme Court,\" Mohler said. \"And now we have evidence nationwide of all kinds of slippage on this issue. Quite frankly, we know that in our churches we have compromised on this issue. But if we believe in the sanctity and dignity of every single human life from the moment of fertilization, we need to recognize any intervention with an embryo, any commodification of the embryo, any turn of the embryo into a consumer product, is an assault upon human dignity.\n\n\"And we need to understand that IVF as it is practiced is not only the alienation of reproduction from the conjugal setting, it is also an engineered system whereby multiple embryos are created only for most of them assuredly to be destroyed,\" Mohler said. \"That is as immoral as anything we could imagine if you state the proposition clearly, but a lot of evangelicals don't want to state the proposition clearly.\"\n\nFacing the potential shutdown of IVF clinics across the state, the majority of Republican lawmakers in Alabama supported a rushed piece of legislation to remedy the situation. The bill that is now Alabama law offers immunity to IVF clinics for the destruction of embryos.\n\nA few Republicans, such as Rep. Ernie Yarbrough, R-Trinity, balked at the legislation. Yarbrough said the ruling by the Supreme Court \"possibly uncovered a silent holocaust\" happening in the state.\n\nCertain conservative groups such as Alabama Policy Institute and its current or former affiliates also expressed their opposition to the law and support for the IVF decision. The American Action Fund circulated materials criticizing lawmakers who voted for the IVF bill, prompting House Republican leadership to criticize the organization and support its members.\n\nMeanwhile U.S. Senator Katie Britt, R-AL, sponsored legislation to safeguard IVF by blocking Medicaid funding to states that ban IVF access. The bill does not prevent regulations, however, on the practice.\n\nMohler also said IVF is \"exploited\" by the LGBTQ community.\n\n\"Much of the market for this is actually not even found among heterosexual married couples, but the redefinition of marriage, the redefinition of gender, the redefinition of all things in light of the LGBTQ movement, also means that there are people who can now have children alienated from that natural process and from the union of a husband and a wife in the institution of marriage and the larger institution of a natural family,\" Mohler said.\n\nThe convention is considering passing a resolution supporting restrictions on IVF treatments, and Mohler urged support for the resolution.\n\n\"I want to urge you to vote for that resolution on the floor of the Southern Baptist Convention and honestly, I want to urge you to be consistent in your pro-life advocacy in your local church, in your community, with your legislators and political leaders and frankly with the medical community, where honestly there's a lot of slippage on this among doctors who think themselves to be faithful Christians,\" Mohler said.\n\n\"Some of them have probably not thought through the issue. Sadly, some of them have.\"", "source": {"uri": "alreporter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Alabama Political Reporter"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jacob_holmes@alreporter.com", "name": "Jacob Holmes", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Alabama", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of Alabama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alabama Legislature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Embryo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Baptist_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southern Baptist Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sperm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_constitution_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State constitution (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dignity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dignity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelicalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Evangelicalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Britt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Katie Britt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christians", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christians"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Holocaust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Policy_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alabama Policy Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medicaid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_community", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LGBT community"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Infertility", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Infertility", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://www.alreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AdobeStock-311662439-scaled-1-1024x576.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9641932", "eventUri": "eng-9641932", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Wade.\n\nThe landmark ruling returned the question of abortion restrictions to the states, but Democrats have since argued the ruling has implications for reproductive rights more broadly and believe the issue can be used to pressure Republicans in an election year.\n\n\"Protecting IVF should be one of the easiest votes the Senate has taken all year,\" Schumer said in a Tuesday afternoon floor speech. \"The vast majority of senators should agree that strengthening treatments that help people start a family is a good thing.\"\n\nJust as they did with the fight over contraception, Senate Republicans will counterprogram the vote by putting forward their own legislation on IVF.\n\nOne such bill, led by Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Katie Britt (R-AL), will be brought up for what is known as a unanimous consent request, according to a source familiar with the matter. The move will force Democrats to shoot it down.\n\nThe GOP strategy comes as Schumer ramps up what Republicans have dismissed as \"show votes\" on hot-button issues such as immigration and reproductive health.\n\nSen. John Cornyn (R-TX), a leadership adviser who's running to be Sen. Mitch McConnell's (R-KY) successor as Senate GOP leader, condemned \"another partisan show vote\" from Democrats on \"another made-up controversy.\"\n\n\"There are countless bipartisan bills that deserve a vote by the Senate, but [Schumer] is simply disinterested,\" Cornyn said.\n\nSen. Rick Scott (R-FL), who's also seeking to replace McConnell, has stepped up his IVF advocacy since entering the race. He has a nonbinding pro-IVF resolution that he could try to pass on the floor as well. Last week, he launched a seven-figure ad campaign vowing to protect access.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats' IVF bill, the Right to IVF Act, is led by Sens. Patty Murray (D-WA), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), and Cory Booker (D-NJ). It includes four separate measures and comes amid the second anniversary of the overturning of Roe, as well as in the wake of the Alabama Supreme Court earlier this year ruling frozen embryos should be considered children. The decision forced state lawmakers to pass temporary legal protections for IVF providers.\n\nIn addition to protecting IVF, the Democratic bill would shield providers from legal liability, safeguard access for service members and veterans, and require more health insurance providers to help pick up the tab for the procedure, which can cost up to tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nThe legislation from Britt and Cruz, the IVF Protection Act, is far more narrowly tailored over religious liberty concerns. It would strip states of Medicaid funding if they prohibit IVF, a move that ultimately gives states broad discretion and does not bar them from passing restrictions on the fertility procedure.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\n\"Just like with nationwide access to contraception, I want to make it clear that Republicans support continued nationwide access to IVF,\" Britt said in a recent floor speech. \"I look forward to discussing this more next week, as unfortunately, my Democratic colleagues will continue their 'Summer of Scare Tactics.'\"\n\nSchumer rejected the accusation that Democrats are staging show votes in his Tuesday speech. \"In no way, shape, or form is protecting IVF a show vote -- it's a show-us-who-you-are vote,\" he said, pointing to a 2022 bill protecting same-sex marriage rights.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ramsey_touchberry@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Ramsey Touchberry", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mitch McConnell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Birth control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cornyn", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Cornyn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reproductive rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

Yet we've seen judges and politicians take direct aim at fertility care, including in Alabama, where a state Supreme Court ruling upended families' access to IVF overnight. It isn't a far-off threat or a fearmongering tactic - we're in the middle of a targeted assault on women's access to reproductive care, and we need federal protections in place so families in all 50 states have the freedom to grow if they wish to do so. I'm deeply disappointed that my colleagues failed to protect access to IVF today, including robust protections for servicemembers and military families. I stand firmly with a woman's right to make her own health care decisions, and I'll never stop fighting to protect and expand a right to IVF.\"\n\nThe Right to IVF Act includes provisions from the Warner-cosponsored Access to Family Building Act, and would establish a right for individuals to access IVF and ART services, as well as an adjacent right for doctors to provide these services. It also includes measures from the Veteran Families Health Services Act, which would improve fertility treatment and counseling options for veterans and servicemembers and promote research on servicemember and veteran reproductive health. It would also take several steps to increase affordability, including through mandating coverage of fertility treatments through employer-sponsored insurance plans and other public plans, as well as the Federal Employees Health Benefit (FEHB) Program.", "source": {"uri": "warner.senate.gov", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. Senator Mark R.

Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) introduced last week, did not garner the 60 votes needed to move forward with a floor vote Thursday afternoon. Almost all Republicans voted against the measure to advance the legislation, resulting in a 48-47 tally.\n\nThe legislation rolls together three previous bills all aiming to improve access and insurance coverage for in-vitro fertilization (IVF). In part, the bill would have impacts specifically on FEHB enrollees. One component of the Right to IVF Act aims to set higher requirements for FEHB carriers to offer IVF coverage.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management increased FEHB carrier requirements for IVF treatments for plan year 2024. But the legislation looks to further extend the requirements of IVF to cover both treatments and medications, as well as expanding to more types of assisted reproductive technology (ART).\n\nThe Democrat-led bill currently has 48 cosponsors. Generally, it focuses on establishing broader access to IVF and ART and lowering treatment costs, which without insurance can add up to tens of thousands of dollars in costs.\n\n\"Federal workers -- myself included -- know how expensive paying for IVF out of pocket can be, and the cost has put it out of reach for far too many,\" Stacey Young, president of the Department of Justice Gender Equality Network (DOJ GEN), a federal employee advocacy group, told Federal News Network.\n\nThe push for a vote on the IVF bill represents a mindset shift toward the presidential campaign now just five months away, the Associated Press reported. Duckworth and other co-sponsors of the bill have said the legislation is also a response to the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022, and other more recent efforts to limit access to fertility treatments and medications.\n\n\"Today, women and families ... are worried about what comes next, including the erosion of reproductive freedoms nobody thought were at risk. This includes access to services like IVF,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Tuesday on the Senate floor. \"The Right to IVF Act establishes a nationwide right to IVF and eliminates barriers for the millions of families looking to use IVF to start and grow a family.\"\n\nThe Biden administration also came out in support of the legislation and called for its passage.\n\n\"The administration looks forward to working with Congress ... in order to protect access to fertility services, eliminate barriers for families in need of high-quality, affordable fertility services, and ensure that federal agencies have the resources to implement these benefits,\" the Office of Management and Budget wrote in a statement of administrative policy Wednesday.\n\nDOJ GEN has continually called for better federal health care coverage of infertility treatments. The group is one of many stakeholders that pushed for the advancement of the Right to IVF Act in the Senate.\n\n\"Supporting this bill should be a no-brainer,\" Young told Federal News Network. \"Our nation's public servants should have affordable access to the full range of reproductive health care, including IVF and other forms of assisted reproductive technology.\"\n\nBut some lawmakers, along with DOJ GEN, have said even without the legislation, OPM should still work to add more coverage for FEHB enrollees. For plan year 2024, OPM already expanded IVF coverage requirements for FEHB carriers to provide, at a minimum, coverage of the cost of drugs related to an IVF procedure for three cycles annually. OPM has also encouraged FEHB carriers to go beyond the minimum requirements -- and so far, 24 carriers have done so.\n\nDOJ GEN leaders said they're grateful for the efforts OPM has made so far in the FEHB requirements. But the advocacy group wants OPM now to take things a step further. DOJ GEN is asking OPM to expand health carrier requirements to cover IVF treatments, on top of medications, for plan year 2025.\n\n\"OPM has the opportunity to break new ground again in 2025 by mandating not only coverage of IVF medications, but also medical treatments,\" DOJ GEN wrote in a letter to OPM Acting Director Rob Shriver in May. \"Medical treatments comprise the lion's share of the cost of IVF. Many of our members can attest first-hand to the financial strains that paying out of pocket for IVF placed on them. Some had to drain their savings; borrow money from family members; or forgo treatments entirely. Others left DOJ for private-sector jobs that offered full IVF coverage, taking their invaluable skills and institutional knowledge with them.\"\n\nOPM declined to comment on whether there were any plans underway to further expand coverage requirements for IVF in the health insurance program. But some federal health experts have said with just a few months before Open Season, it's likely too late to expand the coverage as early as plan year 2025 -- though it would be possible in future health plan years.\n\nBetsy Campbell, chief engagement officer at national infertility association RESOLVE, said the calls for better insurance coverage of fertility treatments have been growing.\n\n\"We know that hundreds of federal employees have been reaching out to OPM to request this coverage, and we've started to see some progress with OPM,\" Campbell said in an interview with Federal News Network. \"The next step is actually adding the medical procedure of IVF. So we're hopeful that OPM will listen to their employees and add this highly desired benefit.\"\n\nRESOLVE has also been encouraging the adoption of a more inclusive definition of infertility that would help LGBTQ+ employees as well as unpartnered individuals access IVF and other fertility benefits through FEHB -- but she said the efforts should go beyond simply updating the definition.\n\n\"There appears to still be some work, because donor sperm and donor eggs aren't necessarily covered by all the plans,\" Campbell said. \"And that, of course, is needed by same-sex couples and non-partnered people when building their families. It's one thing to have an inclusive definition, but you also have to cover the elements that are needed for these communities to build their families as well.\"\n\nA 2021 survey from Mercer, in partnership with RESOLVE, found that a vast majority of employers that increased fertility treatment coverage and benefits did not see a significant increase in medical plan costs.\n\nAdditionally, Campbell said, these types of benefit adjustments can significantly impact recruitment and retention of employees.\n\n\"You don't want to provide yet another reason for them to leave federal employment to go to a private employer that is providing fertility benefits,\" Campbell said. \"Often employers don't realize there's a gap in this coverage until it's pointed out. I think we're seeing OPM trying to fill this gap piece by piece ... Now it's time to also cover these medically necessary procedures to help their employees build their families.\"", "source": {"uri": "federalnewsnetwork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Federal News Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Employees_Health_Benefits_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Employees Health Benefits Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_the_Philippines", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Music of the Philippines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_(United_States)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assisted reproductive technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammy_Duckworth", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tammy Duckworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Office_of_Personnel_Management", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Office of Personnel Management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Booker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cory Booker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocacy_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advocacy group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patty_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patty Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fertility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

In the United States, about 9% of men and about 11% of women of reproductive age have experienced fertility problems. IVF is the main type of assisted reproductive technology. It involves extracting a woman's eggs, fertilizing the eggs in the laboratory and transferring the resulting embryos into the woman's uterus.\n\nAbout 2.3 percent of all infants born in the United States each year are conceived using assisted reproductive technology like IVF. However, access to IVF is limited and many states have banned or restricted access to reproductive medical services, in some cases including IVF.\n\nReproductive endocrinologists are a major part of a family's fertility care. They perform IVF and other assisted reproductive technology procedures and diagnose and treat infertility and other hormonal health issues related to the reproductive system.\n\nThe Right to IVF Act\u202fwould help individuals and families who are impacted by infertility by establishing a statutory right to access IVF for all Americans who need it to start or grow a family, and expanding access to coverage for IVF and fertility treatment by requiring that health plans including the VA, TRICARE, Medicaid, Medicare, group and individual market plans, ERISA, and the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program provide coverage for fertility treatment.\n\nWe strongly urge Congress to take this opportunity to protect the right to IVF and other fertility treatments by passing the Right to IVF Act.\n\n# # #\n\nEndocrinologists are at the core of solving the most pressing health problems of our time, from diabetes and obesity to infertility, bone health, and hormone-related cancers.

But that doesn't change the organization's position on women serving in leadership roles.\n\nThe church members' stance on IVF comes as the fight over abortion is expected to be a major issue in the presidential election between President Joe Biden and challenger Donald Trump.\n\nIVF entails merging eggs and sperm in a laboratory dish to form an embryo.

Ted Cruz of Texas and Katie Britt of Alabama, introduced the legislation to protect access to IVF last month. But the bill, which would deny Medicaid funds to states that prohibit IVF, was quickly met with pushback by Democrats, who questioned its scope and mechanism. Still, on Wednesday, the senators sought to approve the bill unanimously, meaning a single senator could block its passage.\n\n\"To the best of my knowledge, all 100 senators in this body support IVF,\" Cruz said Wednesday on the Senate floor before attempting to pass the legislation by unanimous consent. \"We invite our colleagues in the Senate from both sides of the aisle to join together in supporting this crucial legislation.\"\n\nSen. Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat, objected to the motion, calling the bill a \"PR tool, plain and simple.\"\n\n\"I am not going to mince words here. It is ridiculous to claim that this bill protects IVF when it does nothing of the sort,\" Murray said, adding that the bill allows states to restrict the fertility treatments in other ways.\n\nThe bill, known as the IVF Protection Act, would require that states \"do not prohibit in vitro fertilization\" as a condition for the states to receive federal funding for Medicaid, which provides health insurance for low-income Americans. It doesn't compel an organization or individual to provide IVF services, and it also doesn't preclude states from otherwise regulating IVF -- which some Democrats take issue with.\n\nBritt said the bill would give the parents the certainty that access to IVF would be protected, while arguing that it wouldn't \"stray\" beyond, like the Democrats' proposed legislation.\n\nSenate Democrats have pushed their own bill to protect access to IVF, which they see as more comprehensive. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat, has tried to approve her legislation to protect the fertility treatments with the same unanimous consent approach on multiple occasions, attempts that were blocked by one Republican.\n\nThe GOP push for its own bill comes as the Senate is set to vote Thursday on a legislative package to protect access to IVF, which includes Duckworth's measure, as Democrats rally around reproductive rights this month.\n\n\"If the Senate GOP really supports access to IVF, they can prove it by voting for Democrats' bill tomorrow,\" Murray wrote Wednesday on social media.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans have criticized the efforts as part of a summer of \"scare tactics.\"\n\n\"The bottom line is the American people deserve better,\" Britt said of the Democrat's plan. \"And there is no better path out there than our bill, the path of common-ground solutions, not show-votes or scare tactics.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

More than 10,000 messengers representing the nation's largest Protestant denomination joined together Tuesday and Wednesday in Indianapolis, Indiana, for preaching, business matters and opportunties to weigh in on some of the most hotly debated issues of the day.\n\nThe Rev. Doug Melton, longtime senior pastor of Southern Hills Baptist Church in Oklahoma City, said Southern Baptists -- Oklahoma's largest faith group -- were not condemning IVF, but sharing their concern about the practice of discarding some human embryos generated through the process.\n\n\"I don't want people to think we are saying IVF is wrong, it's a concern over every single embryo,\" he said.\n\n\"We believe that the Bible teaches that from the moment of conception, that is a soul, that is a human being, and it's made in the image of God. It was knitted together in its mother's womb by God. That's what we believe about the embryo.\"\n\nThe denomination's resolution on the \"ethical realities of reproductive technologies and the dignity of the human embryo\" came amid the ongoing national debate on in vitro fertilization that arose after the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos created through in vitro fertilization should be considered children. The Alabama Legislature passed a law protecting IVF treatments, about a month after the state's high court made its controversial ruling in February.\n\nWednesday, several messengers asked to change the wording of the resolution being considered to make it less likely that it would be seen as condemning IVF, a path to parenthood for millions of people across the country. Two men asking for language modifications and a woman who spoke in favor of the resolution amounted to the sparse discussion about the resolution before it was approved.\n\nDaniel Taylor, of Michigan, talked about his godson who whose parents chose IVF in their quest to have a child.\n\n\"The child that was born was a gift from God ... because of him, I thank God for IVF,\" Taylor said.\n\nHe told the crowd that he was proposing an amendment to the resolution's language so it did not seem to proclaim IVF as \"a wicked thing,\" and also potentially make it more difficult for Southern Baptists to evangelize people who have used IVF.\n\nZach Haddock, of Ohio, said he and his wife have children through the use of IVF. He spoke in favor of Taylor's amendment because he supported both the sanctity of life and IVF, suggesting that the reproductive technology could be used while simultaneously trusting in the sovereignty of God.\n\n\"I am against the idea that this technology is so wicked that it can not be employed,\" he said.\n\nBut Monica Hall, of Kentucky, argued in favor of the resolution as it was presented by the denomination's resolution's committee. She said it gave Southern Baptists an opportunity to be \"a voice of biblical truth and clarity in this pressing cultural issue.\"\n\nHall said she used IVF and two of the \"babies we adopted as embryos\" died before she could even hear their hearts beating. She described the embryos as \"frozen, left over from someone's else's IVF cycle, donated, thawed and then transferred\" into her womb.\n\n\"Those are chilling phrases to describe a human being created in the image of God,\" she said. \"Nothing in the process of IVF upholds the sanctity of life,\" Hall said.\n\nResolutions are seen as the denomination's way of expressing opinions or concerns about a variety of topics. The resolutions are nonbinding, but they have always been an important way for Southern Baptists to share their thoughts on relevant -- and often controversial -- topics.\n\nSouthern Baptists got an opportunity to vote for a second time on an amendment to the denomination's constitution that would have defined a church in \"friendly cooperation\" with the faith group as one that \"affirms, appoints, or employs only men as any kind of pastor or elder as qualified by Scripture.\"\n\nMelton said the amendment needed messengers to take two votes with a two-thirds majority of approval to be adopted. Although the amendment received the two-thirds majority approval at last year's annual meeting, he said he wasn't surprised that it did not receive enough votes the second time around on Wednesday.\n\nHe said this year, more Southern Baptists understood that the denomination's statement of faith, the Baptist Faith & Message, already prohibits women from holding the position of pastor, in accordance with Scripture.\n\n\"The theology of the Southern Baptists has not changed on that issue,\" Melton said. \"There was just more understanding that the confessional statement that we have, that Scripture teaches that women are not to serve as the pastor of church.\"\n\nThe Rev. Blake Gideon, senior pastor of First Baptist Church of Edmond, said women play a vital and valuable role in ministry, bringing unique gifts, perspectives and talents to the church.\n\n\"While the role of pastor has been historically (based on 1 Timothy 3:1-7) reserved for men, it is important to recognize and affirm the diverse ways in which women can lead, teach and serve in the church,\" Gideon said.\n\n\"The vote against the amendment has put the Southern Baptist Convention on a new trajectory and where this decision takes us only time will tell.\"\n\nThe Rev. Clint Pressley, senior pastor of Hickory Grove Baptist Church in Charlotte, North Carolina, was elected as the denomination's next president on Wednesday, while an Oklahoman, the Rev. Brad Graves, senior pastor of First Baptist Church of Ada, was elected as the faith group's first vice president.\n\nThe Rev. Mike Keahbone, senior pastor of First Baptist Church of Lawton, was one of six men nominated for the president, but he did not receive enough votes to be placed in the first of two runoffs. In the second runoff, Pressley emerged with more votes than the Rev. Dan Spencer, senior pastor of First Baptist Church, Sevierville, Tennessee.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Jackson Women's Health Organization case severely eroded women's reproductive freedom, U.S. Senator Jack Reed is joining with Senate Democrats to protect access to in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments and prevent states from restricting access to the procedure.\n\n\"For some prospective parents who struggle with fertility issues, their only chance at having children is through IVF. But now, some Republican legislatures and activist judges are seeking to deny them that opportunity and forcing them to put family planning decisions on hold. I cosponsored the Right to IVF Act to protect reproductive care and make life a little easier for patients going through the IVF process. Passing this bill would give them peace of mind and prevent a partisan, out of touch judge from suddenly halting their fertility treatment and taking away their opportunity to have a child of their own,\" said Senator Reed.\n\nEarlier this month, Senator Reed joined U.S. Senators Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Patty Murray (D-WA), and Cory Booker (D-NJ) in introducing the Right to IVF Act (S.4445) to protect nationwide access to fertility treatment, including in vitro fertilization and other assisted reproductive technology, as well as lower the costs of IVF treatment to make it more affordable. The bill would require that health plans including the VA, TRICARE, Medicaid, Medicare, group and individual market plans, ERISA, and the Federal Employees Health Benefits program provide coverage for fertility treatment.\n\nThis week, the Senate is scheduled to vote on the Right to IVF Act, which includes elements of the Access to Family Building Act (S.3612), the Veteran Families Health Services Act (S.2801), the Access to Infertility Treatment and Care Act (S.2386) and the Family Building FEHB Fairness Act (S.1262).\n\nPassing this legislation has become an urgent priority in the wake of the Dobbs decision, which served as a springboard for the Alabama Supreme Court's February ruling that embryos outside of the womb are entitled to the same rights as children. That ruling forced many prospective parents and the fertility doctors and clinics that serve them to halt treatments.\n\n\"The Supreme Court got the Dobbs decision wrong and did a real disservice to many families trying to conceive, adding a layer of legal complications and uncertainty to an already expensive and emotional process. Passing this bill would help protect those going through the IVF process from political interference. It would help make it easier for families to grow,\" said Reed. \"Instead of putting IVF parents at risk, there should be a bipartisan commitment to passing this bill and providing access to these vital services at a lower cost.\"\n\nInfertility affects an increasing number of individuals. According to the Endocrine Society, about 9 percent of men and about 11 percent of women of reproductive age have experienced fertility problems and about 2.3 percent of all infants born in the U.S. each year are conceived using assisted reproductive technology.\n\nIn 2022, 91,771 babies were born from IVF-assisted pregnancies, according to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, including 221 in Rhode Island.\n\nSo far, 13 states have introduced fetal personhood bills that would affect the legality of IVF, according to the non-profit Guttmacher Institute.\n\nThe full U.S. Senate is expected to vote on the bill later this week. Under Senate rules. the cloture vote will require 60 votes to advance the legislation.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Reed_(Rhode_Island_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jack Reed (Rhode Island politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assisted reproductive technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

(WTVF) -- The world's largest Baptist organization is calling for restrictions on in vitro fertilization.\n\nAt the Southern Baptists' annual convention, delegates -- otherwise known as messages -- adopted a resolution criticizing IVF because unused embryos are often discarded during the process.\n\nAs most reproductive procedures are these days, IVF is a hot-button topic.\n\nYou may recall Alabama's Supreme Court ruled in February that frozen embryos created through IVF are children under state law.\n\nBabies born with the use of assisted reproductive technologies like IVF account for 2% of all U.S. births, according to the CDC's most recent data. In Tennessee, it's 1% percent of all births.\n\nIVF patients usually need multiple embryos to ensure just one healthy baby. It's because of the number of embryos disposed of during the process that the Southern Baptists condemned the use of IVF. The religious group believes embryos are children.\n\nFor some, like Jordan McLendon, IVF is the best way to have children. McLendon was diagnosed with leukemia in 2020. He and his wife plan to consult a fertility doctor about IVF when he is healthy enough to start a family.\n\n\"I underwent a stem cell transplant in the summer of 2021 and just through that process we are not able to conceive naturally,\" said Jordan McLendon.\n\nTo get an idea where Tennesseans fall on the issue, I looked at the poll conducted by Vanderbilt University in the spring. It shows eight out of every 10 people answered that IVF should be legal.\n\n\"So, it doesn't matter your partisan stripe, there's widespread support with making IVF legal which stands in stark contrast to the vote that was taken yesterday,\" said John Geer, a professor of political science at Vanderbilt. \"And then, if you ask the question: If you think this is a moral issue or not? You again find pretty strong consensus across partisan groups. Only 10% of the state thinks its morally wrong.\"\n\nHeadquartered in Nashville, the Southern Baptists' statement at the annual convention this week is alienating some followers already.\n\n\"Even though we don't want to let those subjects get in the way, there are some things we can't overlook and opposition to something like this is something that we can't overlook,\" McLendon said.\n\nIVF patients can choose not to discard their unused embryos but other options may not be a fit for everyone.\n\nCarrie: https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/2e/72/be0f23854c54a228c9d6138c9847/carrie-recommends-header.png\n\nBen: https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/df/c4/19fa7c504480938f39a431e3b276/ben-recommends-header.png\n\nAmy: https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/b9/b6/1408516a4a91b97639b178fc1ba9/amy-recommends-header.png\n\nRhori: https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/5b/25/a224d13d47739165c92b94e643db/rhori-recommends-header.png\n\nWonder Woman; school celebrates beloved teacher living with brain cancer\n\nI think we can all remember our favorite teachers.

Even opponents of the ban noted the proposal's redundancy.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, opponents said the Southern Baptists already can oust Southern Baptist churches that allow women pastors -- which it did last year and again on Tuesday.\n\nUltimately, the resolution received 61.4% of the vote but it needed a two-thirds majority to pass.\n\nMeredith Stone, executive director of Baptist Women in Ministry, said her group \"grieved that this vote has ever even taken place\" adding that it \"demonstrates that women in ministry are still devalued\".\n\nSupporters of the amendment said that strong language opposing women pastors would make the Convention's position on issues like LGBTQ+ rights more clear.\n\nGroups like the Human Rights Campaign say the position of the Southern Baptists -- which does not ordain openly LGBTQ+ people -- is already clear.\n\nAs for the IVF proposal, the resolution urged its congregants to only support reproductive efforts that uphold the \"unconditional value and right to life of every human being, including those in an embryonic stage,\" and criticized IVF.\n\nThe resolution called the practice \"dehumanizing\" and urged the U.S. government to \"restrain\" from the medical practice.\n\nStill, some Baptist leaders spoke about IVF with gratitude, detailing their experiences and urging a softening of the resolution's language.\n\nDaniel Taylor, a deacon with Charity Baptist Church in Paris, Michigan, said his godson was born through IVF.\n\n\"Because of him, I thank God for IVF,\" he said, adding that passing the resolution would condemn the \"entirely moral and ethical actions\" of parents who are hoping to have or have had a child through IVF.\n\nThe resolution passed anyway, but is not enforcable.\n\nIt recommends members of the congregation use alternative fertility therapies or adopt existing frozen embryos and only use reproductive technologies \"consistent\" with the \"unconditional value and right to life of every human.\"\n\nAmong other Christian groups, many conservative Christians already largely oppose IVF. Catholic teaching forbids IVF, but many Catholics pursue the treatment anyway, the New York Times reports.\n\nAs noted by Reuters, the move marks the latest sign that U.S. evangelicals -- a powerful community that helped drive Donald Trump's 2016 presidential election victory -- are broadening their anti-abortion efforts following the overturning of Roe v. Wade.\n\nThe Southern Baptist Convention is considered the largest Protestant denomination in the United States with nearly 13 million members, mainly in the American South.\n\nEvery year, the group gathers for an annual convention and meeting. This year's was in Indianapolis and took place from Sunday through Wednesday.\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence spoke at a luncheon.\n\nThe group says its convention and resolutions give attendees a chance to weigh in on topical issues, but the resolutions are not enforceable rules.", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Philadelphia Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emily_bloch@inquirer.com", "name": "Emily Bloch", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Baptist_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southern Baptist Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pastor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptists", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baptists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LGBT rights in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human Rights Campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right to life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Embryo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supermajority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

Mark R. Warner on the Senate's Failure to...", "body": "Source: United States Senator for Commonwealth of Virginia Mark R Warner\n\nWASHINGTON - Today, Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-VA) released the following statement on the Senate's failure to advance the Right to IVF Act, Warner-cosponsored legislation that would protect and expand access to in-vitro fertilization (IVF) and other assisted reproductive technology (ART) services nationwide.\n\n\"For years, millions of women have safely and successfully used IVF to start and grow families, making their plans a reality and their dreams come true. Yet we've seen judges and politicians take direct aim at fertility care, including in Alabama, where a state Supreme Court ruling upended families' access to IVF overnight. It isn't a far-off threat or a fearmongering tactic - we're in the middle of a targeted assault on women's access to reproductive care, and we need federal protections in place so families in all 50 states have the freedom to grow if they wish to do so. I'm deeply disappointed that my colleagues failed to protect access to IVF today, including robust protections for servicemembers and military families. I stand firmly with a woman's right to make her own health care decisions, and I'll never stop fighting to protect and expand a right to IVF.\"\n\nThe Right to IVF Act includes provisions from the Warner-cosponsored Access to Family Building Act, and would establish a right for individuals to access IVF and ART services, as well as an adjacent right for doctors to provide these services. It also includes measures from the Veteran Families Health Services Act, which would improve fertility treatment and counseling options for veterans and servicemembers and promote research on servicemember and veteran reproductive health. It would also take several steps to increase affordability, including through mandating coverage of fertility treatments through employer-sponsored insurance plans and other public plans, as well as the Federal Employees Health Benefit (FEHB) Program.\n\nSen. Warner is a longtime advocate for comprehensive protections for reproductive care. In April, Sen. Warner urged the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to require all insurance carriers in the FEHB Program to cover in-vitro fertilization (IVF) medical treatments and medications. He also cosponsored and voted to pass the Right to Contraception Act, which would codify a right to birth control, and the Women's Health Protection Act, which would protect abortion access, both of which have been blocked by Republicans.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Warner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Warner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assisted reproductive technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fertility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Health_Protection_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's Health Protection Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codification_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Codification (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Office_of_Personnel_Management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Office of Personnel Management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Birth control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Infertility", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Infertility", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Family_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Family Planning", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Universal_Design", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Universal Design", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family_Resources_and_Support", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family Resources and Support", "wgt": 16}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9641932", "eventUri": "eng-9641932", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5450980392156863, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

It says the process creates far more embryos than can be used, leading to the destruction of hundreds of thousands of them. The measure also calls on government to limit the use of the procedure.\n\nEarlier Wednesday at the Indianapolis meeting, a vote on a constitutional amendment to bar women from pastoral positions fell just shy of passage. Last year, the delegates -- called messengers -- voted to expel churches led by women, a group that included Rick Warren's Saddleback Church. Backers of the move said the amendment was needed this time to specify that even lower-ranking jobs such as women's ministry pastor or children's pastor can be held by men only, per the Washington Post. The amendment needed two-thirds support to be enacted but received about 61%, per the Wall Street Journal.\n\nWhile the IVF resolution is nonbinding, people among the nearly 13 million Southern Baptists wanting to have children could now face pressure from their pastors to stay away from IVF. The Roman Catholic Church already opposes the procedure, per Politico, but many Protestant denominations have not included IVF in their campaigns against abortion. A broader battle could be ahead; in Washington, Senate Democrats have scheduled a vote on IVF protections for Thursday. \"It's going to be a long process,\" said Brent Leatherwood, who leads the Southern Baptist Convention's public policy arm. \"It took us 50 years to take down Roe.\" (More Southern Baptist Convention stories.)", "source": {"uri": "newser.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newser"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bob_cronin@newser.com", "name": "Bob Cronin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Baptist_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Southern Baptist Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Embryo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right to life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pastor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Warren", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rick Warren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddleback_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saddleback Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

She described IVF as callous toward human life, given how frozen embryos are often discarded.\n\n\"The only possible ethical stance on IVF is to advocate for more Christian couples to be willing to give the 1 million-plus embryos in freezers a chance at dignity and life by adopting them,\" she said.\n\n\"Most embryos created through IVF die at some point in the process. How could it be considered ethical to create human life knowing death is a probability? My babies died, but I am so thankful that they lived for a few days in the womb and were and still are fiercely loved and cherished.\"\n\nThe messengers rejected the amendment via a vote of raised ballot.\n\nAccording to a preliminary copy of the resolution, the measure called on the SBC \"to reaffirm the unconditional value and right to life of every human being, including those in an embryonic stage, and to only utilize reproductive technologies consistent with that affirmation.\"\n\n\"In Vitro Fertilization most often engages in the destruction of embryonic human life and increasingly engages in dehumanizing methods for determining suitability for life and genetic sorting, based on notions of genetic fitness and parental preferences,\" reads the resolution.\n\n\"The In Vitro Fertilization process routinely creates more embryos than can reasonably be implanted, thus resulting in the continued freezing, stockpiling and ultimate destruction of human embryos, some of which may also be subjected to medical experimentation.\"\n\nThe resolution called on Southern Baptists to \"continue to promote adoption as one way God may call upon couples to grow their families and to consider adopting frozen embryos in order to rescue those who are eventually to be destroyed\" and encouraged couples \"to consider the ethical implications of assisted reproductive technologies as they look to God for hope, grace, and wisdom amid suffering.\"\n\nIVF has garnered increased scrutiny in recent years, and in February the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that embryos created via the controversial process and kept frozen are protected by a state law known as the Wrongful Death of a Minor Act.", "source": {"uri": "christianpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Zoll, 37, of St. Louis, now runs a nonprofit called Making a Miracle which offers support to other families struggling with infertility (Photo provided by Danielle Faith Zoll).\n\nDanielle Faith Zoll and her husband have one last embryo frozen in Missouri.\n\nZoll's daughter, who is 2 years old, was conceived through in vitro fertilization. But during that pregnancy Zoll developed Hellp Syndrome, an extreme and life-threatening case of preeclampsia.\n\nAfter giving birth to her daughter at 35 weeks, Zoll's doctor advised her not to do so again out of fear that she wouldn't survive another pregnancy.\n\nThat warning left Zoll and her husband unsure of the best future for their last embryo. And the uncertainty turned to fear after an Alabama Supreme Court ruling in February.\n\n\"Because of all we go through, (embryos) feel like more than just this clump of cells, because it's this hope that you'll be a parent one day,\" Zoll said. \"And you lose so much going through infertility.\"\n\nZoll, like many Americans, was shocked when the Alabama Supreme Court's ruled frozen embryos were \"extrauterine children.\" Several fertility clinics in that state immediately stopped IVF for fear of being found liable for wrongful death if they accidentally destroyed an embryo.\n\nFloored by the news and the unknown, Zoll reached out to her state senator, Tracy McCreery, an Olivette Democrat. This is scary, Zoll told her. Can you do something?\n\nMcCreery would later reference stories like Zoll's on the Senate floor, but ultimately wasn't able to push through legislation to protect the procedure.\n\nA handful of attempts to protect IVF through the legislative process were introduced, but didn't make it far in either the House or Senate. In part, the reluctance stemmed from a belief that IVF wasn't in immediate danger, and therefore was an issue for a different year as more urgent matters -- and Senate dysfunction -- often ruled the day.\n\nBut advocates for IVF say the lack of urgency was a mistake. They believe ambiguity in state law leaves IVF vulnerable to the same conclusion reached by Alabama's highest court.\n\nMcCreery's bill, which would have excluded IVF from any \"unborn children\" language in Missouri law, never got a Senate hearing.\n\n\"Unfortunately in the legislature,\" McCreery said, \"there just weren't people willing to have that discussion.\"\n\nHouse Majority Leader Jon Patterson, a Lee's Summit Republican and a physician, said many Republicans, himself included, are eager to put more protections in place. But in the House, he said IVF legislation came too late in the session to realistically act on what he called a preemptive bill.\n\n\"Going forward, protecting Missouri parents' ability to access in vitro fertilization will be a priority,\" said Patterson, who is expected to become speaker of the House next session. Lawmakers, he said, \"need to do everything we can to protect access to IVF.\"\n\nIVF, the process of collecting a woman's eggs, fertilizing them with sperm in a laboratory and transferring resulting embryos to her uterus or freezing them for later, has become increasingly common. It gives people the opportunity to both start families later in life and grow families in spite of illness or infertility.\n\nIn 2021, more than 97,000 babies were born thanks to assisted reproductive technology, more than double the number a decade earlier, according to the CDC.\n\nWhile many Missouri Republicans voiced support for IVF, in the wake of the Alabama ruling a few spoke out against the procedure, arguing families should only create as many embryos as they intend to use, running counter to how the process currently works.\n\n\"I've got a group of colleagues that believe that what happened in Alabama could happen in Missouri,\" McCreery said. \"But like a lot of things in the state of Missouri, people just cross their fingers and hope that there isn't a problem.\"\n\nIn an attempt to start answering his clients many questions after the Alabama decision came down, Tim Schlesinger, a surrogacy and assisted reproductive technologies attorney in St. Louis, took to a blog post.\n\n\"This case has no direct legal impact outside the State of Alabama,\" he assured Missourians.\n\nIn a recent interview with The Independent, Schlesinger said this still holds water. But it also stands alongside another truth in Missouri: \"There is no protection for IVF right now.\"\n\nHe's carefully watched the ripple effect of the Alabama decision move north.\n\nHe doesn't believe IVF is at risk of disappearing in Missouri, but without legislation that protects both patients and clinics, he said it's not impossible for Missourians to find themselves in a situation similar to Alabama.\n\nSchlesinger knows the topic well. Several years ago he litigated the case that set the precedent for defining an embryo as \"property of a special character.\"\n\nThat case, McQueen v. Gadberry, arose from a custody dispute over embryos in a divorce.\n\nSchlesinger, who represented Gadberry -- the ex-husband who didn't want his ex-wife to use the remaining embryos to create children, and won -- said the outcome confirmed patients have the right to decide what to do with their pre-embryos.\n\nBut Michael Wolff, a former Missouri Supreme Court chief justice and dean emeritus at St. Louis University School of Law, fears the overturning of Roe v. Wade, a case cited in the McQueen v. Gadberry decision, means the precedent set by the judge's decision would no longer apply if brought before a court again.\n\nMissouri law states that all life begins at conception. Wolff interprets conception and fertilization to be one in the same in regards to state law, adding that it would simply take \"an overeager prosecutor\" for Missouri to find itself in a position similar to Alabama.\n\n\"I'm not being an alarmist about this, I'm not being an extremist. I'm not saying that everybody should believe that what the legislature says is true,\" Wolff said. \"But I think you have to take seriously what the legislature says. They were perfectly serious when they wrote it as far as I can tell.\"\n\nSchlesinger is hopeful that if a state court was faced with a case similar to McQueen v. Gadberry today, it would come to the same conclusion it did several years ago, since he said that case wasn't premised on Roe v. Wade.\n\nBut, he added, there's no guarantee the judges now sitting on the Missouri Supreme Court would agree.\n\n\"That's a legitimate concern, and an insightful concern brought up by Judge Wolff, but in my opinion, the overturn of Roe v. Wade should not impact McQueen v. Gadberry,\" he said. \"Because the reason for the overturn of Roe v Wade was not relevant to what is the character of a pre-embryo.\"\n\nSchlesinger said a more immediate impact he's considering is on doctors.\n\n\"The people who live in Missouri and want to have outstanding fertility care in Missouri might be impacted just by physicians reluctant to expand within Missouri until enough time has passed that they see how efforts in this regard are going to shake out,\" he said.\n\nAs Missouri senators debated legislation blocking Planned Parenthood clinics from receiving Medicaid reimbursements, McCreery brought forward an amendment that would exempt IVF from Missouri's current statute which states that life begins at conception.\n\n\"I assumed wrongly, stupidly, that when the legislature passed a total ban on abortion, that that would be enough. People would feel like they had their Pro-Life credentials,\" state Sen. Lauren Arthur, a Democrat from Kansas City, said during the debate. \"What I have since realized is, it's never enough.\"\n\nThe amendment never made it to a vote, but it fueled much of the Democratic senators' filibuster that April evening.\n\nBut unlike inside the statehouse, McCreery believes the issue remains largely a nonpartisan one. Conservative voters have reached out asking for her help protecting the procedure.\n\nAfter the Alabama decision, Republican state Rep. Bill Allen of Kansas City consulted his priest, who encouraged him to look around the church at the children born through IVF.\n\n\"That helped square my faith and politics, I'll tell ya,\" Allen said, adding: \"To me it was the right thing to do for Missouri families, and I just wanted to protect it.\"\n\nIn late February he filed legislation that would have clarified the right to IVF. His bill, like McCreery's, was never granted a committee hearing.\n\nAllen plans to file the bill again next year, if re-elected.\n\n\"There may have been election year politics that got in the way this time,\" he said. \"But with those removed next year, I'm really optimistic that this can get through as a priority.\"\n\nWhile IVF remains a fairly bi-partisan issue, some hold-outs remain.\n\nDuring a Missouri Freedom Caucus press conference this spring, state Sen. Rick Brattin, a Harrisonville Republican, decried the current IVF process as the \"reckless storage and disposal of human life.\"\n\nOften, several embryos are created at once, in part because many don't survive to the point of implantation in the womb. It's common practice to immediately freeze any embryos created, even if the intention is to implant them quickly.\n\n\"If you're getting in vitro fertilization, it needs to be the embryos that are going to be implanted at that particular time,\" Brattin said. \"I know it's an expensive process, but creating this huge inventory of life being frozen, I don't agree with it.\"\n\nHe proposed that families create an embryo, and then if unsuccessful, come back and create another one. Brattin could not be reached for comment.\n\nAfter the Alabama decision, many Republicans spoke up in favor of the current IVF process. But others, like Brattin, stood by a long-held anti-abortion belief that embryos should not be stored, discarded or used for science.\n\nDuring a mid-March Senate debate on an education bill, state Sen. Mike Moon, a Republican from Ash Grove, was asked by Arthur if he believed IVF should be allowed. Moon had proposed an amendment which would have required students be taught that life begins at conception.\n\n\"If I were the one with the magic wand, I would have discouraged it because now you've got how many fertilized embryos out there? And what happens if that facility where they're housed loses power and they all die? Who's culpable?\" Moon said. \"And so I think we've created a problem, and we created it. Only God's supposed to create in that fashion. And we've taken it upon ourselves to do it.\"\n\nAbolish Abortion Missouri leader Wesley Scroggins, who has endorsed Moon, called IVF \"sinful\" at a rally in Jefferson City following the Alabama ruling.\n\nThe Missouri GOP website, under a page titled \"faith and family,\" lists support for \"the protection of the lives of in vitro fertilized embryos and all other human embryos from the beginning of biological development\" just below its support for marriage between \"one man and one woman.\"\n\nAsked about IVF during a KSDK interview in March, state Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman, a Republican from Arnold and a leading anti-abortion lawmaker, said Missouri already has some of the most \"permissive\" IVF laws in the country, so she saw no further need to protect the process through legislation.\n\nShe noted that since the passage of the Missouri Stands for the Unborn Act in 2019, there's been no litigation filed against I.V.F.\n\n\"If Missouri was going to do something, they would've needed to already address it,\" she said.\n\nIn the days following the Alabama decision, lawmakers in that state passed a law shielding IVF clinics and providers from civil and criminal liability, raising concerns that while such a law allowed clinics to reopen immediately, it also prevented families from having the ability to sue if something went wrong.\n\nAsked in March if she'd support a law to more clearly protect I.V.F., Coleman said she would be hesitant.\n\n\"Because it's broadly legal right now,\" Coleman said. \"I wouldn't want to enact something that would actually make it harder for a family who would receive malpractice in their medical practice to be able to be made whole.\"\n\nAs president of the Midwest Reproductive Symposium International, Dr. Amber Cooper looks forward to discussing emerging technologies and advancing access to care at the annual gathering.\n\nBut this year, the Alabama decision lingered like a shadow over the group.\n\n\"We've had to pivot and discuss 'how do we protect patients, patients' decisions? How do we protect embryos in storage? How do we protect clinics, particularly in states that are more threatened by some of these political decisions?'\" said Cooper, a board certified reproductive endocrinologist and medical director for fertility clinic Kindbody St. Louis, who led this year's conference, happening this week in Chicago.\n\nShe said a lot of misunderstanding around IVF has emerged in mainstream conversations since this spring, including a belief that many patients have numerous excess embryos in storage.\n\nCooper said it's lucky if even 20% of the embryos created result in a live birth.\n\nCreating only one embryo to use at a time is unrealistic, she said, and overlooks considerations including rapidly declining egg pools, patients undergoing cancer treatment and patients with genetic diseases.\n\n\"If we only create one embryo at a time, the success of IVF becomes profoundly lower,\" she said. \"And in a country where (health plans) don't often pay for IVF ... the access to care, and the affordability becomes the biggest issue of all.\"\n\nCooper said many of her Missouri patients have asked about storing their embryos across the river in Illinois, where reproductive rights are more expansive. Larger nationwide fertility clinics are also considering where to grow and expand. Right now, Cooper said, red states look less appealing than blue ones.\n\n\"I think IVF still could be at risk,\" Cooper said. \"I don't think we're quite there yet in Missouri, compared to some other states. But it's still a state where we are nervous that it could be.\"\n\nLegislation, she said, would be the most effective way to alleviate that concern.\n\nThe U.S. Senate might take up legislation to protect IVF access on a federal level as soon as this week. Last week, Senate Republicans blocked a bill from moving forward to vote on reinforcing access to contraception. Missouri Sens. Josh Hawley and Eric Schmitt were among the Republicans who blocked the legislation.\n\nAnother possible protection lies in an initiative petition campaign hoping to ask Missouri voters if they want to legalize abortion up to the point of fetal viability. The amendment, if approved for the November ballot, reads, in part: \"The government shall not deny or infringe upon a person's fundamental right to reproductive freedom.\"\n\nWhile IVF has largely faded from the headlines in recent weeks, people struggling to grow their families across Missouri still grapple with concerns sparked by the Alabama news.\n\nMaddie Bobbitt and her husband Jerel have been trying to conceive since December 2019.\n\nOne egg retrieval, six frozen embryos and two miscarriages later, they're waiting to implant their remaining two embryos in August.\n\nAbout one in five married women between the ages of 15 and 49 experience infertility in America, meaning they are unable to get pregnant within the first year of trying, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIn St. Louis, where Bobbitt lives, it's one in six couples.\n\n\"But when you are the one in six, you know, it feels like one in 6 million, it feels like you are the only one,\" Bobbitt said.\n\nWhen news of the Alabama decision came as Bobbitt, 33, was in the thick of IVF, she was filled with rage.\n\n\"IVF in and of itself is so unbelievably stressful and heartbreaking, and just very traumatic,\" Bobbitt said. \"When you add on top of it that we live in a very conservative, red state, that just adds an extra layer of stress and angst and being afraid for my own personal health and wellbeing and safety.\"\n\nJovonna Jones, 35, who is undergoing infertility treatment, considered traveling to Mexico to finish her current round of IVF when she and her husband, Donovan, heard the news. But for now, they're continuing to see their doctor in St. Louis.\n\n\"You really don't have room for stress,\" Jones said. \"Because your body needs to be as calm as possible so those follicles can continue to grow.\"\n\nSo far she and her husband have undergone five IVF cycles. They've taken out two loans and hosted numerous fundraisers to afford the $70,000 they've paid out of pocket in the hopes of making Jones' husband a father.\n\nShe has four children of her own from a previous relationship.\n\nMissouri is not among the growing number of states that mandate some form of infertility coverage, despite efforts by some lawmakers to require insurance coverage for the process to help alleviate some of the financial burden that comes with growing a family through IVF\n\nZoll, the St. Louis mother who petitioned her state senator earlier this year to protect the procedure, watches her daughter play with baby dolls and fiercely hopes she won't also experience the toll of infertility.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Embryo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infertility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Legislature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

This evangelical church has a congregation of 10 000. (Getty Images)\n\nOn Wednesday, the Southern Baptist Convention -- a denomination with nearly 13 million members -- voted to condemn the use of in-vitro fertilization. This marks the first time one of the largest conservative religious organizations in the country has officially formed a position on the reproductive care process.\n\nThe nearly 10,000 delegates at the group's annual meeting voted to affirm a \"right to life of every human being, including those in an embryonic stage,\" going so far as to include language to advocate for government regulation on IVF, per the New York Times.\n\nThe vote wasn't without dissent. While delegates from across the country shared their firsthand positive experiences with the treatment, the group ultimately voted in favor of the language, which marks a turning point in the largest evangelical body's position. Evangelical groups, especially the SBC, are amongst the most powerful voices in conservative politics.\n\nAuthor and religious right expert Annika Brockschmidt blasted the move, warning that it's merely one of many attacks on reproductive rights and sexual freedom.\n\n\"Christian Nationalists [are] coming for abortion rights, gender affirming care, IVF. We were right. Contraception and no-fault divorce are next on their chopping block,\" she wrote on X.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers took the vote as a sign that the GOP intends to trample IVF rights in the future, after an Alabama Supreme Court ruling effectively ended the practice on the grounds of \"extrauterine\" personhood.\n\n\"They have already come after reproductive freedom. They are coming after contraception. They are coming after IVF. They will not stop,\" Hawaii Democratic Senator Brian Schatz wrote in a post on X.\n\nDemocrats are expected to hold a floor vote on a bill to preserve the right to IVF at a nationwide level on Thursday.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has been vocal in his support of IVF and his opponent, Donald Trump, previously championed the right to the procedure in a Truth Social post. Whether the Southern Baptist position will influence his own is unclear, but he used a speech at the Danbury Institute earlier this week, which coincided with the conference, to urge Baptists not to vote for Democrats.", "source": {"uri": "salon.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Salon.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Baptist_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southern Baptist Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelicalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Evangelicalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megachurch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Megachurch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptists", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baptists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_denomination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christian denomination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_right", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christian right"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reproductive rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right to life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Birth control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Alabama", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of Alabama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-fault_divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "No-fault divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Schatz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brian Schatz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Infertility", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Infertility", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Alternative_Political_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Alternative Political Systems", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/1200/https://media2.salon.com/2020/02/dallas-megachurch-0228201.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9641932", "eventUri": "eng-9641932", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

But during that pregnancy Zoll developed Hellp Syndrome, an extreme and life-threatening case of preeclampsia.\n\nAfter giving birth to her daughter at 35 weeks, Zoll's doctor advised her not to do so again out of fear that she wouldn't survive another pregnancy.\n\nThat warning left Zoll and her husband unsure of the best future for their last embryo. And the uncertainty turned to fear after an Alabama Supreme Court ruling in February.\n\n\"Because of all we go through, (embryos) feel like more than just this clump of cells, because it's this hope that you'll be a parent one day,\" Zoll said. \"And you lose so much going through infertility.\"\n\nZoll, like many Americans, was shocked when the Alabama Supreme Court ruled frozen embryos were \"extrauterine children.\" Several fertility clinics in that state immediately stopped IVF for fear of being found liable for wrongful death if they accidentally destroyed an embryo.\n\nFloored by the news and the unknown, Zoll reached out to her state senator, Tracy McCreery, an Olivette Democrat. This is scary, Zoll told her. Can you do something?\n\nMcCreery would later reference stories like Zoll's on the Senate floor, but ultimately wasn't able to push through legislation to protect the procedure.\n\nA handful of attempts to protect IVF through the legislative process were introduced, but didn't make it far in either the House or Senate. In part, the reluctance stemmed from a belief that IVF wasn't in immediate danger, and therefore was an issue for a different year as more urgent matters -- and Senate dysfunction -- often ruled the day.\n\nBut advocates for IVF say the lack of urgency was a mistake. They believe ambiguity in state law leaves IVF vulnerable to the same conclusion reached by Alabama's highest court.\n\nMcCreery's bill, which would have excluded IVF from any \"unborn children\" language in Missouri law, never got a Senate hearing.\n\n\"Unfortunately in the legislature,\" McCreery said, \"there just weren't people willing to have that discussion.\"\n\nHouse Majority Leader Jon Patterson, a Lee's Summit Republican and a physician, said many Republicans, himself included, are eager to put more protections in place. But in the House, he said IVF legislation came too late in the session to realistically act on what he called a preemptive bill.\n\n\"Going forward, protecting Missouri parents' ability to access in vitro fertilization will be a priority,\" said Patterson, who is expected to become speaker of the House next session. Lawmakers, he said, \"need to do everything we can to protect access to IVF.\"\n\nIVF, the process of collecting a woman's eggs, fertilizing them with sperm in a laboratory and transferring resulting embryos to her uterus or freezing them for later, has become increasingly common. It gives people the opportunity to both start families later in life and grow families in spite of illness or infertility.\n\nIn 2021, more than 97,000 babies were born thanks to assisted reproductive technology, more than double the number a decade earlier, according to the CDC.\n\nWhile many Missouri Republicans voiced support for IVF, in the wake of the Alabama ruling a few spoke out against the procedure, arguing families should only create as many embryos as they intend to use, running counter to how the process currently works.\n\n\"I've got a group of colleagues that believe that what happened in Alabama could happen in Missouri,\" McCreery said. \"But like a lot of things in the state of Missouri, people just cross their fingers and hope that there isn't a problem.\"\n\nIn an attempt to start answering his clients many questions after the Alabama decision came down, Tim Schlesinger, a surrogacy and assisted reproductive technologies attorney in St. Louis, took to a blog post.\n\n\"This case has no direct legal impact outside the State of Alabama,\" he assured Missourians.\n\nIn a recent interview with The Independent, Schlesinger said this still holds water. But it also stands alongside another truth in Missouri: \"There is no protection for IVF right now.\"\n\nHe's carefully watched the ripple effect of the Alabama decision move north.\n\nHe doesn't believe IVF is at risk of disappearing in Missouri, but without legislation that protects both patients and clinics, he said it's not impossible for Missourians to find themselves in a situation similar to Alabama.\n\nSchlesinger knows the topic well. Several years ago he litigated the case that set the precedent for defining an embryo as \"property of a special character.\"\n\nThat case, McQueen v. Gadberry, arose from a custody dispute over embryos in a divorce.\n\nSchlesinger, who represented Gadberry -- the ex-husband who didn't want his ex-wife to use the remaining embryos to create children, and won -- said the outcome confirmed patients have the right to decide what to do with their pre-embryos.\n\nBut Michael Wolff, a former Missouri Supreme Court chief justice and dean emeritus at St. Louis University School of Law, fears the overturning of Roe v. Wade, a case cited in the McQueen v. Gadberry decision, means the precedent set by the judge's decision would no longer apply if brought before a court again.\n\nMissouri law states that all life begins at conception. Wolff interprets conception and fertilization to be one in the same in regards to state law, adding that it would simply take \"an overeager prosecutor\" for Missouri to find itself in a position similar to Alabama.\n\n\"I'm not being an alarmist about this, I'm not being an extremist. I'm not saying that everybody should believe that what the legislature says is true,\" Wolff said. \"But I think you have to take seriously what the legislature says. They were perfectly serious when they wrote it as far as I can tell.\"\n\nSchlesinger is hopeful that if a state court was faced with a case similar to McQueen v. Gadberry today, it would come to the same conclusion it did several years ago, since he said that case wasn't premised on Roe v. Wade.\n\nBut, he added, there's no guarantee the judges now sitting on the Missouri Supreme Court would agree.\n\n\"That's a legitimate concern, and an insightful concern brought up by Judge Wolff, but in my opinion, the overturn of Roe v. Wade should not impact McQueen v. Gadberry,\" he said. \"Because the reason for the overturn of Roe v Wade was not relevant to what is the character of a pre-embryo.\"\n\nSchlesinger said a more immediate impact he's considering is on doctors.\n\n\"The people who live in Missouri and want to have outstanding fertility care in Missouri might be impacted just by physicians reluctant to expand within Missouri until enough time has passed that they see how efforts in this regard are going to shake out,\" he said.\n\nAs Missouri senators debated legislation blocking Planned Parenthood clinics from receiving Medicaid reimbursements, McCreery brought forward an amendment that would exempt IVF from Missouri's current statute which states that life begins at conception.\n\n\"I assumed wrongly, stupidly, that when the legislature passed a total ban on abortion, that that would be enough. People would feel like they had their Pro-Life credentials,\" state Sen. Lauren Arthur, a Democrat from Kansas City, said during the debate. \"What I have since realized is, it's never enough.\"\n\nThe amendment never made it to a vote, but it fueled much of the Democratic senators' filibuster that April evening.\n\nBut unlike inside the statehouse, McCreery believes the issue remains largely a nonpartisan one. Conservative voters have reached out asking for her help protecting the procedure.\n\nAfter the Alabama decision, Republican state Rep. Bill Allen of Kansas City consulted his priest, who encouraged him to look around the church at the children born through IVF.\n\n\"That helped square my faith and politics, I'll tell ya,\" Allen said, adding: \"To me it was the right thing to do for Missouri families, and I just wanted to protect it.\"\n\nIn late February he filed legislation that would have clarified the right to IVF. His bill, like McCreery's, was never granted a committee hearing.\n\nAllen plans to file the bill again next year, if re-elected.\n\n\"There may have been election year politics that got in the way this time,\" he said. \"But with those removed next year, I'm really optimistic that this can get through as a priority.\"\n\nWhile IVF remains a fairly bi-partisan issue, some hold-outs remain.\n\nDuring a Missouri Freedom Caucus press conference this spring, state Sen. Rick Brattin, a Harrisonville Republican, decried the current IVF process as the \"reckless storage and disposal of human life.\"\n\nOften, several embryos are created at once, in part because many don't survive to the point of implantation in the womb. It's common practice to immediately freeze any embryos created, even if the intention is to implant them quickly.\n\n\"If you're getting in vitro fertilization, it needs to be the embryos that are going to be implanted at that particular time,\" Brattin said. \"I know it's an expensive process, but creating this huge inventory of life being frozen, I don't agree with it.\"\n\nHe proposed that families create an embryo, and then if unsuccessful, come back and create another one. Brattin could not be reached for comment.\n\nAfter the Alabama decision, many Republicans spoke up in favor of the current IVF process. But others, like Brattin, stood by a long-held anti-abortion belief that embryos should not be stored, discarded or used for science.\n\nDuring a mid-March Senate debate on an education bill, state Sen. Mike Moon, a Republican from Ash Grove, was asked by Arthur if he believed IVF should be allowed. Moon had proposed an amendment which would have required students be taught that life begins at conception.\n\n\"If I were the one with the magic wand, I would have discouraged it because now you've got how many fertilized embryos out there? And what happens if that facility where they're housed loses power and they all die? Who's culpable?\" Moon said. \"And so I think we've created a problem, and we created it. Only God's supposed to create in that fashion. And we've taken it upon ourselves to do it.\"\n\nAbolish Abortion Missouri leader Wesley Scroggins, who has endorsed Moon, called IVF \"sinful\" at a rally in Jefferson City following the Alabama ruling.\n\nThe Missouri GOP website, under a page titled \"faith and family,\" lists support for \"the protection of the lives of in vitro fertilized embryos and all other human embryos from the beginning of biological development\" just below its support for marriage between \"one man and one woman.\"\n\nAsked about IVF during a KSDK interview in March, state Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman, a Republican from Arnold and a leading anti-abortion lawmaker, said Missouri already has some of the most \"permissive\" IVF laws in the country, so she saw no further need to protect the process through legislation.\n\nShe noted that since the passage of the Missouri Stands for the Unborn Act in 2019, there's been no litigation filed against I.V.F.\n\n\"If Missouri was going to do something, they would've needed to already address it,\" she said.\n\nIn the days following the Alabama decision, lawmakers in that state passed a law shielding IVF clinics and providers from civil and criminal liability, raising concerns that while such a law allowed clinics to reopen immediately, it also prevented families from having the ability to sue if something went wrong.\n\nAsked in March if she'd support a law to more clearly protect I.V.F., Coleman said she would be hesitant.\n\n\"Because it's broadly legal right now,\" Coleman said. \"I wouldn't want to enact something that would actually make it harder for a family who would receive malpractice in their medical practice to be able to be made whole.\"\n\nAs president of the Midwest Reproductive Symposium International, Dr. Amber Cooper looks forward to discussing emerging technologies and advancing access to care at the annual gathering.\n\nBut this year, the Alabama decision lingered like a shadow over the group.\n\n\"We've had to pivot and discuss 'how do we protect patients, patients' decisions? How do we protect embryos in storage? How do we protect clinics, particularly in states that are more threatened by some of these political decisions?'\" said Cooper, a board certified reproductive endocrinologist and medical director for fertility clinic Kindbody St. Louis, who led this year's conference, happening this week in Chicago.\n\nShe said a lot of misunderstanding around IVF has emerged in mainstream conversations since this spring, including a belief that many patients have numerous excess embryos in storage.\n\nCooper said it's lucky if even 20% of the embryos created result in a live birth.\n\nCreating only one embryo to use at a time is unrealistic, she said, and overlooks considerations including rapidly declining egg pools, patients undergoing cancer treatment and patients with genetic diseases.\n\n\"If we only create one embryo at a time, the success of IVF becomes profoundly lower,\" she said. \"And in a country where (health plans) don't often pay for IVF ... the access to care, and the affordability becomes the biggest issue of all.\"\n\nCooper said many of her Missouri patients have asked about storing their embryos across the river in Illinois, where reproductive rights are more expansive. Larger nationwide fertility clinics are also considering where to grow and expand. Right now, Cooper said, red states look less appealing than blue ones.\n\n\"I think IVF still could be at risk,\" Cooper said. \"I don't think we're quite there yet in Missouri, compared to some other states. But it's still a state where we are nervous that it could be.\"\n\nLegislation, she said, would be the most effective way to alleviate that concern.\n\nThe U.S. Senate might take up legislation to protect IVF access on a federal level as soon as this week. Last week, Senate Republicans blocked a bill from moving forward to vote on reinforcing access to contraception. Missouri Sens. Josh Hawley and Eric Schmitt were among the Republicans who blocked the legislation.\n\nAnother possible protection lies in an initiative petition campaignhoping to ask Missouri voters if they want to legalize abortion up to the point of fetal viability. The amendment, if approved for the November ballot, reads, in part: \"The government shall not deny or infringe upon a person's fundamental right to reproductive freedom.\"\n\nWhile IVF has largely faded from the headlines in recent weeks, people struggling to grow their families across Missouri still grapple with concerns sparked by the Alabama news.\n\nMaddie Bobbitt and her husband Jerel have been trying to conceive since December 2019.\n\nOne egg retrieval, six frozen embryos and two miscarriages later, they're waiting to implant their remaining two embryos in August.\n\nAbout one in five married women between the ages of 15 and 49 experience infertility in America, meaning they are unable to get pregnant within the first year of trying, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIn St. Louis, where Bobbitt lives, it's one in six couples.\n\n\"But when you are the one in six, you know, it feels like one in 6 million, it feels like you are the only one,\" Bobbitt said.\n\nWhen news of the Alabama decision came as Bobbitt, 33, was in the thick of IVF, she was filled with rage.\n\n\"IVF in and of itself is so unbelievably stressful and heartbreaking, and just very traumatic,\" Bobbitt said. \"When you add on top of it that we live in a very conservative, red state, that just adds an extra layer of stress and angst and being afraid for my own personal health and wellbeing and safety.\"\n\nJovonna Jones, 35, who is undergoing infertility treatment, considered traveling to Mexico to finish her current round of IVF when she and her husband, Donovan, heard the news. But for now, they're continuing to see their doctor in St. Louis.\n\n\"You really don't have room for stress,\" Jones said. \"Because your body needs to be as calm as possible so those follicles can continue to grow.\"\n\nSo far she and her husband have undergone five IVF cycles. They've taken out two loans and hosted numerous fundraisers to afford the $70,000 they've paid out of pocket in the hopes of making Jones' husband a father.\n\nShe has four children of her own from a previous relationship.\n\nMissouri is not among the growing number of states that mandate some form of infertility coverage, despite efforts by some lawmakers to require insurance coverage for the process to help alleviate some of the financial burden that comes with growing a family through IVF\n\nZoll, the St. Louis mother who petitioned her state senator earlier this year to protect the procedure, watches her daughter play with baby dolls and fiercely hopes she won't also experience the toll of infertility.\n\n\"IVF is one of the most pro life things I've ever heard,\" said Zoll, who runs an infertility-focused nonprofit in St. Louis called Making a Miracle, \"How can you try and take that away? The impact would be just detrimental to so many families, because it's our right to have children and build them.\"", "source": {"uri": "kcur.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "KCUR 89.3 - NPR in Kansas City.

Peters cosponsored this legislation, which was introduced in response to continued efforts across the country to limit access to reproductive health care, including access to IVF and ART services.\n\n\"Becoming a father was one of the greatest joys of my life. I believe every American who wants to be a parent should have that same opportunity,\" said Senator Peters. \"IVF is an essential tool that has helped countless families who face infertility, frequent miscarriages, or other medical challenges. I call on my Republican colleagues to support this bill and ensure IVF and other critical health care services remain available to every American who simply wants the chance to start a family.\"\n\nThe Right to IVF Act is a package of bills that, together, would protect the ability to receive - and for health care professionals to provide - IVF services. Additionally, the package would expand IVF insurance coverage, making it more accessible and affordable for millions of Americans.\n\nSpecifically, the Right to IVF Act includes:\n\nThe Access to Family Building Act, which Peters also cosponsored, that would ensure individuals have the right to access IVF and ART services. It would also protect the right of insurance providers and insurers to cover these services.\n\nThe Veteran Families Health Services Act, which would allow servicemembers to preserve gametes both before deployment to a combat zone or hazardous duty assignment and after an injury or illness. Additionally, it would enhance fertility treatment and counseling options for veterans and servicemembers.\n\nThe Access to Infertility Treatment and Care Act, which would make fertility care, including IVF, more affordable by requiring employer-sponsored and other public insurance plans to cover fertility treatments to protect Americans against expensive out-of-pocket costs.\n\nThe Family Building Federal Employees Health Benefit (FEHB) Fairness Act, which would require employer-sponsored health insurance plans, including the Federal Employees Health Benefit (FEHB) Program, to cover assisted reproductive technology, including IVF.\n\nThe Right to IVF Act is supported by numerous key stakeholders, including the National Women's Law Center, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Reproductive Freedom For All, National Council of Jewish Women, and Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA).\n\nPeters has been a strong advocate for protecting access to essential care and the right of all Americans to make health care decisions privately with their doctors and family. Last week, Peters spoke on the Senate floor in support of the Right to Contraception Act, legislation Peters cosponsored that would guarantee the right to access contraceptives. Peters also spoke on the Senate floor in February to urge his colleagues to support the Access to Family Building Act, legislation Peters cosponsored that would protect every American's right to access in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment, as well as other assisted reproductive technology (ART) services. Last year, Peters joined his colleagues in introducing the Women's Health Protection Act of 2023, legislation seeking to restore the right to comprehensive health care for millions of Americans following the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization which repealed Roe v. Wade. In 2020, Peters was the first U.S. Senator to publicly share his family's personal abortion story.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Peters", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gary Peters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assisted reproductive technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miscarriage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infertility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_professional", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health professional"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamete", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gamete"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fertility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Health_Protection_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's Health Protection Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

They'll even say life starts at conception,\" she noted in a March tweet. \"On the other hand, many of these same pro-life Republicans adamantly support unrestricted access to IVF, which has resulted in the destruction, abandonment, and indefinite freezing of millions of embryos over the past several decades.\"\n\n\"Yes, Republicans are hypocrites, which may be worse in this case than Democrats, who are simply open about their support of destroying babies,\" she declared. \"I can't stand the dissonance, the duplicitousness, the dishonesty. I can't stand politics. Babies have a right to life. Period.\"\n\n\"I have talked to many IVF moms - wonderful, Christian mothers who love their children - who only now realize the quandary they've placed themselves in. They have embryos frozen on ice, and they don't know what to do. Discarding them feels wrong. Allowing them to be frozen indefinitely while paying the fee feels wrong. Adopting them out to a couple who may not share their beliefs and may mistreat them feels wrong. There's no easy answer, and they weren't warned about this when they went through IVF to begin with. No one warns parents about these heartbreaking ramifications. Few consider the ethics of this from the embryo's perspective,\" Stuckey noted.", "source": {"uri": "theblaze.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheBlaze"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allie_Beth_Stuckey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Allie Beth Stuckey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaze_Media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blaze Media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fearmongering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fearmongering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christians", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christians"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right to life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Embryo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Baby", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Baby", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Infertility", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Infertility", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.theblaze.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=52448577&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C57%2C0%2C57", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9641932", "eventUri": "eng-9641932", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

Sen. Welch's remarks came ahead of Senate Republicans' refusal to join Democrats in advancing the Right to IVF Act today. \"We have a terrible United States Supreme Court. It will live in infamy for many reasons, but no more of an ignominious decision that took away constitutional rights that American citizens enjoyed. They stripped women of their right to choose. Enormously bad consequences: it's created an incentive for folks who have their views, to try and impose them on others. And we saw that in Alabama with their effort to prohibit people from having access to in vitro fertilization,\" said Senator Welch. \"Now our Republican colleagues are saying that this is a 'show vote,' so why pay attention to it? Well, you know what? They're right. They're right,\" continued Senator Welch. \"It's a vote to show that we want to make certain -- with the power of the United States Congress -- that the decision a family wants to make about trying to conceive through IVF is protected. That they have the capacity to take advantage of the best medicine that is out there to realize that dream that is a dream about life.\" \"And what's wrong with showing the people of the United States that each and every one of us in the United States Senate wants to not only show that we respect and honor the decision those citizens are making, but with the power invested in us as United States Senators, we're going to use the authority of our vote to guarantee they have that right?\" concluded Senator Welch. Watch the Senator's full remarks below:\n\nThis Congress, Senator Welch joined the Access to Family Building Act, which would establish a statutory right to access IVF for all Americans who need it to start or grow a family by protecting access to IVF and other assisted reproductive technology nationwide. The bill has 46 Senate cosponsors. Senate Republicans blocked the legislation from being passed in February. Last week, Senator Welch delivered remarks on the Senate floor emphasizing the importance of passing the Right to Contraception Act, legislation that guarantees the right for people to obtain and use contraceptives and protects providers' rights to prescribe contraceptives and provide information related to contraception, free from government interference. The bill passed the House of Representatives in July 2022 but was blocked in the Senate by Republicans in 2022, 2023, and 2024.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Welch", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peter Welch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senator_Welch", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Senator Welch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

If you have a question on work and careers, family and relationships or personal finance, send your question via the form below.\n\nThe question: \"We have done several rounds of IVF [in vitro fertilisation] with a negative result. It is putting our lives on hold, especially me because I have to attend all the appointments and follow a strict healthy lifestyle. Whenever I start having a normal life again, I feel that I am jeopardising our chances. I really want this child but a part of me wants it to be over so that I can have my life back. I am starting to lose hope and nobody has a clear explanation why it is not working. I feel helpless.\"\n\nLaura Fox's answer: Going through IVF is a physically and emotionally draining process, and having several rounds without success is understandably demoralising and difficult to cope with.\n\nThe uncertainty inherent in this process should not be underestimated. I hear that the whole experience has been disruptive to your lifestyle and normal routines, including the new health and lifestyle changes for increasing fertility. It also seems that you're finding it challenging to cope with these changes. Is there something specific you had to give up that you find particularly difficult? I'm curious as to what it is that you feel you are missing out on that leads you to feel like you want your life back. Perhaps it's worth exploring this further, as it may be an opportunity to make more lasting changes to your health, and it could be a matter of perspective.\n\nThe unpredictability of IVF can indeed lead to feelings of doubt about whether it's worth continuing. Given that IVF can take time and involves a lot of waiting, have you considered taking breaks from the process? Taking time to recharge and recover from the treatments doesn't necessarily mean giving up; instead, it could be a way of taking care of yourself. Reconnecting with parts of your life that bring you joy and fulfilment can be very helpful. Engaging in activities that lift your spirits and focusing on things outside of the fertility process can help mitigate feelings of helplessness.\n\nIt's important to remember that the human brain has a negativity bias and tends to fixate on what isn't going well. In your situation, reminding yourself of what you're grateful for can help maintain perspective and manage stress. Building a healthy support network is crucial. Consider reaching out to health professionals and connecting with others who have been in similar situations.\n\nPrioritising your mental and physical health, joining a supportive community, and engaging in activities that nourish you are all essential. Maintaining open communication with your partner about IVF as well as your lives more generally is important to ensure that this process doesn't take a toll on your relationship. Taking a long-term approach that allows you to enjoy your life as much as possible during this journey will hopefully be beneficial.\n\nYou mentioned that nobody has a clear explanation for why IVF isn't working, which is understandably frustrating. While it's important to stay informed and listen to medical advice, it's equally important to develop the ability to sit with uncertainty and manage the uncomfortable feelings that arise from seeking answers and control. This process is inherently uncertain. During difficult moments, techniques such as breathing exercises, physical movement, and spending time in nature can help calm your nervous system and bring a sense of stability.\n\nLaura Fox is a counsellor and mindfulness specialist working in Belair, Luxembourg City.

Here's how MO, KS voted.", "body": "Republicans from Kansas and Missouri on Thursday blocked a bill offering federal protections for in-vitro fertilization, as Democrats are ramping up their efforts to pin Republicans down on abortion rights ahead of the November election.\n\nThe bill, which failed 48-47 with all but two Republicans voting against it, would have preempted any state law that forbids the use of IVF.\n\nDemocrats expected the vote to fail, using it as part of a larger messaging campaign accusing Republicans of trying to restrict women's rights. Last week, the Democrats offered legislation to grant federal protections for access to birth control that also failed to pass the Senate.\n\nSen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican running for reelection, characterized the bill as part of a larger messaging push by Democrats to focus on an issue they think helps turn out voters.\n\n\"I'm not gonna vote for the Democrats version because it'll have all of this abortion related language in it,\" Hawley said ahead of the vote. \"I'm for IVF and we ought to leave it alone and certainly not get rid of it. In Missouri IVF is widely available, protected in law, that's how it should be.\"\n\nDemocrats have aggressively campaigned on abortion rights in the aftermath of the 2022 Supreme Court ruling that eliminated federal protections for abortion as Republicans, who once eagerly campaigned on the issue, have struggled to come up with a consistent message.\n\nRepublicans like Hawley, who is up for reelection this November, have repeatedly said they believe the abortion rights are best left up to voters in the states. But that message has been complicated by anti-abortion advocates who continue to push for federal limits.\n\nHawley has co-sponsored a bill that would ban the procedure after 15-weeks, saying he believes there is national consensus on when the procedure should be banned. And he was in the Supreme Court to support his wife, Erin Morrow Hawley, as she argued a case that would limit the use of mifepristone, a commonly used abortion medication.\n\nDemocrats have also seized on an Alabama Supreme Court ruling in February declaring fertilized embryos are people and throwing access to IVF in the state into question. While the Alabama legislature quickly passed a law to protect IVF, Democrats have continued to use the court's ruling to highlight how far some Republicans would go in the name of limiting abortion.\n\nLucas Kunce, Hawley's likely Democratic opponent, immediately criticized Hawley after the vote. He said the federal protections are necessary because Missouri has a similar law that says life begins at conception, which could be used to limit IVF.\n\n\"Josh claims to be '100% pro-IVF' but he's really just 100% full of (expletive) ,\" Kunce said.\n\nThe vote came the same day the Supreme Court protected access to mifepristone, ruling that a group of doctors didn't have the legal standing to overrule the Food and Drug Administration's decision to allow the abortion medication to be prescribed without an in-person doctor visit and for the pills to be sent in the mail.\n\nThe White House issued a statement from President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris after the ruling, saying the lawsuit against medication abortion is part of a larger attempt to ban the procedure across the country.\n\n\"Today's decision does not change the fact that the fight for reproductive freedom continues. It does not change the fact that the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade two years ago, and women lost a fundamental freedom,\" the statement said. \"It does not change the fact that the right for a woman to get the treatment she needs is imperiled if not impossible in many states.\"\n\nHow they voted", "source": {"uri": "kansascity.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Kansas City Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_desrochers@kansascity.com", "name": "Daniel Desrochers", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hawley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hawley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Birth control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mifepristone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mifepristone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_Kunce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lucas Kunce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

Cupp: The ripple effect of overturning Roe v. Wade", "body": "It's nearly two years since the conservative Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the decision that had protected access to abortion for nearly 50 years, sparking a seismic series of events in American political history.\n\nAnd if overturning Roe was indeed an earthquake, the aftershocks have been never-ending, although a unanimous court did prudently pull back this week from banning the abortion pill.\n\nDobbs vs. Jackson, the 2022 case that allowed states to ban or limit abortion in unprecedented -- and unpopular -- ways also opened the door to countless other conversations and legislative actions that have upended women's reproductive rights for multiple generations.\n\nWould essentially kicking the issue over to the states mean one could just vote to ban it completely? Yes, yes it did. Abortion is now banned in almost all circumstances in 14 states.\n\nWould women who got abortions be thrown in jail? Some state lawmakers said enthusiastically, \"yes!\" and others have tried arresting women. Former President Donald Trump, for his part, has said he's open to punishing women.\n\nWould doctors and anyone else who aided in the procurement of an illegal abortion be prosecuted or punished? Yes, in some cases, as it turns out.\n\nIs contraception safe from the grasp of far-right judges and lawmakers? Not if you talk to Senate Republicans.\n\nWhat about IVF -- in vitro fertilization -- a practice millions of women use to get pregnant, and one that 86% of Americans want to be kept legal? That's also in the crosshairs as states like Alabama decided that destroying unused embryos was murder.\n\nIt's unclear whether or not pro-life advocates for overturning Roe had considered all the ramifications of getting what they wanted -- including the political ones.\n\nAfter all, it's an election year, and these aftershocks keep rocking Republicans running for office all over the country, leading to headlines like these:\n\nSixty-three percent of Americans say they could not support an elected official who believes in a nationwide abortion ban.\n\nAnd every time Republicans manage to muscle past one ugly news cycle in which they're in the spotlight for opposing women's reproductive rights, another one puts them right back in it.\n\nThis week, a one-two punch: First, Southern Baptists representing almost 13 million members across the country voted on Wednesday to oppose IVF.\n\nIn Indianapolis, 10,000 delegates called \"messengers\" gathered at the annual Southern Baptist Convention and voted to \"reaffirm the unconditional value and right to life of every human being, including those in an embryonic stage, and to only utilize reproductive technologies consistent with that affirmation, especially in the number of embryos generated in the IVF process.\"\n\nAnd on Thursday, the Senate took a procedural vote on a legislative package to protect IVF access, which Republicans killed.\n\nPut aside the fact that efforts to criminalize IVF puts Republicans in the uncomfortable and hypocritical position of having to oppose the creation of life while condemning the destruction of it, a familiar position given that pro-life advocates are sometimes against abortions even in the case of saving a mother's life.\n\nAnd put aside the fact that IVF is hugely popular across party lines and even among evangelicals. Threatening to limit, ban, or criminalize it is stupid math at any time, but especially in an election year.\n\nThe wildest part of this is that Republicans who thought overturning Roe was a practical win couldn't envision just how much of a political loser it would turn out to be.\n\nThe 2022 midterm elections, which happened just months after Dobbs, were a decisive victory for Democrats. And voters in battleground states like Michigan and Pennsylvania said abortion was the most important issue of that election, not GOP-favoring inflation or crime.\n\nBefore Dobbs the midterms looked very bad for Democrats -- \"disastrous,\" according to Politico. President Biden had low approval ratings, voters were contending with economic malaise, crime, and a migrant crisis and midterms are usually bad for incumbent presidents.\n\nBut thanks to abortion, Dems were able to dam an impending red wave.\n\nConditions haven't changed much -- Biden's approvals are still low, and the economy, crime and immigration are still important issues for many voters.\n\nBut the issue of women's reproductive rights, thanks to these endless ripple effects and damning news cycles for Republicans, is still threatening to save the Democrats and Biden from another Trump administration and Republican wins down-ballot.\n\nOverturning Roe is the bomb that keeps exploding, even years after the initial blast.

The legislation, which Durbin is a cosponsor of, establishes a clear and enforceable nationwide right to receive, provide, or cover in vitro fertilization (IVF) services and other assisted reproductive technologies. It also expands insurance coverage for such care.\n\nDuring his speech, Durbin praised Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) and Senator Patty Murray (D-WA) for their efforts on this legislation. He also highlighted Senator Duckworth's journey with IVF.\n\n\"What's at stake here is privacy and freedom as to whether we, as Americans, are going to respect one another in making these fundamental human decisions. There are politicians in this chamber, as well as legislatures across the country, who want to make that decision for your family. Don't let them take that away from you.

That hearing came after two previous hearings the Committee has held on reproductive freedoms since Roe was overruled -- one in July 2022 and one in April 2023.

And that, ultimately, is what this is all about,\" Britt said Wednesday on the Senate floor as Democrats blocked the bill from being considered.\n\n\"They're in Week 2 of their Summer of Scare Tactics, and eventually they are going to transition into a Fall of Fearmongering,\" the senator said of her colleagues across the aisle.\n\nThe IVF Protection Act, Britt claimed, is the strongest of several competing Senate bills.\n\nShe argued the legislation, which Britt cosponsored with Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, is the only one that could pass with 60 votes in the upper chamber, the only version that \"safeguards religious liberties\" and is the only bill solely dedicated to protecting the fertility treatments.\n\n\"However, that's not the bill the Democrats will be putting on the floor this week,\" Britt said. \"Sadly, they aren't interested in a bill to actually protect IVF access and figuring out how we can get that to become law.

Wade", "body": "It's nearly two years since the conservative Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the decision that had protected access to abortion for nearly 50 years, sparking a seismic series of events in American political history.\n\nAnd if overturning Roe was indeed an earthquake, the aftershocks have been never-ending, although a unanimous court did prudently pull back this week from banning the abortion pill.\n\nDobbs vs. Jackson, the 2022 case that allowed states to ban or limit abortion in unprecedented -- and unpopular -- ways, also opened the door to countless other conversations and legislative actions that have upended women's reproductive rights for multiple generations.\n\nWould essentially kicking the issue to the states mean one could just vote to ban it completely? Yes, yes it did. Abortion is now banned in almost all circumstances in 14 states.\n\nWould women who got abortions be thrown in jail? Some state lawmakers said enthusiastically, \"yes!\" and others have tried arresting women. Former President Donald Trump has said he's open to punishing women.\n\nWould doctors and anyone else who aided in the procurement of an illegal abortion be prosecuted or punished? Yes, in some cases.\n\nIs contraception safe from the grasp of far-right judges and lawmakers? Not if you talk to Senate Republicans.\n\nWhat about IVF -- in vitro fertilization -- a practice millions of women use to get pregnant, and one that 86% of Americans want to be kept legal? That's also in the crosshairs as states like Alabama decided that destroying unused embryos was murder.\n\nIt's unclear whether or not pro-life advocates for overturning Roe considered all the ramifications of getting what they wanted -- including the political ones.\n\nAfter all, it's an election year, and these aftershocks keep rocking Republicans running for office all over the country, leading to headlines like these:\n\n\"Republicans Receive Nightmare Polling News.\"\n\nAnd numbers like these: 63% of Americans say they could not support an elected official who believes in a nationwide abortion ban, 60% of Independents are unhappy that Roe was overturned and nearly 40% of Republicans say the same, and 59% of Americans believe abortion should be legal.\n\nEvery time Republicans manage to muscle past one ugly news cycle in which they're in the spotlight for opposing women's reproductive rights, another one puts them right back in it.\n\nThis week, a one-two punch: First, Southern Baptists representing almost 13 million members across the country voted on Wednesday to oppose IVF.\n\nIn Indianapolis, 10,000 delegates called \"messengers\" gathered at the annual Southern Baptist Convention and voted to \"reaffirm the unconditional value and right to life of every human being, including those in an embryonic stage, and to only utilize reproductive technologies consistent with that affirmation.\"\n\nOn Thursday, the Senate took a procedural vote on a legislative package to protect IVF access, which Republicans killed.\n\nPut aside the fact that efforts to criminalize IVF put Republicans in the uncomfortable and hypocritical position of having to oppose the creation of life while condemning the destruction of it, a familiar position given that pro-life advocates are sometimes against abortions even to save a mother's life.\n\nAnd put aside the fact that IVF is hugely popular across party lines and even among evangelicals. Threatening to limit, ban, or criminalize it is stupid math at any time, but especially in an election year.\n\nThe wildest part is that Republicans who thought overturning Roe was a practical win couldn't envision just how much of a political loser it would turn out to be.\n\nThe 2022 midterm elections were a decisive victory for Democrats. Voters in battleground states like Michigan and Pennsylvania said abortion was the most important issue of that election, not GOP-favoring inflation or crime.\n\nBefore Dobbs the midterms looked very bad for Democrats. President Joe Biden had low approval ratings, voters were contending with economic malaise, crime, and a migrant crisis and midterms are usually bad for incumbent presidents.\n\nBut thanks to abortion, Dems were able to dam an impending red wave.\n\nConditions haven't changed much. Biden's approvals are still low, and the economy, crime and immigration are still important issues for many voters.\n\nBut women's reproductive rights is still threatening to save the Democrats and Biden from another Trump administration and Republican wins down-ballot.\n\nOverturning Roe is the bomb that keeps exploding. It could be the GOP's nail in the coffin.", "source": {"uri": "chicago.suntimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chicago Sun-Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

In the hands of voters * Missouri Independent", "body": "Two years have passed since Missouri outlawed abortion nearly completely.\n\nMissouri's life-begins-at-conception law also seems to outlaw in vitro fertilization (IVF), the medical process that enables many infertile couples to conceive and bear children. If citizens of Missouri wish to protect this procedure then there will need to be a new law.\n\nHow is IVF related to the state's ban on abortion? Let's start with a simple question: When Missouri law proclaims that life begins at conception, does that mean that fertilized eggs are persons? The Alabama Supreme Court said yes, shocking families whose doctors are helping them become pregnant through IVF. Likewise, when the U.S. Supreme Court in the Dobbs case held there is no constitutional protection for reproductive decisions, does that mean that destruction of fertilized eggs could be considered homicide under the laws of these states such as Missouri?\n\nThe Dobbs decision in 2022 turned these questions over to the states, subject only to federal statutes (which do not apply to IVF or abortion, so far), so the wording of states' laws now really matters.\n\nWhat should happen in a working democracy is that state legislators would change the laws before rulings strike down access to IVF or patients with ectopic pregnancies die waiting to be treated. Changes in laws are difficult in the current extremist era.\n\nStates like Missouri, where voters can change the constitution, can protect access to care. But Congress, if extremists prevail, could enact federal laws to limit or bar state protections, even state constitutions.\n\n\"Words have meaning...and their meaning doesn't change,\" said the late Justice Antonin Scalia. We should take Scalia's advice as a caution when politicians throw words around to assure us falsely that all is well with IVF and women's emergency health care.\n\nAfter Dobbs, we must read carefully what state legislators have enacted for us that fully apply. We need also to be aware that nationwide legislation has been proposed in Congress to trump state law and ban or severely restrict abortion.\n\nLet's look at the words: In vitro fertilization (IVF) is the process of fertilizing a woman's egg outside the womb (in a \"test tube,\" as you've heard) with a man's sperm. The fertilized egg is then implanted in the womb with the hope a child is born at the end of the pregnancy. Fertilized eggs can be frozen, stored for later use. In some cases, these eggs are discarded inadvertently or on purpose.\n\nIs there a distinction between \"fertilization\" and \"conception?\" Some may equate \"conception\" with \"pregnancy,\" which occurs when a fertilized egg is implanted in the woman's womb. Not so, according to Missouri law, which equates \"fertilization\" and \"conception\" by defining \"conception\" as \"the fertilization of the ovum (egg) of a female by the sperm of a male.\" Missouri law plainly says that \"the life of each human being begins at conception\" and \"the term 'unborn children' or 'unborn child' shall include all unborn child or children or the offspring of human beings from the moment of conception until birth at every stage of biological development.\" It is not necessary that the fertilized egg be implanted in a womb to be considered an unborn child.\n\nSo, does that make accidental discarding of fertilized eggs manslaughter, or the intentional discarding of those eggs murder?\n\nA 1992 Missouri Supreme Court case upheld the conviction for manslaughter of a negligent intoxicated driver who injured a pregnant woman in a collision that killed her unborn child. The court cited the definition of an \"unborn child\" in the life-begins-at-conception law which plainly says \"the laws of this state shall be interpreted and construed to acknowledge on behalf of the unborn child at every stage of development, all the rights, privileges, and immunities available to other persons, citizens, and residents of this state, subject only to the Constitution of the United States, and decisional interpretations thereof by the United States Supreme Court and specific provisions to the contrary in the statutes and constitution of this state.\"\n\nUnder current Missouri law, which considers fertilized eggs as persons, criminal punishments for women and doctors who discard fertilized eggs are possible unless legislators change the law or voters enact a proposed Missouri constitutional change likely to be on the ballot this November.\n\nSome IVF proponents may take comfort from a pre-Dobbs 2-1 ruling in 2016 by the Missouri Court of Appeals that fertilized frozen embryos are not persons but are property of \"special character.\" The majority opinion was on solid ground when Roe v. Wade was the constitutional law of the land. But Roe is no longer law, so for any future ruling on this topic, we should look to the court of appeals dissent, also well-reasoned, which said that under Missouri's law embryos are persons not property. In the recently concluded Missouri legislative session, a House bill to protect IVF was introduced but not referred to committee until the last day of the session, dead on arrival.\n\nWhat about ectopic pregnancies, which result when fertilized eggs become implanted outside the womb, posing a serious risk to the woman's life or health?\n\nMedical care that ends these pregnancies may violate Missouri law which bans all abortions except in life-threatening emergencies or where there is serious risk of \"substantial and irreversible\" physical harm. Women will not be prosecuted, but a health care provider (not the state prosecutor) will have to prove that a woman's life or physical health was in danger before the abortion care was provided. We will continue to have news reports of women denied care until they are clearly in danger of death or irreversible damage to their reproductive organs. Doctors, nurses, and midwives who practice obstetrical care will probably continue leaving states with such laws, especially where (as in Missouri) they must prove their innocence.\n\nWhat's the solution?\n\nThe anxiety resulting from the decisions stripping away the constitutional protection of the Roe v. Wade line of cases could readily be dispatched by a law from Congress to protect IVF as proposed by Senator Tammy Duckworth, or to more broadly protect reproductive healthcare, as proposed by Senator Tammy Baldwin. But so far, that has not happened. Legislative efforts in most states with restrictive laws, as we've seen in Missouri, are also blocked.\n\nWhich leaves these questions exactly where the U.S. Supreme Court put them - in the hands of voters in Missouri - who will decide whether to protect reproductive health care in our state constitution - and voters across the country who will decide whether Congress will have a working majority to override state laws.", "source": {"uri": "missouriindependent.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Missouri Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Egg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uterus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygote", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Zygote"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonin_Scalia", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Antonin Scalia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

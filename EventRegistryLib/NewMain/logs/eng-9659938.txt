Tennis at this year's Olympics will take place on the clay at Roland Garros.\n\n\"Especially with all the struggles I was having last month, I feel like I need to take care of my health. ... It's too much with the scheduling,\" Sabalenka said. \"It's just too much. I made the decision to take care of my health.\"\n\nHad Sabalenka elected to compete at the Games, she would have been entered as an Individual Neutral Athlete, provided she passed an eligibility review. Belarusian and Russian athletes are prohibited from competing under their nations' flags due to the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe two-time grand slam champion is the No. 2 seed in the Berlin grass-court tournament this week as she prepares for Wimbledon. This will be her first tournament since the French Open.\n\nWorld No. 10 and three-time grand slam finalist Ons Jabeur also confirmed that she will miss the Games next month, writing on social media that the change of surfaces would put her health at risk. The Tunisian has been dealing with a recurring knee injury.\n\nAfter the clay court season concluded at the French Open, players will now spend the next few weeks playing on grass, a much faster and often slippery surface.\n\nThe WTA grass court season ends at Wimbledon, with the majority of tournaments throughout rest of the calendar typically being staged on hard courts. However, with the Olympics being held at Roland-Garros, a switch back to the physically taxing clay offers a challenge.\n\n\"After consulting with my medical team regarding attending the Olympics in Paris, we have decided that the quick change of surface and the body's adaptation required would put my knee at risk and jeopardize the rest of my season,\" Jabeur posted on X, formerly known as Twitter. \"Unfortunately, I will not be able to participate in the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\n\"I have always loved representing my country in any competition, However, I must listen to my body and follow my medical team's advise.\"\n\nSabalenka and Jabeur join Great Britain's Emma Raducanu in opting not to compete at the Olympics.\n\nAs a former grand slam winner, Raducanu was offered a wild card spot in the tournament, which would have given her automatic entry into the Games despite her current ranking of No. 165. However, she turned it down saying it wasn't the \"right time\" for her this year.\n\n\"With the changing surface, it's just not worth the risk for me at this point,\" Raducanu said.\n\nRaducanu had dropped out of French Open qualifying to work on building her fitness. Choosing to focus on the grass-court and hard-court portions of the season seemed to pay off, as Raducanu reached the semifinals at the Rothesay Open, a Wimbledon tune-up event, last week.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_joseph@aol.com", "name": "Sam Joseph", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "jill_martin@aol.com", "name": "Jill Martin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryna_Sabalenka", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aryna Sabalenka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ons_Jabeur", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ons Jabeur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarus", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirra_Andreeva", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mirra Andreeva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Tennis_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's Tennis Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tunisia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Tunisia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Raducanu", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emma Raducanu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardcourt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hardcourt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_cnn_articles_945/37d40752da12b9537452f1e9cea16ff2", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659938", "eventUri": "eng-9659938", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 543, "textEnd": 549}, {"amb": false, "date": "2018-06-", "textStart": 121, "textEnd": 128}], "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Tennis at this year's Olympics will take place on the clay at Roland Garros.\n\n\"Especially with all the struggles I was having last month, I feel like I need to take care of my health. ... It's too much with the scheduling,\" Sabalenka said. \"It's just too much. I made the decision to take care of my health.\"\n\nHad Sabalenka elected to compete at the Games, she would have been entered as an Individual Neutral Athlete, provided she passed an eligibility review. Belarusian and Russian athletes are prohibited from competing under their nations' flags due to the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe two-time grand slam champion is the No. 2 seed in the Berlin grass-court tournament this week as she prepares for Wimbledon. This will be her first tournament since the French Open.\n\nWorld No. 10 and three-time grand slam finalist Ons Jabeur also confirmed that she will miss the Games next month, writing on social media that the change of surfaces would put her health at risk. The Tunisian has been dealing with a recurring knee injury.\n\nAfter the clay court season concluded at the French Open, players will now spend the next few weeks playing on grass, a much faster and often slippery surface.\n\nThe WTA grass court season ends at Wimbledon, with the majority of tournaments throughout rest of the calendar typically being staged on hard courts. However, with the Olympics being held at Roland-Garros, a switch back to the physically taxing clay offers a challenge.\n\n\"After consulting with my medical team regarding attending the Olympics in Paris, we have decided that the quick change of surface and the body's adaptation required would put my knee at risk and jeopardize the rest of my season,\" Jabeur posted on X, formerly known as Twitter. \"Unfortunately, I will not be able to participate in the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\n\"I have always loved representing my country in any competition, However, I must listen to my body and follow my medical team's advise.\"\n\nSabalenka and Jabeur join Great Britain's Emma Raducanu in opting not to compete at the Olympics.\n\nAs a former grand slam winner, Raducanu was offered a wild card spot in the tournament, which would have given her automatic entry into the Games despite her current ranking of No. 165. However, she turned it down saying it wasn't the \"right time\" for her this year.\n\n\"With the changing surface, it's just not worth the risk for me at this point,\" Raducanu said.\n\nRaducanu had dropped out of French Open qualifying to work on building her fitness. Choosing to focus on the grass-court and hard-court portions of the season seemed to pay off, as Raducanu reached the semifinals at the Rothesay Open, a Wimbledon tune-up event, last week.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Both women, who are in the top 10, blame their recordings on scheduling problems.\n\nThe pair have joined a host of top players tennis talents who have withdrawn from the sport's premier event in recent weeks, declaring that their bodies would not cope well with the rigors of the switch from grass at Wimbledon to clay at Roland Garros for the Olympics and then immediately move on to the hard court season in North America. Sabalenka, who has won the past two Australian Open women's singles titles, announced on Monday her withdrawal from the Paris Games in Berlin, where she will play Daria Kasatkina in the last 16.\n\nThe Belarusian said she would rather take a break than compete in the upcoming Games, saying her absence is due to the packed WTA schedule. \"It is simply poor planning by the WTA. After the Olympic Games we have to fly straight to Canada for a mandatory event. That is too much pressure and has health consequences,\" said Sabalenka.\n\n\"Unfortunately I have to sacrifice one tournament and at this stage of my career it's the Olympics. It's just too much. Now we're playing on grass, on clay at the Olympics, on hard courts in Canada. It's so crazy and damaging our health.\"\n\nWhile number 10 Tunisian world champion Jabeur We (and my medical team) decided that the rapid change of surface and required body adjustment would compromise my knee and jeopardize the rest of my season, Jabeur wrote.\n\nI have always loved representing my country in any competition. However, I need to listen to my body and follow the advice of my medical team. Other top players withdrawing from Olympic competition include Elise Mertens, Andrey Rublev, Ben Shelton and Karen Khachanov.\n\n2021 US Open champion Emma Raducanu has also turned down the chance to represent Great Britain at the Olympics so she can focus on the US hard court season. She also cited the switch from grass to clay as a major factor behind that decision. And with the serious possibility of more withdrawals to come, the tennis world has debated whether tennis should even be played in the Olympics, as top players often prioritize the majors over competing for their country.\n\nHowever, former world number 1 Naomi Osaka and Caroline Wozniacki have confirmed they will return to Roland Garros to take part in the Olympic Games. The Japan Tennis Federation has confirmed that Osaka will compete against 2014 US Open finalist Kei Nishikori. Paris will be Osaka's second Olympic Games.\n\nRELATED:\n\nWhile the 33-year-old Wozniacki will play in her fourth Olympic Games. She will join Clara Tauson and ATP No. 15 Holger Rune as part of the Danish line-up.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

That's very important in life, in general, to be grateful for what you did.\n\nAs the 29-year-old Tunisian returns to the grass, it's hard not to shake the bittersweet memories on the turf. It is the surface on which she won her first Hologic WTA Tour title, at 2021 Birmingham, and her history-making runs to back-to-back Wimbledon finals, in 2022 and 2023.\n\nIt is, of course, also where she went into those finals as the favorite to become the first Arab and North African Grand Slam champion, only to walk away empty-handed.\n\n\"I come from a very small country, a continent that dreams of seeing someone win a Grand Slam,\" Jabeur said. \"I feel it's great what I achieved. Obviously it becomes more and more personal for me because it's always tough to arrive to the final and not win it. But I'm going to keep chasing my dream and what I've learned is that I shouldn't be afraid of failing because that's where I'm really courageous.\n\n\"If I arrive again to the final and I fail again and I stand up again and go back again to another final, I see that as being a strong woman more than anything else.\"\n\nThis year, Jabeur has hit the grass under the radar. In a season in which her body has been her toughest opponent, Jabeur has slipped to No.10 on the PIF WTA Rankings, her lowest ranking in over two years.\n\nBut her form and results are trending in the right direction. She has made the quarterfinals of three of her last four tournaments, including at Roland Garros and Madrid.\n\n\"I always say the more matches I play on clay, the more physically better [I am] and easier the grass season is for me,\" said Jabeur, \"because the toughest surface to play on in tennis is clay because you have to be physically ready.\n\n\"But definitely, [Roland Garros] gave me a lot of confidence and made me understand a lot of things. I was blaming myself a lot at the beginning of the season, knowing that I was really injured. I didn't know how much the injury affected my physical but also my mind. Obviously, if you cannot step on your foot you're not going to rip forehands.\"\n\nJabeur admits she is still not 100 percent. She continues to manage the knee injury that has plagued her season. Some days are worse than others, but Jabeur said she will need to have it checked again after Wimbledon.\n\nBut back on soft and forgiving grass, Jabeur has been back to her swashbuckling ways. Her courtcraft has been sublime and her movement solid and sure. Last week at the Rothesay Open, she rolled through her first two matches before taking a narrow 7-6, 6-7, 7-5 loss to Karolina Pliskova in the quarterfinals.\n\nIn Berlin, she fought off big-hitting Linda Noskova in three sets to earn a rematch against World No.2 Coco Gauff on Friday. The American beat Jabeur at Roland Garros 4-6, 6-2, 6-3. But Jabeur got her the year before, right here in the Berlin semifinals. Gauff leads the overall head-to-head 5-2.\n\n\"I think she likes slower surfaces,\" Jabeur said. \"She likes to have her time. But a champion is always a champion. I'm sure she'll play unbelievable on grass.\n\n\"What I like more on grass is I can use my magic a little bit, the touch, the slices. I feel I can bother a little bit Coco with that.\"\n\nA win over World No.2 Gauff would be Jabeur's best win by ranking since besting Aryna Sabalenka in the Wimbledon semifinals a year ago. It would also put her into her first semifinal of the season.\n\nEither way, Jabeur says she's not going to read too much into anything as she prepares for another run at Wimbledon.\n\n\"Learning from experience, you can play very bad and then make the final at Wimbledon like what happened last year,\" Jabeur said. \"And I can play really good and win the tournament and still make the final as well (as in 2022).\n\n\"I think the most important thing is to keep really positive every match and to take any positive thing I did this week or last week. It's important for me that I enjoy playing on grass.\"", "source": {"uri": "wtatennis.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Women's Tennis Association"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ons_Jabeur", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ons Jabeur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WTA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hologic", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hologic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tunisia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Tunisia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTA_rankings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WTA rankings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Noskov\u00e1", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Linda Noskov\u00e1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryna_Sabalenka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aryna Sabalenka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karol\u00edna_Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karol\u00edna Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Clans_and_Guilds", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Clans and Guilds", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://photoresources.wtatennis.com/photo-resources/2024/06/20/15ad3ac9-b1d8-4e3a-bd41-4563becacc32/Jabeur-R2-Jimmie.jpg?width=1200&height=630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659938", "eventUri": "eng-9659938", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

When making that clear, Swiatek also underlined that the upcoming Paris Olympics won't have any impact on how she practices on grass.\n\n\"I want to be successful wherever I play, you know? We do not underestimate any tournament, especially a Grand Slam. But I realise that I haven't fully discovered my potential on grass yet. So I'll concentrate on work. Generally, the preparations will not be any different due to the Olympics,\" Swiatek told Przeglad Sportowy.\n\nDuring the clay swing, Swiatek played a lot of tennis and she concluded her clay season by winning three consecutive titles at the Madrid Open, Rome Open and the French Open. Now, Swiatek is set to play on the grass and then return to clay for the Paris Olympics - Wimbledon ends on July 14th while the Olympics start on July 26th.\n\nChanging surfaces in a quick time might be an issue for some star players but not for the 23-year-old Pole, who says going back to clay \"will not be a problem\" for her.\n\n\"We will start thinking about [the Olympics] only after Wimbledon, because in tennis it's not like you have to be in shape for literally two weeks,\" Swiatek said.\n\n\"We rather have to be in top form four or five times a year. Physically it is not always possible, but we will prepare as best we can and we will see. I think it would be a bigger challenge if there was grass first, clay in the middle, and grass again. Going back to the clay won't be a problem for me.\n\n\"When I come back to it after a whole year, two days are enough and I feel great on clay. This year I already played the Billie Jean King Cup on hard, I went straight to clay in Stuttgart and I was able to play a very good tournament, so going to clay a second time will not be a problem,\" Swiatek noted.\n\nRaducanu, 21, was struggling with several injuries for quite some time before surgically repairing both wrists and her left ankle last May. Since returning to tennis at the start of this year, the 2021 US Open champion has managed to stay healthy and avoid any serious physical issues.\n\nAnd when Raducanu's Paris Olympics decision was announced over the weekend, it didn't sit well with the majority of the British public. The 21-year-old then defended herself by explaining that going from grass to clay would be too risky for her considering her injury history.\n\n\"I just don't think there's any need to put additional stress on my body or any risk, especially with my history. It [clay] is more demanding on the body, for sure. It's more physical, longer points, but I think it's more just the change, the contrast between clay and grass and then on to the hard... For me, it is not necessary at this point to put my body through that,\" Raducanu said.\n\nMeanwhile, two-time Grand Slam champion Sabalenka simply admitted that also playing in Paris would too much for her and that the Olympics being staged on clay wasn't helping either.\n\n\"It's too much for the scheduling. I made the decision to take care of my health. It's too much of changing the surface,\" Sabalenka said on Monday.\n\nLater on Monday, three-time Grand Slam finalist Jabeur also withdrew from the Olympics, saying: \"Dear All, after consulting with my medical team regarding attending the Olympics in Paris, we have decided that the quick change of surface and the body's adaptation required would put my knee at risk and jeopardize the rest of my season. Unfortunately, I will not be able to participate in the 2024 Paris Olympics.\"\n\nAfter Raducanu, Sabalenka and Jabeur, it wouldn't be surprising if more players decided to skip the Paris Olympics in the upcoming period.\n\nBut one thing is for sure - the Paris Olympics will feature world No. 1 Swiatek unless something drastic happens.", "source": {"uri": "tennisworldusa.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis World USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dzevad_mesic@tennisworldusa.org", "name": "Dzevad Mesic", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ons_Jabeur", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ons Jabeur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTA_500_tournaments", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WTA 500 tournaments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Raducanu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emma Raducanu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryna_Sabalenka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aryna Sabalenka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Jean_King_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Billie Jean King Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuttgart", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stuttgart"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Stuttgart"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Modeling_Compounds", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Modeling Compounds", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/E-mail", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/E-mail", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.tennisworldusa.org/world/media/image150301.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659938", "eventUri": "eng-9659938", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-14", "textStart": 1643, "textEnd": 1652}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-26", "textStart": 1681, "textEnd": 1690}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

Many tennis players have done everything they can to participate: just think of Rafael Nadal, who will skip the Wimbledon Championships to focus on an Olympic medal. Novak Djokovic and Iga Swiatek will also certainly be in Paris in search of an Olympic gold medal.\n\nBut, despite who will be there, many have decided (or have been forced for one reason or another) not to participate.\n\nNick Kyrgios, for example, should return directly for the swing on the North American hard-courts. Belinda Bencic, after becoming a mother, will return only in the next few months, while Petra Kvitova is pregnant. Andrey Rublev has decided to skip Paris Olympics without revealing the reason for the decision. Venus Williams is also out.\n\nEmma Raducanu and Ons Jabeur, for example, have decided to avoid the switch on clay-courts, as the Paris Olympics is between the grass and hard-court seasons.\n\n\"I have to listen to my body and follow the advice of my medical team. Unfortunately I will not be able to participate in the Paris 2024 Olympics. I have always loved representing my country in any competition,\" said Jabeur.\n\n\"I just don't think there's any need to put any more stress on my body or take risks, especially with my history. I'm very determined and do things my way and on my own time, whenever I want. So not in my own way. diva, I'm just prioritizing my body and my health because I know if I'm fit, I know if I'm giving 100%, I know that great things are happening and coming,\" analyzed Raducanu.\n\nAryna Sabalenka is also out, for a similar reason: \"I prefer to rest a bit to make sure I am ready physically and health-wise for the hard court and I will prepare well before going to the hard court season and better for my body. Especially with all the difficulties I've faced in the last few months, I feel like I have to take care of my health.

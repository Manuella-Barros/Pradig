What we know", "body": "A Florida woman has been charged with first-degree murder and child abuse in the beating death of her adopted 4-year-old son, according to the Polk County Sheriff's office.\n\n\"We don't believe we know all that this child suffered,\" Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said during a press conference Wednesday. \"We have another video clip where he's face down on the floor and she's beating him on the back, and he's not even resisting it. It's like it's a normal occurrence.\"\n\nPatricia Boyer Saintizaire, 36, brought Bryan Boyer to the AdventHealth Heart of Florida hospital in Haines City on May 1 with abdominal bleeding, according to a PCSO release. He was flown to Orlando Health but died after emergency surgery couldn't save him, the PCSO said. The hospital notified the sheriff's office on May 2 that the child died under suspicious circumstances.\n\n\"What we have learned in this investigation just turned our stomachs,\" Judd said.\n\nWho is Patricia Saintizaire?\n\nPatricia Saintizaire's sister helped her adopt Brian from a woman in Haiti and brought him to the U.S. in April 2023 after a three-year process, Judd said. She had already adopted another son, now 16, from Haiti.\n\nSaintizaire is married and works at the ABC Liquors corporate office in Orlando, Judd said.\n\nWhat happened to the 4-year-old boy in Davenport?\n\nThe 16-year-old initially denied that the younger boy was abused. After he was placed in Department of Children and Families custody, he told detectives that Saintizaire told him, \"when they ask you something, say nothing so I don't get in trouble,\" and that she threatened to kill him by shooting him.\n\nThe teen described discipline against both boys with a belt and a \"homemade hitting device\" while they were living in Haiti, the PCSO said in a release. Brian arrived home from Loughman Oaks Elementary in a good mood, investigators said after reviewing school and bus cameras and interviewing people who had interacted with him.\n\nThe older boy said he was in a different room for about two hours when Saintizaire told him to bring his brother some food. He noticed that Brian was unable to sit up or walk on his own, but Saintizaire said he was \"faking it,\" the release said, and told him to feed the boy anyway.\n\nDuring dinner, the boy began to \"visibly shake,\" then vomited three times and was visibly lethargic, according to the affidavit.\n\nWhen Brian became unresponsive the teen began performing CPR and demanded that Saintizaire take him to the hospital. The younger boy began shaking violently again on the way to the car and fell, landing on his back according to the affidavit.\n\nWhen investigators reviewed videos on Saintizaire's phone they found two clips from home surveillance cameras showing Saintizaire \"actively hitting the child with an unknown object while the child is laying on a floor, unresponsive,\" the release said. Another clip showed her throwing the boy into a swimming pool while his hands were tied behind his back.\n\n\"We found an injury where his spleen suffered a significant tear. The medical examiner said it could have been nothing else other than an immediate hard strike to the abdomen,\" Judd said. \"And as the autopsy went on, they found different layers of bruises and injuries from past beatings.\"\n\nWhat injuries did the medical examiner find in the 4-year-old boy in Davenport?\n\nAccording to the PCSO, the autopsy revealed:\n\nThe boy's cause of death was ruled a homicide by assault/blunt force trauma. \"He's dead,\" Judd said. \"He's dead because she beat him to death.\"\n\nWhat does Patricia Saintizaire say about the death of her 4-year-old son?\n\nSaintizaire told deputies that the boy had complained he was weak and tired, having had \"flu-like\" symptoms for a week, according to a police affidavit. She denied ever using physical discipline as punishment, deputies said.\n\nWhat was Patricia Saintizaire charged with?\n\nSaintizaire was arrested and charged with first-degree murder, aggravated child abuse, and tampering with a witness, Judd said.\n\nWas Patricia Saintizaire's husband charged?\n\nSaintizaire's husband, Rene, told deputies that she disciplined the children but he did not, the release said.\n\n\"Her husband was clearly at work at the time this event occurred,\" Judd said. \"She was the disciplinarian.\"\n\nSaintizaire and her husband have obtained a lawyer to represent them, Judd said.\n\nThe investigation is still ongoing. This is at least the third instance this year in Polk County where a parent or caregiver has been charged with killing a child in their custody younger than 4.", "source": {"uri":

But the boy, who tragically died in suspicious circumstances at the beginning of May, suffered \"horrible\" abuse at the hands of the woman, Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said.\n\n\"We have a video clip where that 3-year-old baby's hands were tied behind his back, and she threw him in the swimming pool in the backyard,\" Judd said, adding: \"He's dead because she beat him to death.

The sheriff's office was notified by staff at Orlando Health Hospital on May 2 after a medical exam showed the boy had an abdominal bleed that could not be treated by emergency surgery.\n\nHis body was then taken to the District 9 Medical Examiner's Office for an autopsy, following which it was declared that Bryan died from assault/blunt force trauma. The manner of death was ruled as a homicide, as Judd said: \"What we have learned during this investigation just turns our stomachs.\"\n\nThe little child was found to have old and new scarring on his back as well as a deep laceration on his liver. He also suffered bruising and haemorrhaging to his arms and legs. The medical examiner's decision was that Bryan's injuries were consistent with ongoing abuse.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nPolk County Sheriff Grady Judd said the child suffered 'horrible' abuse at the hands of the woman\n\nInvestigators spoke to Saintizaire's oldest son who said his adoptive mother told him to \"say nothing so I don't get in trouble\" and threatened to kill him with a gun, Fox News reported. He told detectives that his brother was \"happy and behaving normally with no injuries\" when he came back from school before he died.\n\nHowever, the teen said he later noticed his brother was \"unable to walk on his own and struggled to sit up on his own\" when Saintizaire told him to take food to the child. However, he said his mother claimed the boy was \"faking it\" and told him to feed him before Bryan became unresponsive.\n\nThe teenager then began performing CPR on the child and insisted they needed to go to the hospital. The woman denied ever using physical discipline as punishment for either child, the sheriff's office said, but during a forensic review, detectives found two videos on her phone - one showing Saintizaire allegedly hitting the young boy with an unknown object while he was on the floor and another clip showing her allegedly throwing Bryan into a pool with his hands tied behind his back.\n\nThe woman has been charged with first-degree murder, aggravated child abuse, and tampering with a witness. The case is still under investigation.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nA Florida mother is behind bars facing multiple charges in the death of her 4-year-old son, whom she adopted from Haiti in April 2023, according to the Polk County Sheriff's Office.\n\nPatricia Saintizaire, 36, is charged with first-degree murder, aggravated child abuse and tampering with a witness in the death of Bryan Boyer, Sheriff Grady Judd said Wednesday.\n\n\"He's dead because she beat him to death,\" Judd said. \"It is beyond my wildest imagination how anyone could abuse a beautiful little fella like this child was abused and neglected.\"\n\nSaintizaire also has a 16-year-old son she adopted from Haiti, who is now in protective custody.\n\nNAKED FLORIDA WOMAN ARRESTED AFTER BREAKING INTO NEIGHBOR'S HOME, LEAVING HER OWN CHILDREN ALONE AT HOME\n\nThe sheriff's office said it was notified by staff at Orlando Health Hospital on Thursday, May 2, of a 4-year-old boy who died \"under what appeared to be suspicious circumstances\" after a medical exam showed an abdominal bleed that couldn't be fixed by emergency surgery.\n\nThe boy's body was taken to the District 9 Medical Examiner's Office for an autopsy, which was conducted the following day. The autopsy declared the child died from assault/blunt force trauma and ruled the manner of death as a homicide.\n\n\"What we have learned during this investigation just turns our stomachs,\" Judd said.\n\nThe autopsy showed the little boy had old and new scarring on his back that would have occurred during his past year with Saintizaire in the United States. He also had a deep laceration on his liver, which would have affected him immediately and \"caused a rapid decline\" in his health, the sheriff's office said.\n\nWhile he had no broken or fractured bones, the autopsy showed bruising and hemorrhaging to his arms and legs. The medical examiner's ultimate decision was that his injuries were consistent with ongoing abuse.\n\n\"We don't believe we know all that this child suffered,\" Judd said.\n\nWISCONSIN FATHER ARRESTED FOR CHILD ABUSE AFTER CLAIMING NEWBORN SON WAS HIT BY AN IPAD\n\nPolk County homicide detectives learned the boy was initially taken to Heart of Florida hospital in Davenport, where the family lived, but was flown to Orlando Health because of his injuries.\n\nSaintizaire took him to the hospital at the request of her teenage son, who was performing CPR on the child at home beforehand, according to the PCSO.\n\nWhen detectives initially spoke with the 16-year-old, he told them he was not abused and never witnessed abuse, but once he was placed in protective custody, he said his adoptive mother told him to \"say nothing so I don't get in trouble.\" He also said Saintizaire threatened to kill him with a gun, the sheriff's office shared.\n\nThe teenager also told detectives he and his brother were physically disciplined with a belt and a homemade hitting device when they lived in Haiti before telling them what happened on May 1, the day before the 4-year-old was reported dead.\n\nWhen the little boy got home from school that afternoon, he was \"happy and behaving normally with no injuries,\" the brother told detectives, which was confirmed in a review of bus and school cameras and by talking to those who interacted with him.\n\n\"Despite his abusive treatment, they said he was a happy child,\" Judd said.\n\nMULTIPLE STATES REPORT SPIKE IN CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT\n\nThe teenager said he went to another room in the house for about two hours and did not see or hear what happened to his little brother, but noted that he was \"unable to walk on his own and struggled to sit up on his own\" when Saintizaire told him to take food to the child.\n\nShe allegedly told the teenager that the boy was \"faking it\" and to just feed him shortly before he became unresponsive, which is when he began performing CPR and insisted they needed to go to the hospital.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSaintizaire's husband, who was \"clearly at work,\" according to Judd, told detectives he does not handle the discipline of the children. Saintizaire \"repeatedly denied\" ever using physical discipline as punishment for either child, the sheriff's office said.\n\nWhen reviewing her phone, detectives found two videos from home surveillance cameras showing Saintizaire allegedly hitting the 4-year-old with an unknown object while he was lying face down on the floor, Judd said. Another video showed her allegedly throwing the boy into a pool with his hands tied behind his back.\n\n\"Our number one goal in this organization is to protect the children,\" Judd said, \"and that's why we go after child predators, that's why we go after child pornographers, that's why we go after child abusers and we certainly go after child murderers.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com",

He's dead because she beat him to death.\"\n\nJudd said what detectives learned while investigating the case is 'stomach-turning.'\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, it is beyond my wildest imagination how anyone could abuse a beautiful little fellow like this,\" Judd stated.\n\nThe sheriff went on to say that he doesn't believe detectives know all the abuse the child suffered and referenced another video clip that was on the suspect's phone in which the child was face-down on the floor, and she's beating him in the back, and he's not even resisting it as though it is a normal occurrence.\n\n\"The positive, if you search for a positive in this, is that he's in the arms of God right now, and he's no longer being beaten. He's no longer being punched. He's no longer being tied up and thrown in the swimming pool. Now, he's, as our Christians believe, he's living the life there where he's surrounded by love and things are great like he should have been surrounded by love and things are great here on Earth for him.\"\n\nREAD: DeSantis denounces attempt to set up pro-Palestinian encampment at UF: 'We don't do that here'\n\nAccording to the Polk County Sheriff's Office, Saintizaire's 16-year-old son is now in

is still under investigation.\n\nJudd encourages anyone who suspects a child is being abused to call the authorities.", "source": {"uri": "fox13news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 13 Tampa

It's like it's a normal occurrence.\"\n\nOn May 2, Polk detectives began their investigation after receiving a call from Orlando Health of a young boy dying under suspicious circumstances. An autopsy performed by the District 9 Medical Examiner's Office found several layers of injuries during an autopsy of the unidentified 4-year-old boy indicating severe beatings or abuse, including a deep laceration to his liver. The cause of death was ruled homicide by assault/blunt force trauma.\n\n\"He's dead because she beat him to death,\" he said.\n\nThe boy was born in Haiti to a mother who did not want him, according to Judd. Saintizaire's sister helped arrange for his adoption, a three-year process. The boy had arrived in Saintizaire's custody approximately a year ago.\n\nOn May 1, the boy was picked up from the bus stop about 5:10 p.m. by Saintizaire. Upon interview with detectives, Saintizaire said the boy had complained he was weak and tired, having had \"flu-like\" symptoms for a week, according to a police affidavit.\n\nAbout 8 p.m., Saintizaire and her adopted 16-year-old son found the boy in his room and woke him up to eat dinner. During dinner, the boy began to \"visibly shake,\" then vomited three times and was visibly lethargic, according to the affidavit.\n\nAs the 16-year-old carried the boy to the car, he began to shake violently again and fell, landing on his back. Saintizaire brought the boy to AdventHealth Heart of Florida hospital in Haines City, where medical staff began life-saving care. The boy was air lifted to Orlando Health, where he died.\n\nUpon questioning, Saintizaire denied ever using physical discipline as punishment for the boy, according to a police affidavit. Her husband, Rene Saintizaire, said he never physically disciplined the child, but told detectives his wife did spank the boy and his main caretaker. However, the 16-year-old told detectives the boys would be physically disciplined receiving multiple strikes from a belt and homemade hitting device, according to a police affidavit. The strikes, noted as coming from \"unidentified persons,\" would be to the boy's back, arms and stomach. The 16-year-old boy said he received similar discipline from Saintizaire while in Haiti, but had not had this done to him in the United States.\n\nStaff at the 4-year-old's school, Loughman Oaks Elementary, said that the boy appeared in good condition and did not have any complaints of pain on May 1, according to a police affidavit.\n\nThe Sheriff's Office obtained a search warrant for the Saintizaire's Davenport home on May 3. Judd said detectives went through her cell phone to find a video of her hitting the boy with an unknown object, and another of her tying the boy's hands behind his back and throwing him into a pool.\n\nThese videos were released to the media by PCSO, but have not been shared by The Ledger in accordance with our crime reporting policies.\n\nNorth Lakeland shooting: Last suspect in gunbattle that killed 3-year-old boy arrested in Plant City\n\nSaintizaire and Rene have obtained a lawyer to represent them, Judd said.\n\nRene Saintizaire was at work from noon to 11 p.m. on the day the boy died and is not facing charges at this time. The investigation remains active.\n\n\"I can assure you of this, if you hear something, see something, or believe something, or think something about a child being neglected or abused, if you call us, I assure you we will completely and thoroughly investigate it with [Department of Children and Families],\" Judd said. \"Our No. 1 goal in this organization is to protect the children. \"\n\nThis is at least the third instance this year in Polk County where a parent or caregiver has been charged with killing a child in their custody younger than 4.\n\nSara-Megan Walsh can be reached at

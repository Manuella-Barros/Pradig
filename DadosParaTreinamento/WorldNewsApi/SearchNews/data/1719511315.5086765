Responding to a written parliamentary question, defence minister Andrew Murrison said there were \u201cno plans\u201d to introduce the controversial policy. The MP, who represents South West Wiltshire, added that it could damage morale if \u201cpotentially unwilling\u201d recruits were forced to serve alongside armed forces personnel. However on Saturday, the prime minister announced plans to make 18-year-olds take part in a form of \u201cmandatory\u201d national service, either on a 12-month placement in the military or by doing volunteer work. Follow The Independent\u2019s live blog for all the latest news on the general election The armed forces option would be selective \u2013 with some 30,000 placements for \u201cthe brightest and best\u201d, the Conservatives said. The prime minister added the programme would help unite society in an \u201cincreasingly uncertain world\u201d and give young people a \u201cshared sense of purpose\u201d. In a statement published on Thursday, after Mr Sunak had called a July 4 election, Mr Murrison had said: \u201cIf potentially unwilling national service recruits were to be obliged to serve alongside the professional men and women of our armed forces, it could damage morale, recruitment and retention and would consume professional military and naval resources. \u201cIf, on the other hand, national service recruits were kept in separate units, it would be difficult to find a proper and meaningful role for them, potentially harming motivation and discipline. \u201cFor all these reasons, there are no current plans for the restoration of any form of national service.\u201d The Conservatives said they would establish a royal commission bringing in expertise from across the military and civil society to establish the details of what they described as the \u201cbold\u201d national service programme. This would be with the aim of the first batch of participants taking part in the scheme in September 2025. Home secretary James Cleverly stressed that teenagers would not be sent to jail for defying the Tories\u2019 proposed \u201cmandatory\u201d scheme. A Labour spokesperson said: \u201cThis is not a plan \u2013 it\u2019s a review which could cost billions and is only needed because the Tories hollowed out the armed forces to their smallest size since Napoleon. \u201cBritain has had enough of the Conservatives, who are bankrupt of ideas, and have no plans to end 14 years of chaos. It\u2019s time to turn the page and rebuild Britain with Labour.\u201d", "summary": "<p>Defence minister Andrew Murrison said national service could \u2018damage morale\u2019 if introduced  </p>", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/politics/rishi-sunak-tory-national-service-general-election-b2551808.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2022/07/06/09/PA-49618009.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 16:36:16", "author": "Holly Evans", "authors": ["Holly Evans"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.152}

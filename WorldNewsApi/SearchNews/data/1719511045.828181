Tangent Kennedy spoke at the convention Friday and his running mate, Nicole Shanahan, is expected to speak Sunday. Kennedy in his speech accused Trump of presiding \"over the greatest restriction on individual liberties this country has ever known\" in his response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and spoke for the freedom of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who he said \"should be celebrated as a hero.\" Key Background Libertarians base their core beliefs in the rights of the individual, limited government, free markets and, overall, a balanced society that functions with limited oversight and a collective interest in the common good. Many Libertarians believe the Trump administration wielded too much government power, particularly early in the COVID-19 pandemic, when the government recommended certain businesses shut their doors to the public while urging Americans to stay home, socially distance and wear face masks. The Libertarian Party earned 3.3% of the vote in the 2016 presidential election, when former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson was its nominee, and 1.2% in 2020, when its nominee was activist Jo Jorgensen. The Libertarian vote has always been small but Republicans have a vested interest in winning it\u2014if Libertarians in Arizona had voted for Trump over Jorgensen, for instance, he would have won the state in 2020. Arizona is another crucial battleground state in the 2024 election, as are Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Nevada and Wisconsin.

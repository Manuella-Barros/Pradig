{"id": 232059296, "title": "Three-in-a row supreme championships for Suffolk breeder, Mark Priestly, at Armagh Show", "text": "He started off this year\u2019s showing season with an emphatic Balmoral inter breed championship victory, showing a truly elite shearling ewe. And then, just for good measure, he secured the inter-breed sheep championship at Saturday\u2019s Armagh Show with another shearling ewe. The commitment of the Downpatrick man to breed Suffolk sheep of the highest quality is immense. This was his third Armagh inter-breed sheep victory on the spin. Alison Crabbe, from Raphoe in Co Donegal, judged the final sheep class of the day at Armagh Show 2024. She farms a mix of Beltex and Badger sheep in tandem with Hereford cattle. The judge described her champion as a tremendous example of the Suffolk breed, adding: \u201cShe has tremendous length and balance. It\u2019s almost as if she had an extra rib. The shearling has tremendous breeding potential for the future.\u201d The winning ewe will be put to the ram in September, in preparation for lambing next January. Meanwhile, Armagh Show 2024 boasted, possibly, the largest beet cattle entry of all time. Judging of the various classes went on well into the afternoon. The inter-breed beef championship was awarded to Kilkeel Limousin breeder, Trevor Shields with a tremendous 22 month-old heifer: Glenmarshal Theduchess. She looked an absolute picture in the ring. John Kingham, from Tateetra Farms in Co Louth, judged the beef inter-breed class. He described his champion as an elite heifer. \u201cShe just stood out that little bit on the day,\u201d he said. \u201cFor me she had everything that a elite beef breeding heifer should have: tremendous presence, scope and an all-round quality that only top animals possess. Kingham added: \u201cI was very impressed with the overall quality of the cattle taking part in the classes that were herd throughout the day. Tateetra Farm is home to the largest herd of sucklers in Ireland. John Kingham again: \u201cWe will be calving in excess of 500 cows this year. The winning beef inter-breed connections were the inaugural recipients of the Charlotte Crowe Perpetual Cup, named after a former patron of Armagh Show, who passed away during December 2023. The dairy inter-breed championship at Armagh Show 2024 was won by George and Jason Booth, from Stewartstown in Co Tyrone, with their impressive Holstein third calver: Brookroad Satrin 185. The reserve went to the Fleming family, from Seaforde in Co Down with their Jersey third calver: Potterswalls Impression Lady 6 The Holstein judge - Andrea Rafferty, from Co Monaghan - described her champion as a tremendous dairy cow, adding: \u201cShe is very silky, very dairy and has tremendous feet and legs. \u201cHer mammary system is excellent. The cow also has tremendous balance. \u201cBoth the winning cow and the reserve could win a lot of classes around the country.\u201d Sathrin is currently giving 55l of milk per day. \u201cShe calved for the third time back in February,\u201d Jason Booth explained. \u201cShe was second in the four-year-old class at this year\u2019s Balmoral Show. Hopefully she is back in calf to the Candain bull: Logic PP. \u201cWe used a sexed straw, so hopefully we can look forward to the arrival of a heifer calf in a few months\u2019 time.\u201d The Jersey inter-breed reserve is also performing extremely well at the present time. According to Lindsay Fleming, she is giving 33L of milk at the present at 5.6% butterfat and 3.89% protein.", "summary": "The summer of 2024 just keeps on improving for Co Down Suffolk sheep breeder, Mark Priestly.", "url": "https://www.newsletter.co.uk/country-and-farming/three-in-a-row-supreme-championships-for-suffolk-breeder-mark-priestly-at-armagh-show-4658791", "image": "https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimg/b25lY21zOjllMWIzNzg3LWNkNjMtNGM2ZS05NWQwLTFmZGM2NGJjN2Q0ZTo5NDk4MWI0Yi1kNDM1LTQ1NTgtOTJlNi1jMTljMGZjNjhjOWM=.jpg?width=1200&enable=upscale", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 15:52:34", "author": "Richard Halleron", "authors": ["Richard Halleron"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.356}

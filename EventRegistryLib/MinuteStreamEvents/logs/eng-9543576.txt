Against Nashville, Vancouver struggled to produce much offense, which could a major problem against the high-powered Oilers.\n\nEdmonton had a phenomenal series against LA, and McDavid will likely not be stopped as the Oilers continue their playoff rout.\n\nDallas edged out the Vegas Golden Knights in seven games, while Colorado routed Winnipeg in five games.\n\nThe Avalanche will be well-rested against Dallas, but the Stars match up well with Colorado.

A new winner is also guaranteed after defending champion Vegas was eliminated by Western Conference top-seeded Dallas in the tightest opening-round series.\n\nFlorida, which reached the final last year, and Edmonton, led by three-time and reigning MVP Connor McDavid and German star Leon Draisaitl, are the co-favorites on BetMGM Sportsbook to hoist the Cup, followed by Carolina, Dallas and the New York Rangers.\n\nAfter the team favored to win each first round series did, this remains one of the most wide open postseasons in recent hockey history. Everyone left standing has a chance to win it all, with plenty of new blood: Colorado (2022) is the only one with a title over the past 12 seasons.\n\nTHE MATCHUPS\n\nIn the East: the New York Rangers vs. the Carolina Hurricanes and the Florida Panthers vs. the Boston Bruins. New York swept Washington; Carolina beat the Islanders in five; Florida beat Tampa Bay in five and Boston nearly blew a 3-1 lead before eliminating Toronto in seven.\n\nIn the West: the Dallas Stars vs. the Colorado Avalanche and the Vancouver Canucks vs. the Edmonton Oilers. Dallas beat Vegas in seven; Colorado rebounded from a crazy Game 1 to beat Winnipeg in five; Vancouver beat Nashville in six and Edmonton beat Los Angeles in five, the third consecutive season the Kings have been knocked out in the first round by the Oilers.\n\nHOW TO WATCH\n\nEvery game of the Stanley Cup playoffs is televised nationally in the U.S. and Canada and available on streaming platforms. Games are carried in the U.S. on an ABC, ESPN, TNT or TBS and in Canada on CBC or Sportsnet in English and TVA Sports in French.\n\nWHO TO WATCH\n\nMcDavid, widely considered the best hockey player in the world, leads all players with 12 points through the first round, followed closely by Draisaitl with 10, including two game-winning goals. McDavid is coming off becoming just the fifth player in NHL history to record 100 assists in a season.\n\nRangers center Vincent Trocheck has arguably been one of the most dominant players early, and he and his teammates look like legitimate Cup contenders thanks in large part to goaltender Igor Shesterkin, who stopped 94 of the 101 shots he faced against the Capitals. Colorado's Nathan MacKinnon, the front-runner to succeed McDavid as the Hart Trophy winner, has also found peak playoff form already with nine points through five games.\n\nWhile McDavid, Draisaitl and MacKinnon are in their primes, there are plenty of old guys to root for who haven't yet won the Cup, from Dallas' Joe Pavelski to Carolina's Brent Burns and Colorado's Zach Parise.\n\nWHO ARE THE FAVORITES?\n\nThe betting favorites (in order) to win the Stanley Cup are Florida and Edmonton at 9-2, and Carolina, Dallas and New York at 11-2, according to BetMGM Sportsbook.\n\nWHEN IS THE STANLEY CUP FINAL?\n\nAfter the playoffs began April 20 and the second round started Sunday, the final is set to start in early June. If it goes the distance, Game 7 could go as late as June 24.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nScoring creativity hasn't stopped now that the playoffs are here, with a handful of goals being scored off the masks of goaltenders. It's an art form shooters are continuing to refine to put the puck in the net at the most difficult time of year to do so.\n\nWhile Alex Ovechkin was held without a point in a series for the first time in his nearly two-decade career in North America, many fellow Russians are starring this postseason, from the Rangers' Shesterkin and Artemi Panarin to Carolina's Andrei Svechnikov and Colorado's Valeri Nichushkin.\n\nThe Hurricanes have won a round for a sixth consecutive season under coach Rod Brind'Amour, their 2006 Cup-winning captain who has created a winning culture.

Round 1 was kind of a dud, but there are some tantalizing matchups ahead with a couple juggernauts facing off early.\n\nFor funsies, let's take a look back at our staff's predictions for Round 1 and see who's been the most accurate. We're using Jason M's system for scoring, which is five points for guessing the correct team, and minus one for each game off the mark. For example, Joe D guessed Florida in six, so he gets four points because the team was correct but he missed the number of games (they did it in five). Let us know how your predictions went in the comments!\n\nJoe D: This is going to be a heavyweight bout: the President's Trophy winning Rangers versus a stacked and rolling Carolina team-a second round matchup we were robbed of last year because the New Jersey Devils somehow came to life. Both the Canes and Rangers finished their series in five games or fewer, and will enter this matchup well rested; both teams have elite talent at all positions, but the Rangers have the leg up in net-Igor Shesterkin is a better goalie than either Freddie Andersen or Pyotr Kochetkov. There's a fair bit of drama surrounding Carolina now, with Rod Brind'Amour's next coaching contract starting to take center stage, and the team's never made it past the Conference Final under him-they've gotta get it done this year, which means insulating their goaltenders and solving Shesterkin. I think they do it, but it takes seven games for Carolina to get there.\n\nJason M: If Rempe gets more goals than he does penalties Carolina is in trouble. But otherwise I don't see the Rangers gettingC this to seven games and will be doing well to get it to six. Despite the advantage the Rangers might have in goal I doubt very much it will be enough to steal two or three games outright. Carolina in six.\n\nJacob: I feel dirty doing this after the Rangers took game one, but I just trust Shesterkin and the Rangers' rugged style over the Canes' pure firepower. If I'm personally looking at who has the biggest liability between these two pretty elite teams, I zero in on Freddie Andersen in the Carolina net as a weak point. He could have a good, even great series, but the Rangers are no slouches offensively either, and I think they'll continue to break through, it'll be a battle, but I think the Rangers are more built for this. Rags in seven.\n\nCole: Igor Shesterkin versus Freddie Anderson feels like the matchup of the series, and New York just has such an advantage in that matchup that I think it is the ultimate difference. Carolina is the better team in pretty much every other way, but I can't help but think Igor goes wild and New York's high-end talent does just enough to squeak wins out. Going to go Rangers in six.\n\nJoe D: It took the Bruins seven games to beat this Leafs team? Yeah, they're not winning this one. The Panthers may be down Sam Bennett (at least to start the series), but they're deep enough all over the roster to manage. However, Jeremy Swayman and Linus Ullmark are each good enough to steal games, and I think they'll get one win a piece-Florida in six.\n\nJason M: This should not be much of a series but the Bruins could put up a bit of a fight. Still, the fact they don't quite like world-beaters makes this one almost a gimme for the Panthers. Panthers in five.\n\nJacob: The Bruins are the most uninspiring they've been since Brad Boyes was a Calder candidate. I don't even think they want to play Florida, their Stanley Cup came when they beat the Leafs again. The Panthers, to me, have a pretty easy path to the ECF so long as they don't trip up majorly, maybe Jeremy Swayman can steal one, but with Bob down in the other net looking solid once again, it might even out anyways. Panthers in four.\n\nCole: I made the mistake of doubting the Panthers in the first round against Tampa, and I'm not going to make that mistake again. I thought Vasilevsky was going to goalie the Panthers, and the high-flying Florida offense quickly proved me wrong. Jeremy Swayman and Linus Ullmark are certainly up for that task for the Bruins, but I don't see how the Bruins can skate with the Panthers, especially down the middle. Barkov and Lundell versus Zacha and Coyle feels like such a mismatch, and having said all that, Panthers win this in six.\n\nJoe D: God, I wish these games were on earlier. Dallas started their series against Vegas slow, but were more or less clinical by game seven; the Avs had a rough game one against the Jets and then pinned five goals or more per game against the best goalie in the league. The Stars are not a fraudulent Jets team, though, so this series could go the distance-and since Dallas is my Cup pick, I say the Stars get it done in another seven games.\n\nJason M: The Stanley Cup final in the second round? Well some might argue Dallas was already in two this playoff year. Regardless, this should be the class of the second round with Nathan MacKinnon and company trying to get through Dallas and their near flawless well-rounded team. This should go seven games easily barring a slew of injuries on either side but I think Dallas gets the nod. Stars in seven.\n\nJacob: Zero idea which way this one will swing, two absolute titans here, both capable of going on cup runs, both with high powered offenses, even if they do it a little differently. Dallas can't match the starpower (pun intended) of the likes of Makar and MacKinnon, but they counter that with wave after wave of rock solid forward trios and D pairings. Against Vegas, Dallas really grew into their own as the series went on, and with some shaky goaltending in the between the pipes in Colorado, it might prove to be too much. I expect the Avs to maybe take game one, but the Stars to get it done in six.\n\nCole: On paper, we have perhaps the two best teams in the entire league, and we are getting it in the second round. I wonder, if after a slugfest with Vegas, there's a slight bit of fatigue for the Stars in the early goings of the series. Against a fresh Avalanche team, I'm not sure if the Stars can afford a slow start in this series, or to not have their legs in any part of it. It's all about the little things, since the rosters are so even, as the Stars top to bottom depth matches the raw power of MacKinnon, Rantanen, and Makar. The goaltending mismatch could prove to be a difference, but I have a feeling the Avs win in six.\n\nThomas: Both teams are just fine. It can go either way. Avalanche have Nathan MacKinnon, though. Colorado in seven.\n\nEdmonton Oilers vs. Vancouver Canucks\n\nJoe D: This should be a cakewalk for Edmonton. If you watched any of the Predators/Canucks series, you'll have noticed that Vancouver was not playing all that well and is using their third string goalie Artur Silovs while Thatcher Demko is injured and Casey DeSmith is...Casey DeSmith. The Oilers, meanwhile, have been resting after a thorough stomping of the LA Kings. If the Canucks fail to find their game, they're going to get shellacked-but Jack Adams finalist Rick Tocchet may still have a trick or two up his sleeve (including an early return for Demko, if they're lucky). The Canucks probably squeeze out a game or two, but ultimately fall to the offensive onslaught of McDraisaitl and friends. Oilers in six.\n\nJason M: Hockey Night In Canada's dream and nightmare all rolled into one: two Canadian teams good, one Canadian team leaf in the West afterwards bad. If the Canucks make this a series or somehow are able to take advantage of home ice in the first two games then they've got a puncher's chance. But a split isn't going to be enough. Also it looked like Corey Perry was injured in the final game against the Kings which might make the Oilers a little less pestering. Canucks in seven.\n\nJacob: We stand on guard for thee...\n\nNobody should have to lose this one, in my opinion. But if I had to choose, it feels like the Oilers have so much more to offer in this series. McDavid and Draisatl are clicking as usual, while Elias Pettersson had a horrible time of it against Nashville in round one. The Canucks in general struggled to score against the Predators, something they will have to do in bunches if they want to keep pace with the high-powered Oilers. Add in the fact that Edmonton now possesses the more proven goalie after the injury to Thatcher Demko, and this really shouldn't be that close. The Canucks are good, the Oilers may just be great. Edmonton in five.\n\nCole: The Canucks have that weird magic that I'm done betting against. They got outworked and outchanced in most of that Nashville series, and somehow got through on the back of their third string goalie, Artur Silovs. Sure, McDavid and Draisaitl are a step up from Nashville, but I like the odds that Petterson gets it going in Round 2. The Oilers might be better in almost every way, but the Canucks seem to have the hockey gods on their side right now. Their luck lasts one more time, and the Canucks win this in seven.\n\nThomas: I think I hate the Oilers more than any team in existence. Canucks in four.", "source": {"uri": "broadstreethockey.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Broad Street Hockey"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Shesterkin",

We grant them anonymity in exchange for candor. Predicting a playoff sweep is generally not for the faint of heart, but in our first-round preview, our executive correctly suggested the New York Rangers would take a broom to the Washington Capitals and win in four.\n\nThe Rangers' Metropolitan Division rivals, the Carolina Hurricanes, also made short work of their first-round opponent, the New York Islanders, setting up an intriguing second-round meeting between two teams that were separated by only three points in the standings.\n\nBecause both teams won their first series so easily, the NHL took the unusual step of starting Round 2 Sunday afternoon before the final game of the opening round between the Dallas Stars and Vegas Golden Knights was completed hours later. Our panel made their selections for the Rangers-Carolina series before Game 1 was played, a 4-3 win for New York.\n\nA general rule of thumb in the NHL is that the first round of the playoffs is usually the best round. That hopefully won't be the case this year. The Stars-Golden Knights series went the distance and was a barnburner on every level. Though not as aesthetically pleasing, the Boston Bruins-Toronto Maple Leafs series had many fascinating twists and turns before the Bruins emerged with a dramatic Game 7 overtime win to advance.\n\nBut overall, the opening round wasn't nearly as satisfying as in past years. Now that a couple of the overmatched pretenders are gone, let's hope Round 2 shapes up nicely with four compelling and distinctive matchups set to unfold.\n\nLet's examine.\n\nIt's a classic pick 'em series; little sets the two teams apart. Both starting goalies, New York's Igor Shesterkin and Carolina's Frederik Andersen, faced challenging times this season -- Shesterkin got off to a flat start, Andersen dealt with a blood clot issue. But when it mattered both were excellent. Special teams were close, too. The Rangers get a lot of kudos for their play with the man advantage because they were No. 3 in the regular season with a 26.4 percent success rate. Statistically, Carolina was slightly better, No. 2 at 26.9 percent. As for penalty killing, Carolina ranked first (86.4 percent) and the Rangers third (84.5 percent). Whoever wins the special teams battle will almost certainly win the series.\n\nAll three of our experts picked the Rangers in seven, but none could identify a substantive edge one way or the other -- other than the fact somebody has to win, and somebody has to lose.\n\n\"That's exactly where I'm at,\" said our scout. \"They're two really good teams. They both had an easy first round, so there are no advantages there. The Rangers, I think they're a little better built for the playoffs than Carolina and I like their back end better. They're big and hard to play against. It's a well-rounded defense, with a little bit of everything. And Carolina's a bit banged up on the back end (missing Brett Pesce).\"\n\nOur coach thought: \"You can flip a coin. The goaltending is where it could sway. The other thing would be special teams. Both those teams had really good special teams, on both sides. Which one is going to continue for both? Or is one going to get exposed? If so, that would be the difference. There's something about the Rangers, when we played them, just the way they play, their depth, I just think there's a little more skill there.\"\n\nAs for our executive, he noted, before Mika Zibanejad had a big night in the opener, that while \"most of the focus on the Rangers offense will be based around what Artemi Panarin does, I don't agree. I think the key is whether Zibanejad and Chris Kreider continue to be big playoff producers. In 31 games over the last two playoff years, plus this year's first round, Zibanejad is a point-a-game player, while Kreider's managed 28.\n\n\"If they score at that same pace in this series, and Panarin lives up to his big-time billing, the Rangers will have more than enough offense.\"\n\nExecutive: Rangers in 7\n\nScout: Rangers in 7\n\nCoach: Rangers in 7\n\nConsensus: Rangers advance\n\nA rematch of last year's riveting opening round when the Panthers, a heavy underdog, upset the Bruins, who'd been coming off a record-setting regular season. A year ago, the regular-season gap between the two teams was a staggering 43 points. This year, the Panthers are the favorites.\n\nFlorida, last year's Stanley Cup finalist, looked like a hungry team in a hard-fought opening-round victory over the Tampa Bay Lightning and, like last year, found ways to win close games. That's the mark of a potential champion.\n\nWhile Florida's been sitting at home resting, Boston-Toronto went down to the wire, with the Bruins forced to expend oodles of physical and emotional energy before it was finally settled.\n\nIs there a potential for a post-Toronto letdown?\n\n\"If they hadn't played them last year, I might agree there could be,\" answered our coach. \"But I think, right now, any letdown is going to be short-lived, and the immediate thought process is, 'last year, we didn't get it done -- and it's only seven games, so you can't give any of them away.' The leadership in Boston is top notch and starting on the road will help them focus. They're going into a hostile environment against a good team and they know what Florida's capable of. Their attention is going to be where it needs to be.\"\n\nOur scout was more forceful in his assessment, noting bluntly that Florida is better than they were a year ago. But Boston isn't as good, so why would the result be any different? \"I'm tempted to say Florida in four, but I think (Jeremy) Swayman could win a game or two for Boston, just by himself. So, I'm saying Florida in five.\n\nOur executive made it unanimous for the Panthers, even though he thought the Bruins defense could match up easily with Florida's. And in goal, Swayman was, without question, the MVP of the Toronto series. \"I give the advantage to Florida offensively, a slight advantage to Boston on the blue line, and the goaltending is a tossup. I feel the biggest advantage is that Florida is starting the series healthy and rested, while the Bruins will really have to dig deep to find a way to win this series given the schedule the way it is and that they have to start on the road.\"\n\nExecutive: Panthers in 6\n\nScout: Panthers in 5\n\nCoach: Panthers in 7\n\nConsensus: Panthers advance\n\nOur executive nicely summarized the challenge of predicting playoff results given the way Vancouver eliminated Nashville in six games to advance to the second round.\n\nOriginally, everyone focused on the goaltending matchup, which began as the Canucks' Thatcher Demko vs. the Predators' Juuse Saros. Made perfect sense. Then, when Demko was injured, it became Casey DeSmith vs. Saros. When DeSmith was briefly unavailable, the Canucks then turned to a goaltender who'd made nine previous NHL starts, none in the playoffs. He later recorded his first career shutout in the elimination game.\n\nJust as everyone imagined.\n\n\"When you look at Vancouver,\" our executive said, \"nobody would have predicted that they would beat a tough Nashville team despite having only six players score a goal, by scoring only 13 goals overall in the series, by having to play three goalies, and that the organization's third goalie, Arturs Silovs, would end up being the MVP of the series.\"\n\nStill, that was then.\n\nNow comes Edmonton; only the third time in history the two Western Canadian rivals have met in the playoffs.\n\nEdmonton advanced relatively easily compared to Vancouver, eliminating Los Angeles in five games primarily because of exceptional special teams play. The Oilers scored nine times with the man advantage, while the Kings couldn't score any. So that'll be the challenge for Vancouver -- to stay out of the penalty box as much as possible, and when they inevitably do take penalties, to kill them off.\n\n\"I think Edmonton's going to take them pretty quick,\" said our scout. \"Same reason I picked them in the first round. That power play is clicking, and McDavid is on a mission. Their top guys are hungry, and they can see a path forward there. And then I think Vancouver got a little lucky to beat Nashville, to be honest. That game where they came back -- I had that one in the bank for Nashville. Overall, I wasn't overly impressed with Vancouver. I just think Edmonton is on a roll, and that power play is so deadly.\"\n\nThe Canucks won all four regular-season games against the Oilers, which should give them some confidence -- though Edmonton was a different team after the coaching change from Jay Woodcroft to Kris Knoblauch. Vancouver had quality first-round performances from their two ex-Flames, Elias Lindholm and Nikita Zadorov, both of whom will bring a Battle of Alberta chip on their shoulders to this series.\n\nRedemption, according to our executive, will be on the minds of some of Vancouver's first-round underperformers -- especially Elias Pettersson, who should have more room to operate against the Oilers than against Nashville's smothering defensive coverage.\n\nOur coach went out on a limb and picked Vancouver.\n\n\"I think Vancouver's going to give them a run, and I'll tell you why. I'm still not sure about (Oilers goalie Stuart) Skinner and I'm not sure about their defense. Yes, their power play is great, but in the faceoff circle, the Canucks have a right-handed shot in Lindholm who is good on the draws. I think that can make a big difference. I think that's where they can get them -- in the faceoff circle, because if the Canucks start with the puck all the time, then Connor and the rest of them have to work to get it back. And Lindholm is starting to play. Connor had 12 points, nine on the power play. If you don't shut that power play down, you can't beat them. But I like the size of Vancouver's defense -- and they can go toe-to-toe with Edmonton, one to four lines. I'm going with Vancouver. I think they have a chance.\"\n\nExecutive: Oilers in 6\n\nScout: Oilers in 5\n\nCoach: Canucks in 7\n\nConsensus: Oilers advance\n\nGoaltending provided the biggest surprises in the Avalanche's opening-round win over the Jets -- both Colorado's and Winnipeg's. The Avalanche's Alexandar Georgiev was thought to be the weak link on an otherwise powerful team, and he looked exactly that in the opener, a 7-6 Colorado loss. But from there, Georgiev settled down and gave them solid play the rest of the way. Meanwhile, Connor Hellebuyck, a Vezina Trophy finalist and likely winner, gave up 24 goals in five games under Colorado's offensive onslaught, which translated into a garish 5.23 goals-against average and .870 save percentage. Not the outcome you would have imagined.\n\nColorado's stars came to play. Cale Makar, Nathan MacKinnon and Mikko Rantanen each had nine points in the five games while Valeri Nichushkin had seven goals and Artturi Lehkonen managed five. So finding a way to shut down that potent Colorado offense will be the No. 1 challenge for the Stars and Jake Oettinger, who was exceptional in the seven-game first-round series win over the defending Stanley Cup champions.\n\nOur scout doesn't think it'll happen. He cast his vote for the Avs.\n\n\"I'm picking Colorado,\" he said. \"I didn't pick them to beat Winnipeg, but watching them in the first round, similar to Edmonton, that power play and their high-end skill looks just so deadly. They're so good at home. I think the rest really helps Colorado because they rely so much on the three guys who play a lot -- MacKinnon, Makar and Rantanen -- who are going to have five, six days off before they start.\"\n\nBut our coach and executive think differently and like the Stars.\n\nFrom our executive: \"The fact that Colorado has had seven days off after easily beating Winnipeg will help them in this series, especially early in the series. Dallas, on the other hand, has to go straight into Round 2 on Tuesday night and then play every other night throughout the series. Still, Dallas does not have to travel for the first two games which will make it easier to recover from the hard fought series with Vegas.\"\n\nAnd our coach added this postscript: \"The motivation for Dallas is Joe Pavelski. They know this is it for him. The kid that stays at his place (Wyatt Johnson) is playing his ass off. Like the rest of them, they're motivated to push that team as far as they can because of Pav.\"", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The only remaining goalie with a better high-danger save percentage than Swayman (.872) is Thatcher Demko (1.000), who hasn't played for the Vancouver Canucks since Game 1 of the first round because of an injury. Swayman is also tied with Jake Oettinger of the Dallas Stars for the most games with greater than a .900 save percentage (six) this postseason.\n\nCarolina Hurricanes: Forward Martin Necas reached the fastest max skating speed (23.84 miles per hour in second period of Game 1 against New York Rangers) of the playoffs so far and also has the second-most 20-plus mph speed bursts (33 in first six games) behind Colorado Avalanche forward Nathan MacKinnon (45 in first five games).\n\nColorado Avalanche: As a team, the Avalanche lead the NHL in high-danger goals (13 in first five games), as well as total goals (scored 28 against Winnipeg Jets in first round), this postseason. Three Colorado players rank among the League's top 10 in high-danger goals this playoffs: Artturi Lehkonen (three; tied for third), Valeri Nichushkin and Zach Parise (two each; tied for sixth). Nichushkin is tied with Zach Hyman of the Edmonton Oilers for the most overall goals (seven) in the NHL this postseason. The Avalanche also lead the NHL in playoff goals by defensemen (five) so far in the playoffs (Cale Makar: two; Josh Manson: two; Devon Toews: one).\n\nDallas Stars: Forward Wyatt Johnston leads the NHL in playoff shots on goal (27 through his first seven games) and ranks third in high-danger shots on goal (12) behind Hyman (16) and Sam Reinhart (15) of the Florida Panthers. Johnston also ranks third among NHL forwards in total miles skated (22.81) behind Jack Eichel (25.09) of the Vegas Golden Knights and Mitch Marner (23.62) of the Toronto Maple Leafs, whose teams have been eliminated.\n\nEdmonton Oilers: Defenseman Evan Bouchard has by far the most 90-plus mph shots (13 in his first five games) this postseason; the next highest totals are Roman Josi of the Nashville Predators and Victor Hedman of the Tampa Bay Lightning (four each), whose teams have been eliminated. Bouchard also leads the NHL in long-range shots on goal (10) so far in the playoffs.\n\nFlorida Panthers: Forward Carter Verhaeghe is tied with Johnston for the most mid-range shots on goal (10 each) in the NHL this postseason but has reached that total in two fewer games than the Stars forward.

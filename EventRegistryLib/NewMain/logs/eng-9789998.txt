OpenAI hasn't released it.", "body": "OpenAI has a method to reliably detect when someone uses ChatGPT to write an essay or research paper. The company hasn't released it despite widespread concerns about students using artificial intelligence to cheat.\n\nThe project has been mired in internal debate at OpenAI for roughly two years and has been ready to be released for about a year, according to people familiar with the matter and internal documents viewed by The Wall Street Journal. \"It's just a matter of pressing a button,\" one of the people said.\n\nIn trying to decide what to do, OpenAI employees have wavered between the startup's stated commitment to transparency and their desire to attract and retain users. One survey the company conducted of loyal ChatGPT users found nearly a third would be turned off by the anticheating technology.\n\nAn OpenAI spokeswoman said the company is concerned the tool could disproportionately affect groups such as non-native English speakers. \"The text watermarking method we're developing is technically promising but has important risks we're weighing while we research alternatives,\" she said. \"We believe the deliberate approach we've taken is necessary given the complexities involved and its likely impact on the broader ecosystem beyond OpenAI.\"\n\nEmployees who support the tool's release, including those who helped develop it, have said internally those arguments pale compared with the good such technology could do.\n\nGenerative AI can create an entire essay or research paper in a matter of seconds, based on a single prompt, free. Teachers and professors say they are desperate for help to crack down on its misuse.\n\n\"It's a huge issue,\" said Alexa Gutterman, a high school English and journalism teacher in New York City. \"It's something that every teacher I work with has talked about.\"\n\nA recent survey by the Center for Democracy & Technology, a technology policy nonprofit, found 59% of middle- and high-school teachers were sure some students had used AI to help with schoolwork, up 17 points from the prior school year.\n\nOpenAI Chief Executive Sam Altman and Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati have been involved in discussions about the anticheating tool. Altman has encouraged the project but hasn't pushed for it to be released, some people familiar with the matter said.\n\nWall Street Journal owner News Corp has a content-licensing partnership with OpenAI.\n\nChatGPT is powered by an AI system that predicts what word or word fragment, known as a token, should come next in a sentence. The anticheating tool under discussion at OpenAI would slightly change how the tokens are selected. Those changes would leave a pattern called a watermark.\n\nThe watermarks would be unnoticeable to the human eye but could be found with OpenAI's detection technology. The detector provides a score of how likely the entire document or a portion of it was written by ChatGPT.\n\nThe watermarks are 99.9% effective when enough new text is created by ChatGPT, according to the internal documents.\n\n\"It is more likely that the sun evaporates tomorrow than this term paper wasn't watermarked,\" said John Thickstun, a Stanford researcher who is part of a team that has developed a similar watermarking method for AI text.\n\nStill, staffers have raised concerns the watermarks could be erased through simple techniques like having Google translate the text into another language and then back, or having ChatGPT add emojis to the text and then manually deleting them, an OpenAI employee familiar with the matter said.\n\nThere is broad agreement within the company that determining who can use this detector would be a challenge. If too few people have it, the tool wouldn't be useful. If too many get access, bad actors might decipher the company's watermarking technique.\n\nOpenAI employees have discussed providing the detector directly to educators or to outside companies that help schools identify AI-written papers and plagiarized work.\n\nGoogle has developed a watermarking tool that can detect text generated by its Gemini AI. Called SynthID, it is in beta testing and isn't widely available.\n\nOpenAI has a tool to determine whether an image was created using its text-to-image generator, DALL-E 3, that was released for testing this past spring. The company has given priority to audio and visual watermarking over text because the harms are more significant, particularly in a busy election year in the U.S., the employee familiar with the matter said.\n\nIn January 2023, OpenAI released an algorithm intended to detect text written by several AI models, including its own. But it succeeded just 26% of the time, and OpenAI pulled it seven months later.\n\nThere are other tools developed by outside companies and researchers to detect text created with AI, and many teachers say they have used them. But they sometimes fail to detect text written by advanced large language models and can produce false positives.\n\nAt first, students \"thought we had all these magic wizard tricks to figure out whether they were using AI,\" said Mike Kentz, an AI consultant for educators who recently taught at a private high school in Georgia. \"By the end of the year...they were like, hold on a second, my teacher has no idea.\"\n\nSome teachers encourage students to use AI to help with research or to provide feedback on ideas. The problem is when students have an app like ChatGPT do all the work and don't even know what they are handing in.\n\nLast year, Josh McCrain, a political-science professor at the University of Utah, gave students a writing assignment that included, in indecipherable small text, instructions to include a reference to Batman. If they copy and pasted the assignment into AI, the instructions would be incorporated.\n\nSure enough, a handful of students turned in papers with nonsensical references to Batman. Going forward, McCrain is tweaking writing assignments to focus more on current events AI is less familiar with and beseeching students not to outsource their work to AI. \"That's where I try to really hammer that point home to students: You need to learn this stuff,\" he said.\n\nDiscussions about the watermarking tool started before OpenAI launched ChatGPT in November of 2022 and have been a persistent source of tension, the people familiar with the matter said. It was developed by Scott Aaronson, a computer-science professor who has been working on safety at OpenAI while on leave from the University of Texas for the past two years.\n\nIn early 2023, one of OpenAI's co-founders, John Schulman, outlined the pros and cons of the tool in a shared Google Doc. OpenAI executives then decided they would seek input from a range of people before acting further.\n\nOver the next year and a half, OpenAI executives repeatedly discussed the technology and sought fresh data to help decide whether to release it.\n\nIn April 2023, OpenAI commissioned a survey that showed people worldwide supported the idea of an AI detection tool by a margin of four to one, the internal documents show.\n\nThat same month, OpenAI surveyed ChatGPT users and found 69% believe cheating detection technology would lead to false accusations of using AI. Nearly 30% said they would use ChatGPT less if it deployed watermarks and a rival didn't.\n\nA recurring internal concern has been that the anticheating tool could hurt the quality of ChatGPT's writing. OpenAI conducted a test earlier this year that found watermarking didn't impair ChatGPT's performance, people familiar with the matter said.\n\n\"Our ability to defend our lack of text watermarking is weak now that we know it doesn't degrade outputs,\" employees involved in the testing concluded, according to the internal documents.\n\nIn early June, OpenAI senior employees and researchers met again to discuss the project. The group agreed the watermarking technology worked well, but the results of the ChatGPT user survey from last year still loomed large. Staffers said the company should look into other approaches that were potentially less controversial among users but unproven, according to people with knowledge of the meeting.\n\nThey also said OpenAI needed a plan by this fall to sway public opinion around AI transparency as well as potential new laws on the subject, the internal documents show.\n\n\"Without this, we risk credibility as responsible actors,\" a summary of the June meeting said.", "source": {"uri": "livemint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watermark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Watermark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Alexa", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Alexa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_technology_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief technology officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mira_Murati", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mira Murati"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-to-image_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Text-to-image model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DALL-E", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DALL-E"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lexical analysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Translate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google Translate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagiarism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plagiarism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software testing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emoji"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stanford University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Utah", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Utah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Aaronson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scott Aaronson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Texas_at_Austin", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Texas at Austin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images.livemint.com/img/2024/08/04/600x338/AI-LANGUAGES--0_1722765112679_1722765128060.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789998", "eventUri": "eng-9789998", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 224, "relevance": 1}

The text watermarking feature could be a revelation for teachers and companies who suspect people are cheating by using the chatbot but claim otherwise. However, OpenAI says it is only considering releasing it, possibly because doing so could impact its sales.\n\nNews that OpenAI has a system that can watermark ChatGPT-created text and detect it was revealed by The Wall Street Journal. The tool has been ready for about a year, but there is debate within the AI firm over whether it should ever be released.\n\nIn simple terms, the system works by making slight adjustments to the way ChatGPT selects words and phrases that follow each other, creating a pattern that can be detected by another tool - an invisible watermark, essentially.\n\nOpenAI updated a May blog post following the publication of the WSJ report, confirming that \"Our teams have developed a text watermarking method that we continue to consider as we research alternatives.\"\n\nThe post states that while the watermarking has proved highly accurate and effective against localized tampering, such as paraphrasing, it struggles when faced with globalized tampering, including using translation systems and rewording text using another generative model. Users could even circumvent the system by asking the model to insert a special character in between every word and then deleting that character.\n\nOpenAI also claims that text watermarking has the potential to disproportionately impact some groups. It gives the example of stigmatizing the use of AI as a writing tool for non-native English speakers.\n\nText watermarking is one of several solutions OpenAI has been investigating. It has looked into classifiers and metadata as part of \"extensive research on the area of text provenance.\"\n\nIn a statement to TechCrunch, an OpenAI spokesperson confirmed the WSJ's report but said it was taking a \"deliberate approach\" due to \"the complexities involved and its likely impact on the broader ecosystem beyond OpenAI.\"\n\nFor all OpenAI's claims of why it is still considering releasing the watermarking method, the main reason is likely the fact that 30% of surveyed ChatGPT users said that they'd use the chatbot less often if watermarking was implemented.\n\nIn March 2023, a study by five computer scientists from the University of Maryland concluded that text generated by LLMs cannot be reliably detected in practical scenarios, both from a theoretical and practical standpoint. OpenAI seemed to agree, shutting down its AI classifier tool, which was supposed to determine the likelihood that a piece of text was written by an AI, in July last year due to its low rate of accuracy.", "source": {"uri": "techspot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechSpot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rob_thubron@techspot.com", "name": "Rob Thubron", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watermark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Watermark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphrase", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paraphrase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Globalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Statistical classification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metadata"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Maryland,_College_Park", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Maryland, College Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TechCrunch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TechCrunch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Speech_Technology/Speech_Synthesis", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Speech Technology/Speech Synthesis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups/Twelve_Step", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups/Twelve Step", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://www.techspot.com/images2/news/bigimage/2023/03/2023-03-22-image-4-j_1100.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789998", "eventUri": "eng-9789998", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 221, "relevance": 1}

This comes in response to increasing concerns about students using artificial intelligence to cheat in their exams and assignments.\n\nBut despite the tool's ability to accurately pick up ChatGPT-generated text and the fact that it is ready to be launched at just the click of a button, OpenAI has held back its release for over a year due to internal debates and concerns over its potential impact on users and specific groups, such as non-native English speakers.\n\nInternal debates aplenty\n\nOpenAI employees have been divided on the issue, balancing the company's commitment to transparency against the desire to maintain and grow its user base.\n\nA survey of dedicated ChatGPT users revealed that nearly one-third would be dissuaded by the implementation of anti-cheating technology. The company is cautious about the potential risks and unintended consequences, as highlighted by an OpenAI spokeswoman who emphasised the importance of taking a deliberate and careful approach.\n\nHowever, proponents within the company argue that the benefits of such a tool far outweigh any potential downsides. They believe that the technology could significantly curb academic cheating and uphold the integrity of educational assessments.\n\nDespite these compelling arguments, the company remains hesitant, mainly because of the mixed reactions from users and the complexity that they would have to face in implementing the watermarking tool and making users realise the benefits of such a tool.\n\nHow the watermarking tech works\n\nThe watermarking technology developed by OpenAI subtly alters how tokens (words or fragments) are selected by ChatGPT, embedding a detectable pattern within the text. This pattern, invisible to the naked eye, can be identified by OpenAI's detection system, which assigns a likelihood score indicating whether a particular text was generated by ChatGPT or not. The method is reported to be 99.9% effective when enough new text is generated, according to internal documents.\n\nDespite its high effectiveness, there are concerns about the ease with which these watermarks could be removed. Techniques such as using translation services or adding and then removing emojis could potentially erase the watermark, undermining its reliability.\n\nAdditionally, determining who should have access to the detection tool poses a challenge. Limited access might render the tool ineffective, while widespread availability could expose the watermarking technique to potential bad actors.\n\nMuch broader implications\n\nOpenAI has debated various distribution strategies, including providing the detector directly to educators or partnering with third-party companies specialising in plagiarism detection. These discussions highlight the complexities involved in implementing the tool and ensuring it serves its intended purpose without unintended consequences.\n\nOpenAI is not alone in this endeavour. Google has developed a similar watermarking tool for its Gemini AI, currently in beta testing. OpenAI has also prioritised watermarking for audio and visual content, given the higher stakes associated with misinformation in these media, especially during an election year.\n\nThe ongoing internal discussions at OpenAI reflect the broader concerns and challenges associated with AI-generated content. As academic institutions grapple with the implications of AI on education, the need for reliable detection methods becomes increasingly critical. The balance between innovation, ethical considerations, and practical implementation remains a delicate one, as OpenAI continues to navigate this complex landscape.\n\nUltimately, the decision to release the text watermarking tool will likely hinge on further assessments of its impact on users and the broader ecosystem. As OpenAI seeks to align its actions with its values of transparency and responsibility, the outcome of these internal debates will shape the future of AI use in education and beyond.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watermark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Watermark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Misinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software testing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lexical analysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unintended_consequences", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unintended consequences"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagiarism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plagiarism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emoji"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2024/08/OpenAI-plans-to-launch-text-watermark-tool-for-ChatGPT-generated-content-to-stop-students-from-cheating-2024-08-8524f536356885bd0b9d74f257015da2-1200x675.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789998", "eventUri": "eng-9789998", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

However, internal debates have stalled the release of this feature. While watermarking seems like a responsible step, it could impact the company's user base and, consequently, its revenue.\n\nWatermarking in ChatGPT involves tweaking the model's word prediction patterns to create detectable markers. For a more detailed explanation, you can refer to Google's analysis of Gemini's text watermarking. The potential benefits of watermarking are significant, particularly for educators looking to prevent students from submitting AI-generated assignments. The Journal notes that watermarking does not compromise the quality of ChatGPT's text output. Moreover, a survey commissioned by OpenAI revealed that global support for an AI detection tool outweighs opposition by a four-to-one margin.\n\nAfter the Journal's story, OpenAI confirmed in a blog post that it has been working on watermarking, a fact also highlighted by TechCrunch. According to the company, their method boasts a 99.9% effectiveness rate and is resistant to tampering, such as paraphrasing. However, OpenAI acknowledges that rewording by another model could easily bypass the watermark, making it trivial for malicious users to evade detection. The company also expressed concern about the potential stigmatization of AI tools, particularly for non-native English speakers.\n\nOne significant worry for OpenAI is user response. Almost 30 per cent of surveyed ChatGPT users indicated they would use the software less if watermarking were implemented. This hesitation underscores the delicate balance OpenAI must maintain between ethical responsibility and user satisfaction.\n\nDespite these concerns, some OpenAI employees believe in the effectiveness of watermarking. Nevertheless, the Journal reports that alternative methods, which might be less controversial but are still unproven, are also under consideration. In its recent blog post, OpenAI mentioned it is in the early stages of exploring metadata embedding. This technique, being cryptographically signed, promises no false positives, though it is too soon to determine its overall effectiveness.\n\nIn summary, while OpenAI acknowledges the advantages of watermarking in identifying AI-generated text, user feedback and practical concerns have led the company to explore other less invasive methods. The decision reflects a careful consideration of both ethical implications and user engagement.", "source": {"uri": "thehansindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hans India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watermark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Watermark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_engagement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Customer engagement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphrase", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paraphrase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TechCrunch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TechCrunch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metadata"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Digital signature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Spreadsheets", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Spreadsheets", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Information_Retrieval", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Information Retrieval", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2024/05/17/1447338-chatgpt.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789998", "eventUri": "eng-9789998", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

But it's considering whether to even release it, citing several issues and complexities involved, and potentially putting off uses who don't want to be found out using AI-generated text.\n\nIn an updated blog post about its research on AI text detection, OpenAI states: \"Our teams have developed a text watermarking method that we continue to consider as we research alternatives\".\n\nText watermarking methods are not without their issues and complexities and can negatively impact the AI generated content.

While AI generated content saves time for many, the tool is also infamous when it comes to students and learning. Since its inception, OpenAI's ChatGPT has been a topic of concern. The debate about students using artificial intelligence for cheating has been widespread. But what if OpenAI says that there is a way to detect texts written by its artificial intelligence? OpenAI has a method that can detect when someone is using ChatGPT to write. According to the Wall Street Journal, the saviour tool has been ready to be released for about a year now. But it looks like OpenAI is not ready to show the green light just yet.\n\nThe report suggests that the delay in releasing this tool is solely to attract and retain users. One survey the company conducted of loyal ChatGPT users found nearly a third would be turned off by the anti-cheating technology. The Center for Democracy and Technology, a technology policy non-profit organisation, also found that 59 per cent of middle- and high-school teachers were sure some students had used AI to help with schoolwork, up 17 points from the prior school year.\n\nWall Street Journal report quoted an OpenAI spokesperson, who said that the decision to keep the anti-cheating tool under wraps is because it has a few risk factors and is complex. The launch will likely impact the broader ecosystem beyond OpenAI, given the complexities.\n\nOpenAI's anti-cheating tool modifies the way ChatGPT selects words or word fragments (tokens) to generate text. This modification would introduce a subtle pattern, known as a watermark, into the generated text, allowing for detection of potential cheating or misuse.\n\nThe watermarks, though undetectable to humans, would be recognisable by OpenAI's detection technology. It assigns a score to indicate the likelihood that a document or section was generated by ChatGPT. This score would serve as an indicator of the probability that the content was created by the AI model.\n\nInternal documents reveal that the watermarking technique is nearly flawless, achieving a 99.9 per cent effectiveness rate. But this flawlessness is only when ChatGPT produces a substantial amount of new text, enabling accurate identification of AI-generated content.\n\nEven then, the concerns that the watermarks can be erased through other techniques like having Google Translate the text into another language and then back, or having ChatGPT add emojis to the text and then manually deleting them stand tall.\n\nBut the primary issue, as per the report, is, if and when released, who should be able to use the tool. If too few people have it, the tool wouldn't be useful. If too many get access, bad actors might decipher the company's watermarking technique.\n\nBut this is just for the text.

The company supposedly gave its side of the reason why the text formatting tool hasn't seen the light of the day. OpenAI added that it could, \"disproportionately impact some groups. For example, it could stigmatize the use of AI as a useful writing tool for non-native English speakers.\"\n\nFor now, the company is evaluating the risks involved in releasing the text formatting tool, since it will likely impact a broader ecosystem beyond OpenAI.

Credit: EconoTimes\n\nOpenAI has developed a watermarking system for ChatGPT to detect AI-generated text, but internal disagreements and user backlash concerns delay its implementation.\n\nOpenAI's Year-Old Watermarking Tool Faces Internal Disagreements and Potential Financial Impact\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that OpenAI has had an instrument to detect the watermark and a system for watermarking ChatGPT-created text ready for approximately a year. However, the organization has internal disagreements regarding whether or not to disclose it. It is the responsible course of action; however, it could hurt its financial performance.\n\nOpenAI's watermarking is defined as modifying the model's prediction of the most probable words and phrases that follow the most recent ones, thereby establishing a discernible pattern. (That's a simplification, but you can check out Google's more in-depth explanation for Gemini's text watermarking for more).\n\nThe company has found this to be \"99.9% effective\" for making AI text detectable when there's enough of it -- a potential boon for teachers trying to deter students from turning over writing assignments to AI. While not affecting the quality of its chatbot's text output, this system could significantly enhance the integrity of AI-generated content. In a survey the company commissioned, \"people worldwide supported the idea of an AI detection tool by a margin of four to one,\" the Journal wrote.\n\nOpenAI Weighs User Backlash and Circumvention Risks in Watermarking ChatGPT Texts\n\nHowever, OpenAI is concerned that implementing watermarking could discourage surveyed ChatGPT users. According to The Verge, nearly 30% of these users informed the company that they would use less software if watermarking were implemented.\n\nThe Journal reported that certain employees harbored additional apprehensions, including the potential for watermarking to be readily circumvented through methods such as bouncing the text between languages with Google Translate or causing ChatGPT to add emojis and subsequently deleting them.\n\nEmployees continue to perceive the methodology as effective, regardless of this. However, the article suggests that some methods that are \"potentially less controversial among users but unproven\" should be tried in response to persistent user sentiments.

He believes that artificial intelligence will fundamentally change the relationship between humans and computers.\n\nOpenAI has developed technology to reliably detect AI-generated text, according to inside sources and documents reported by the Wall Street Journal. However, the company is reluctant to release it, likely due to concerns about its own business model.\n\nThe AI text detector project has been discussed internally for about two years and has been ready for use for around a year, the WSJ reports. Releasing it is reportedly \"just a matter of pressing a button,\" but OpenAI is torn between transparency and user demands.\n\nAn internal survey found nearly one-third of ChatGPT users would be put off by a text detector. However, a global survey commissioned by OpenAI showed 4-to-1 support for AI detection and transparency.\n\nThe detector could particularly affect non-native English speakers, an OpenAI spokesperson said, and has \"likely impact on the broader ecosystem beyond OpenAI.\" While \"technically promising,\" it also has \"important risks we're weighing while we research alternatives,\" she said.\n\nThe detector provides an assessment of how likely it is that all or part of the document was written by ChatGPT. Given a sufficient amount of text, the method is said to be 99.9 percent effective.\n\nIt relies on watermarks that are invisible to humans but can be detected by OpenAI technology without affecting the quality of the text. However, it is unclear how reliable it is after extensive editing, back-and-forth translation, or the addition/removal of emoji.\n\nIn addition, OpenAI can only implement the method for ChatGPT and its own models, potentially driving users to other language models in the absence of an industry standard for AI transparency. So it could hurt OpenAI's business without solving the overall transparency problem.\n\nOpenAI staff has also discussed offering the detector directly to educators, or to outside companies that help schools or businesses identify AI-authored work and plagiarism to mitigate the damage done by text generation.\n\nOpenAI had already released an AI text detector, but it was unreliable. The company took it offline in the summer of 2023.\n\nThe tool stems from work done by computer science professor Scott Aaronson during a two-year safety project at OpenAI. At the end of 2022, Aaronson said that OpenAI planned to present the work in more detail in the coming months, but nothing has happened yet.\n\nOpenAI is said to have last discussed the watermarking method in early June, with the decision to evaluate less controversial alternatives. By fall, the company wants to have an internal plan in place to influence public opinion and legislation on the issue. Without this plan, \"credibility as responsible actors\" would be at risk.\n\nA working text detector could threaten OpenAI's business model if people devalue AI-generated text. One study suggests that this happens in private messages, where the human touch is valued. Another study showed that even when AI text is of higher quality, people still prefer human advice when given the choice.\n\nHowever, AI-generated text is becoming more common in search results, and some are betting that this kind of AI text could have a lot of commercial value as an omniscient answering machine - including OpenAI with SearchGPT.\n\nSo it may just be a matter of getting used to it.

The company has developed new algorithms that add watermark-like elements to the text content generated by ChatGPT, making it easier to identify such writing\n\nHowever, OpenAI is unsure whether to roll out this update, as it could affect millions of users who benefit from AI content writing. Here are the details.\n\nIn an official blog post, OpenAI mentioned that it has developed new techniques for some types of text-based watermarks for content written by ChatGPT. The algorithm uses a specific format of words and phrases that makes it easier and more effective for OpenAI to detect that the particular text was curated by its GPT models.\n\nHowever, OpenAI also said these techniques can be tampered with using third-party AI-powered paraphrasing tools. Hence, if a user generates text content in ChatGPT and then paraphrases it using an external tool, OpenAI will not be able to identify that the rephrased content was originally written by ChatGPT.\n\nIt is important to note that OpenAI has not implemented these algorithms yet. The company has developed the necessary tools but is deciding whether to roll them out. OpenAI says that watermarking text could hurt non-English users of ChatGPT who use the chatbot for productive tasks and translation purposes.\n\nIt could also negatively impact users who might be criticised for using ChatGPT. On the flip side, ChatGPT is also being used extensively by students, content creators, marketers, etc., for their content writing. In the case of students, it is being used to cheat in some exams and essays, which has become a problem.\n\nOpenAI has not disclosed a specific timeline for rolling out its text watermarking. According to a WSJ report, another reason this feature is not being rolled out is a serious worry that some users would stop relying on the tools if watermarking were present.\n\nHowever, the company has taken new steps in watermarking its AI-generated images.\n\nOpenAI has started adding metadata to images generated using its DALL-E 3 AI model. It adds context like, \"This content was generated using an AI tool,\" and mentions the tool's name and the API used. The company is also adding tamper-proof watermarks to its images.\n\nOpenAI will now use special algorithms to generate images, making them easy to detect.

Detection Tool Exists, But OpenAI Hasn't Released It Yet\n\nThe technology for detecting AI-generated text with pinpoint accuracy has been under internal discussion for the past two years.\n\nBy Syazwan Bahri -- 05 Aug 2024, 07:00 PM\n\n#ChatGPT #OpenAI #artificialintelligence #tech #technews Cover image via Shantanu Kumar/Pexels & Andrea Piacquadio/Pexels\n\nFollow us on Instagram, TikTok, and WhatsApp for the latest stories and breaking news.\n\nOpenAI has developed a tool capable of detecting if students use ChatGPT to write their assignments, but they are currently debating whether to release it or not\n\nSpeaking to TechCrunch, OpenAI has confirmed they are researching a text watermarking method as mentioned in an exclusive by The Wall Street Journal. However, they are taking a deliberate approach due to the complexities involved and the potential impact on the broader ecosystem beyond OpenAI.\n\nWith text watermarking, OpenAI would specifically target detecting text generated by ChatGPT, not other models. This involves subtly altering how ChatGPT selects words to embed an invisible watermark in the text, which can later be detected by a separate tool.\n\nProviding a method to detect AI-generated text could be a gamechanger for teachers aiming to prevent students from submitting AI-written assignments\n\nImage used for illustration purposes only.\n\nImage via Shantanu Kumar/Pexels\n\nOpenAI confirmed in a blog post that their watermarking method for detecting AI-generated text is highly accurate and resistant to tampering, including paraphrasing.\n\nHowever, they acknowledge that rewording using another model could easily bypass the watermark. The company also expressed concerns about the potential stigmatisation of AI writing tools, particularly regarding their utility for non-native speakers.\n\nOpenAI is also concerned that implementing watermarking might deter users, with nearly 30% of surveyed ChatGPT users indicating they would use the software less if it were introduced\n\nDespite these concerns, some employees believe watermarking is effective. To address user feedback, the company is exploring alternative methods, such as embedding metadata, which could be less controversial but are still unproven.\n\nAccording to their blog post, OpenAI is in the early stages of this exploration, and while the metadata would be cryptographically signed to avoid false positives, it's too soon to determine its effectiveness.\n\nFollow SAYS Tech on Facebook, Instagram, & TikTok for the latest in tech in Malaysia and the world!\n\nRead more #tech stories:\n\nDon't miss out!

Images created by artificial intelligence proliferate online, as do news reports and countless other types of content -- including essays and research articles.\n\nWhile it is sometimes incredibly easy to tell when Gen AI has been used to create a portion of text, this not always the case. But that could be set to change as OpenAI is working on a way to watermark Gen AI text, just as has been possible with images created by AI.\n\nSee also:\n\nWatermarking images is incredibly simple, and it is a practice that is already widely used. Text, however, is a little different -- but that's not to say there is not an interest in, and a drive towards, finding a way to make AI-generated text easier to identify.\n\nUpdating a blog post on the subject of watermarking, OpenAI has revealed the headway it has made in making it possible to check the provenance of text. There are various possible approaches to making text traceable and checkable -- such as classifiers, watermarking and metadata. Each has advantages and disadvantages, and OpenAI is concentrating on metadata and watermark research.\n\nIn fact, the company has already developed a text watermarking method, but it is not without its problems. This weekend OpenAI explains its work in an updated article spotted by The Wall Street Journal and reported by TechCrunch:\n\nWhile it has been highly accurate and even effective against localized tampering, such as paraphrasing, it is less robust against globalized tampering; like using translation systems, rewording with another generative model, or asking the model to insert a special character in between every word and then deleting that character -- making it trivial to circumvention by bad actors.\n\nAnother important risk we are weighing is that our research suggests the text watermarking method has the potential to disproportionately impact some groups. For example, it could stigmatize use of AI as a useful writing tool for non-native English speakers.\n\nWhile the idea of watermarking text might seem complex, it is something that OpenAI sees as a possibility for the future. The company says that \"there are characteristics of metadata that would make this approach particularly promising\".

Also, employees warn that if too many people had access to the detection tool, bad actors would likely be able to figure out OpenAI's watermarking technique, rendering the tool useless.\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson told The Journal that another concern is that the tool might disproportionally impact non-native English speakers.

Nearly 30% said they would use ChatGPT less if it deployed watermarks and a rival didn't.\n\nIf ChatGPT was the only LLM tool, watermarking might make sense.

Now, the company has shared a bit more about its research into test watermarking in an update to a blog post, and why it hasn't made its detection method available just yet.\n\nOpenAI says that its teams have developed a text watermarking method that they are considering, but are also looking into alternatives on ways to prevent text written by ChatGPT from being used in cases where it shouldn't be... (like if your high schooler suddenly \"came up\" with an epic essay).\n\nAccording to OpenAI, watermarking is one of the solutions. Watermarking may include classifiers and metadata. Watermarking is accurate but can be less useful if you use a translation system or if you reword the text using another generative model. It can also be bypassed if you ask the AI to insert a specific character after every word and then delete it later (boy, some of these high-schoolers are creative, it's that been done!)\n\nText watermarking could also impact other users, like for example non-native English speakers who'd like to refine their text and use AI to help them with writing.\n\nAccording to the blog post, OpenAI has been considering all aspects of the issue with text provenance.\n\nI agree with the fact that addressing this issue is a complicated thing. Of course, we don't want kids to be incapable of writing an essay themselves (or any text longer than 200 characters, for that matter). But also there are cases where using Generative AI to write things is totally acceptable and shouldn't be that big of a deal.

This increased usage has created another problem among others -- cheating and forgery. As per reports, ChatGPT is increasingly being used by students for writing essays and research papers. A report by The Wall Street Journal last week said that the company has been sitting on a tool that can help users identify articles and essays written by AI. Furthermore, the report says that the tool has been a subject of internal debate for about two years and has been ready to be released for about a year. Responding to the development, OpenAI has updated its blog post detailing how it is planning to identify text written by AI.\n\nText Watermarking\n\nOpenAI has said that it is exploring the text watermarking technique to identify data or text based on its origin. The company says this technique is effective against localised tampering such as paraphrasing, it's not effective against more complex techniques such as using another generative AI model to reword the article or essay written by the first gen-AI model.\n\n\"While it has been highly accurate and even effective against localized tampering, such as paraphrasing, it is less robust against globalized tampering; like using translation systems, rewording with another generative model, or asking the model to insert a special character in between every word and then deleting that character - making it trivial to circumvention by bad actors,\" the company wrote in its blog post.\n\nText Metadata\n\nBesides text watermarking, the company is also exploring using how metadata can be used to identify text written by AI or in other words trace its origin. OpenAI says that it is still in the early stages of exploring this technique but it looks more promising than text watermarking.\n\n\"For example, unlike watermarking, metadata is cryptographically signed, which means that there are no false positives...While text watermarking has a low false positive rate, applying it to large volumes of text would lead to a large number of total false positives,\" the company added.\n\nThat said, these tools remain unavailable for now.

As per the report, the tool has been ready to be released for quite some time, but the AI firm is concerned that such a detection tool might make the chatbot unpopular among users. However, not releasing such a tool has led to educators struggling to find out when an assignment or an essay was written using the help of AI.\n\nAccording to a report by The Wall Street Journal, OpenAI has been debating the release of such a tool for the last two years. The text detection tool has also been ready to release for about a year, the report claimed citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. One of the sources told the publication that releasing the tool was as easy as pressing a button.\n\nSuch a tool could help educators and other similar institutions where people have resorted to generating content such as essays and research papers using AI. Earlier this year, a peer-reviewed scientific paper published in Elsevier's Surfaces and Interfaces journal was found to be written by AI and was subsequently retracted after it gained attention online. This AI-based plagiarism has become a big concern for academia due to the lack of a reliable method to detect AI usage.\n\nAs per the report, OpenAI's refusal to release its AI detection tool comes from fears of losing existing users. The company reportedly conducted a survey and found that nearly a third of users would be less inclined to use ChatGPT if an anti-cheating mechanism was released.\n\nAnother fear was that making it available to a select number of users such as educators might reduce the usefulness of the tool, whereas making it available to a large group could result in the watermarking technology being deciphered by bad actors who can then make advanced masking tools.\n\nBased on internal documents viewed by the publication, the report claims that the AI text detection tool is 99 percent effective in finding text that was written with the help of ChatGPT. This reportedly works as the tool is essentially a watermarking technology that embeds the text with an invisible watermark that cannot be seen but gets flagged when run through the AI checker.\n\nThe workings of the tool was also explained in internal documents. As per the report, ChatGPT generates text by predicting which word or phrase, also known as a token, should follow in a sequence.

Some employees within OpenAI are against deploying the tool due to concerns about non-native English speakers and member preferences. The debate over implementing the fingerprinting technology has been ongoing for two years without a clear resolution in sight.\n\nEver since ChatGPT began making waves online, people have been concerned about the power of AI writing when it comes to plagiarism. With AI tools, people don't need to write their essays and reports; instead, they can plug the subject into an AI generation tool and have it write everything for them. As it turns out, OpenAI has the technology to make it a lot easier to detect when ChatGPT generates a passage of text; however, internal conflict surrounding the tool has prevented the company from actually deploying it.\n\nRelated How to use ChatGPT: Making an account, prompts, and more\n\nChatGPT is a tool that many people may have heard of but aren't sure how to use. This is how to get started and what you can use it for!\n\nOpenAI is having an internal argument over ChatGPT's fingerprinting tool Image Credit: OpenAI\n\nAs reported by the Wall Street Journal, insiders claim that OpenAI has the power to add \"fingerprinting\" to the text that ChatGPT generates. Fingerprinting is when an AI developer adds a tell-tale pattern to the model's generation which humans can't detect. Then, the developer can create a tool that looks for this special pattern and flags anything that features it as AI-generated. People concerned about AI use can then use this tool to spot AI generation in ways that a human can't.\n\nThe fingerprinting tool that OpenAI made for ChatGPT reportedly has a 99.9% detection rate, which would help cut down on people using it for plagiarism. There's just one problem; some employees don't think it should be deployed. Some cite that AI generation is handy for people who aren't native English speakers to get their point across, while others point to a recent survey where 1/3rd of OpenAI's paying members said they do not want fingerprinting technology applied to their generations.\n\nThe debate has been raging for two years now, and the company still hasn't come to a solid conclusion on what it wants to do.

The company hasn't released it despite widespread concerns about students using artificial intelligence to cheat.\n\nThe project has been mired in internal debate at OpenAI for roughly two years and has been ready to be released for about a year, according to people familiar with the matter and internal documents viewed by The Wall Street Journal. \"It's just a matter of pressing a button,\" one of the people said.\n\nWhat OpenAI wrote on 5/7/2024 -- \"Understanding the source of what we see and hear online\" (\"Update on August 4, 2024\") -- suggests that the method is relatively easy to circumvent:\n\nSee also Umar Shakir, \"Google's invisible AI watermark will help identify generative text and video\", The Verge 5/14/2024:\n\nGoogle's DeepMind CEO, Demis Hassabis, took the stage for the first time at the Google I/O developer conference on Tuesday to talk not only about the team's new AI tools, like the Veo video generator, but also about the new upgraded SynthID watermark imprinting system. It can now mark video that was digitally generated as well as AI-generated text.\n\nSome details are available on Google Deep Mind's SynthID page:\n\nFinding a robust solution to watermarking AI-generated text that doesn't compromise the quality, accuracy and creative output has been a great challenge for AI researchers. To solve this problem, our team developed a technique that embeds a watermark directly into the process that a large language model (LLM) uses for generating text.\n\nAn LLM generates text one token at a time. These tokens can represent a single character, word or part of a phrase. To create a sequence of coherent text, the model predicts the next most likely token to generate. These predictions are based on the preceding words and the probability scores assigned to each potential token. [...]\n\nThis process is repeated throughout the generated text, so a single sentence might contain ten or more adjusted probability scores, and a page could contain hundreds. The final pattern of scores for both the model's word choices combined with the adjusted probability scores are considered the watermark. This technique can be used for as few as three sentences. And as the text increases in length, SynthID's robustness and accuracy increases.\n\nObviously this method depends on knowing what release of what generative model was used. And even then, the same \"globalized tampering\" interventions will presumably work here as well -- though if and when these methods are generally accessible and used, naive cheaters will be caught.", "source": {"uri": "languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu", "dataType": "news", "title": "LDC - Linguistic Data Consortium"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_liberman@languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu", "name": "Mark Liberman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watermark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Watermark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_I/O", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "O"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepMind", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DeepMind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demis_Hassabis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Demis Hassabis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_distribution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Digital distribution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Verge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Verge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Probability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_(computer_science)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robustness (computer science)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lexical analysis"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Information_Retrieval", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Information Retrieval", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Insults", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Insults", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 93}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789998", "eventUri": "eng-9789998", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

There is no denying that the company has brought convenience and utility to users from varied fields, but data is sometimes misused by users at workplaces and academic institutions, and to deal with this problem, OpenAI has been working for the past year on a detection tool but is not releasing it yet, despite the growing concerns.\n\nOpenAI with ChatGPT has changed the AI game and how content is generated and used. Like any AI tool, the language model has brought forth more enhanced access to information and how it's presented, but it also posed issues regarding students using the tool for cheating and content creators using text generated through prompts as original through different workarounds.\n\nTo minimize this problem, OpenAI has been working on a tool to detect users who rely entirely on ChatGPT for content creation. However, despite how widespread the concern regarding the loopholes seems to be, the company has still not rolled out the tool and is still weighing the potential impact and outcomes, as per a Wall Street Journal report.\n\nOpenAI updated its blog post regarding its tool for detecting AI-generated content and its watermarking method. It suggested that the technique is effective in localized tampering, such as paraphrasing, but would not be as accurate with globalized tampering that involves rewriting, for instance. Since the method can let bad actors find a workaround and potentially discourage non-native speakers from using the tool, OpenAI seems hesitant and is internally discussing whether to release the tool.\n\nEven though OpenAI confirmed to TechCrunch that the method's accuracy is close to 99.9 percent, it will still go with a 'deliberate approach.' The company's spokesperson said that they are dealing with caution due to:\n\n\"The complexities involved and its likely impact on the broader ecosystem beyond OpenAI.\"\n\nAnother possible reason OpenAI seems reluctant to release the tool is the potential ChatGPT users it could lose due to the watermarking. About 30 percent of ChatGPT users mentioned that they might not use the tool as frequently once the watermarking system is intact.\n\nOpenAI also mentioned in its blog post that they are exploring text metadata as an alternative approach since it is cryptographically signed, ensuring no false positives. However, it is still too early to know if this approach would be effective and what kind of impact would it have.", "source": {"uri": "wccftech.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wccftech"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ezza_ijaz@wccftech.com", "name": "Ezza Ijaz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheating", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cheating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watermark", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Watermark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphrase", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paraphrase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metadata"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Digital signature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TechCrunch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TechCrunch"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/OpenAI-tool-e1722856197626.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789998", "eventUri": "eng-9789998", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 460558502, "relevance": 2}

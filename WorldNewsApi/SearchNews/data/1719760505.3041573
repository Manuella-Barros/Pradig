{"id": 225016826, "title": "Death penalty jury change creates &#8216;game of chance&#8217; for resentencings, groups argue", "text": "TALLAHASSEE \u2014 A 2023 law that reduced the number of jurors needed to recommend execution has resulted in a \u201cquintessential game of chance\u201d for inmates being resentenced and it unconstitutionally \u201csilences Black voices,\u201d according to groups seeking to join a Florida Supreme Court case. The law allowed death sentences to be imposed based on the recommendations of eight of 12 jurors, instead of what had to be a unanimous jury recommendation. The change, prompted by Parkland school mass murderer Nikolas Cruz receiving a life sentence after a jury did not unanimously recommend death, gave Florida the least strict death penalty jury standard in the nation. Allowing 8-4 recommendations was the latest in a series of changes in the capital-sentencing process after a 2016 U.S. Supreme Court decision in a case known as Hurst v. Florida found the state\u2019s process unconstitutional. That ruling led the Florida Supreme Court to decide unanimous recommendations were required for death sentences, which the Legislature later enshrined in state law. Justices ordered resentencing for about 150 Death Row inmates who had been sentenced based on non-unanimous jury recommendations. Amid the resentencings, however, a revamped Florida Supreme Court backed away from the unanimous requirement and paved the way for the 8-4 law, which took effect last April. Michael James Jackson, convicted of two 2005 Jacksonville murders, is among about 40 Death Row inmates whose resentencings were pending when the 8-4 law went into effect. A jury voted 8-4 on May 25, 2023, to recommend execution for Jackson, and a judge issued a death sentence in August. In a friend-of-the-court-brief filed last week in the Jackson case, a coalition of groups argued that the different death-penalty standards have injected an unconstitutional haphazardness in the resentencing process in pending cases when the law changed. The groups, including the Florida Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, the Florida Public Defender Association, the Florida Justice Institute, Floridians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty and Conservatives Concerned About the Death Penalty, argued that the 8-4 requirement has been applied \u201cbased on chance.\u201d The resentencing standards hinged on \u201can arbitrary line-drawing based on the date\u201d the sentencing was made final, Melanie Kalmanson, an attorney who frequently writes about the death penalty, wrote on behalf of the groups. \u201cData on the Hurst resentencing proceedings show that whether a capital defendant was resentenced under Florida\u2019s post-Hurst unanimity statute or the 8-4 statute is the quintessential game of chance,\u201d the brief fsaid. Jackson\u2019s case is the first direct Florida Supreme Court death-penalty appeal under the 2023 law. It also drew a brief Tuesday from groups and Black state lawmakers alleging the 8-4 law unconstitutionally violates equal protection rights of jurors and \u201csilences Black voices.\u201d Groups signing onto Tuesday\u2019s brief included the NAACP Florida State Conference and Equal Ground Education Fund Inc., along with five Black state representatives and a former state senator. The 2023 law \u201cdisproportionately excludes Black jurors\u2019 votes in capital sentencing,\u201d Christopher Belelieu, an attorney with the Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher firm, wrote in the brief. \u201cLike systemic state systems of exclusion and racially tainted peremptory strikes, non-unanimous juries operate to exclude the voices of Black jurors, thereby depriving jurors of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment,\u201d the brief said. The law, \u201cby design,\u201d operates to \u201cprevent up to a third of jurors from having their voices heard,\u201d Belelieu wrote. \u201cA law that denies jurors the equal right to have their voices heard is patently unconstitutional, and undermines confidence and legitimacy in the judicial process,\u201d the brief said. As of March 31, only 17% of the resentencings decided under the unanimous requirement had resulted in death sentences, according to the brief filed last week. A jury in January voted 9-3 to recommend death for inmate Bessman Okafor in an Orange County murder, but he will not be sentenced by a judge until June. The court needs to \u201crectify the unconstitutional arbitrariness created by this new subset of cases,\u201d Kalmanson wrote. The brief does not seek a ruling on the underlying constitutionality of the 8-4 law but asks the court to \u201clevel the playing field for those prisoners who were granted a new penalty phase after Hurst.\u201d", "summary": "Death penalty juror change creates 'game of chance' for resentencings, groups argue.", "url": "https://www.orlandosentinel.com/2024/05/29/death-penalty-jury-change-creates-game-of-chance-for-resentencings-groups-argue/", "image": "https://www.orlandosentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/OS-WP-fallback-image-3.png", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:00:55", "author": "News Service Of Florida", "authors": ["News Service Of Florida"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.297}

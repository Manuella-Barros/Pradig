most of which were investments owned by Alameda Research, a crypto-focused hedge fund controlled Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX Ventures businesses, and litigation claims.\n\nThe amount for distribution includes assets under the control of the chapter 11 debtors, as well as those controlled by liquidators of FTX Bahamas Digital Markets, Bahamas Securities Commission, liquidators of FTX's Australia unit, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and several private parties, the statement added.\n\nThe company said the amended plan focuses on a series of settlements reached consensually with the key stakeholders including cases that are still subject to court approval.\n\nThe plan put forward by FTX creates a \"convenience class\" for creditors with claims of $50,000 or lower, under which it anticipates that majority of the creditors will receive about 118% of the amount of their claims within 2 months if approved by the court.\n\n\"We are pleased to be in a position to propose a chapter 11 plan that contemplates the return of 100% of bankruptcy claim amounts plus interest for non-governmental creditors,\" CEO John Ray said.\n\nIn February, the distressed crypto currency trading platform had $6.4 billion in cash.\n\nEarlier this year, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison by a judge for stealing $8 billion from customers.\n\nFTX, once among the world's top crypto exchanges, shook the sector in November 2022 by filing for bankruptcy, leaving an estimated 9 million customers and investors facing billions of dollars in losses.", "source":

The exchange estimates that it has between $14.5 billion and $16.3 billion to distribute to them.\n\nThe filing said that after paying claims in full, the plan provides for supplemental interest payments to creditors, to the extent that funds still remain. The interest rate for most creditors is 9%.\n\nThat may be a diminished consolation for investors who were trading cryptocurrency on the exchange when it collapsed. When FTX sought bankruptcy protection in November 2022, bitcoin was going for $16,080. But crypto prices have soared as the economy recovered while the assets at FTX were sorted out over the past two years. A single bitcoin on Tuesday was selling for close to $62,675.

This covers about 98% of FTX customers.\n\nFTX said that it was able to recover funds by monetizing a collection of assets that mostly consisted of proprietary investments held by the Alameda or FTX Ventures businesses, or litigation claims.\n\nFTX was the third-largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world when it filed for bankruptcy protection in November 2022 after it experienced the crypto equivalent of a bank run.\n\nChief Executive Officer and founder Sam Bankman-Fried resigned when the exchange collapsed. In March he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the huge fraud that occurred at FTX.\n\nBankman-Fried was convicted in November of fraud and conspiracy -- a dramatic fall from a crest of success that included a Super Bowl advertisement, testimony before Congress and celebrity endorsements from stars like quarterback Tom Brady, basketball point guard Stephen Curry and comedian Larry David.\n\nThe company appointed as its new CEO John Ray III, a long-time bankruptcy litigator who is best known for having to clean up the mess made after the collapse of Enron.\n\n\"We are pleased to be in a position to propose a chapter 11 plan that contemplates the return of 100% of bankruptcy claim amounts plus interest for non-governmental creditors,\" Ray said in a prepared statement.\n\nFTX, technically, remains a company but its future is unclear. In early 2023, Ray said that he had formed a task force to explore reviving FTX.com, the crypto exchange.\n\nThe sordid details of a company run amok that emerged after its assets were seized would hamstring almost any business attempting a comeback, but there may also be different parameters for cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nThe rival crypto exchange Binance briefly explored acquiring FTX before it collapsed in late 2022. Its founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao, was sentenced last week to four months in prison for looking the other way as criminals used the platform to move money connected to child sex abuse, drug trafficking and terrorism.\n\nBinance is still the largest crypto exchange in the world.\n\nThe bankruptcy court is set to hold a hearing on the dispersion of FTX assets on June 25.\n\nThe case is FTX Trading Ltd., 22-11068, US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.\n\nInformation for this article was contributed by Steven Church of Bloomberg News (WPNS).", "source": {"uri": "arkansasonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArkansasOnline"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Bankman-Fried", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Bankman-Fried"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsecured_creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unsecured creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_bankruptcy_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States bankruptcy court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changpeng_Zhao", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Changpeng Zhao"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binance", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Binance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron_scandal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Enron scandal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_David", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Larry David"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_11,_Title_11,_United_States_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/static-4/ao_redesign/graphics/adgog.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547890", "eventUri": "eng-9547890", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-25", "textStart": 3651, "textEnd": 3658}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 221, "relevance": 1}

The FTX-associated wallet moved 860 Tether Gold (XAUT) tokens, valued at over $2 million, to algorithmic trading firm Wintermute.\n\nMeanwhile, an Alameda-related wallet transferred 2,027 Ether, worth more than $6.3 million, to two undisclosed addresses. While the exact motive behind these transactions is unclear, they coincide with a critical juncture in FTX's bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nThe impending deadline for FTX debtors to submit an amended version of the \"Plan and Disclosure Statement\" on May 7 has left creditors eagerly anticipating insights into how they will be compensated for their losses.\n\nThe amended restructuring plan promises to offer creditors more clarity regarding their path to recovery. Concerns loom large among some creditors who fear that the revised plan may not adequately address their interests, however.\n\nOne such voice of caution is Sunil, an FTX Customer Ad-Hoc Committee member representing over 1,500 FTX creditors. Sunil has urged users to scrutinize the upcoming plan, warning that it may favor debtors at the expense of creditors.\n\n\"S&C [Sullivan & Cromwell] likely include clauses to absolve their liability for crimes,\" said Sunil in a May 5 X post. \"S&C puppet John Ray secures a position for himself. Property rights not recognized [for creditors].\"\n\nSunil highlighted potential issues, such as clauses to absolve liability for crimes and the lack of recognition of creditors' property rights.\n\nOngoing legal battles, including lawsuits against bankruptcy firm Sullivan & Cromwell (S&C), add to the complexity.\n\n\"S&C knew of FTX US and FTX Trading Ltd.'s omissions, untruthful and fraudulent conduct, and misappropriation of Class Members' funds,\" claimed FTX creditors in a February 16 court filing. \"Despite this knowledge, S&C stood to gain financially from the FTX Group's misconduct and agreed, at least impliedly, to assist that unlawful conduct for its own gain.\"\n\nThese legal disputes further prolong the resolution process, potentially delaying creditors' access to compensation. With over $490 million worth of claims already sold through 507 transactions, the path to resolution appears fraught with challenges.\n\nFTX, amidst bankruptcy proceedings, recently agreed to sell the majority of its shares in AI startup Anthropic for $884 million.

The plan must still be approved by a court and by creditors.\n\n\"We are pleased to be in a position to propose a chapter 11 plan that contemplates the return of 100% of bankruptcy claim amounts plus interest for non-governmental creditors,\" said John J. Ray III, who took over as chief executive officer of FTX alongside his role as chief restructuring officer.\n\nThat plan is possible mostly because FTX and its sister company, Alameda Research, held a number of other assets that the reorganization team has sold off.

It owes customers and other non-governmental creditors about $11 billion.\n\nAlthough all debts will be paid in full, plus interest, nothing will be leftover for equity holders, according to court documents filed Tuesday evening in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware, where the FTX case is being handled.\n\nDepending on the type of claim they hold in the case, some creditors could recover as much as 142% of what they are owed. The vast majority of customers, however, will likely get paid 118% of what they had on the FTX platform the day the company entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n\nThe company, now run by restructuring advisers, has also proposed setting up a fund to pay some creditors, including those who lent FTX crypto, with money that otherwise would have gone to government regulators.\n\nPayouts are likely several months away, as FTX winds its way through the final stages of the bankruptcy case.\n\nEarlier this year, the company had about $6.4 billion in cash. The increase is due mostly to a general spike in prices for various cryptocurrencies, including Solana, a token heavily backed by convicted fraudster and FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried. The company has also sold dozens other assets, including various venture-capital projects like a stake in the artificial-intelligence company Anthropic.\n\nThe latest figures underscore the surprising outcome for FTX, whose collapse drew comparisons to Enron Corp.'s fraud-fueled downfall and the unraveling of Bernie Madoff's ponzi scheme.\n\nBut restructuring advisers have since been tracking down the company's assets and untangling a web of accounts scattered around the world. Those recoveries have been given a massive jolt by the crypto rebound, which has caused the price of Bitcoin to roughly quadruple since late 2022.\n\nIn a document filed Tuesday, restructuring advisers laid out new details of their proposal to distribute the cash to creditors and end the Chapter 11 case. Known as a disclosure statement, the document is designed to help creditors vote on the proposed payout plan.\n\nUS Bankruptcy Judge John Dorsey will take that vote into consideration when he decides whether to approve the plan sometime later this summer.

But some will reject it anyway.\n\nSome creditors of the bankrupt crypto exchange FTX are preparing to reject a plan that would see them recover 118 percent of the money they lost. The proposal is far less generous than it might seem, they claim.\n\nStarting in January, the FTX creditors began to form a voting block, now made up of 1,600 claimants. The new plan is due to be put to a vote in June; the leaders of the block -- Sunil Kavuri and Arush Sehgal -- will urge members to vote against its approval. \"The recovery percentages are drawn from a fake baseline. It's a false narrative,\" says Sehgal. \"It's an insult to creditors.\"\n\nFTX fell to pieces in November 2022 after running dry of funds with which to process customer withdrawals. Billions of dollars' worth of customer funds was missing. A year later, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was convicted of multiple counts of fraud and conspiracy in connection with the collapse of the exchange. In April, he was sentenced to 25 years in federal prison.\n\nFiled on Tuesday, the FTX bankruptcy plan charts a path to a full recovery, plus interest, for practically all creditors -- made possible, according to FTX, by the liquidation of billions of dollars' worth of investments made by the exchange's venture capital arm, FTX Ventures, and its sister company, Alameda Research.\n\nUnder the proposed plan, government bodies in the United States -- including the Internal Revenue Service and the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission -- have agreed to suspend high-value claims against FTX until creditors had been repaid (although the IRS will receive a $200 million upfront payment as part of the settlement).\n\n\"We are pleased to be in a position to propose a Chapter 11 plan that contemplates the return of 100 percent of bankruptcy claim amounts plus interest for nongovernmental creditors,\" said John Ray III, the veteran bankruptcy professional in charge of the estate, in a statement. \"I want to thank all the customers and creditors of FTX for their patience throughout this process.\"\n\nAlthough the plan affords creditors a greater recovery than FTX had previously indicated would be possible and assigns their claims priority over others, the creditors leading the voting block object to the plan on a variety of different grounds.\n\nThey take issue with the way claims have been valued under the plan. Many customers held crypto assets like bitcoin on the FTX platform, but through a process common to bankruptcy proceedings known as dollarization, their claims have instead been assigned a dollar value based on the price of those assets on the date of the bankruptcy petition. The issue is the subject of a lawsuit filed by the creditors within the bankruptcy proceeding.\n\nWhen FTX fell, the crypto market nosedived, but has since rebounded. The value of bitcoin, for example, has risen from roughly $16,000 in November 2022 to more than $60,000 per coin. The market recovery is part of the reason FTX is in a position to repay customers in full, but it also means that customer claims could be less than a third as valuable under the plan -- even accounting for the 18 percent interest -- as they would be if mapped to the present value of crypto assets.", "source": {"uri": "wired.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wired"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conde_nast@wired.com", "name": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internal Revenue Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alameda_Research", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alameda Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Bankman-Fried", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Bankman-Fried"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_11,_Title_11,_United_States_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Venture capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidation", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liquidation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Futures contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accounting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://media.wired.com/photos/663ba309e6755459097533ca/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/FTX-Bankruptcy-Business-GettyImages-1245052532.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547890", "eventUri": "eng-9547890", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

It owes customers and other non-governmental creditors about US$11 billion.\n\nAlthough all debts will be paid in full, plus interest, nothing will be leftover for equity holders, according to court documents filed on Tuesday (May 7) evening in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware, where the FTX case is being handled.\n\nDepending on the type of claim they hold in the case, some creditors could recover as much as 142 per cent of what they are owed. The vast majority of customers, however, will likely get paid 118 per cent of what they had on the FTX platform the day the company entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n\nThe company, now run by restructuring advisers, has also proposed setting up a fund to pay some creditors, including those who lent FTX crypto, with money that otherwise would have gone to government regulators.\n\nPayouts are likely several months away, as FTX winds its way through the final stages of the bankruptcy case.\n\nEarlier this year, the company had about US$6.4 billion in cash. The increase is due mostly to a general spike in prices for various cryptocurrencies, including Solana, a token heavily backed by convicted fraudster and FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried. The company has also sold dozens of other assets, including various venture-capital projects such as a stake in the artificial intelligence company Anthropic.\n\nThe latest figures underscore the surprising outcome for FTX, whose collapse drew comparisons to Enron's fraud-fuelled downfall and the unravelling of Bernie Madoff's ponzi scheme.\n\nBut restructuring advisers have since been tracking down the company's assets and untangling a web of accounts scattered around the world. Those recoveries have been given a massive jolt by the crypto rebound, which has caused the price of Bitcoin to roughly quadruple since late 2022.\n\nIn a document filed on Tuesday, restructuring advisers laid out new details of their proposal to distribute the cash to creditors and end the Chapter 11 case. Known as a disclosure statement, the document is designed to help creditors vote on the proposed payout plan.\n\nUS bankruptcy judge John Dorsey will take that vote into consideration when he decides whether to approve the plan sometime later this summer.

The company has also sold dozens of other assets, including various venture-capital projects like a stake in the artificial-intelligence company Anthropic.\n\n\"In any bankruptcy, this is just an unbelievable result,\" said FTX Chief Executive Officer, John Ray, who took over the firm when it collapsed.\n\nOnce it finishes selling all of its assets, FTX will have as much as $16.3 billion in cash to distribute, according to a company statement. It owes customers and other non-governmental creditors about $11 billion.\n\nThere have only been a handful of large corporate US bankruptcies that saw creditors get all their money back in recent times. In 2021, car rental company Hertz exited bankruptcy with money left over to repay shareholders, following a strong run-up in used car prices. In 2013, American Airlines Group Inc.'s parent company also exited bankruptcy with a plan to gave a distribution to shareholders and repay unsecured creditors in full.\n\nThe latest figures underscore the surprising outcome for FTX, whose collapse drew comparisons to Enron Corp.'s fraud-fueled downfall and the unraveling of Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme. Earlier this year, the company had about $6.4 billion in cash.\n\nAlthough all debts will be paid in full, plus interest, nothing will be leftover for equity holders, according to court documents filed Tuesday evening in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware, where the FTX case is being handled.\n\nFTX's major equity holders include Sequoia Capital, Thoma Bravo, Singapore's Temasek Holdings Pte and the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan, according to a court filing last year. Individuals including Tom Brady and Gisele BA.25ndchen also hold common shares.\n\nBig recoveries\n\nThe company, now run by restructuring advisers, has also proposed setting up a fund to pay some creditors, including those who lent FTX crypto, with money that otherwise would have gone to government regulators. They've also been tracking down the company's assets and untangling a web of accounts scattered around the world.\n\nThose recoveries have been given a massive jolt by the crypto rebound, which has caused the price of Bitcoin to roughly quadruple since late 2022.\n\nDepending on the type of claim they hold in the case, some creditors could recover as much as 142 per cent of what they are owed. The vast majority of customers, however, will likely get 118 per cent of what they had on the FTX platform the day the company entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Payouts are likely several months away, as FTX winds its way through the final stages of the bankruptcy case.\n\nStill, the prospect of such huge wins are boosting the price of creditor claims. Some of which are now being traded at more than 100 per cent of their face value, according to two people familiar with the transactions. Many of those claims traded for as little as three cents on the dollar in the immediate aftermath of the bankruptcy.\n\nCash distribution\n\nIn a document filed Tuesday, restructuring advisers laid out new details of their proposal to distribute the cash to creditors and end the Chapter 11 case. Known as a disclosure statement, the document is designed to help creditors vote on the proposed payout plan.\n\nUS Bankruptcy Judge John Dorsey will take that vote into consideration when he decides whether to approve the plan sometime later this summer. Dorsey is scheduled to hold a hearing in late June on the disclosure statement and the voting procedures.\n\nFTX filed bankruptcy in November 2022 after Bankman-Fried shut down the company's crypto-trading platform and handed control to insolvency experts. Bankman-Fried was later convicted of fraud.\n\nThe case is FTX Trading Ltd., 22-11068, US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.", "source": {"uri": "gulfnews.com", "dataType": "news",

This covers about 98% of customers.\n\nFTX said that it was able to recover funds by monetizing a collection of assets that mostly consisted of proprietary investments held by the Alameda or FTX Ventures businesses, or litigation claims.\n\nFTX, which was once the third-largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, filed for bankruptcy protection in November 2022 after it experienced the crypto equivalent of a bank run.\n\nCEO and founder Sam Bankman-Fried resigned when the exchange collapsed. In March he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the massive fraud that occurred at FTX.\n\nBankman-Fried was convicted in November of fraud and conspiracy -- a dramatic fall from a crest of success that included a Super Bowl advertisement, testimony before Congress and celebrity endorsements from stars like quarterback Tom Brady, basketball point guard Stephen Curry and comedian Larry David.\n\nThe company appointed as its new CEO John Ray III, a long-time bankruptcy litigator who is best known for having to clean up the mess made after the collapse of Enron.\n\n\"We are pleased to be in a position to propose a chapter 11 plan that contemplates the return of 100% of bankruptcy claim amounts plus interest for non-governmental creditors,\" Ray said in a prepared statement.\n\nThat may be diminished consolation for investors at FTX. When the company sought bankruptcy protection in November 2022, bitcoin was going for $16,080. Prices have soared while the assets at FTX have been sorted out for the past two years. A single bitcoin on Tuesday was selling for close to $62,675. That comes out to a 290% loss, if those investors had held onto those coins.\n\nThe bankruptcy court is set to hold a hearing on June 25.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press.

Amazingly, some creditors will recover as much as 142% of what they are owed. Claims will be repaid in cash within 60 days of court approval, although payouts are likely several months away, as FTX winds its way through the final stages of the bankruptcy case.\n\nUnder the plan, other non-governmental creditors would get back 100% of their claims plus up to 9% interest to compensate them \"for the time value of their investments.\" The arrangement is still subject to approval by the Delaware bankruptcy court overseeing the bankruptcy case.\n\nAs Coindesk reports, the proposed payouts are higher than earlier estimates from the FTX estate, which said in October it expected to pay back only 90% of customer funds which still was a hefty haul for a bankruptcy where most said recoveries would be virtually nil. In January, current FTX CEO John Jay Ray III revised that estimate, telling the court he expected to be able to pay customers back in full.\n\nSo how did FTX creditors - who typically receive just pennies on the dollar for their holdings - luck out so tremendously, and most of them will actually make money following the bankruptcy? Simple: as we hinted in March, FTX has benefited from a historic rally in cryptocurrencies including Solana, a token heavily backed by convicted fraudster and FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried (in fact, some have wondered if the tremendous ascent of Solana - a B-grade token which traditionally crashes every few months, and is generally the laughing stock within the crytpo community - wasn't another market manipulation meant to generated 100%+ recoveries).\n\nOther sources of value, including investments made by FTX and Alameda Research - such as its 8% stake in AI startup Anthropic, which was sold piecemeal to institutional investors for $884 million in March - have been liquidated to generate cash to pay back the claims.\n\n\"In any bankruptcy, this is just an unbelievable result,\" said FTX Chief Executive Officer, John Ray, who took over the firm when it collapsed.\n\nIn a Tuesday press release, the FTX estate said it expects to have between $14.5 and $16.3 billion in cash available for distribution by the time a plan is approved by a Delaware bankruptcy court - the result of a year-and-a-half of scraping together the company's scattered assets around the world and liquidating them.\n\n\"As previously disclosed, FTX.com had a massive shortfall at the time of the Chapter 11 filing in November 2022 - holding only 0.1% of the Bitcon and only 1.2% of the Ethereum customers believed it held,\" the press release stated. \"Accordingly, Debtors have not been able to benefit from the appreciation of these missing tokens during these Chapter 11 cases.\"\n\nFTX's new reorganization plan would also settle a host of claims from regulators and government agencies, including the IRS and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\n\nThe IRS agreed to resolve its $24 billion in claims in return for a $200 million cash payment and a $685 million subordinated claim that will only be paid out after all creditors and other governmental entities.\n\nThe CFTC and other unnamed governmental claimants agreed to subordinate their claims as long as FTX users and investors were paid in full with interest. There are also plans for a special fund created to make \"supplemental restitution\" to certain customers and creditors, though the details of this agreement have not been finalized, according to the press release.\n\nA hearing to discuss the proposed plan is scheduled for June.\n\nFormer FTX CEO and convicted fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried previously attempted to use the estate's ability to pay back customers in full as evidence that the collapse of his exchange had \"zero\" harm to its customers. Before his sentencing in March, Bankman-Fried's lawyers argued that their client should receive a light sentence, in part because customers would get all their money back.\n\nIronically, if it hadn't been for the Terra-Luna \"stablecoin\" implosion exactly two years ago which triggered a liquidation cascade across the crypto universe including a 50% plunge in bitcoin in one month in May and June 2022, not only would FTX still be viable, but SBF would be a free man and also one of the world's richest people.\n\nRay, along with dozens of FTX creditors, wrote to the court arguing that the estate's ability to claw together enough to money pay back his victims - the result of \"tens of thousands of hours ... spent digging through the rubble of Mr. Bankman-Fried's sprawling criminal enterprise to unearth every possible dollar, token or other asset\" - doesn't mean his conduct wasn't criminal.\n\nBankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison. He plans to appeal his sentence and conviction. In retrospect, considering that those who had money in his bankrupt exchange got as much as a 42% return, he may well end up with a reduced sentence.", "source": {"uri": "zerohedge.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zero Hedge"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Bankman-Fried", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sam Bankman-Fried"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_11,_Title_11,_United_States_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solana_(blockchain_platform)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solana (blockchain platform)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alameda_Research", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alameda Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_Futures_Trading_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commodity Futures Trading Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_manipulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market manipulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidation", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liquidation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internal Revenue Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_investor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Institutional investor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_(blockchain)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terra (blockchain)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stablecoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stablecoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethereum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2024-05/SBF%20teaser%20BEST.jpg?h=1d46227f&itok=CA77YHlY", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547890", "eventUri": "eng-9547890", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

This document, known as a disclosure statement, aims to assist creditors in assessing the proposed distribution plan.\n\nFTX said that the extra billions of dollars in its cash reserves will be used to pay interest to the company's 2 million customers. This shall be a rare outcome since in most bankruptcy settlements, the creditors usually receive only pennies.\n\n\"In any bankruptcy, this is just an unbelievable result,\" said FTX Chief Executive Officer, John Ray, who took charge after the collapse in 2022. Earlier this year in January, crypto exchange FTX announced that it has started repaying its customers.\n\nAfter selling off all its assets, the company expects to have up to $16.3 billion in cash available for distribution, as per a company announcement. It has outstanding debts totaling around $11 billion owed to customers and other non-governmental creditors.\n\nDespite fulfilling all debt obligations along with interest, court documents filed on Tuesday evening in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware, indicate that there will be no residual funds for equity holders.\n\nAt the beginning of this year, the company held approximately $6.4 billion in cash. The surge in cash reserves is primarily attributed to the widespread rise in prices of various cryptocurrencies, notably Solana, a token strongly supported by FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried. Additionally, the company has divested numerous other assets, including stakes in various venture capital endeavors such as the artificial intelligence firm Anthropic.\n\nDepending on the nature of their claim in the proceedings, certain creditors stand to recover up to 142% of their owed amounts. However, most customers are expected to receive approximately 118% of their FTX platform holdings as of the day the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n\nUnder the management of restructuring advisors, the company has suggested establishing a fund to compensate select creditors, including those who extended cryptocurrency loans to FTX, utilizing funds originally allocated for government regulatory purposes.\n\nPayments are anticipated to occur several months from now as FTX progresses through the concluding phases of the bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nThe post Here's How FTX Will Use Surplus Cash to Repay Bankruptcy Victims appeared first on CoinGape.", "source": {"uri": "cryptorank.io", "dataType": "news", "title": "CryptoRank"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_11,_Title_11,_United_States_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington,_Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Bankman-Fried", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Bankman-Fried"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Venture capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Cash_Flow", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Cash Flow", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://cryptorank.io/static/logo.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547890", "eventUri": "eng-9547890", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

The company has also sold dozens of other assets, including various venture-capital projects like a stake in the artificial-intelligence company Anthropic.\n\n\"In any bankruptcy, this is just an unbelievable result,\" said FTX Chief Executive Officer, John Ray, who took over the firm when it collapsed.\n\nOnce it finishes selling all of its assets, FTX will have as much as $16.3 billion in cash to distribute, according to a company statement. It owes customers and other non-governmental creditors about $11 billion.\n\nThere have only been a handful of large corporate US bankruptcies that saw creditors get all their money back in recent times. In 2021, car rental company Hertz exited bankruptcy with money left over to repay shareholders, following a strong run-up in used car prices. In 2013, American Airlines Group Inc.'s parent company also exited bankruptcy with a plan to gave a distribution to shareholders and repay unsecured creditors in full.\n\nThe latest figures underscore the surprising outcome for FTX, whose collapse drew comparisons to Enron Corp.'s fraud-fueled downfall and the unraveling of Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme. Earlier this year, the company had about $6.4 billion in cash.\n\nAlthough all debts will be paid in full, plus interest, nothing will be leftover for equity holders, according to court documents filed Tuesday evening in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware, where the FTX case is being handled.\n\nFTX's major equity holders include Sequoia Capital, Thoma Bravo, Singapore's Temasek Holdings Pte and the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan, according to a court filing last year. Individuals including Tom Brady and Gisele B\u00fcndchen also hold common shares.\n\nBig Recoveries\n\nThe company, now run by restructuring advisers, has also proposed setting up a fund to pay some creditors, including those who lent FTX crypto, with money that otherwise would have gone to government regulators. They've also been tracking down the company's assets and untangling a web of accounts scattered around the world.\n\nThose recoveries have been given a massive jolt by the crypto rebound, which has caused the price of Bitcoin to roughly quadruple since late 2022.\n\nDepending on the type of claim they hold in the case, some creditors could recover as much as 142% of what they are owed. The vast majority of customers, however, will likely get 118% of what they had on the FTX platform the day the company entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Payouts are likely several months away, as FTX winds its way through the final stages of the bankruptcy case.\n\nStill, the prospect of such huge wins are boosting the price of creditor claims, some of which are now being traded at more than 100% of their face value, according to two people familiar with the transactions. Many of those claims traded for as little as three cents on the dollar in the immediate aftermath of the bankruptcy.\n\nCrypto's Big Revival\n\nThe rising value of claims also reflects a remarkable rebound in crypto markets. Bitcoin, for example, has rallied to above $62,000 from around $16,000 just after FTX went bankrupt.\n\nThat's fueled discontent among some creditors, who argue that they're being shortchanged even though they'll eventually recover more than the dollar value of their claims.\n\n\"In reality am only getting 25% of my Bitcoin back, and that will be over many years,\" said UK-based Arush Sehgal, a member of the FTX unsecured creditors' committee who had more than $4 million stuck on the exchange when it toppled.\n\nIn a document filed Tuesday, restructuring advisers laid out new details of their proposal to distribute the cash to creditors and end the Chapter 11 case. Known as a disclosure statement, the document is designed to help creditors vote on the proposed payout plan.\n\nUS Bankruptcy Judge John Dorsey will take that vote into consideration when he decides whether to approve the plan sometime later this summer. Dorsey is scheduled to hold a hearing in late June on the disclosure statement and the voting procedures.\n\nFTX filed bankruptcy in November 2022 after Bankman-Fried shut down the company's crypto-trading platform and handed control to insolvency experts. Bankman-Fried was later convicted of fraud.\n\nThe case is FTX Trading Ltd., 22-11068, US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.", "source": {"uri": "matzav.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Ray III, chief executive officer of FTX, whose role also serves as a chief restructuring officer.\n\nThe reorganization team's sale of many other assets held by FTX and its sister business, Alameda Research, made that strategy viable. Among these were shares in Anthropic, the artificial intelligence startup funded by Amazon, which is currently valued at close to $20 billion.\n\nAccording to FTX, the corporation has sold $900 million worth of shares this year.\n\nHowever, a few claimants are against having their cryptocurrency holdings assessed at rates starting in November 2022. Bitcoin has increased by more than 250% since then.\n\nFTX admitted that certain claimants may feel that the benefits they receive from the bankruptcy are insufficient. However, the announcement stated that at the time of its failure, FTX was thought to hold \"only 0.1% of the Bitcoin and only 1.2% of the Ethereum customers.\"\n\nFTX, which is referred to as a debtor in the bankruptcy case, has thus, \"not been able to benefit from the appreciation of these missing tokens during the chapter 11 cases,\" according to the press release.\n\n\"Instead, the debtors have had to look to other sources of recoverable value to repay creditors.\"\n\nSam Bankman-Fried, the former head of FTX, was given a 25-year prison term in March for orchestrating the scam that led to the exchange's failure.\n\nStay informed!

FTX estimated the total value of cash available for distribution to be between $14.5 billion and $16.3 billion, though the plan is still subject to court approval.\n\nThe bankrupt FTX exchange was mired in illegitimate behind-door operations by its executives, which led to a liquidity crisis and its ultimate collapse in November 2022. Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was found guilty in November 2023 on all seven criminal counts of defrauding FTX customers and investors. Bankman-Fried received a prison sentence of nearly 25 years in March.\n\nSullivan & Cromwell did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Block.", "source": {"uri": "theblock.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Block"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_hunt@theblock.co", "name": "James Hunt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debtor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Debtor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sullivan_&_Cromwell", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sullivan & Cromwell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estate_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Estate (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_J._Ray_III", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John J.

The company has also sold dozens of other assets, including various venture-capital projects like a stake in the artificial-intelligence company Anthropic.\n\n\"In any bankruptcy, this is just an unbelievable result,\" said FTX chief executive officer, John Ray, who took over the firm when it collapsed.\n\nOnce it finishes selling all of its assets, FTX will have as much as US$16.3 billion (RM77.3 billion) in cash to distribute, according to a company statement. It owes customers and other non-governmental creditors about US$11 billion.\n\nThere have only been a handful of large corporate US bankruptcies that saw creditors get all their money back in recent times. In 2021, car rental company Hertz exited bankruptcy with money left over to repay shareholders, following a strong run-up in used car prices. In 2013, American Airlines Group Inc's parent company also exited bankruptcy with a plan to give a distribution to shareholders and repay unsecured creditors in full.\n\nThe latest figures underscore the surprising outcome for FTX, whose collapse drew comparisons to Enron Corp's fraud-fueled downfall and the unravelling of Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme. Earlier this year, the company had about US$6.4 billion in cash.\n\nAlthough all debts will be paid in full, plus interest, nothing will be leftover for equity holders, according to court documents filed Tuesday evening in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware, where the FTX case is being handled.\n\nFTX's major equity holders include Sequoia Capital, Thoma Bravo, Singapore's Temasek Holdings Pte and the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan, according to a court filing last year. Individuals including Tom Brady and Gisele B\u00fcndchen also hold common shares.\n\nThe company, now run by restructuring advisers, has also proposed setting up a fund to pay some creditors, including those who lent FTX crypto, with money that otherwise would have gone to government regulators. They've also been tracking down the company's assets and untangling a web of accounts scattered around the world.\n\nThose recoveries have been given a massive jolt by the crypto rebound, which has caused the price of bitcoin to roughly quadruple since late 2022.\n\nDepending on the type of claim they hold in the case, some creditors could recover as much as 142% of what they are owed. The vast majority of customers, however, will likely get 118% of what they had on the FTX platform the day the company entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Payouts are likely several months away, as FTX winds its way through the final stages of the bankruptcy case.\n\nStill, the prospect of such huge wins are boosting the price of creditor claims. Some of which are now being traded at more than 100% of their face value, according to two people familiar with the transactions. Many of those claims traded for as little as three cents on the dollar in the immediate aftermath of the bankruptcy.\n\nIn a document filed Tuesday, restructuring advisers laid out new details of their proposal to distribute the cash to creditors and end the Chapter 11 case. Known as a disclosure statement, the document is designed to help creditors vote on the proposed payout plan.\n\nUS bankruptcy judge John Dorsey will take that vote into consideration when he decides whether to approve the plan sometime later this summer. Dorsey is scheduled to hold a hearing in late June on the disclosure statement and the voting procedures.\n\nFTX filed bankruptcy in November 2022 after Bankman-Fried shut down the company's crypto-trading platform and handed control to insolvency experts. Bankman-Fried was later convicted of fraud.\n\nThe case is FTX Trading Ltd, 22-11068, US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.", "source": {"uri": "theedgemalaysia.com", "dataType": "news",

Under a plan filed in federal bankruptcy court in Delaware, virtually all FTX's creditors, including hundreds of thousands of ordinary investors who used the exchange to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, would receive cash payments equivalent to 118 percent of the assets they had stored on FTX, the lawyers said.\n\nThose payments would flow from a pool of assets that FTX's lawyers have pulled together in the 17 months since the exchange collapsed, the lawyers said. They tapped a wide range of sources, including digital currencies FTX still owned when it filed for bankruptcy and company assets such as shares in startups, which could be sold to bidders.\n\nThe amount that FTX recovered is \"in general pretty unheard of,\" said Yesha Yadav, a law professor at Vanderbilt University. \"That's something that is really quite astonishing for a major bankruptcy.\"\n\nThe plan comes with a caveat. The amount owed to customers was calculated based on the value of their holdings at the time of FTX's bankruptcy in November 2022. That means customers won't reap the benefits of a recent surge in the crypto market that sent the price of bitcoin to a record high. A customer who lost one bitcoin when FTX imploded, for example, would be entitled to less than $20,000, even though a Bitcoin is now worth more than $60,000.\n\nIt will take months for the payouts to begin. The plan must be approved by the federal judge overseeing FTX's bankruptcy, John T. Dorsey. If creditors raise any objections to the plan, that could extend the timeline.\n\n\"The timing of recovery is still a big question mark,\" said Matthew Sedigh, the CEO of Xclaim, a platform for creditors to trade bankruptcy claims. \"Even if the recovery amount is better than expected, collecting these amounts two years from now is kind of a slap in the face.\"\n\nStill, it seemed unlikely that customers would get their money back when FTX collapsed. Before its implosion, customers used the exchange as a marketplace to buy and sell digital currencies and stored billions of dollars in crypto on the platform.\n\nAfter FTX failed, its founder and CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, stepped down, handing control to John J. Ray III, a veteran of corporate turnarounds who oversaw the unwinding of Enron, the energy company that collapsed in 2001.\n\nBankman-Fried was later convicted of a sweeping fraud in which he siphoned billions of dollars in FTX customer savings to finance venture investments, political donations, and other spending. He was sentenced to 25 years in prison in March.\n\nAfter he took over, Ray described the cryptocurrency exchange as the biggest mess he had ever seen. Over the next few months, he and his team began the painstaking process of tracking down the missing assets.\n\nSome of the recoveries stemmed from successful investments that Bankman-Fried made during his FTX tenure. In 2021, the company had put $500 million into the artificial intelligence company Anthropic. A boom in the AI industry made those shares much more valuable. This year, Ray's team sold about two-thirds of FTX's stake in Anthropic for $884 million.\n\nFTX also reached a deal to recoup more than $400 million from Modulo Capital, a hedge fund that Bankman-Fried had financed. And lawyers for FTX filed lawsuits to claw back funds from former company executives and others, including Bankman-Fried's parents.\n\nCrypto experts have for months expected significant recoveries in the FTX bankruptcy for months. Some opportunistic investors have bought bankruptcy claims from the exchange's customers for pennies on the dollar, hoping to profit when the payouts begin. And when he was sentenced, Bankman-Fried's lawyers said he should receive a lighter punishment because FTX's customers were likely to get their deposits back. A judge rejected that argument.\n\nThe speed of the recoveries in the FTX case is unusual for a bankruptcy. In the Enron case, for example, it took about three years for a bankruptcy plan to be approved and many more years for funds to be distributed to creditors, the FTX lawyers wrote in the court filing Tuesday.\n\nThe FTX bankruptcy has \"proceeded with remarkable alacrity given the challenges faced,\" the filing said.\n\nThe bankruptcy has also been highly profitable for the lawyers working on it. As of last fall, the law firm Sullivan & Cromwell and other experts overseeing the FTX case had charged more than $320 million in fees.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Digital currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanderbilt_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vanderbilt University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_bankruptcy_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States bankruptcy court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_J._Ray_III", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John J.

The document also stated that after settling claims in full, any remaining funds would be used for supplemental interest payments to creditors at a rate of 9%.\n\nHowever, this may offer little comfort to those who were trading cryptocurrency on the platform when it went under. At the time of FTX's bankruptcy protection filing in November 2022, bitcoin was valued at $16,080.\n\nSince then, crypto prices have skyrocketed as the economy recovered and FTX's assets were sorted out over the past two years. On Tuesday, a single bitcoin was selling for close to $62,675, representing a 290% loss for those investors, slightly less if accrued interest is taken into account.\n\nAccording to the plan filed with the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, customers and creditors claiming $50,000 or less will receive about 118% of their claim. This covers roughly 98% of FTX customers. FTX has managed to recover funds by capitalising on a collection of assets primarily comprising proprietary investments held by Alameda or FTX Ventures businesses, or litigation claims.\n\nThe company filed for bankruptcy protection in November 2022 following a crypto equivalent of a bank run. Sam Bankman-Fried, the chief executive and founder, stepped down when the exchange collapsed.\n\nIn March, he was handed a 25-year prison sentence for the massive fraud that took place at FTX. Bankman-Fried was found guilty of fraud and conspiracy in November - a stark contrast from his previous successes, which included a Super Bowl advertisement, congressional testimony, and celebrity endorsements from stars like Tom Brady, Stephen Curry, and Larry David.\n\nJohn Ray III, a seasoned bankruptcy litigator renowned for cleaning up the mess left by Enron's collapse, was appointed as the new chief executive. \"We are pleased to be in a position to propose a chapter 11 plan that contemplates the return of 100% of bankruptcy claim amounts plus interest for non-governmental creditors,\" Ray stated in a prepared statement.\n\nAlthough FTX technically remains a company, its future is uncertain. In early 2023, Ray announced the formation of a task force to explore the possibility of reviving FTX.com, the crypto exchange. The grim details of a company gone rogue, revealed after its assets were seized, would cripple almost any business trying to make a comeback, but the rules might be different for cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nBinance, a rival crypto exchange, briefly considered acquiring FTX before it collapsed in late 2022. Its founder and former chief executive, Changpeng Zhao, was sentenced last week to four months in prison for turning a blind eye as criminals used the platform to launder money linked to child sex abuse, drug trafficking and terrorism.\n\nDespite this, Binance remains the largest crypto exchange globally. A bankruptcy court hearing is scheduled for June 25 to discuss the distribution of FTX's assets.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lawrence_matheson@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Lawrence Matheson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Bankman-Fried", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Bankman-Fried"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changpeng_Zhao", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Changpeng Zhao"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binance", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Binance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Enron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_David", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Larry David"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_11,_Title_11,_United_States_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Money laundering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Child sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32764457.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS283090339.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547890", "eventUri": "eng-9547890", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-25", "textStart": 3343, "textEnd": 3350}], "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

The creditors alleged that S&C took an active part in the \"FTX Group's multibillion-dollar fraud,\" claiming the firm benefited financially from FTX's fraud, a court filing on Feb. 16:\n\n\"S&C knew of FTX US and FTX Trading Ltd.'s omissions, untruthful and fraudulent conduct, and misappropriation of Class Members' funds. Despite this knowledge, S&C stood to gain financially from the FTX Group's misconduct and so agreed, at least impliedly, to assist that unlawful conduct for its own gain.\"\n\nSullivan & Cromwell is the century-old law firm overseeing the FTX bankruptcy proceedings. Previously, the firm reportedly served as outside counsel to the exchange in several deals, including FTX's bid for the assets of Voyager Digital and its acquisition of LedgerX, receiving significant payments for its services.\n\nFTX owed up to $1.45 billion in legal bankruptcy fees to the S&C law firm, according to compensation filings from December 2023.\n\nFTX's new plan caused widespread outrage among crypto investors, mainly due to the exculpatory clause, which could prompt creditors to vote no, including pseudonymous FTX creditor Rob, who is also the head of growth at Paradex. In a May 8 X post, Rob wrote:\n\n\"Icing on the cake from the team that destroyed billions of potential value for FTX customers. This can't be allowed. I'm voting NO on this plan.\"\n\nWhile FTX debtors said they would give over 98% of creditors an 11% payout, plus \"billions in compensation\" to the rest, some don't consider this unfair, considering that debtors are compensating holders based on a $16,800 Bitcoin (BTC) price, which has appreciated significantly since the collapse.\n\nNone of the FTX creditors will accept this compensation structure, according to Mike Belshe, the CEO of BitGo, who wrote in a May 8 X post:\n\n\"0% of FTX creditors agree that receiving $16800 for your bitcoin is fully compensated.

success that included a Super Bowl advertisement, testimony before Congress and celebrity endorsements from stars like quarterback Tom Brady, basketball point guard Stephen Curry and comedian Larry David.\n\nThe company appointed as its new CEO John Ray III, a long-time bankruptcy litigator who is best known for having to clean up the mess made after the collapse of Enron.\n\n\"We are pleased to

In a recent court filing, FTX disclosed it owes creditors approximately $11.2 billion, but has between $14.5 billion and $16.3 billion available for distribution.\n\nAccording to the documents submitted to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, the plan not only covers full claims but also includes supplemental interest payments at a rate of 9%, assuming residual funds are available. This partial compensation might offer little solace to investors who suffered significant losses during the exchange's collapse. When FTX filed for bankruptcy in November 2022, Bitcoin was valued at around $16,080. Since then, the price of Bitcoin has escalated to approximately $62,675, representing a substantial potential loss for those who might have retained their cryptocurrency investments.\n\nUnder the proposed plan, customers and creditors with claims up to $50,000 are set to receive about 118% of their claim value, covering nearly 98% of FTX customers. The ability to settle these claims comes from the successful liquidation of assets primarily associated with Alameda Research or FTX Ventures, as well as through litigation claims.\n\nAt its peak, FTX was the third-largest global cryptocurrency exchange. Its rapid downfall began with a financial crisis akin to a bank run, leading to bankruptcy filings in November 2022. Following the collapse, FTX's founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried stepped down and was later sentenced to 25 years in prison in March for his role in the massive fraud at FTX.\n\nThe aftermath of the scandal also brought down several high-profile endorsements, including those from celebrities like Tom Brady and Stephen Curry. John Ray III, known for his work in the Enron bankruptcy, has since taken over as CEO of FTX, announcing plans to potentially revive the FTX.com exchange amidst exploring other strategic options.\n\nDespite the controversy, FTX's new management remains optimistic, with Ray expressing satisfaction over the proposed chapter 11 plan that would fully satisfy non-governmental creditor claims with additional interest.\n\nMeanwhile, the saga of crypto mismanagement extends to Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange, whose former CEO Changpeng Zhao was recently sentenced to prison for allowing illicit activities through the platform. Binance had considered purchasing FTX just before its 2022 collapse but withdrew amid emerging financial issues.\n\nThe bankruptcy court is scheduled to review the FTX asset distribution plan on June 25, potentially turning a new page for the beleaguered exchange.", "source": {"uri": "cryptocurrencynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Crypto Currency News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy_of_FTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy of FTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alameda_Research", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alameda Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidation", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liquidation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Bankman-Fried", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Bankman-Fried"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changpeng_Zhao", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Changpeng Zhao"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binance", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Binance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron_scandal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Enron scandal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_11,_Title_11,_United_States_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://cryptocurrencynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/6902-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547890", "eventUri": "eng-9547890", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-25", "textStart": 2631, "textEnd": 2638}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

The vast majority of customers are set to get their money back with interest, though they (and the debtors) missed out on major gains in the crypto market since FTX's dramatic collapse in November 2022 -- the price of Bitcoin has more than tripled since then.\n\nFTX aims to fully pay back non-governmental creditors based on the value of their claims as determined by the bankruptcy court. That means 98 percent of creditors (those who have up to $50,000 in claims) will get 118 percent of the amount of their allowed claims. Other creditors will get their money back, plus what billions of dollars in compensation \"for the time value of their investments.\"\n\nGovernment creditors are in line for payouts with a nine percent interest rate. The Internal Revenue Service and Department of Justice are among the stakeholders with which FTX has agreed settlements.\n\nThe company suggests that, if its plan of reorganization is rubber stamped, it would be able to resolve disputes with private and government stakeholders \"without costly and protracted litigation.\" All told, FTX says that it will be able to distribute between $14.5 billion and $16.3 billion in cash.\n\nBut, you may be wondering, where exactly is all this money coming from? After all, when FTX 17 months ago, it held just 0.1 percent of the Bitcoin and 1.2 percent of the Ethereum that its customers thought it had.\n\nFTX said it was able to monetize \"an extraordinarily diverse collection of assets, most of which were proprietary investments held by the Alamedaor FTX Ventures businesses, or litigation claims.\" As TechCrunch reports, the assets that FTX CEO John J.

This document, known as a disclosure statement, aims to assist creditors in assessing the proposed distribution plan.\n\nFTX said that the extra billions of dollars in its cash reserves will be used to pay interest to the company's 2 million customers. This shall be a rare outcome since in most bankruptcy settlements, the creditors usually receive only pennies.\n\n\"In any bankruptcy, this is just an unbelievable result,\" said FTX Chief Executive Officer, John Ray, who took charge after the collapse in 2022. Earlier this year in January, crypto exchange FTX announced that it has started repaying its customers.\n\nAfter selling off all its assets, the company expects to have up to $16.3 billion in cash available for distribution, as per a company announcement. It has outstanding debts totaling around $11 billion owed to customers and other non-governmental creditors.\n\nDespite fulfilling all debt obligations along with interest, court documents filed on Tuesday evening in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware, indicate that there will be no residual funds for equity holders.\n\nAt the beginning of this year, the company held approximately $6.4 billion in cash. The surge in cash reserves is primarily attributed to the widespread rise in prices of various cryptocurrencies, notably Solana, a token strongly supported by FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried.

CEO John Ray III says bankrupt crypto exchange FTX will be able to fully repay creditors $11bn\n\nThe saga of the bankrupt crypto exchange FTX took a fresh turn this week, with some welcome news for creditors.\n\nThe Guardian reported that John Ray III, a turnaround specialist who succeeded the disgraced Sam Bankman-Fried as the chief executive of FTX shortly after its collapse, has confirmed that once FTX has sold off remaining assets, it will have more than the amount required to pay off its creditors.\n\nFTX said it will be able to repay creditors the full $11bn (\u00a38.8bn) it owes.\n\nFTX Chapter 11\n\nFTX in January had abandoned efforts to restart its crypto exchange, instead opting to liquidate all assets and return funds to customers.\n\nFTX had collapsed into Chapter 11 in November 2022 after a multi billion dollar hole was found in its balance sheet.\n\nAt the time of filing for Chapter 11, Bankman-Fried stepped down and was replaced by new CEO John J. Ray III.\n\nRay is an experienced operator, having overseen some of the biggest bankruptcies in corporate history, including the collapse of the energy giant Enron.\n\nIn total Ray has 40 years of experience in restructuring companies, and he had promised to work with federal regulators to investigate FTX founder Bankman-Fried.\n\nAnd he had pulled no punches in his initial assessment of FTX and Bankman-Fried, saying he had never seen anything as bad as FTX.\n\n\"Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here,\" Ray wrote in a filing with the Delaware bankruptcy court.\n\n\"From compromised systems integrity and faulty regulatory oversight abroad, to the concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of inexperienced, unsophisticated and potentially compromised individuals, this situation is unprecedented.\"\n\nJohn Ray has previously said his top priority was the recovery of assets to repay FTX customers, and last year he once again slammed Sam Bankman-Fried in a debtors report, and said the collapse of FTX was due to \"hubris, incompetence, and greed\".\n\nAsset recovery\n\nJohn Ray said that once the exchange had sold off its remaining assets, it might have more than $16bn - well in excess of its debts.\n\n\"We are pleased to be in a position to propose a chapter 11 plan that contemplates the return of 100% of bankruptcy claim amounts plus interest for non-governmental creditors,\" the bankruptcy expert was quoted as saying by the Guardian newspaper.\n\nFTX has reportedly been helped by the fact its debts are denominated in dollar terms, while many of its assets are highly speculative digital commodities and stakes in high-growth startups. At the time of FTX's collapse, in November 2022, one bitcoin was worth about $20,000; now it sells for more than triple that.\n\nThe Guardian also noted that FTX has been helped by its large stake in the artificial intelligence startup Anthropic.\n\nThe exchange reportedly sold that stake in March this year, for $824m.\n\nOn 28 March 2024 Bankman-Fried had been sentenced to 25 years in prison for masterminding a $8 billion fraud at the now-bankrupt FTX cryptocurrency exchange he had founded.\n\nIn April Bankman-Fried launched his appeal against that prison sentence.\n\nThe Guardian noted that the FTX recovery plan still requires approval from the courts before funds can be distributed to former depositors.\n\nRead also : Binance's Changpeng Zhao Sentenced To Four Months In Prison", "source": {"uri": "silicon.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Silicon UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_jowitt@silicon.co.uk", "name": "Tom Jowitt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_11,_Title_11,_United_States_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Bankman-Fried", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Bankman-Fried"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Balance sheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_J._Ray_III", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John J.

The filing specifies that the location of the assets at the time is irrelevant: the plan aims to distribute the total value wherever it may have been held.\n\nAccording to its May 7 press release, FTX's recovery plan hinges on monetizing \"an extraordinarily diverse collection of assets.\" This includes proprietary investments held by its affiliated businesses, such as Alameda Research and FTX Ventures, as well as assets under the control of the liquidators of FTX Digital Markets in the Bahamas, the Securities Commission of The Bahamas, the liquidators of FTX's Australian division, and the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nThe plan proposes full repayment to non-governmental creditors based on the value of their claims as determined by the court. Additionally, FTX proposes interest payments of up to 9% per year, calculated from the date FTX filed for bankruptcy.\n\nBut according to calculations, When FTX collapsed in November 2022, bitcoin was priced at around $16,080. Since then, crypto prices have risen substantially, with the price now closer to $62,675. Overall, that equals a loss of around 290%. Due to this, some creditor representatives called against the compensation plan.\n\nFTX also outlines a subordination arrangement for governmental creditors like the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission, ensuring they are paid only after non-governmental creditors receive full repayment with interest.\n\nMoreover, the plan incorporates specific agreements to resolve substantial claims, such as the $24 billion in IRS claims settled for a $200 million cash payment and a $685 million subordinated claim. It also suggests potential agreements where some government entities might contribute recoveries on their claims to a \"'Supplemental Remission Fund\" for further distribution to certain customers and creditors.\n\nThe plan establishes a \"convenience class\" for about 98% of FTX's creditors. Those with claims of $50,000 or less would receive up to 118% of their claims (original loss plus 2 years interest at 9%) within 60 days following the Delaware Bankruptcy Court's approval.\n\nJohn J. Ray III, the CEO and Chief Restructuring Officer of FTX, praised the effort and cooperation from governmental and private stakeholders, which has been crucial in reaching this stage of the reorganization process.\n\nAt the end of March, Samuel Bankman-Fried (SBF), the former CEO of FTX, was sentenced to 25 years in prison by a New York court after being found guilty of fraud and related charges. On April 22, SBF reportedly reached a deal with a group of investors to help them in a legal fight against celebrity promoters who endorsed FTX and, in exchange, have the charges against him dropped in another class-action lawsuit.", "source": {"uri": "cryptodaily.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "cryptodaily.co.uk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidator_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Liquidator (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bahamas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alameda_Research", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alameda Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy_of_FTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy of FTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_Futures_Trading_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commodity Futures Trading Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internal Revenue Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_J._Ray_III", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John J.

After selling assets, they have $16.3bn\n\nFTX filed for bankruptcy in November 2022 after Bankman-Fried shut down the company's crypto-trading platform and handed control to insolvency experts. Bankman-Fried was later convicted of fraud and sentenced to 25 years.\n\nOnce it finishes selling assets, FTX will have as much as $16.3bn (\u20ac15.2bn) in cash to distribute, according to a company statement.

The vast majority of customers, however, will likely get 118pc of what they had on the FTX platform the day the company entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n\nPayouts are probably several months away, as FTX winds its way through the final stages of the bankruptcy case.", "source": {"uri": "independent.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solana_(blockchain_platform)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solana (blockchain platform)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Bankman-Fried", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Bankman-Fried"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Venture capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy_of_FTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy of FTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hertz_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Hertz Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Group", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Airlines Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insolvency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insolvency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Madoff", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bernie Madoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario_Teachers'_Pension_Plan", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequoia_Capital", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sequoia Capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Enron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_11,_Title_11,_United_States_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponzi_scheme", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ponzi scheme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temasek_Holdings", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Temasek Holdings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington,_Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Cash_Flow", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Cash Flow", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://www.independent.ie/extra/assets/img/dummy-social.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547890", "eventUri": "eng-9547890", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

Other non-governmental creditors would receive 100% of their claims plus up to 9% interest to account for the time value of their investments.\n\nMeanwhile, provisions exist to settle claims with regulatory bodies such as the IRS and CFTC.

(Leon Neal/Getty Images)\n\nLawyers for defunct cryptocurrency exchange FTX proposed a plan on Tuesday that would return all invested money to customers within 60 days of the plan's effective date, including interest of up to 18 percent on the funds.\n\nDespite only a small part of the money being present when massive fraud was discovered at FTX in November 2022, company executives were able to collect more than $16 billion in assets from businesses related to FTX, including Alameda Ventures, a crypto hedge fund, which was also owned by FTX owner Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\n\"FTX has achieved this recovery level by monetizing an extraordinarily diverse collection of assets, most of which were proprietary investments held by the Alameda or FTX Ventures businesses, or litigation claims,\" the plan announcement, which was jointly signed by the law firms Sullivan & Cromwell, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan and Landis Rath & Cobb, which all represent FTX debtors, read.\n\nInvestors who invested $50,000 or less in FTX will receive 118 percent of their initial investment within 60 days, while larger investors will receive their money back plus 9 percent.\n\nAbout 98 percent of creditors have claims of under $50,000.\n\nFTX estimated that the total owed to creditors was around $11.2 billion, several billion dollars less than its assets.\n\nThe assets have been frozen since FTX collapsed 17 months ago, leaving customers in the lurch.\n\nWhile 18 percent interest may seem like a lot, bitcoin has appreciated more than nearly 400 percent in that time period, going from just over $16,000 in November 2022 to $62,597 at press time.\n\nSome customers have also objected to their money being \"dollarized\" due to the scrutiny that comes from the IRS and other government institutions and the potential to trigger capital gains taxes.\n\nA big reason people hold cryptocurrency is that they can do so without paying taxes as long as it is not converted to dollars.\n\nAlthough the company filed for reorganization, the exchange was permanently shut down, and FTX is liquidating assets to distribute them.\n\nThe plan, which needs to be approved by the bankruptcy court, rests on several agreements made with the IRS and other agencies to subordinate their claims to a lower priority than returning money to customers.\n\nThe IRS claimed $24 billion in unpaid taxes and fines prior to the bankruptcy filings, but it settled for a $200 million cash payment and a $685 million subordinated claim below all creditors and other government entities.\n\nThe agency will also subordinate future tax claims.\n\nOther agencies, including the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Department of Justice, have also subordinated their claims for fees and administrative expenses until creditors are paid.\n\nThe plan also includes a previously approved settlement with BlockFi, FTX's largest creditor. Under the settlement, BlockFi agreed to accept $250 million upfront and up to $689 million after all other creditors were paid.\n\nCryptocurrency had been steadily appreciating until 2021, when inflation and rising interest rates led to more people withdrawing their money from cryptocurrencies.\n\nBitcoin bottomed out at just over $16,000 around the time of FTX's collapse, which had a ripple effect on other cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nFTX founder and CEO at the time of the collapse, Mr. Bankman-Fried, was convicted of fraud and conspiracy to launder money. He is serving a 25-year prison sentence on the charges.\n\nHe could have faced 100 years in prison, effectively a life sentence.\n\nMr. Bankman-Fried showed little remorse for his actions and claimed before sentencing that all investors would be repaid.", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Bankman-Fried", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Bankman-Fried"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sullivan_&_Cromwell", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sullivan & Cromwell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_firm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law firm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internal Revenue Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hedge fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_gains_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Capital gains tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlockFi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BlockFi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://i.ntd.com/assets/uploads/2022/12/FTX-1200x630.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547890", "eventUri": "eng-9547890", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2010-11-", "textStart": 70, "textEnd": 77}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

Here's why", "body": "Sam Bankman-Fried is serving 25 years in prison for defrauding customers and investors. Image Credit: AP\n\nFTX, the cryptocurrency exchange that went bankrupt, announced plans to repay all its creditors, totalling $11 billion, thanks to a surge in bitcoin prices. John Ray III, the new CEO, took over after the previous leader's disgrace.\n\nFTX unveiled its bankruptcy plan on Tuesday, outlining a route to complete repayment, with interest, for nearly all creditors. This feat, FTX claims, is achievable through the liquidation of multi-billion-dollar investments made by its venture capital arm, FTX Ventures, and its affiliate, Alameda Research.\n\nHow FTX plans to repay its users\n\nThe proposed plan also includes an agreement with US government entities, such as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), to temporarily halt substantial claims against FTX until creditors are satisfied. As part of the settlement, the IRS will receive a $200 million upfront payment.\n\nRay is optimistic that after selling off assets, FTX might have over $16 billion, which would be more than its debts. He also expressed that the team handling the bankruptcy is satisfied in proposing a plan to return 100 per cent of the owed amounts along with interest to creditors.\n\nThe company's debts are in dollars, while its assets include speculative digital commodities and stakes in startups. When FTX collapsed in 2022, bitcoin was around $20,000; now, it's more than tripled.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, creditors, mostly former platform users will receive their lost funds. However, they might rue selling their cryptocurrencies at low prices and missing out on recent gains.\n\n'A thief who took his loot to Las Vegas...'\n\nDuring his trial, Bankman-Fried argued that the expected repayment should lessen his sentence. However, Judge Lewis Kaplan dismissed it, calling Bank-Fried's appeal as \"misleading, logically flawed and speculative\".\n\nHe went on to say: \"A thief who takes his loot to Las Vegas and successfully bets the stolen money isn't entitled to a reduction of his sentence.\"\n\nFTX's stake in Anthropic, an AI startup, also aided its recovery. The exchange sold this stake for $824 million. Meanwhile, the company's former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, is serving a 25-year jail term for his part in the company's fraudulent collapse.\n\nCreditors of the bankrupt crypto exchange FTX aren't happy with the plan offered to recover their lost money. Even though the plan promises that creditors will receive 118 per cent of the money they had invested, which they say is not as good as it sounds. This gives them a return of 18 per cent. They argue that the calculation is misleading and unfair.\n\nWhy former users are not happy with the settlement offer\n\nFTX creditors, about 1,600 of them, formed a group to vote on the plan. Leaders Sunil Kavuri and Arush Sehgal will encourage others to reject it. They claim the plan doesn't accurately assess the value of their crypto assets, which have grown since FTX went bust.\n\nThe proposed plan promises full repayment, plus interest, thanks to selling off investments by FTX's related companies. US government agencies agreed to hold off on their claims until creditors are paid, with the IRS getting an upfront payment.\n\nHowever, the leading creditors who had invested the most in the platform, don't trust the plan. They fear it undervalues their claims and leaves them vulnerable. The creditors also believe that the way the plan has been worded, allows the company to go back on its word and refuse to honour its obligation, by citing banal reasons.\n\nThey also worry about losing their ability to pursue other legal actions against parties like law firms linked to FTX who covered their shenanigans.\n\nFTX creditors feel the proposed plan isn't fair or trustworthy. They believe it could leave them shortchanged and without legal recourse in the future.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Bankman-Fried", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sam Bankman-Fried"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Internal Revenue Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alameda_Research", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alameda Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_Futures_Trading_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commodity Futures Trading Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Venture capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidation", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liquidation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Futures contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commodity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2024/05/Bankrupt-FTX-plans-to-pay-creditors-11bn-but-investors-feel-insulted-by-the-offer.-Heres-why-2024-05-b2cf3193afcf1fbd76e03f864df77cde-1200x675.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547890", "eventUri": "eng-9547890", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

It owes customers and other non-governmental creditors about $11 billion.\n\nAlthough all debts will be paid in full, plus interest, nothing will be leftover for equity holders, according to court documents filed Tuesday evening in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware, where the FTX case is being handled.\n\nDepending on the type of claim they hold in the case, some creditors could recover as much as 142% of what they are owed. The vast majority of customers, however, will likely get paid 118% of what they had on the FTX platform the day the company entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n\nThe company, now run by restructuring advisers, has also proposed setting up a fund to pay some creditors, including those who lent FTX crypto, with money that otherwise would have gone to government regulators.\n\nPayouts are likely several months away, as FTX winds its way through the final stages of the bankruptcy case.\n\nEarlier this year, the company had about $6.4 billion in cash. The increase is due mostly to a general spike in prices for various cryptocurrencies, including Solana, a token heavily backed by convicted fraudster and FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried. The company has also sold dozens other assets, including various venture-capital projects like a stake in the artificial-intelligence company Anthropic.\n\nThe latest figures underscore the surprising outcome for FTX, whose collapse drew comparisons to Enron Corp.'s fraud-fueled downfall and the unraveling of Bernie Madoff's ponzi scheme.\n\nBut restructuring advisers have since been tracking down the company's assets and untangling a web of accounts scattered around the world. Those recoveries have been given a massive jolt by the crypto rebound, which has caused the price of Bitcoin to roughly quadruple since late 2022.\n\nIn a document filed Tuesday, restructuring advisers laid out new details of their proposal to distribute the cash to creditors and end the Chapter 11 case. Known as a disclosure statement, the document is designed to help creditors vote on the proposed payout plan.\n\nUS Bankruptcy Judge John Dorsey will take that vote into consideration when he decides whether to approve the plan sometime later this summer. Dorsey is scheduled to hold a hearing in late June on the disclosure statement and the voting procedures.\n\nFTX filed bankruptcy in November 2022 after Bankman-Fried shut down the company's crypto-trading platform and handed control to insolvency experts. Bankman-Fried was later convicted of fraud.\n\nThe case is FTX Trading Ltd., 22-11068, US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.\n\n(Updates with estimate that equity will be out of the money in the fourth paragraph)", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

SBF was hit with a 25-year prison sentence in March, and ordered to pay $11 billion in forfeiture, though the crypto mogul filed an appeal last month which could last years.\n\nAfter filing for bankruptcy in late 2022, SBF stood down and U.S. attorney John J. Ray III was brought in as CEO and \"chief restructuring officer,\" charged with overseeing FTX's reorganization. Shortly after taking over, Ray said in testimony that despite some of the audits that had been done previously at FTX, he didn't \"trust a single piece of paper in this organization.\" In the months that followed, Ray and his team set about tracking the missing funds, with some $8 billion placed in real estate, political donations, and VC investments -- including a $500 million investment in AI company Anthropic before the generative AI boom, which the FTX estate managed to sell earlier this year for $884 million.\n\nInitially, it seemed unlikely that investors would recoup much, if any, of their money, but signs in recent months suggested that good news might be on the horizon, with progress made on clawing back cash via various investments FTX had made, as well as from executives involved with the company.\n\nWe now know that 98% of FTX creditors will receive 118% of the value of their FTX-stored assets in cash, while the other creditors will receive 100% -- plus \"billions in compensation for the time value of their investments,\" according to a press release issued by the FTX estate today.\n\nIn total, FTX says that it will be able to distribute between $14.5 and $16.3 billion in cash, which includes assets currently under control of entities including chapter 11 debtors, liquidators, the Securities Commission of The Bahamas, the United States Department of Justice, among various other parties.\n\nWhile the reorganization plan will need approval from the relevant bankruptcy court, the intention, they say, is to resolve all ongoing disputes with stakeholders and government, \"without costly and protracted litigation.\"\n\nIt is worth noting here that creditors won't benefit from the Bitcoin boom that has emerged from the crypto industry since FTX went belly-up.

The bankruptcy process gave FTX the time it needed to find buyers and fill in the nearly $9 billion balance-sheet hole it entered chapter 11 with.\n\nIf approved in court, the repayment plan would make FTX the rare case of financial fraud that compensates its victims in full, and relatively quickly. By way of comparison, account holders at Bernard Madoff's firm have waited more than a decade and a half for their stolen money to trickle back after his 2008 arrest for operating a Ponzi scheme.\n\nAside from FTX's millions of individual customers, some of Wall Street's biggest investment firms are among the winners. They bet that, when FTX filed for bankruptcy, many of its customers would want to -- or need to -- cash out their claims against the exchange rather than wait years to see how much they might recover.\n\nAsset managers including Oaktree Capital Management, Attestor, Canyon Capital, Farallon Capital Management and Silver Point Capital hold more than $3 billion in customer claims they bought, court filings show. The firms didn't return requests for comment.\n\nSoon after FTX filed for bankruptcy, customer claims could be purchased for as little as 3 cents on the dollar, said Thomas Braziel, an investor in distressed debt and crypto assets whose firm has bought claims from FTX customers. Customers who sold their claims for pennies on the dollar may have seller's remorse. FTX said Tuesday that 98% of its users are now expected to recover 118% of their account balances.\n\n\"This is historic,\" Braziel said. \"That's got to be the highest return of all time\" for creditors in a bankruptcy.\n\nFTX previously said it would be able to pay its millions of users more or less in full for the amounts they had in their crypto trading accounts when the company filed for chapter 11. On Tuesday, it said it wouldn't only cover those account balances in full but also would pay 9% interest to most users, dating back to the bankruptcy filing.\n\nU.S. prosecutors called FTX a massive fraud and charged Bankman-Fried and other former executives with fraud. Bankman-Fried was sentenced in March to 25 years in prison for stealing billions of dollars from customers. The bankruptcy plan filed Tuesday marks the first time FTX confirmed it expects users to recover their funds in full.\n\nDriving the turnaround in users' fortunes was a rebound in cryptocurrency prices. A large portion of FTX's assets are tied to the volatile market for digital assets, many of which have risen in value since the bankruptcy filing -- especially solana, a token closely tied to Bankman-Fried that has multiplied sevenfold since the bankruptcy filing.\n\nSome customers have complained, however, that they're being repaid in cash -- not the crypto they deposited -- based on the values in their frozen FTX accounts. That means they have missed out on the asset appreciation in cryptocurrencies as prices roared back after 2022's meltdown.\n\nSaul Ewing bankruptcy lawyer Candice Kline said being paid in full in bankruptcy differs from being made whole in an economic sense.\n\n\"Actual market value, time value of money beyond some interest, and opportunity cost will still hound creditors digesting this good news,\" she said.\n\nIn addition to the recent bull run in prices of bitcoin, ether and solana, customers and investors can thank the rising value of FTX's venture-capital investments and its success in finding and clawing back assets that were transferred out of the company shortly before its bankruptcy filing, said Erin Broderick, a lawyer for a group of FTX claim holders. For instance, FTX sold most of its stake in Anthropic, an artificial intelligence startup backed by Google and Amazon.com, for $884 million this year -- 267% above the original purchase price.\n\nBrigham Young University law professor Brook Gotberg said valuing claims in bankruptcy isn't always straightforward, and that it depends on what type of relationship a company has with its customers.\n\n\"If the claim is just for the dollar value of the cryptocurrency at the time of the bankruptcy filing, then the FTX creditors will be paid in full,\" she said. \"If the claim is for the cryptocurrency itself, then the FTX creditors aren't getting their full value.\"\n\nHolders of FTX's proprietary FTT token -- another Bankman-Fried creation -- won't receive anything under FTX's plan. Nor will the exchange's equity owners -- which include Sequoia Capital, the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan and SoftBank Group -- and FTX's various celebrity backers who include NFL quarterback Tom Brady and model Gisele B\u00fcndchen.\n\nUnder Bankman-Fried's leadership, the company spent customer money on \"bad or illiquid investments, vanity projects, celebrity endorsements, political donations, and lavish personal expenditures,\" FTX's court papers said on Tuesday. Hard assets recovered for customers since the bankruptcy include luxury real estate in FTX's former home of the Bahamas as well as two private jets. The company explored, then abandoned, plans to reboot its crypto exchange.\n\nProsecutors said Bankman-Fried's theft of customer funds caused $10 billion in losses, drawing comparisons to Madoff. After FTX's bankruptcy, Bankman-Fried argued that customers could be made whole. Ahead of his sentencing, Bankman-Fried claimed that FTX was \"solvent at the time of the bankruptcy petition\" and that \"the harm to customers, lenders and investors is zero\" because of the likely outcome of FTX's chapter 11 case.\n\nJohn J. Ray III, the turnaround specialist who assumed control of FTX from Bankman-Fried, said in response that the company's asset-recovery effort since 2022 \"does not mean that things were not stolen.\"\n\n\"What it means is that we got some of them back,\" Ray said in a March filing in Bankman-Fried's criminal case. \"And there are plenty of things we did not get back.\"\n\nU.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan said that whether customers recovered their money didn't weigh into his sentencing decision for Bankman-Fried, who has appealed his conviction and sentence.\n\nWrite to Becky Yerak at becky.yerak@wsj.com, Soma Biswas at soma.biswas@wsj.com and Andrew Scurria at Andrew.Scurria@wsj.com", "source": {"uri": "livemint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy_of_FTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy of FTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_11,_Title_11,_United_States_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Bankman-Fried", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Bankman-Fried"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Investment company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponzi_scheme", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ponzi scheme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asset management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Balance sheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Madoff", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bernie Madoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farallon_Capital", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Farallon Capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distressed_securities", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Distressed securities"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oaktree_Capital_Management", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oaktree Capital Management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_J._Ray_III", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John J.

Early in 2023, Ray established a task committee to explore the possibility of reviving FTX.com, the crypto exchange. On Tuesday, FTX reported that it had recovered $14.5 billion to $16.3 billion in collapsed exchange assets.\n\nFTX expects 98% of its creditors to get 118% of their permitted claims pending clearance from the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District Court of Delaware, per CNN.\n\nDespite the asset seizure and mismanagement disclosures, rebuilding FTX has many of the same obstacles as any company with a tainted reputation. However, bitcoin trade dynamics may require special treatment.\n\nBinance, a rival to FTX, considered buying the faltering exchange before its late 2022 collapse, according to Inquirer. However, the company's founder and former CEO, Changpeng Zhao, was sentenced to four months in prison for child sex abuse, drug trafficking, and terrorism funding on the network.\n\nDespite these scandals, Binance remains the largest cryptocurrency exchange.", "source": {"uri": "techtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tech Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "quincy_jon@techtimes.com", "name": "Quincy Jon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_11,_Title_11,_United_States_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidation", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Liquidation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Bankman-Fried", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Bankman-Fried"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_asset", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Digital asset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_J._Ray_III", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John J.

Subsequently, the exchange was driven into bankruptcy and never recovered. The developments that followed are still occupying the market.\n\nContentsLatest Developments in FTXFTX's Cryptocurrency Pricing Latest Developments in FTX\n\nThe process between the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX and its creditors continues. On the other hand, it is believed that FTX has assets worth billions of dollars more than the amount legally confirmed to be owed to its creditors.\n\nA significant announcement was made recently. FTX's bankruptcy commission is among those estimating that there will be a net distributable income of between $14.5 billion and $16.3 billion as part of the plan based on the restructuring of the exchange, marked by the start date of September 30.\n\nLatest technology news here: Newslinker.co\n\nAccording to the statement, the debt owed by the FTX exchange to creditors is said to be $11.2 billion, which shows that the bankrupt exchange has capital ranging from 118% to 142% relative to what it owes to creditors.\n\nFTX's Cryptocurrency Pricing\n\nOn the other hand, the claim of FTX's creditors is calculated in dollars, and the collapse of the exchange in November 2022 raises questions as the cryptocurrency prices took a dip. The events on the FTX side and the related developments in the sector had led to a full-blown crisis in the market at that time.\n\nFor example, Bitcoin (BTC) was trading at about $16,600 on November 14, 2022, while at the time of writing, it is at $61,435. Ethereum (ETH), on the other hand, is currently at $1,250 compared to its $3,000 level at the time of writing.\n\nThe situation with increasing dollar payments by FTX creditors emerged this year with rising cryptocurrency prices and following the sale of a stake in the AI security and research company Anthropic.\n\nFTX founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was convicted last year of defrauding investors and misusing billions of dollars of customer funds related to the exchange's multibillion-dollar collapse in 2022.\n\nYou can follow our news on Telegram, Facebook, Twitter & Coinmarketcap Disclaimer: The information contained in this article does not constitute investment advice.

In February, FTX petitioned the court to sell its claim against Genesis in the interest of creditor recoveries.\n\nFTX has also sold its crypto derivatives firm LedgerX for $50 million, and a major part of its stake in AI startup Anthropic for a whopping $884 million. FTX has also been selling billions of dollars worth of its locked-up Solana (SOL) tokens as part of its asset recovery efforts, upsetting a group of creditors that took issue with these discounted sales.\n\nThe current reorganization plan is likely to sit well with creditors, despite the fact that it still wont equate to the value if they had held these assets until this time.\n\nIt is worth noting that a portion of the funds recovered is contingent on the court approving settlements with several stakeholders. These include resolving the Internal Revenue Service's proposed $25 billion claim in return for a $200 million cash payment and a $685 million subordinated claim.\n\nIt also includes a proposed arrangement with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) pursuant to which over $1.2 billion could be distributed to creditors if the DOJ decides on it.", "source": {"uri": "unchainedcrypto.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Unchained Crypto"}, "authors": [{"uri": "samyuktha_sriram@unchainedcrypto.com", "name": "Samyuktha Sriram", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_11,_Title_11,_United_States_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solana_(blockchain_platform)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Solana (blockchain platform)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derivative (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stakeholder (corporate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internal Revenue Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://unchainedcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/efgs-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547890", "eventUri": "eng-9547890", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

And this is the next best alternative.\"\n\n\"I've never seen a case with 2 million customers,\" Ray added. \"I've just never seen anything close to it.\"\n\nThe judge who prosecuted the case, US District Judge Lewis Kaplan, however, had said during sentencing: \"The defendant's assertion that FTX customers and creditors will be paid in full is misleading. It is logically flawed, it is speculative.\"\n\nCar-rental giant Hertz and American Airlines are among the other other major US corporations that have gone through a recent bankruptcy and been able to get creditors all their money back.\n\nBankman-Fried recommended Solana and the decentralized blockchain platform its traded on, which bears the same name, to the prison guards at Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center, ahead of the 25-year sentence he got for swiping FTX user funds to plug an $8 billion debt at sister company and failing hedge fund Alameda Research.\n\nFTX has also

The exchange pledges to repay nearly all outstanding funds, with certain customers set to receive additional compensation.\n\nFTX plans to reimburse most clients within two years following a significant crypto crash. The cryptocurrency exchange assures that nearly all owed funds will be repaid, with some customers receiving additional compensation.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, FTX acknowledges a debt of approximately $11.2 billion to creditors while estimating available funds for distribution between $14.5 billion and $16.3 billion.\n\nThe filing outlines a plan to fully settle claims and pay supplementary interest payments of 9% to remaining creditors.\n\nHowever, this compensation may offer little solace for traders who experienced losses during the exchange's collapse.\n\nBitcoin's value surged from $16,080 when FTX filed for bankruptcy protection in November 2022 to nearly $62,675 on Tuesday, resulting in a substantial loss for those who held onto their assets.\n\nSubmitted to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, the plan stipulates that individuals and entities with claims amounting to $50,000 or less will receive approximately 118% of their claimed amount.\n\nThis provision encompasses nearly all of FTX's clientele, covering around 98% of its customer base.\n\nFTX reported that it successfully retrieved funds through the monetization of various assets, primarily proprietary investments held by either the Alameda or FTX Ventures enterprises and litigation claims.\n\nWhen FTX sought bankruptcy protection in November 2022, it was the third-largest cryptocurrency exchange globally, facing a situation akin to a bank run in the crypto realm.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the exchange, CEO and founder Sam Bankman-Fried stepped down.

They may even receive additional cash on top of that amount.\n\nThis unexpected windfall is possible because FTX said it recovered billions more dollars than initially anticipated to cover customer losses from its Nov. 2022 collapse.\n\nFTX revealed it amassed roughly $15b, primarily from selling venture capital investments made by the exchange and its affiliate Alameda Research. This amount is enough to fully repay nearly all creditors with claims of $50,000 or less (representing 98% of creditors). The remaining creditors will also receive a significant recovery, with a minimum payout of 118% of their claims.\n\nThe defunct exchange's proposed reorganization plan goes beyond simply repaying creditors.\n\nThe court filing reveals it also includes potential additional compensation to account for the time value of money lost since FTX's bankruptcy. This means customers won't just get their money back, they may also receive interest on it.\n\nThis payout to over 2m customers is a rare occurrence in typical US bankruptcy cases, where creditors often receive only a fraction of what they're owed.\n\nSome creditors, depending on their claim type, could see a return of up to 142% - meaning they get back more than they originally lost.\n\nFTX's payout plan is significantly better than initial expectations. Back in October, the company anticipated returning just 90% of customer funds. This outlook improved in January when CEO John Ray III told the court he expected full repayment for customers.\n\nFTX is expected to have a significant surplus of cash ($16.3b) after selling all its assets, according to the filing. This is more than enough to cover what it owes to customers and other non-government lenders (about $11.2b).\n\n\"The debtors and their stakeholders have had time to explore strategic options and runway to monetize illiquid and volatile investments gradually over time,\" the filing said.\n\nFTX had been aggressively selling off its assets to raise the funds needed to repay creditors.\n\nThis includes investments both FTX and its affiliate made, such as an 8% stake in AI startup Anthropic. That stake was sold to institutional investors for a total of $884m back in March.\n\nThe proposed distribution plan remains contingent upon formal approval from the Delaware bankruptcy court.

This extraordinary development sets the stage for a rare outcome in U.S. bankruptcy proceedings, where creditors are poised to receive full recoveries plus interest.\n\nThe FTX bankruptcy case has defied expectations, as lower-ranking creditors typically receive only a fraction of their holdings in such situations. However, FTX has benefited from a strong rally in cryptocurrencies, particularly Solana ($SOL), a token heavily backed by the exchange's founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, who has since been convicted of fraud. Additionally, the company has successfully sold numerous other assets, including stakes in various venture capital projects, such as the artificial intelligence company Anthropic.\n\nAs Bloomberg reported, John Ray, who took over as FTX's CEO when the company collapsed, expressed his astonishment at the outcome, stating, \"In any bankruptcy, this is just an unbelievable result.\" Once FTX completes the sale of all its assets, it is expected to have up to $16.3 billion in cash to distribute while owing approximately $11 billion to customers and other non-governmental creditors.\n\nFTX's impressive recovery is particularly striking given the initial comparisons drawn between its collapse and the fraud-fueled downfall of Enron Corp. and the unraveling of Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme. Earlier this year, the company reported having about $6.4 billion in cash, a figure that has since grown substantially.\n\nWhile all debts will be repaid in full, plus interest, court documents filed in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware, indicate that there will be no remaining funds for equity holders. FTX's major equity holders include prominent names such as Sequoia Capital, Thoma Bravo, Singapore's Temasek Holdings Pte, and the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan, as well as individuals like Tom Brady and Gisele B\u00fcndchen.\n\nThe company's restructuring advisers have proposed setting up a fund to pay some creditors, including those who lent FTX crypto, using money that would have otherwise gone to government regulators. They have also been diligently tracking down the company's assets and untangling a complex web of accounts scattered around the world.\n\nThe crypto rebound, which has seen the price of Bitcoin roughly quadruple since late 2022, has given a massive boost to FTX's recoveries. Depending on the type of claim they hold, some creditors could recover as much as 142% of what they are owed, while the vast majority of customers are likely to receive 118% of their holdings on the FTX platform at the time the company entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n\nThe prospect of such substantial recoveries has driven up the price of creditor claims, with some now being traded at more than 100% of their face value. This is a stark contrast to the immediate aftermath of the bankruptcy, when many claims traded for as little as three cents on the dollar.\n\nAs the FTX bankruptcy case enters its final stages, the company's restructuring advisers have laid out new details of their proposal to distribute the cash to creditors and bring the Chapter 11 case to a close. The plan will be put to a vote by creditors, and U.S. Bankruptcy Judge John Dorsey will consider the outcome when deciding whether to approve the payout plan later this summer.", "source": {"uri": "cryptoglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CryptoGlobe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solana_(blockchain_platform)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solana (blockchain platform)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Bankman-Fried", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Bankman-Fried"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Venture capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Madoff", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bernie Madoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequoia_Capital", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sequoia Capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Enron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponzi_scheme", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ponzi scheme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington,_Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario_Teachers'_Pension_Plan", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_11,_Title_11,_United_States_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gisele_B\u00fcndchen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gisele B\u00fcndchen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temasek_Holdings", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Temasek Holdings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_bankruptcy_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States bankruptcy court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://media.cryptoglobe.com/2020/10/FTX-Pro-App-Image-1-768x432.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547890", "eventUri": "eng-9547890", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

The failure shook the cryptocurrency industry and led to the conviction of founder Sam Bankman-Fried on fraud charges. Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in federal prison.\n\nJohn Ray III, who took the helm of FTX after it filed for bankruptcy, on Tuesday said: \"We are pleased to be in a position to propose a Chapter 11 plan that contemplates the return of 100 per cent of bankruptcy claim amounts plus interest for non-governmental creditors.\"\n\nRay publicly described the FTX enterprise he took over as a \"dumpster fire\" and \"crime scene\" amid allegations that Bankman-Fried had plundered customer accounts for lavish personal spending and trading, a scheme that collapsed as digital asset prices lost steam during the 2022 \"crypto winter\".\n\nFTX noted the recent sharp rally in crypto prices have not driven the expected big recoveries for account holders. Rather, it said about 99 per cent of the bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies believed to have been on the exchange at the time of the bankruptcy filing were missing, leaving the recovery pool largely filled by the proceeds from the company's investment portfolio.\n\nAmong FTX's most attractive assets was a stake in AI start-up Anthropic, whose shares it sold for nearly $900 million this year.

Bitcoin, the most widely traded token, had plunged more than 50 per cent in the six months prior to November, 2022. - Copyright The Financial Times", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Bankman-Fried", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sam Bankman-Fried"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alameda_Research", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alameda Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Venture capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_asset", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Digital asset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_11,_Title_11,_United_States_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt_collection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Debt collection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internal Revenue Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portfolio_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Portfolio (finance)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/B7fJAK-ayAOtFSQuSdB-s35Bi7M=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/IB3NF4P4EIJOVYTWR7CQDPFCJM.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547890", "eventUri": "eng-9547890", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

The company said it recovered property valued between $14.5 billion and $16.3 billion, drawn from assets held by the U.S. Department of Justice, authorities in Australia and the Bahamas, and dozens of private parties.\n\n\"FTX has achieved this recovery level by monetizing an extraordinarily diverse collection of assets, most of which were proprietary investments held by the Alameda or FTX Ventures businesses, or litigation claims,\" read the announcement, which was jointly signed by the law firms Sullivan & Cromwell, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan and Landis Rath & Cobb, who all represent FTX debtors.\n\nThe recovery plan, which still has to be finalized by a Delaware bankruptcy court, could bring some closure to customers who lost money with FTX.\n\nFTX was used as an exchange to buy and sell digital currencies, including bitcoin. It amassed billions before collapsing in late 2022 amid a run on deposits. When it filed for bankruptcy in November that year, it had only 0.1 percent of the bitcoin and 1.2 percent of the ethereum that customers believed it had, according to the announcement.\n\nSam Bankman-Fried, the company's founder and chief executive, stepped down and was convicted of sweeping fraud for using customer assets to pay for venture investments, political donations and pricey real estate. Billions were taken out of FTX and put into a hedge fund called Alameda Research, effectively under Bankman-Fried's control, which used the money to make risky cross-border bets on cryptocurrency, among other investments.\n\nAt Bankman-Fried's March court date, when he was sentenced to 25 years in prison, U.S. prosecutors spoke of the \"extraordinary harm\" for customers who gave their life savings to the company and watched the value vanish overnight. But Bankman-Fried said that FTX still had the resources to make customers whole. \"There's plenty of assets to do that,\" he said, according to a Washington Post report from the courtroom. \"There's billions more. It's been true the whole time.\"\n\nThe bankruptcy attorneys said Tuesday that 100 percent of the company's bankruptcy claimants will see their investments returned. The 9 percent interest rate - which covers roughly 17 months that FTX remained in bankruptcy proceedings - applies to about 98 percent of the creditors.\n\nThe value of those holdings is based on cryptocurrency values as of November 2022, when the company filed for bankruptcy. That means creditors won't reap the benefits of the more recent cryptocurrency rally, which has roughly tripled the price of bitcoin from where it stood at the start of legal proceedings.", "source": {"uri": "unionleader.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UnionLeader.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bahamas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Bankman-Fried", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Bankman-Fried"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethereum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinn_Emanuel_Urquhart_&_Sullivan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sullivan_&_Cromwell", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sullivan & Cromwell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Digital currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_firm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law firm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debtor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Debtor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alameda_Research", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alameda Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Campaign finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/unionleader.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/1b/21b385f1-b3b1-55a6-9872-bff02c033e62/663bc6d2c7619.image.jpg?crop=1761%2C925%2C0%2C126&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547890", "eventUri": "eng-9547890", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

At the time of the bankruptcy filing, Bitcoin was trading at about $16,000, but it recently peaked at above $72,000. FTX was holding a significant stash of cryptocurrencies.\n\n\"As previously disclosed, FTX.com had a massive shortfall at the time of the Chapter 11 filing in November 2022 -- holding only 0.1% of the Bitcoin and only 1.2% of the Ethereum customers believed it held,\" the exchange noted. \"The Debtors have not been able to benefit from the appreciation of these missing tokens during the Chapter 11 cases.\"\n\nThe bankruptcy exchange further highlighted that, according to its forecasts, it will have between $14.5 and $16.3 billion available for distribution.\n\n\"FTX has achieved this recovery level by monetizing an extraordinarily diverse collection of assets, most of which were proprietary investments held by the Alameda or FTX Ventures businesses, or litigation claims,\" the announcement added.\n\nThe condition of FTX looked grim when the company filed for bankruptcy.

On May 7, the company announced that it will try to pay 100% of the allowable bankruptcy claim amounts and interest to non-governmental creditors. This change is a departure from previous developments that used to only cover asset value at the time of bankruptcy.\n\nThe plan in question is awaiting finalization and approval of a Delaware Bankruptcy Court. Given by FTX CEO and chief restructuring officer John J. Ray III, the better financial prognosis is attributed to a recent bull run of the cryptocurrency markets, in which only Bitcoin has appreciated more than 200% since the bankruptcy. FTX have successfully gathered and liquidated some of the assets with cash worth of $14.5 to $16.3 billion to be distributed among the creditors.\n\nEligibility and compensation details\n\nThe 118% is still subject to the courts on the new plan to those creditors who have claims amounting less than $50,000. This is intended for a more favorable treatment of smaller creditors who, as a result of the bankruptcy, may have been disproportionately affected. The plan specifies that these payments be made within 60 days once the plan takes effect, the quick resolution of the affected parties.\n\nAmong other measures, FTX has been actively recuperating funds after declaring insolvency, among other things through selling off a number of investments. One of the prominent trades was liquidating shares of $884 million in the artificial intelligence company Anthropic, which formed a significant part of its portfolio. These initiatives have been at the heart of FTX's tactic to accumulate the required capital to pay off the suggested repayments.\n\nFTX's repayment plan aims for financial stability\n\nThe recent declaration also serves to assure that FTX will not re-open as an exchange for cryptocurrencies. The emphasis will rather be on reorganization and creditor claims satisfaction which is in line with the significant recovery efforts in its investment portfolio. This approach is consistent with FTX's mission to compensate for the financial harm suffered by its creditors and to preserve its remaining assets in order to stabilize them.\n\nThe proposal by FTX could be described as a major repayment effort in the history of bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange companies. If accepted, it will form a model for digital finance companies to operate willingly during the recovery period post-crisis that will be based on restitution and responsibility.", "source": {"uri": "cryptopolitan.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cryptopolitan"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mutuma_maxwell@cryptopolitan.com", "name": "Mutuma Maxwell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_J._Ray_III", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John J.

Known as a disclosure statement, the document is designed to help creditors vote on the proposed payout plan.\n\nUS Bankruptcy Judge John Dorsey will take that vote into consideration when he decides whether to approve the plan sometime later this summer. Judge Dorsey is scheduled to hold a hearing in late June on the disclosure statement and the voting procedures.\n\nFTX filed bankruptcy in November 2022 after Bankman-Fried shut down the company's crypto-trading platform and handed control to insolvency experts. Bankman-Fried was later convicted of fraud.

Rather, it said about 99 per cent of the bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies believed to have been on the exchange at the time of the bankruptcy filing were missing, leaving the recovery pool largely filled by the proceeds from the company's investment portfolio.\n\nAmong FTX's most attractive assets was a stake in AI start-up Anthropic, whose shares it sold for nearly $900mn this year.

That covers about 98% of FTX customers.\n\nAfter paying claims in full, the plan provides for supplemental interest payments to the extent that funds still remain. The interest rate for most creditors is 9%.\n\nAlthough customers will be reimbursed the cash value of their cryptocurrency assets at the time of FTX's collapse plus some interest, that's far short of how much money those assets would be worth today given crypto's resurgence. The price of bitcoin today, for instance, is about three times what it was in November 2022.\n\nWhat is FTX?\n\nFTX was co-founded in 2019 by Sam Bankman-Fried, once considered the golden boy of the crypto industry. As chief executive, he grew the exchange into one of the largest in the world, with more than 1 million users at its peak and endorsements from major celebrities including NFL quarterback Tom Brady and NBA star Stephen Curry.\n\nBankman-Fried, 32, was hailed as a positive force and trustworthy spokesperson for the emerging industry, especially as he rescued several failing crypto firms.\n\nWhat happened to FTX?\n\nFTX failed in spectacular fashion when users, worried about the exchange's solvency, began pulling out their money en masse in 2022. The collapse triggered a surge in outflows across other global crypto exchanges, leading to a catastrophic fiasco.\n\nFTX had a staggering shortfall at the time of its Chapter 11 filing, holding only 0.1% of the bitcoin and only 1.2% of the ethereum that customers believed it held, the company said in an announcement Tuesday.\n\nWhat about Bankman-Fried?\n\nBankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas in December 2022 and extradited to the U.S., where he faced criminal charges. Eleven months later, a jury in federal court in Manhattan convicted him of fraud in a scheme that cheated customers and investors out of at least $10 billion.\n\nProsecutors said Bankman-Fried had misappropriated funds to fuel his quest for influence and dominance in the crypto world, and had illegally used money from FTX depositors to cover his expenses, which included luxury properties in the Caribbean, alleged bribes to Chinese officials and private planes.\n\n\"His crimes caught up to him. His crimes have been exposed,\" Assistant U.S. Atty. Danielle Sassoon said during the monthlong trial. Sassoon said Bankman-Fried turned customer accounts into his \"personal piggy bank\" as up to $14 billion disappeared.\n\nIn March, Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison. It was a stunning downfall for the founder, who at one point was estimated to be worth $26 billion.\n\nWhere is the reimbursement money coming from?\n\nThe billions available to repay defrauded customers includes assets under the control of the debtors, the U.S. Department of Justice, authorities in Australia and the Bahamas as well as dozens of private parties.\n\n\"FTX has achieved this recovery level by monetizing an extraordinarily diverse collection of assets, most of which were proprietary investments held by the Alameda or FTX Ventures businesses, or litigation claims,\" the company said.\n\nThe plan still has to be finalized in U.S. Bankruptcy Court.", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The insolvent crypto exchange had filed a new reorganization strategy with the United States Bankruptcy Court of Delaware.\n\nRelated Reading: Dogecoin Holders In Profit across 82%, What About Shiba Inu?\n\nThe reorganization plan, which involves the allocation of funds to customers affected by FTX's fraud scheme, will involve a centralized distribution of all of the company's assets during the time of its collapse in November 2022 to its creditors and customers.\n\nThe crypto exchange has revealed that it has secured between $14.5 billion to $16.3 billion, after selling assets and properties owned by the company. This specifically includes assets under control of the \"Chapter 11 debtors,\" the Joint Official Liquidators of FTX Digital Markets Ltd., and FTX Australia, as well as various private parties which have participated in the recovery and repayment process.\n\nFTX's repayment strategy outlines a comprehensive approach to repay creditors, both governmental and non-governmental. The crypto exchange has stated that it will make complete payments to non-governmental creditors based on the value of their claims determined by the Bankruptcy Court.\n\nOn the other hand, a subordination arrangement is proposed for governmental creditors, prioritizing interest payments to primary classes of customers and creditors at up to 9%, executed in a timely manner.\n\nThe repayment plan will also establish a unique category known as \"convenience class,\" specifically focusing on creditors with claims valued at $50,000 or less. This reorganization will effectively streamline the payment process for smaller creditors and expedite compensation.\n\nThe exchange's amended repayment strategy is still undergoing finalization and awaiting approval from the Bankruptcy Court. However, if the plan receives approval, it is expected that creditors will receive 118% of the value of their allowed claims within 60 days following the plan's effective date.\n\nIn its new payment reorganization plan, FTX disclosed several settlements mutually agreed upon with primary economic stakeholders. As well as some that are still pending finalization and approval by the Court.\n\nOne of the key settlements involves a resolution of the $24 billion in claims filed by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). In exchange, FTX has agreed to make a $200 million cash payment and issue a $685 million subordinate claim.\n\nAdditionally, FTX has proposed agreements with the IRS and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to subordinate tax claims which arose after the commencement of the Chapter 11 cases. Furthermore, the crypto exchange revealed a previously approved settlement with the Joint Official Liquidators of FTX Digital Markets, Ltd., and BlockFi, the largest creditor of FTX.", "source": {"uri": "bitcoinist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bitcoinist.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogecoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dogecoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiba_Inu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shiba Inu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insolvency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Insolvency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_bankruptcy_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States bankruptcy court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidator_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liquidator (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_11,_Title_11,_United_States_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debtor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Debtor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlockFi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BlockFi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_Futures_Trading_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commodity Futures Trading Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Futures contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internal Revenue Service"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547890", "eventUri": "eng-9547890", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 238, "textEnd": 243}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

The company's assets, once fully sold, will leave no surplus for equity holders, according to court documents filed in Delaware, where the case is being handled.\n\nFTX's creditors, depending on the type of claim they hold, could recover as much as 142% of their claims.

The company's founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, was sentenced to 25 years for his involvement in an $8 billion fraud, and the company was forced to liquidate his $222 million worth of real estate to compensate creditors.\n\nHowever, the company's fortunes began to change when it ramped up its cash reserves in an attempt to repay customers amid bankruptcy. FTX's affiliates, including FTX Trading Ltd. and Alameda Research LLC, significantly increased the group's cash to $4.4 billion by the end of 2023, a substantial rise from the $2.3 billion recorded in late October. The company raised $1.8 billion through selling some digital assets as of Dec 8, according to the report.\n\nRead Next: If You're Getting Tired Of Crypto, Here's Why: Mad Crypto Alpha With Ivan\n\nThe GPT-4-based Benzinga Neuro content generation system exploits the extensive Benzinga Ecosystem, including native data, APIs, and more to create comprehensive and timely stories for you.

They filed it with the United States Bankruptcy Court in Delaware.\n\nThe plan outlines a structured approach to repay creditors by liquidating nearly all assets held by FTX at the time of its downfall. This move marks a crucial step in resolving the financial turmoil following its November 2022 bankruptcy.\n\nThe reorganization strategy indicates that FTX has secured between $14.5 and $16.3 billion for repayment. The amount has been achieved through liquidating diverse assets, including those controlled by various global entities involved in the proceedings.\n\nDespite the massive asset shortfall identified at the beginning of the bankruptcy, the plan ensures that non-governmental creditors will receive full payment. They will receive up to 9% interest from the start of the bankruptcy cases.\n\nThe strategy introduces a 'convenience class' for creditors with $50,000 or less claims. If the court approves, this arrangement is expected to enable 98% of such creditors to receive about 118% of their claim value. This will occur within 60 days of the plan's activation.\n\nHowever, it subordinates governmental creditors' claims, permitting interest payments of up to 9% to primary customers and creditors classes from the start of the Chapter 11 cases until distribution. Additionally, certain creditors might receive extra payments from the Supplemental Remission Fund.\n\nRead more: FTX Collapse Explained: How Sam Bankman-Fried's Empire Fell\n\nA core component of the bankruptcy exit strategy involves a series of settlements with key stakeholders. This strategy aims to consolidate FTX's position and simplify the repayment process.\n\nThese pending court-approved agreements include resolving a $24 billion IRS claim from before the Chapter 11 cases with a $200 million payment and a $685 million subordinated claim. Furthermore, the Plan proposes subordinating post-Chapter 11 Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax claims and similar claims from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\n\nThese subordinated claims will fund supplemental payments to certain creditors and customers through a special fund, pending further details.\n\nThe Plan also outlines a potential arrangement with the Department of Justice (DOJ). This arrangement will distribute over $1.2 billion in forfeiture proceeds to creditors without extra costs or delays. It confirms settlements with the Ad Hoc Committee of Non-US Customers, Class Action Claimants, and the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors, giving customers special priority.\n\nAnother settlement allows FTX.com customers to resolve their claims either in Chapter 11 or in the liquidation of FTX Digital Markets, Ltd. This arrangement offers similar financial outcomes. Lastly, a previously approved settlement with BlockFi, FTX's largest creditor, is included.\n\nIn its official statement, John J. Ray III, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Restructuring Officer of FTX, expressed his gratitude regarding this plan.\n\n\"We are pleased to be in a position to propose a Chapter 11 plan that contemplates the return of 100% of bankruptcy claim amounts plus interest for non-governmental creditors. On behalf of FTX's independent Board of Directors, I want to extend our deepest appreciation to the numerous governmental agencies. [...] Finally, I want to thank all the customers and creditors of FTX for their patience throughout this process,\" Ray stated.\n\nRead more: Who Is John J. Ray III, FTX's New CEO?\n\nAs FTX moves forward with its proposed plan, the role of the US Bankruptcy Court becomes crucial. A late June hearing will let Judge John Dorsey review and potentially approve the voting procedures and disclosure statement.

Under the plan, billions could flow to creditors, with 98% expected to receive at least 118% of their approved claims. CEO John J. Ray III promises full return plus interest to non-governmental creditors, utilizing diverse assets. The plan awaits court approval, potentially restoring trust in the crypto industry.\n\nIn a recent announcement, insolvent cryptocurrency exchange FTX unveiled a new reorganization plan that offers hope for creditors and users. Under this plan, billions in compensation payments could flow to creditors, a significant step that could restore confidence in digital finance.\n\nFTX, once one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, suffered a dramatic collapse in 2022 triggered by improper behind-the-scenes dealings by its executives. Former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was found guilty on all seven counts of defrauding customers and investors in November last year and received a nearly 25-year prison sentence in March.\n\nAccording to FTX's new plan, 98% of creditors should receive at least 118% of their approved claims. This particularly affects creditors with claims under $50,000, who are expected to receive 118% compensation under the plan upon court confirmation. These compensations are scheduled to be paid out within 60 days of the plan coming into force.\n\nFTX CEO John J. Ray III said it was pleased to propose a Chapter 11 plan that would provide for the return of 100% of the bankruptcy claim amounts plus interest to non-governmental creditors. This promise could be a great relief for many of those affected.\n\nFTX said it has monetized an \"extraordinarily diverse collection\" of assets, primarily derived from investments held by its Alameda and FTX Venture divisions, as well as legal claims. Since FTX only owned small amounts of Bitcoin and Ether at the time of the collapse, the debtors did not benefit from their recent rise in value.\n\nThe goal of the reorganization plan is \"centralized distribution\" for FTX customers and creditors, regardless of where their assets were originally located. FTX estimates the total value of cash available for distribution to be between $14.5 billion and $16.3 billion. However, the plan still needs to be finalized and approved by a U.S. bankruptcy court.\n\nThis plan could be a game-changer for the many users and investors who were financially harmed by FTX's collapse. The proposed compensation not only offers a possible financial recovery, but could also help restore trust in the cryptocurrency industry that has been shaken by the scandal. The crypto world is looking forward to the next steps as the legal process progresses and hopes for justice and redress grow.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This article was written by a third party contributor and does not reflect the opinion of Born2Invest, its management, staff or its associates.

Under a plan filed in federal bankruptcy court in Delaware, virtually all FTX's creditors, including hundreds of thousands of ordinary investors who used the exchange to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, would receive cash payments equivalent to 118% of the assets they had stored on FTX, the lawyers said.\n\nThose payments would flow from a pool of assets that FTX's lawyers have pulled together in the 17 months since the exchange collapsed, the lawyers said. They tapped a wide range of sources, including digital currencies FTX still owned when it filed for bankruptcy and company assets such as shares in startups, which could be sold to bidders.\n\nThe amount that FTX recovered is \"in general pretty unheard of,\" said Yesha Yadav, a law professor at Vanderbilt University. \"That's something that is really quite astonishing for a major bankruptcy.\"\n\nThe plan comes with a caveat. The amount owed to customers was calculated based on the value of their holdings at the time of FTX's bankruptcy in November 2022. That means customers won't reap the benefits of a recent surge in the crypto market that sent the price of bitcoin to a record high. A customer who lost one bitcoin when FTX imploded, for example, would be entitled to less than $20,000, even though a Bitcoin is now worth more than $60,000.\n\nIt will take months for the payouts to begin. The plan must be approved by the federal judge overseeing FTX's bankruptcy, John T. Dorsey. If creditors raise any objections to the plan, that could extend the timeline.\n\nStill, it seemed unlikely that customers would get their money back when FTX collapsed. Before its implosion, customers used the exchange as a marketplace to buy and sell digital currencies and stored billions of dollars in crypto on the platform.", "source": {"uri": "staradvertiser.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Honolulu Star Advertiser"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Bankman-Fried", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Bankman-Fried"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_bankruptcy_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States bankruptcy court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanderbilt_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vanderbilt University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Digital currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_judge", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States federal judge"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Star-Advertiser-thumbnail-image.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547890", "eventUri": "eng-9547890", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

On May 7, the company announced that it will try to pay 100% of the allowable bankruptcy claim amounts and interest to non-governmental creditors. This change is a departure from previous developments that used to only cover asset value at the time of bankruptcy.\n\nThe plan in question is awaiting finalization and approval of a Delaware Bankruptcy Court. Given by FTX CEO and chief restructuring officer John J. Ray III, the better financial prognosis is attributed to a recent bull run of the cryptocurrency markets, in which only Bitcoin has appreciated more than 200% since the bankruptcy. FTX have successfully gathered and liquidated some of the assets with cash worth of $14.5 to $16.3 billion to be distributed among the creditors.\n\nThe 118% is still subject to the courts on the new plan to those creditors who have claims amounting less than $50,000. This is intended for a more favorable treatment of smaller creditors who, as a result of the bankruptcy, may have been disproportionately affected. The plan specifies that these payments be made within 60 days once the plan takes effect, the quick resolution of the affected parties.\n\nAmong other measures, FTX has been actively recuperating funds after declaring insolvency, among other things through selling off a number of investments. One of the prominent trades was liquidating shares of $884 million in the artificial intelligence company Anthropic, which formed a significant part of its portfolio. These initiatives have been at the heart of FTX's tactic to accumulate the required capital to pay off the suggested repayments.\n\nThe recent declaration also serves to assure that FTX will not re-open as an exchange for cryptocurrencies. The emphasis will rather be on reorganization and creditor claims satisfaction which is in line with the significant recovery efforts in its investment portfolio. This approach is consistent with FTX's mission to compensate for the financial harm suffered by its creditors and to preserve its remaining assets in order to stabilize them.\n\nThe proposal by FTX could be described as a major repayment effort in the history of bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange companies. If accepted, it will form a model for digital finance companies to operate willingly during the recovery period post-crisis that will be based on restitution and responsibility.", "source": {"uri": "cryptorank.io", "dataType": "news", "title": "CryptoRank"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_J._Ray_III", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John J.

His lawyers argued that customers should receive \"at least the value of crypto back.\"", "source": {"uri": "insidebitcoins.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "InsideBitcoins.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegram_(messaging_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Telegram (messaging service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_11,_Title_11,_United_States_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_bankruptcy_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States bankruptcy court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Belshe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Belshe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitGo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BitGo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://insidebitcoins.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/FTX-Feature-Image.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547890", "eventUri": "eng-9547890", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 309, "textEnd": 314}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 1479, "textEnd": 1484}, {"amb": false, "date": "-01-12", "textStart": 1533, "textEnd": 1540}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

This plan represents a pivotal moment in their journey to resolve the aftermath of their collapse in November 2022.\n\nAccording to the plan, creditors will be fairly compensated, and any disagreements with government and private parties will be settled without long court fights. Specifically, it expects that within 60 days of the plan's action, 98% of FTX's creditors will receive at least 118% of their allowed claims in cash. Furthermore, other creditors stand to gain 100% of their allowed claims and substantial compensation for their investments' time value.\n\nBesides, the possible payment to creditors could bring much cash into the cryptocurrency markets, leading to more activity and greater market trust. The 2% rise in the FTX token (FTT) value right after the plan was announced shows that this is a good sign.\n\nJohn J. Ray III, FTX's CEO and Chief Restructuring Officer, expressed gratitude to all stakeholders and emphasized the firm's commitment to returning 100% of bankruptcy claim amounts plus interest for non-governmental creditors.\n\nBloomberg analysts have noted that FTX has accumulated a significant amount of funds beyond what is necessary to compensate for customer losses in the event of its collapse in November 2022. This puts the company in a favorable position for complete recoveries in bankruptcy. The plan outlines FTX's strategy for distributing all assets linked to its collapse in 2022, irrespective of their present worth.\n\nWith assets totaling between $14.5 and $16.3 billion, FTX seems ready to cover its debts.

Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment in March and ordered to pay $11 billion in forfeiture.\n\nAccording to a statement released on Wednesday by the company, is now being managed by a new CEO and Chief Restructuring Officer, John J. Ray III, the money to be distributed was realized from properties collected from the convicted founder, which have been converted to cash.\n\n\"FTX forecasts that the total value of property collected, converted to cash, and available for distribution will be between $14.5 and $16.3 billion.\n\n\"This amount includes assets under the control of the chapter 11 debtors as well as assets under the control of the Joint Official Liquidators of FTX Digital Markets, Ltd. (Bahamas), the Securities Commission of The Bahamas, the Joint Official Liquidators of FTX Australia, the United States Department of Justice and dozens of private parties that have cooperated in the recovery efforts,\" the company said in the statement.\n\nProviding more explanations on how the money was realized, the company said it achieved the recovery level by monetizing an extraordinarily diverse collection of assets, most of which were proprietary investments held by the Alameda or FTX Ventures businesses, or litigation claims.\n\nIt added that FTX.com had a massive shortfall at the time of the Chapter 11 filing in November 2022 -- holding only 0.1% of the Bitcoin and only 1.2% of the Ethereum customers believed it held.\n\n\"Accordingly, the Debtors have not been able to benefit from the appreciation of these missing tokens during the chapter 11 cases. Instead, the Debtors have had to look to other sources of recoverable value to repay creditors,\" it added.\n\nFTX said it plans to pay in full all non-governmental creditors based on the value of their claims as determined by the Bankruptcy Court. In addition, it also plans a subordination arrangement with governmental creditors that allows payment of interest to the primary classes of customers and creditors at up to a 9% rate from the commencement of the chapter 11 cases through the date of distribution.\n\n\"There also may be the opportunity for certain creditors to receive additional payments through the Supplemental Remission Fund described in Section 1.F of the Disclosure Statement,\" it added.\n\nThe collapse of FTX in 2022, once a prominent player in the cryptocurrency market, came as a blow to investors and customers who lost substantial sums of money. Prosecutors alleged that Bankman-Fried diverted funds from FTX to Alameda Research, a sister hedge fund, for personal gain, including political donations and real estate investments.\n\nProsecutors detailed Bankman-Fried's use of stolen funds to finance lavish personal expenditures, including luxury real estate acquisitions, risky investments, extravagant charitable donations, and political contributions.\n\nAfter about a year of trial, Bankman-Fried was found guilty of looting $8 billion from customers of his now-bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange. A 12-member jury in Manhattan federal court convicted Bankman-Fried on all seven counts he faced after a monthlong trial.\n\nIn March this year, handed a 25-year prison sentence for his role in the collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange, culminating a high-profile case that has rocked the crypto industry.\n\nAs part of the sentencing, Judge Kaplan ordered Bankman-Fried to forfeit more than $11 billion, showing the magnitude of the financial damage caused by his actions.", "source": {"uri": "nairametrics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nairametrics"}, "authors": [{"uri": "samson_akintaro@nairametrics.com", "name": "Samson Akintaro", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidator_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Liquidator (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_11,_Title_11,_United_States_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bahamas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_J._Ray_III", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John J.

During the meeting on Tuesday, a revised plan was presented, which raises the prospects of financial recovery and includes comprehensive repayment for all non-governmental creditors with a maximum interest rate of 9%.\n\nThe latest plan, which has yet to be approved by a bankruptcy court of Delaware, has already enjoyed a significant improvement over the estimates made by the FTX estate in October, making it a step in the right direction. To begin with, there was a prognosis that just 90% of customers' funds could be recovered. In January, the current CEO of FTX, John Jay Ray III, modified his initial estimates and was optimistic that all harmed customers could be made whole.\n\nDespite the rise in the price of most cryptocurrencies since the FTX failed in mid-November 2022, the estate has stated clearly that its cash reserve of $145-163 billion is not the only factor contributing to such development. The story is the fruit of much global work to assemble the company's assets and hold an auction sale. Their latest press release indicated that when they had to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, there was a severe crisis in the crypto market as vital digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum were in short supply. This lack caused the value to pass by because the added profit from the increasing worth of these cryptocurrencies was not sold.\n\nThe remuneration strategy covers customers and investors, while the restructuring plan identifies settlements for some regulator and government claims. With the claims of $24 billion, the IRS was one of the biggest concerns. However, it settled for a $200 million cash payment and a $685 million subordinated claim, which will be paid later if other creditors and governmental entities do not get their money. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission of the United States (CFTC) and some government agencies have promised to waive their claims, arranging for FTX users and investors to be prioritized.\n\nAlso, a significant component of the proposed idea is establishing a separate fund designed explicitly to help customers and creditors receive compensation. But their exact particularities have just been clarified.\n\nA court hearing is scheduled for June to examine and approve the assumed plan. The trial during this hearing will likely touch on the role Sam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO of FTX, played. Before that, he maintained that his exchange of validating customers was to ensure that they did not suffer any harm. On the other hand, he was found guilty of fraud in the spring and sentenced to 25 years of imprisonment. Bankman-Fried is planning to appeal both his conviction and sentence.", "source": {"uri": "cryptonewsz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CryptoNewsZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virtual currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethereum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_asset", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Digital asset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_Futures_Trading_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commodity Futures Trading Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_11,_Title_11,_United_States_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Bankman-Fried", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Bankman-Fried"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internal Revenue Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://www.cryptonewsz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/FTX-plan-promises-118-cash-payout-to-nearly-all-creditors.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547890", "eventUri": "eng-9547890", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

As per the platform, this value will stand somewhere between $14.5B and $16.3B. Tjis amount is larger than the amount the exchange needs to payback to its clients. Hence, it is likely FTX will share the remaining amount with the clients as compensation.\n\nThe respective amount takes into account the assets that the chapter-11 debtors are controlling at present. In addition to this, it also includes the assets that FTX Digital Markets, Ltd.'s Joint Official Liquidators control. The other entities in this list comprise the United States Department of Justice and FTX Australia's Joint Official Liquidators.\n\nMoreover, they also include the Securities Commission of The Bahamas and several private parties dealing with the recovery efforts. The bankrupt crypto exchange has obtained this recovery scale with the monetization of a surprisingly diverse asset collection. The majority of these assets operated as proprietary investments under FTX Ventures or Alameda businesses. The former disclosures pointed out that FTX witnessed a huge shortfall when it collapsed.\n\nAt that point, the crypto exchange was holding just 0.1% of BTC and just 1.2% of the ETH clients. Subsequently, FTX could not leverage the missing token's appreciation during the bankruptcy proceedings. On the other hand, the debtors moved toward the other recoverable value sources for repayment to the creditors.\n\nThe plan centers around several consensual settlements with the chief economic stakeholders. They include the resolution of the Internal Revenue Service's submitted claims of $24B before Chapter 11 for a $200M cash. Furthermore, the plan also includes a proposed consensus with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission as well as the rest of the governmental claimants.", "source": {"uri": "fxdailyreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FXDailyReport.Com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "umair_younas@fxdailyreport.com", "name": "Umair Younas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debtor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Debtor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidator_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liquidator (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_11,_Title_11,_United_States_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_bankruptcy_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States bankruptcy court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_Futures_Trading_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commodity Futures Trading Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stakeholder (corporate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internal Revenue Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leverage (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bahamas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Brokerages", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Brokerages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://fxdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FTX-Plans-Relaunch-as-it-Retrieves-_7.3B-in-Assets.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547890", "eventUri": "eng-9547890", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nGood news for FTX creditors: FTX Trading and its affiliated debtors have taken a significant stride towards financial recovery by filing their long-awaited amended plan of reorganization nearly two years after filing for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Protection. This plan represents a pivotal moment in their journey to resolve the aftermath of their collapse in November 2022.\n\nAccording to the plan, creditors will be fairly compensated, and any disagreements with government and private parties will be settled without long court fights. Specifically, it expects that within 60 days of the plan's action, 98% of FTX's creditors will receive at least 118% of their allowed claims in cash. Furthermore, other creditors stand to gain 100% of their allowed claims and substantial compensation for their investments' time value.\n\nBesides, the possible payment to creditors could bring much cash into the cryptocurrency markets, leading to more activity and greater market trust. The 2% rise in the FTX token (FTT) value right after the plan was announced shows that this is a good sign.\n\nJohn J. Ray III, FTX's CEO and Chief Restructuring Officer, expressed gratitude to all stakeholders and emphasized the firm's commitment to returning 100% of bankruptcy claim amounts plus interest for non-governmental creditors.\n\nBloomberg analysts have noted that FTX has accumulated a significant amount of funds beyond what is necessary to compensate for customer losses in the event of its collapse in November 2022. This puts the company in a favorable position for complete recoveries in bankruptcy. The plan outlines FTX's strategy for distributing all assets linked to its collapse in 2022, irrespective of their present worth.\n\nWith assets totaling between $14.5 and $16.3 billion, FTX seems ready to cover its debts. This plan marks a big step forward for FTX's financial recovery and could positively change the crypto market.", "source": {"uri": "coinpedia.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Coinpedia - Fintech & Cryptocurreny News Media| Crypto Guide"}, "authors": [{"uri": "qadir_ak@coinpedia.org", "name": "Qadir Ak", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blockchain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_11,_Title_11,_United_States_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_J._Ray_III", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John J.

(d.b.a. FTX.com) and its affiliated debtors (\"FTX\" or the \"Debtors\") today filed their anticipated amended Plan of Reorganization (the \"Plan\") and accompanying Disclosure Statement (the \"Disclosure Statement\") with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District Court of Delaware (the \"Bankruptcy Court\"). Subject to being finalized and approved by the Bankruptcy Court, the Plan contemplates the centralized distribution to customers and other creditors around the world of virtually all of the assets associated with FTX at the time of its collapse in November 2022, regardless of where the assets were located at that time.\n\nFTX forecasts that the total value of property collected, converted to cash and available for distribution will be between $14.5 and $16.3 billion. This amount includes assets under the control of the chapter 11 debtors as well as assets under the control of the Joint Official Liquidators of FTX Digital Markets, Ltd. (Bahamas), the Securities Commission of The Bahamas, the Joint Official Liquidators of FTX Australia, the United States Department of Justice and dozens of private parties that have cooperated in the recovery efforts.\n\nFTX has achieved this recovery level by monetizing an extraordinarily diverse collection of assets, most of which were proprietary investments held by the Alameda or FTX Ventures businesses, or litigation claims. As previously disclosed, FTX.com had a massive shortfall at the time of the chapter 11 filing in November 2022 -- holding only 0.1% of the Bitcoin and only 1.2% of the Ethereum customers believed it held. Accordingly, the Debtors have not been able to benefit from the appreciation of these missing tokens during the chapter 11 cases. Instead, the Debtors have had to look to other sources of recoverable value to repay creditors.\n\nThe Plan contemplates payment in full of all non-governmental creditors based on the value of their claims as determined by the Bankruptcy Court. In addition, the Plan contemplates a subordination arrangement with governmental creditors that allows payment of interest to the primary classes of customers and creditors at up to a 9% rate (the \"Consensus Rate\") from the commencement of the chapter 11 cases through the date of distribution. There also may be the opportunity for certain creditors to receive additional payments through the Supplemental Remission Fund described in Section 1.F of the Disclosure Statement.\n\nFor creditors holding claims in an allowed amount of $50,000 or less, the Plan creates a special \"convenience class\". Because of this classification, if the Plan is approved by the Bankruptcy Court, the Debtors anticipate that 98% of the creditors of FTX by number will receive approximately 118% of the amount of their allowed claims within 60 days after the effective date of the Plan, subject to know-your-client and distribution information requirements.\n\nAt the heart of the Plan are a series of settlements reached consensually with the key economic stakeholders. The key settlements (including those that are still subject to finalization and Court approval) include:\n\nJohn J. Ray III, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Restructuring Officer of FTX, said: \"We are pleased to be in a position to propose a chapter 11 plan that contemplates the return of 100% of bankruptcy claim amounts plus interest for non-governmental creditors. On behalf of FTX's independent Board of Directors, I want to extend our deepest appreciation to the numerous governmental agencies, including the United States Department of Justice, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Internal Revenue Service and the Securities Commission of The Bahamas, for their tireless efforts, cooperation and assistance through this complex recovery process. I also want to thank the Joint Official Liquidators of FTX Digital Markets, the Ad Hoc Committee of Non-U.S. Customers, the Class Action Claimants, BlockFi, the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors and all of their professionals for their hard work in the development of the Plan and its resulting achievements. Finally, I want to thank all the customers and creditors of FTX for their patience throughout this process.\"\n\nThe Plan is subject to material conditions and risks, and all stakeholders are asked to review the Disclosure Statement carefully upon its approval by the Bankruptcy Court. Bankruptcy Court filings, including the Plan and the Disclosure Statement, and other documents related to the court proceedings are available at https://cases.ra.kroll.com/FTX/.\n\nView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ftx-files-consensus-based-plan-of-reorganization-302138948.html", "source": {"uri": "streetinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "StreetInsider.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_11,_Title_11,_United_States_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidator_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Liquidator (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bahamas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloudflare", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cloudflare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expedia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Expedia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_name", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trade name"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amgen", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amgen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_bankruptcy_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States bankruptcy court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PR_Newswire", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PR Newswire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privately_held_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Privately held company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington,_Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethereum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Non-governmental organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alameda,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alameda, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alameda, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_J._Ray_III", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John J.

The company said it recovered property valued between $14.5 billion and $16.3 billion, drawn from assets held by the U.S. Department of Justice, authorities in Australia and the Bahamas, and dozens of private parties.\n\n\"FTX has achieved this recovery level by monetizing an extraordinarily diverse collection of assets, most of which were proprietary investments held by the Alameda or FTX Ventures businesses, or litigation claims,\" read the announcement, which was jointly signed by the law firms Sullivan & Cromwell, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan and Landis Rath & Cobb, who all represent FTX debtors.\n\nThe recovery plan,which still has to be finalized by a Delaware bankruptcy court, could bring some closure to customers who lost money with FTX.\n\nFTX was used as an exchange to buy and sell digital currencies, including bitcoin. It amassed billions before collapsing in late 2022 amid a run on deposits. When it filed for bankruptcy in November of that year, it had only 0.1% of the bitcoin and 1.2% of the ethereum that customers believed it had, according to the announcement.\n\nSam Bankman-Fried, the company's founder and chief executive, stepped down and was convicted of sweeping fraud for using customer assets to pay for venture investments, political donations and pricey real estate. Billions were taken out of FTX and put into a hedge fund called Alameda Research, effectively under Bankman-Fried's control, which used the money to make risky cross-border bets on cryptocurrency, among other investments.\n\nAt Bankman-Fried's March court date, when he was sentenced to 25 years in prison, U.S. prosecutors spoke of the \"extraordinary harm\" for customers who gave their life savings to the company and watched the value vanish overnight. But Bankman-Fried said that FTX still had the resources to make customers whole. \"There's plenty of assets to do that,\" he said, according to a Washington Post report from the courtroom. \"There's billions more. It's been true the whole time.\"\n\nThe bankruptcy attorneys said Tuesday that 100% of the company's bankruptcy claimants will see their investments returned. The 9% interest rate - which covers roughly 17 months that FTX remained in bankruptcy proceedings - applies to about 98% of the creditors.\n\nThe value of those holdings is based on cryptocurrency values as of November 2022, when the company filed for bankruptcy. That means creditors won't reap the benefits of the more recent cryptocurrency rally, which has roughly tripled the price of bitcoin from where it stood at the start of legal proceedings.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

The price of the cryptocurrency has more than tripled in value since then, meaning the creditors will not benefit from bitcoin's higher prices, however most will benefit from an interest rate of 9 per cent.\n\n\"We are pleased to be in a position to propose a chapter 11 plan that contemplates the return of 100% of bankruptcy claim amounts plus interest for non-governmental creditors,\" Mr Ray III said.\n\nCustomers and creditors that claim $50,000 or less will get about 118 per cent of their claim, according to the plan, which was filed with the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. This covers about 98 per cent of customers.\n\nFTX said that it was able to recover funds by monetizing a collection of assets that mostly consisted of proprietary investments held by the Alameda or FTX Ventures businesses, or litigation claims.\n\nFTX, which was once the third-largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, filed for bankruptcy protection in November 2022 after it experienced the crypto equivalent of a bank run.\n\nThe company appointed its new CEO, a long-time bankruptcy litigator who is best known for having to clean up the mess made after the collapse of Enron.\n\n\"We are pleased to be in a position to propose a chapter 11 plan that contemplates the return of 100% of bankruptcy claim amounts plus interest for non-governmental creditors,\" Ray said in a prepared statement.\n\nThe bankruptcy court is set to hold a hearing on 25 June.\n\nIn March, former CEO and founder Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison for his role in overseeing the crypto exchange's demise.\n\nOnce known as the 'Crypto King', Bankman-Fried had previously been one of the industry's figureheads, appearing before Congress and seeking celebrity endorsements from the likes of NFL star Tom Brady and comedian Larry David.\n\nDuring his sentencing, Judge Lewis Kaplan said the 32-year-old had never uttered \"a word of remorse for the commission of terrible crimes\".\n\nAdditional reporting from agencies.\n\nREAD SOURCE", "source": {"uri": "businesstelegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Telegraph"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Repaying all claims and providing extra compensation for the time value of investments are the goals of the plan, which is contingent upon the permission of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware to be implemented.\n\nThe Strategy for Repayment\n\nThe strategy that is being presented contains a recovery percentage of 118% for creditors whose claims are less than $50,000, which is equivalent to 98% of FTX's creditors regarding the number of claims.\n\nIn addition, creditors who have claims that are more than fifty thousand dollars will be given full payback as well as extra compensation for the time value of their investments.\n\nAccording to the proposal, it is projected that the entire payout will be somewhere between $14.5 billion and $16.3 billion.\n\nFollowing the adoption of the proposal, it is anticipated that payments would go into effect within sixty days.\n\nValuation is the Subject of Controversy\n\nAccording to some who are opposed to the idea, the repayment of creditors based on the value of assets at the time of FTX's bankruptcy in November 2022 could not accurately represent the potential that their investments have at the present moment.\n\nIn the time after the crash, the cryptocurrency market has been subject to enormous volatility, with Bitcoin seeing a rise of roughly 280%.\n\nConcerns have been raised by a number of creditors, including Mike Belshe, the Chief Executive Officer of BitGo, who believes that the repayment plan does not take into account the true worth of assets.\n\nEfforts to Recover\n\nSince the collapse of FTX in 2022, the company has been working through a difficult process of rehabilitation.\n\nAn $8 billion shortfall was identified by the exchange, which prompted a number of different financial manoeuvres to be taken in order to reduce losses.\n\nThe fact that FTX has declared that it will not be relaunching its cryptocurrency exchange activities is indicative of a strategic shift from the business model that it had previously used.\n\nMysterious Transfers\n\nThe two wallets that are connected to FTX and its sister company, Alameda Research, were responsible for initiating significant cryptocurrency transactions that totaled $8.3 million.

(d.b.a. FTX.com) and its affiliated debtors (\"FTX\" or the \"Debtors\") today filed their anticipated amended Plan of Reorganization (the \"Plan\") and accompanying Disclosure Statement (the \"Disclosure Statement\") with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District Court of Delaware (the \"Bankruptcy Court\"). Subject to being finalized and approved by the Bankruptcy Court, the Plan contemplates the centralized distribution to customers and other creditors around the world of virtually all of the assets associated with FTX at the time of its collapse in November 2022, regardless of where the assets were located at that time.\n\nFTX forecasts that the total value of property collected, converted to cash and available for distribution will be between $14.5 and $16.3 billion. This amount includes assets under the control of the chapter 11 debtors as well as assets under the control of the Joint Official Liquidators of FTX Digital Markets, Ltd. (Bahamas), the Securities Commission of The Bahamas, the Joint Official Liquidators of FTX Australia, the United States Department of Justice and dozens of private parties that have cooperated in the recovery efforts.\n\nFTX has achieved this recovery level by monetizing an extraordinarily diverse collection of assets, most of which were proprietary investments held by the Alameda or FTX Ventures businesses, or litigation claims. As previously disclosed, FTX.com had a massive shortfall at the time of the chapter 11 filing in November 2022 -- holding only 0.1% of the Bitcoin and only 1.2% of the Ethereum customers believed it held. Accordingly, the Debtors have not been able to benefit from the appreciation of these missing tokens during the chapter 11 cases. Instead, the Debtors have had to look to other sources of recoverable value to repay creditors.\n\nThe Plan contemplates payment in full of all non-governmental creditors based on the value of their claims as determined by the Bankruptcy Court. In addition, the Plan contemplates a subordination arrangement with governmental creditors that allows payment of interest to the primary classes of customers and creditors at up to a 9% rate (the \"Consensus Rate\") from the commencement of the chapter 11 cases through the date of distribution. There also may be the opportunity for certain creditors to receive additional payments through the Supplemental Remission Fund described in Section 1.F of the Disclosure Statement.\n\nFor creditors holding claims in an allowed amount of $50,000 or less, the Plan creates a special \"convenience class\". Because of this classification, if the Plan is approved by the Bankruptcy Court, the Debtors anticipate that 98% of the creditors of FTX by number will receive approximately 118% of the amount of their allowed claims within 60 days after the effective date of the Plan, subject to know-your-client and distribution information requirements.\n\nAt the heart of the Plan are a series of settlements reached consensually with the key economic stakeholders. The key settlements (including those that are still subject to finalization and Court approval) include:\n\nResolution of the $24 billion in claims filed by the Internal Revenue Service for periods prior to the chapter 11 cases in return for a $200 million cash payment and a $685 million subordinated claim that will rank below claims of all creditors and governmental entities.\n\nA proposed agreement with the Internal Revenue Service to also subordinate tax claims arising after the commencement of the chapter 11 cases to payment of creditors in full with interest at the Consensus Rate.\n\nA proposed agreement with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and potentially other governmental claimants to both subordinate their claims to the payment of non-governmental creditors in full with interest at the Consensus Rate, and to contribute any recoveries on these subordinated claims to a special fund created by the Debtors for purposes of making supplemental restitution to certain customers and creditors. The Debtors have proposed that the Supplemental Remission Fund be made available to all customers and digital asset lenders. Details of this arrangement remain to be finalized.\n\nA proposed arrangement with the Department of Justice pursuant to which over $1.2 billion of forfeiture proceeds can, if the Department of Justice decides, be distributed to customers and creditors through the chapter 11 cases with no incremental administrative expense or delay.\n\nThe previously disclosed customer property settlement with the Ad Hoc Committee of Non-U.S. Customers, the Class Action Claimants and the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors, which provides for the arm's-length settlement of customer property assertions in return for a special priority for customers in the Plan.\n\nThe previously approved settlement with the Joint Official Liquidators of FTX Digital Markets, Ltd.

With the upcoming sale of its assets, FTX is expected to have approximately $16.3 billion in cash, surpassing its $11 billion debt to customers and other non-governmental creditors. Ray said:\n\nIn any bankruptcy, this is just an unbelievable result.\n\nWhile bankruptcy victims will receive full payments with interest, court documents suggest that equity holders are unlikely to receive any residual amounts. Depending on the type of claim, some creditors could potentially recover up to 142% of their owed amounts. Still, most customers may receive 118% of their account balances at the time of the bankruptcy filing.\n\nFTX's restructuring advisers suggested setting up a fund to compensate certain creditors, using funds that would have otherwise been collected by regulatory bodies. The timeline for this initiative is not yet clear, but payouts are expected to occur in the coming months.\n\nFollowing the news around the defunct exchange's newfound wealth, FTX Token (FTT) -- the trading platform's native token -- surged to $2, gaining over 33% according to CoinMarketCap data. The cryptocurrency exchange collapsed in November 2022 amid allegations of embezzlement and misappropriation of billions of dollars in customer funds involving its owners and affiliated hedge fund Alameda Research.\n\nSam Bankman-Fried, the founder of FTX, was sentenced to 25 years in prison and ordered to pay back $11 billion.

The proposed plan includes resolution of the $24 billion in IRS claims with \"a $200 million cash payment and a $685 million subordinated claim that will rank below claims of all creditors and governmental entities.\" The plan also includes restoring $1.2 billion seized by the DOJ to be disbursed to customers and creditors, if the DOJ agrees.\n\nFor creditors holding claims in an allowed amount of $50,000 or less, the Plan creates a special \"convenience class\".

Under a plan filed in federal bankruptcy court in Delaware, virtually all FTX's creditors, including hundreds of thousands of ordinary investors who used the exchange to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, would receive cash payments equivalent to 118 percent of the assets they had stored on FTX, the lawyers said.\n\nThose payments would flow from a pool of assets that FTX's lawyers have pulled together in the 17 months since the exchange collapsed, the lawyers said.\n\nBut the recoveries come with a caveat. The amount owed to customers was calculated based on the value of their holdings at the time of FTX's bankruptcy in November 2022. That means customers won't reap the benefits of a recent surge in the crypto market that sent the price of Bitcoin to a record high. A customer who lost one Bitcoin when FTX imploded, for example, would be entitled to less than $20,000, even though a Bitcoin is now worth more than $60,000.\n\nIt will take months for the payouts to begin. The plan must be approved by the federal judge overseeing FTX's bankruptcy, John T. Dorsey.\n\nStill, a major recovery of customer money seemed unlikely when FTX collapsed after a run on deposits. Before its implosion, customers used FTX as a marketplace to buy and sell digital currencies and stored billions of dollars in crypto on the platform.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketplace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marketplace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Digital currency"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/08/world/08FTX-Recovery/08FTX-Recovery-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547890", "eventUri": "eng-9547890", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

It is, however, still well below what assets held on the platform in November 2022 would be worth today.\n\nFTX Customers Miss Out on Bull Market\n\nFTX's insolvency proceedings said that creditors would be repaid in fiat based on the value of their assets at 15:00 UTC on November 11, 2022.\n\nBack then, Bitcoin was worth around $17,000 and Ethereum was about $1,300. Today, BTC is worth more than $62,000 and ETH more than $3,000.\n\nIn other words, BTC worth $1,000 at the time FTX claims are valued at would be worth more than $3,760 today. The equivalent ETH investment is now worth $2,310. Indeed, some altcoins have climbed even more than that.\n\nCompared to crypto market gains in the last year and a half, FTX's pledge to refund customers the dollar value of their assets at the bottom of the bear market is underwhelming.\n\nBut at the same time, if cryptocurrency prices hadn't risen creditors would be even worse off.\n\nHow FTX Recouped Its Losses\n\nThe FTX estate reached a deal to liquidate its assets in April last year, appointing Galaxy Digital to oversee the sales. However, the first tranche of liquidations didn't occur until October. The firm has been offloading cryptocurrency bit by bit since then.\n\nAfter selling off its cryptocurrency holding, often at a significant market discount, FTX filed an amended restructuring plan on Tuesday, May 7.\n\nThe filing states that the bankrupt firm has between $14.5 billion and $16.3 billion to distribute to creditors - more than enough to cover its $11.2 billion of debt.\n\nWhy Not Crypto Repayments?\n\nMany FTX customers would rather receive their reimbursement in crypto. However, that was unlikely to ever happen, given how the exchange collapsed. After all, if FTX had the crypto it owed back in 2022, the entire crisis might not have happened.\n\nSome disgruntled creditors have pointed to the Mt. Gox bankruptcy, which pursued a different path by opting to reimburse users with Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.\n\nMt. Gox users who opted for crypto disbursements won't receive the full amount of Bitcoin they held on the platform. However, they are still much better off than they would be if their claims were priced in the fiat value of BTC when the exchange collapsed in 2014.\n\nCompared to Mt. Gox, FTX offered a much wider range of cryptocurrencies. Distributing the company's crypto holdings like-for-like while fairly sharing the cost of CEO Sam Bankman-Fried's embezzlement would have been a complex undertaking. It is likely the largest and most influential creditors would have little appetite it.", "source": {"uri": "ccn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CCN - Capital & Celeb News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_morales@ccn.com", "name": "James Morales", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ethereum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insolvency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Insolvency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fiat money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidation", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liquidation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Bankman-Fried", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Bankman-Fried"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_Cash", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin Cash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mt.

Let's discover more about this news from FTX.\n\nThe exchange has reported that it owes approximately $11.2 billion to its creditors. However, it has also revealed that it currently possesses between $14.5 billion and $16.4 billion in assets available for distribution. This substantial amount exceeds the debts FTX has acknowledged, positioning the company to meet its obligations. Additionally, it may allow FTX to repay some customers more than their initial claims.\n\nUnder the proposed reorganization plan, FTX has outlined specific repayment details that indicate an over 100% repayment rate for certain groups of creditors. Specifically, customers with claims of $50,000 or less are set to receive 118% of their claim amount. Furthermore, the plan stipulates that 98% of all creditors will be able to access this repayment scheme. If approved, this plan would significantly relieve most affected users, whose funds have been frozen since the platform's collapse.\n\nThe ability to amass such a significant pool of funds for repayment stems from the sale of assets and venture investments made by FTX and Alameda Research, the two entities primarily involved in the financial turmoil. These sales and investments have evidently been fruitful, allowing FTX to propose a recovery plan that not only returns the principal amounts but, in some cases, provides an additional financial buffer to its creditors.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that while FTX has prepared this plan, it still requires approval from a bankruptcy court. This upcoming court decision is critical as it will determine whether the proposed repayment structure can be implemented as designed.\n\nThe information discussed by Altcoin Buzz is not financial advice.

Here's why some are still angry", "body": "Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, seen here in February of 2023, was convicted of fraud and sentenced to 25 years in prison.\n\nEditor's Note: A version of this story appeared in CNN Business' Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free, here.\n\nNew York CNN --\n\nPeople who had money in FTX at the time of its collapse nearly 18 months ago got very lucky this week, as far as bankruptcy proceedings go. But some of them are still, understandably, pretty ticked off.\n\nICYMI: FTX, the crypto exchange that has become a byword for fraud and a black eye on the face of the entire digital asset industry, said that virtually all of the people who had money frozen on the platform will get their money back, plus interest.\n\nThat is an extraordinary outcome. Creditors are rarely made whole in bankruptcy, and it often takes years to claw back whatever pennies on the dollar they're owed.\n\nAnd yet, for FTX customers, there's an unavoidable twinge of resentment over what could have been.\n\nSee here: If you had one bitcoin in an FTX account in mid-November of 2022, it was worth about $17,500. Two months ago, when bitcoin hit its all-time high, it would have fetched $73,700.\n\nToday, it'd be worth more than $61,000.\n\nIn other words, if you'd been able to hold onto that bitcoin, you could have seen its value go up more than 300%.\n\nSorry, Tom Brady\n\nThe speed and scale of the asset recovery is an especially surprising outcome considering the state of FTX when it landed in the hands of John Ray III, the restructuring expert who shepherded the bankruptcy. Ray, who handled Enron's liquidation, described FTX as a staggeringly mismanaged company with almost no formalized bookkeeping -- a total mess.\n\nRay's team now says it expects 98% of FTX creditors to receive approximately 118% of the amount of their claims. The bankruptcy managers tracked down all of FTX's crypto and other holdings and hired an investment manager to sell them. All of that took time, and while it was happening, crypto markets staged a stunning comeback. The bull run inflated the value of FTX's significant crypto holdings, leaving the estate with more than enough to pay back customers.\n\nFor that single bitcoin holder, that means after a year and half without being able to access their $17,500 in bitcoin, they'll get about $20,650 back.\n\nIt could be worse! FTX's shareholders -- people like Tom Brady and private equity firms like Sequoia Capital -- are almost certain to see their equity in the once high-flying crypto startup totally wiped out. Although FTX said it would have as much as $16 billion to disburse, customers and Uncle Sam get paid out first.\n\nWhat about SBF?\n\nFTX's founder and its former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, got a 25-year prison sentence for stealing customer funds and frittering them away on side projects.\n\nPretty much from the moment his crypto empire collapsed, SBF has been making the case that FTX was actually solvent. The money was always there, just, like, not in the most liquid form, he claimed. If he'd just had more time, he could have gotten everyone their money back...\n\nOf course, that's a somewhat fantastical claim.\n\nSure, the crypto fever returned, but that's partly because the industry was able to pin the blame for the meltdown on SBF.\n\nProsecutors and the judge were extremely unmoved by SBF's claim during sentencing that because customers would likely be made whole that there was effectively no harm, no foul.\n\nThat argument seemed to really irk Ray, the guy who's spent the past year and a half sifting through the rubble of FTX and hunting down its globe-spanning assets. In a letter to the court ahead of Bankman-Fried's sentencing, Ray wrote that the company Bankman-Fried left behind was \"neither solvent nor safe.\"", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "allison_morrow@cnn.com", "name": "Allison Morrow", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Bankman-Fried", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Bankman-Fried"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN_Business", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN Business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clawback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clawback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Enron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookkeeping", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bookkeeping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidation", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liquidation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Investment management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequoia_Capital", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sequoia Capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_equity_firm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Private equity firm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hunting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Customer_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Customer Management", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Unclaimed_Money", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Unclaimed Money", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cryptography", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cryptography", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2023-02-09t164411z-661526906-rc2s7z9imwbt-rtrmadp-3-usa-bankman-fried.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547890", "eventUri": "eng-9547890", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

The company has recovered some $8 billion in assets, and all of FTX's creditors will receive cash payments equal to 118 percent of the assets they had kept in the exchange, the company's bankruptcy lawyers said, according to the Times.\n\nThe amount of money that FTX has found is \"in general pretty unheard of,\" Yesha Yadav, a Vanderbilt University law professor, told the newspaper. \"That's something that is really quite astonishing for a major bankruptcy.\"\n\nWhile FTX customers will be receiving refunds, the amount of money will be based on their holdings' value when the company went bankrupt a year and a half ago, the Times noted. So if someone had just one bitcoin back then, they would receive less than $20,000, even though a bitcoin is currently worth more than $60,000. And it will take a while before people begin to see that cash: The judge overseeing FTX's bankruptcy has to approve the plan, which could take months, if not longer depending on any pushback from creditors.\n\nStill, it's impressive that FTX's clients are getting any money back at all. Bankman-Fried was convicted of using billions of dollars from his customers for political donations, investments, and other personal spending, and he currently serving 25 years in prison as a result. But FTX was able to get back much of the money: It sold the majority of its stake in the artificial-intelligence company Anthropic for $884 million, the Times wrote, and took back more than $400 million from a hedge fund that Bankman-Fried had financed. Plus, lawyers have sued those involved in the company, including Bankman-Fried's parents, in an attempt to get money from them.\n\nThe latest development in the FTX scandal is likely welcome news for those who thought they had no chance of retrieving their lost dollars from the failed company. Hundreds of thousands of everyday investors had bought and sold crypto via the exchange, The New York Times noted.

Prosecutors revealed during the trial that Bankman-Fried had misappropriated funds from FTX to support personal ventures and other business interests under the guise of Alameda Research, a related hedge fund.\n\nFollowing a month-long trial, Bankman-Fried was convicted on all charges in a Manhattan federal court, concluding with a 25-year prison sentence handed down in March this year. He was also ordered to forfeit over $11 billion, underscoring the scale of the financial devastation caused by his actions.\n\nIn addition to outlining the recovered amount, FTX's statement shed light on the complex asset recovery process, which included monetizing a diverse portfolio of investments and litigation claims previously held by Alameda and FTX Ventures. However, due to the initial discrepancies in the crypto holdings reported by FTX at the time of the Chapter 11 filing, the appreciation of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum could not be capitalized upon.\n\nFTX has stated that all non-governmental creditors will be fully compensated based on the claim values determined by the Bankruptcy Court. A special arrangement will also be made for governmental creditors, which includes the accrual of interest at up to 9% from the initiation of the Chapter 11 proceedings until the funds are distributed.", "source": {"uri": "naijanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Naija News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "olawale_adeniyi@naijanews.com", "name": "Olawale Adeniyi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_J._Ray_III", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John J.

Here's why some are still angry - KION546", "body": "New York (CNN) -- People who had money in FTX at the time of its collapse nearly 18 months ago got very lucky this week, as far as bankruptcy proceedings go. But some of them are still, understandably, pretty ticked off.\n\nICYMI: FTX, the crypto exchange that has become a byword for fraud and a black eye on the face of the entire digital asset industry, said that virtually all of the people who had money frozen on the platform will get their money back, plus interest.\n\nThat is an extraordinary outcome. Creditors are rarely made whole in bankruptcy, and it often takes years to claw back whatever pennies on the dollar they're owed.\n\nAnd yet, for FTX customers, there's an unavoidable twinge of resentment over what could have been.\n\nSee here: If you had one bitcoin in an FTX account in mid-November of 2022, it was worth about $17,500. Two months ago, when bitcoin hit its all-time high, it would have fetched $73,700.\n\nToday, it'd be worth more than $61,000.\n\nIn other words, if you'd been able to hold onto that bitcoin, you could have seen its value go up more than 300%.\n\nThe speed and scale of the asset recovery is an especially surprising outcome considering the state of FTX when it landed in the hands of John Ray III, the restructuring expert who shepherded the bankruptcy. Ray, who handled Enron's liquidation, described FTX as a staggeringly mismanaged company with almost no formalized bookkeeping -- a total mess.\n\nRay's team now says it expects 98% of FTX creditors to receive approximately 118% of the amount of their claims. The bankruptcy managers tracked down all of FTX's crypto and other holdings and hired an investment manager to sell them. All of that took time, and while it was happening, crypto markets staged a stunning comeback. The bull run inflated the value of FTX's significant crypto holdings, leaving the estate with more than enough to pay back customers.\n\nFor that single bitcoin holder, that means after a year and half without being able to access their $17,500 in bitcoin, they'll get about $20,650 back.\n\nIt could be worse! FTX's shareholders -- people like Tom Brady and private equity firms like Sequoia Capital -- are almost certain to see their equity in the once high-flying crypto startup totally wiped out. Although FTX said it would have as much as $16 billion to disburse, customers and Uncle Sam get paid out first.\n\nFTX's founder and its former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, got a 25-year prison sentence for stealing customer funds and frittering them away on side projects.\n\nPretty much from the moment his crypto empire collapsed, SBF has been making the case that FTX was actually solvent. The money was always there, just, like, not in the most liquid form, he claimed. If he'd just had more time, he could have gotten everyone their money back...\n\nOf course, that's a somewhat fantastical claim.\n\nSure, the crypto fever returned, but that's partly because the industry was able to pin the blame for the meltdown on SBF.\n\nProsecutors and the judge were extremely unmoved by SBF's claim during sentencing that because customers would likely be made whole that there was effectively no harm, no foul.\n\nThat argument seemed to really irk Ray, the guy who's spent the past year and a half sifting through the rubble of FTX and hunting down its globe-spanning assets. In a letter to the court ahead of Bankman-Fried's sentencing, Ray wrote that the company Bankman-Fried left behind was \"neither solvent nor safe.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

This means that these creditors stand to receive not only the full value of their claims but also an additional 18% as compensation for the time their funds have been tied up in the bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nFor non-governmental creditors with claims above $50,000, FTX proposes to repay 100% of their claims plus up to 9% interest. While this may seem like a generous offer, some industry experts argue that it still falls short of being truly fair to creditors.\n\nThe Controversy Surrounding the Plan\n\nThe main point of contention lies in the fact that FTX's repayment plan is based on the value of creditors' assets at the time of the exchange's bankruptcy in November 2022.\n\nSince then, the cryptocurrency market has experienced a significant resurgence, with Bitcoin, for example, rising by nearly 280%.\n\nCritics argue that creditors should be entitled to recover their funds in an amount equivalent to current market prices, rather than the value at the time of FTX's collapse.\n\nMike Belshe, CEO of BitGo, expressed his dissatisfaction with the proposal on social media, stating,\n\n\"I understand why the bankruptcy process needs to work this way but let's not pretend victims are getting their money back.\"\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding the repayment plan, it is undoubtedly a step forward in the lengthy and complex process of resolving FTX's bankruptcy. The proposal must now be approved by a Delaware bankruptcy court before it can be implemented.\n\nIt is worth noting that FTX has confirmed that its restructuring plans will not include a reboot of the cryptocurrency exchange, which was once among the largest platforms by trading volume. Instead, the focus remains on maximizing recoveries for creditors and navigating the legal and regulatory challenges that lie ahead.\n\nWhile the proposed repayment plan may not satisfy everyone, it is a significant milestone in the ongoing efforts to bring closure to those affected by FTX's collapse.\n\nThe post FTX Creditors to Receive Compensation, but Some Argue It's Not Enough appeared first on Blockonomi.", "source": {"uri": "cryptodaily.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "cryptodaily.co.uk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitGo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BitGo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volume (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Compensation_and_Benefits", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Compensation and Benefits", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Urban_and_Regional_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Urban and Regional Planning", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/World_War_II_Dormant_Accounts", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/World War II Dormant Accounts", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Substance_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Substance Abuse", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 48}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 46}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547890", "eventUri": "eng-9547890", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

The meteoric ascent of bitcoin prices, soaring from the depths of $20,000 during FTX's nadir in November 2022 to an astronomical valuation presently, has proven instrumental in boosting the exchange's fiscal viability.\n\nWhile the legal guarantee of full reimbursement offers solace to FTX creditors, the bitter taste of missed opportunities lingers among former platform users, who were compelled to offload their crypto holdings at discounted rates during the exchange's collapse.\n\nThe winds of fortune further favored FTX with its lucrative stake in the AI startup Anthropic, fetching a handsome sum of $824 million upon divestment earlier this year. However, the shadow of ignominy loomed over the exchange's erstwhile figurehead, Sam Bankman-Fried, who found himself ensnared in the web of legal tussles, culminating in a 25-year prison sentence handed to him in March.\n\nAs part of the courtroom drama, Bankman-Fried attempted to plead for leniency, contending that the anticipated restitution to depositors should mitigate his culpability. However, Judge Lewis Kaplan rebuffed this plea, likening it to a thief seeking absolution after squandering ill-gotten gains in the gambler's den of Las Vegas.\n\nBankman-Fried maintained that he was innocent of any fraud throughout the trial, claiming that the implosion of FTX was a result of unintentional mistakes.\n\n'I never thought that what I was doing was illegal. But I tried to hold myself to a high standard, and I certainly didn't meet that standard,\" he said.\n\nThe proposed FTX repayment plan awaits court approval before funds can be disbursed to former depositors. John Ray's intervention and subsequent management of FTX have played a pivotal role in its rehabilitation, notwithstanding initial opposition from Bankman-Fried, who had hoped for a successor committed to maintaining the company's operations.", "source": {"uri": "tekedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tekedia"}, "authors": [{"uri": "samuel_nwite@tekedia.com", "name": "Samuel Nwite", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ray", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Ray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_11,_Title_11,_United_States_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Bankman-Fried", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Bankman-Fried"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidation", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liquidation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Non-governmental organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_asset", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Digital asset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Enron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Astronomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divestment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Divestment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drug rehabilitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://tkcdn.tekedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/09111942/FTX.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547890", "eventUri": "eng-9547890", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

This revelation is set to bring relief and renewed hope to those who had feared their investments were lost forever.\n\nFTX made an official statement on Tuesday, revealing its optimistic projection that approximately 98% of its creditors will receive around 118% of their allowed claims. This means that the majority of individuals affected by the collapse can anticipate not only a full recovery of their investments but also additional compensation in the form of billions of dollars in interest. FTX's commitment to restoring the faith of its customers is truly commendable.\n\nAccording to FTX's updated reorganization plan, which was recently submitted to the Delaware bankruptcy court, the company expects the total value of converted assets available for distribution to range between $14.5 and $16.3 billion. This substantial sum will be funded by the company's existing cash reserves, available NFTs, wind-down cash proceeds, and any remaining assets. The comprehensive nature of this plan demonstrates FTX's determination to rectify its past mistakes and provide the best possible outcome for all stakeholders involved.\n\nTo ensure fairness and transparency, FTX will calculate shareholders' claims based on their holdings as of November 2022, the time when the crypto exchange filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. This method guarantees that all parties are treated equitably, and the distribution process is devoid of favoritism or bias. Former customers, who had previously faced the distressing reality of locked-up funds during the court proceedings, can now look forward to the retrieval of their hard-earned money.\n\nThe collapse of FTX was not without its share of dramatic events. Sam Bankman-Fried, co-founder of the crypto exchange and once known as the \"Crypto King,\" was convicted of fraud last year in relation to FTX's downfall. In March, he was sentenced to a lengthy prison term of 25 years. The conviction underscores the importance of maintaining trust and integrity within the cryptocurrency industry, while offering hope that justice will be served to those responsible for any wrongdoing.\n\nAlthough the new reorganization plan is still pending finalization and court approval, customers can anticipate the commencement of fund disbursement within 60 days of the plan's effective date, which will be determined by the court. This swift timeline signifies FTX's commitment to promptly fulfilling its obligations and allowing affected individuals to reclaim their investments without prolonged delays or uncertainty.\n\nJohn J. Ray III, CEO and chief restructuring officer of FTX, expressed his gratitude to both the customers and the creditors for their unwavering patience throughout the arduous 17-month-long process. His acknowledgment of their endurance underscores the immense challenges faced by all parties involved and the collective relief felt by achieving a resolution that upholds the interests of non-governmental creditors.\n\nAs FTX progresses toward the finalization of its reorganization plan, the potential for customers to recover nearly 100% of their lost funds represents a significant milestone. This remarkable turnaround not only serves as a beacon of hope for those affected but also highlights the resilience and determination of FTX to rectify the past and rebuild a brighter future.\n\nThe comprehensive reorganization plan put forth by FTX, coupled with the commitment to compensating its customers and creditors, signifies a groundbreaking chapter in the company's history.

This clause, unveiled in FTX's amended plan released on May 7, has garnered attention and criticism from stakeholders within the cryptocurrency community.\n\nFTX's amended plan, presented on May 7, introduces significant changes to the repayment strategy for creditors. Notably, the proposal promises substantial compensation and an 11% payout to over 98% of creditors.\n\nHowever, the focal point of contention revolves around the exculpatory clause embedded within the plan.\n\nThe inclusion of the exculpatory clause has sparked criticism from creditors, notably the FTX Customer Ad-Hoc Committee representing over 1,500 creditors. Sunil, a committee member, voiced concerns over potential misconduct by S&C, citing asset sales at significant discounts and failures to restart FTX 2.0.\n\nMeanwhile, Sullivan & Cromwell, a century-old law firm overseeing FTX's bankruptcy proceedings, faces accusations of benefiting from FTX's alleged multibillion-dollar fraud. However, it was found that FTX owed up to $1.45 billion in legal bankruptcy fees to the S&C law firm, based on compensation filings from December 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, the creditors have raised concerns about S&C's role and the potential conflict of interest, given its historical ties to FTX and its involvement in several key transactions.\n\nFTX creditors and industry experts have expressed skepticism and dissatisfaction with the amended proposal. Pseudonymous FTX creditor Rob, also head of growth at Paradex, voiced strong opposition, citing concerns over accountability and fairness.\n\nThe sentiment among creditors reflects broader apprehension regarding the proposed compensation structure and the exculpatory clause.\n\nWith the fate of FTX's amended plan hanging in the balance, stakeholders await the outcome of the upcoming creditor vote.

The plan also includes a substantial compensation offer to account for the time value of their investments.\n\nWhile customers initially expected to be the primary beneficiaries, the biggest winners in this repayment plan are not the customers themselves but rather bankruptcy traders.\n\nAs reported by Bitcoinist, FTX's reorganization plan, filed with the United States Bankruptcy Court of Delaware, outlines the allocation of funds to customers affected by the exchange's fraudulent scheme.\n\nThe plan involves a centralized distribution of all the company's assets from its collapse in November 2022 to its creditors and customers. FTX has disclosed various settlements with primary economic stakeholders, some pending finalization and court approval.\n\nNotably, a key settlement involves resolving the $24 billion in claims filed by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), with FTX agreeing to a $200 million cash payment and a $685 million subordinate claim.\n\nContrary to expectations, the true beneficiaries of the repayment plan are bankruptcy traders who swiftly moved to purchase claims at a fraction of their value before FTX officially filed for bankruptcy.\n\nThese hedge funds and individual investors have seen the bid price of claims rise from 10% to 101%, demonstrating their shrewdness in seizing this opportunity.\n\nAccording to Fortune Magazine, hedge funds specializing in distressed debt, such as Attestor, Baupost, and Farallon, have emerged as frontrunners in reaping substantial returns from FTX's assets.\n\nThese funds, which acquired claims worth \"hundreds of millions of dollars,\" stand to make significant profits. Other notable beneficiaries include Louis d'Origny, the founder of claims buying platform FTX Creditor, who is set to profit over $25 million from personal investments.\n\nHowever, while the repayment plan has yielded impressive gains for some, not all claimants are satisfied. Some investors argue that the present-day value of their crypto tokens should be honored, expressing concerns over how assets were sold.\n\nArush Sehgal, an investor and former member of the FTX unsecured creditors' committee, criticizes the estate's selling practices and claims that damage done by the current administrator exceeds the original crime committed by former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nThe failed co-founder and CEO of the exchange Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison for defrauding customers and is currently being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn.\n\nFTT is trading at $2.015, up more than 25% in the last 24 hours alone, fueled by the repayment announcement.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com", "source": {"uri": "bitcoinist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bitcoinist.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hedge fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fortune (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internal Revenue Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distressed_securities", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Distressed securities"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Bankman-Fried", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Bankman-Fried"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsecured_creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unsecured creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/shutterstock_download-7.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547890", "eventUri": "eng-9547890", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

However, the plan faces pushback from Sunil Kavuri, who speaks for the largest group of creditors. Kavuri has called for a rejection of the proposed restructuring, arguing that repayments should reflect the current market prices of assets, not their value at the time of FTX's bankruptcy.\n\nKavuri said the pricing in the petition for repayment underestimated the actual value of FTX customer holdings. He claimed that the FTX debtors had caused creditors more than $10 billion in losses.\n\nThe restructuring unit of FTX recovered assets worth between $14.5 and $16.3 billion after a 17-month period, which is more than the exchange's estimated shortfall of $8 to $10 billion at the time of its collapse. With these recovered funds, the firm asserts it can compensate 98% of FTX's users.\n\nThose with claims of $50,000 or less are slated to receive at least 118% of their asset value within two months of court approval, while the rest are to be paid the full value of their assets plus a 9% interest rate for the holding period.\n\nKavuri also pointed out an ongoing lawsuit against Sullivan & Cromwell (S&C), the law firm handling FTX's bankruptcy, over their previous relationship with the exchange. He opposes the inclusion of an exculpation clause that protects S&C from lawsuits related to misconduct.\n\nThe law firm was previously sued by a group of FTX creditors represented by Edwin Garrison. The creditors alleged the firm knowingly provided services or assistance that directly enabled or facilitated FTX's fraudulent activities.\n\nS&C was also selected to oversee Binance following its settlement with the US Department of Justice.", "source": {"uri": "cryptobriefing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Crypto Briefing"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vivian_nguyen@cryptobriefing.com", "name": "Vivian Nguyen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fair market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debtor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Debtor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binance", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Binance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sullivan_&_Cromwell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sullivan & Cromwell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_firm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law firm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://static.cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/08193133/img-GUENwZ3knz4qxcTVrvK4M9eH-800x457.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547890", "eventUri": "eng-9547890", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

According to an FTX court filing, almost all of FTX's customers will be able to recover their losses.\n\nFTX owes its creditors a staggering $11.2 billion. However, customers who file claims of $50,000 or less will receive approximately 118% of the amount of their claim, subject to approval by the bankruptcy court overseeing the case.\n\nAnother chapter in the closing saga of collapse.Crypto Exchange FTX, according to a court filing.The company is saying almost all of its customers will get their money back.The company is saying it owes creditors about $11.2 billion and the plan says that customers whose claims amount to $50,000 or less will receive approximately 118% of the amount of their allowed claim the reorganisation and still has to be approved by the bankruptcy court here.It's worth noting that, of course, when the company collapsed when FTX went down back in 2022 late 2022 Bitcoin at that price back then was what, somewhere around $20,000?And as we're taking a look at BT C US D here today, I don't know if we have the chart that we can toss up here on the screen, but we should still be north of $60,000.61 $62,000 if you want to round up at home.So all these things considered there's kind of AAA hefty delta between what some of these people may have owned within FTX and what they will be owed as a result of this settlement, too.Yeah, that's such a good point there, Brad.Especially when you take a look at the behaviour here of Bitcoin ahead of this bankruptcy filing, right, Because they had sold off just about 50% here ahead of that.So when you compare that the time of the value there, what it was during that from this bankruptcy filing to what it was today Seriously, A very, very large gap.And it's also about where this funding is going to come from nearly 100% of them, or 99% of it coming from what they had raised from the company's investment portfolio and within that reports here, that anthropic they're holding there, uh, they they sold the shares there and that for nearly $900 million this year.So again, many of the many of those who have been affected by this filing are going to get 100 and 100 and 18 cents.I guess on the dollar here, when it comes to when it all evens out.But again, like you were saying, this has to be approved.There are still a couple of processes that need to take place before this is finalised.But I think that this doesn't really remove the uncertainty aspect surrounding crypto surrounding Bitcoin, right and why so many people even remain on the sidelines when it comes to these type of investments.Yes, you can make the argument.FX is very much a one off type situation the fraud, the allegations, everything that had been confirmed there and found in court.But still, when people think about investing in crypto, I think there is a hesitation here with a large portion of the investment audience who is a bit sceptical and a bit nervous of putting their money in crypto because of everything that has played out over the last several years.We've had some major profiles that have tried to emerge meant themselves as Bitcoin or crypto barons instead of making sure that they were cementing the service of the product that they were providing to actually sustain the well being of sentiment for the industry as a whole here and and what What do we mean by that?I mean, you, you look at FTX and and Sam Beman Fried now who has also for FTX.They've had to previously approve a settlement with blackly as well that the largest creditor of FTX.There have been continued missteps for the people who were looked at as barons.That's put a dent in the sentiment.And it Homo points exactly back to why, uh, Satoshi, who wrote the and and pioneered the Bitcoin white paper, is so anonymous because it wasn't supposed to be annexed or be able to be made or broken by one figure and one figure alone here.And so that was the prevailing origin story for Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency here, uh, larger question here of now when you've got so many large financial institutions involved and invested where there's gonna be more of an effort to make sure that there is regulatory practises that actually solidify the sentiment from this point forward.Yeah, exactly.We were talking a bit to Anthony and Pagliano about that yesterday.And just in terms of what exactly that could potentially look like here in the years to come", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

The FTX estate owes creditors roughly $11 billion, though it has managed to cobble together between $14.5 and $16.3 billion in cash.\n\nThe returns are \"really unheard of,\" Jonathan Groth, partner at DGIM Law, told Blockworks.\n\nA crypto bull run and the potential subordination of big government claims have spurred the estates projecting better-than-expected returns, noted Erin Broderick, a partner at Eversheds Sutherland and lead counsel for the FTX.com customer claim holders.\n\n\"But to deliver the prospective recoveries, the debtors need stakeholder support,\" she told Blockworks. \"Delays in achieving that support are a threat to the value to ultimately be given back to customers.\"\n\nFTX said in a Wednesday press release that its plan would end disputes \"without costly and protracted litigation.\"\n\nMatthew Gold, a partner at Kleinberg Kaplan, said FTX could be referring to several potential legal actions -- including ongoing mediation regarding priority tax claims.\n\nThe FTX proposal would resolve the $24 billion claim by the Internal Revenue Service for periods prior to the Chapter 11 proceedings. This resolution would be in return for $200 million in cash and a $685 million subordinated claim that would rank below all other claims.\n\n\"Also, the plan is in essence a proposed settlement of disputes regarding the relative priority of creditors of the various silos,\" Gold added. \"If those allocations are challenged, the litigation could be costly and protracted.\"\n\nGroth noted that while some creditors pushed for the estate to pay back claims at current prices (bitcoin, for example, was trading under $20,000 when FTX declared bankruptcy, but is now over $60,000) the FTX estate just didn't have the crypto.\n\n\"When FTX went into bankruptcy, they were holding a fraction of the percent of the coins that they were claiming to have,\" he said. \"The fund they amassed to repay creditors is really based more on liquidation of securities holdings...and other recoveries from third-party claims and selling off other assets.\"\n\nEven if some creditors are unhappy with the plan, Groth said \"it'll be really difficult for a court to look at this and say, 'How unhappy can you be?...You're being made whole.'\"\n\nOverall, Broderick said she believes the plan is \"a good outcome for customers\" that came as a result of \"hard-fought negotiations\" concerning the interest of all stakeholders.\n\n\"We will continue to be closely involved in plan developments, including with the governmental agencies, and have been focused on assisting the estates with distribution mechanics and potential issues to ensure that customers get the largest initial distribution possible as soon as possible,\" Broderick noted\n\nWhile the FTX debtors have proposed a \"confirmation timeline,\" bankruptcy code procedural requirements take time. The court must first hold a disclosure statement hearing -- currently scheduled for June 25 -- at which point it can pencil in a confirmation hearing date.\n\nThose hearings could be 60 days apart in a large case like this, Gold said.\n\nAccording to the current court docket, there are other hearings planned for July and August as well.\n\nThe plan also contains what Gold called \"controversial elements,\" like release and injunction provisions that would shield many non-debtor entities from lawsuits.\n\nThe question of whether a bankruptcy court can impose releases of claims against non-debtors in this way, and to what extent, is before the Supreme Court in a case involving Purdue Pharma.\n\nWhether the releases in the FTX plan are lawful will depend on how the court rules, Gold said.\n\n\"This plan and disclosure statement are best understood as negotiation documents,\" he added. \"They are signed as draft versions, and have many blanks in them. Further negotiations will likely be required before they are finalized.\"\n\nThough the plan could be the final one filed with the bankruptcy court, Groth said, that'll depend on factors including the creditor vote and the government negotiations.\n\nSuch details will be up for discussion at the upcoming hearing to decide whether the current iteration should be \"rejected or needs to be modified in some significant way.\"", "source": {"uri": "blockworks.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "Blockworks"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eversheds_Sutherland", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eversheds Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stakeholder (corporate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debtor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Debtor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mediation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_11,_Title_11,_United_States_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidation", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liquidation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internal Revenue Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Security (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purdue_Pharma", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Purdue Pharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advice_and_consent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advice and consent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docket_(court)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Docket (court)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_law", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Procedural law"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injunction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Injunction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_bankruptcy_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States bankruptcy court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://blockworks.co/_next/image?url=https://blockworks-co.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ftx-pink.jpg&w=1920&q=75&webp=false", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547890", "eventUri": "eng-9547890", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-25", "textStart": 3451, "textEnd": 3458}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

But now, FTX's lawyers say they plan to give back that money. They'll repay everyone who lost less than $50,000 with 118% of what they lost, including extra money as interest.\n\nBut this plan needs the okay from a Delaware court because FTX isn't trying to restart the exchange, they just want to pay people back.\n\nFTX has decided to give back everyone's money in dollars, but not everyone's happy about it. Many folks who lost money had invested in cryptocurrency, not cash. They worry that if FTX gives them dollars, they might miss out if the value of crypto goes up later on.\n\nThey're planning to pay everyone in dollars, but not everyone is happy about it. Many users and creditors originally invested in crypto, not cash. They worry that if they're paid in dollars, they might miss out if the value of crypto goes up in the future.\n\nRecently, FTX customers received an email from \"[email protected]\"(instead of Kroll mail) regarding the claims process. Some users have noticed that when converting their COIN holdings to USD, FTX calculates the value based on the lowest rates at the time of their bankruptcy. This means that even if the current value of their COINs is higher, they are being offered a significantly lower amount in USD.\n\nFor example, according to this calculation, someone with $40,000 worth of COINs might be forced to accept only $16,000.\n\nWhy are creditors furious about this decision?\n\nCustomers are raising concerns about the fairness of this approach. They argue that since they had COINs on FTX.com, not USD currency, they should receive the exact value of their assets back.\n\nThis has led to questions about the nature of this \"payback\" process. Many feel it's more akin to another loss rather than a true payback. Some even call it robbery.\n\nOne Reddit user named Ronitovi expressed his anger stating, \"this is not a payback - this is just another robbery over the incident.\"\n\nCustomers are wondering if there's a way to bypass this system, or if they reject the offered amount, will they end up with nothing? Additionally, they are considering their legal options, asking if they have the right to sue over this matter.\n\nSince the collapse, the value of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin has gone up a lot. For example, when FTX went down, Bitcoin was worth less than $20,000. Now it's worth over $62,000. So, even though customers will get their money back, they won't get back the potential profits they could have made if their Bitcoin had kept growing in value.", "source": {"uri": "cryptodaily.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "cryptodaily.co.uk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reddit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Paper_Money", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Paper Money", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Coins", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Coins", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Coins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Coins", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Paper_Money", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Paper Money", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 48}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547890", "eventUri": "eng-9547890", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

Bitcoin prices drop another 14%.\n\nNov. 10: Cryptocurrency lender BlockFi announced it is \"not able to do business as usual\" and was pausing client withdrawals as a result of FTX's implosion.\n\nNov. 11: FTX files for Chapter 11 and Bankman-Fried resigns.

In a surprising and positive development for claimants, the exchange's bankruptcy estate has now devised a plan that would pay creditors more than they're owed- in cash.\n\nFTX Unearths Billions to Pay Back Customers\n\nFailed crypto exchange FTX has found billions of dollars more than required to cover the losses users incurred during the SBF-led fiasco in November 2022. Surprisingly, the exchange is set to fully reimburse users plus interest -- a rare sight in US bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nFTX's newfound confidence stems from its recent efforts to liquidate assets, including its mountain loads of Solana, shares in successful startups like Anthropic, and its extensive list of illicitly acquired estates.\n\nWith as much as $16.3 billion in cash at its disposal for distribution, 50% more than it owes, FTX appears well-equipped to settle its debts, totaling around $11 billion to two million customers and other creditors.\n\nThe exchange's bankruptcy estate is now confident in reimbursing 98% of its creditors for 118% in claims- in cash.\n\nCreditors with allowed claims below $50,000 will be eligible for the 118% compensation pending court approval, as outlined in the plan. According to a recent court filing, FTX's proposal is slated to distribute the claims within 60 days of court approval.\n\nFTX's new restructuring plan aims for a \"centralized distribution\" among its customers, regardless of where their assets are located. The plan also seeks to leave no crumbs for shareholders. Court documents detailed that although all debts will be paid in full, plus interest, nothing will be left for equity holders.\n\nThis is primarily because US regulators and the IRS are bidding their time and waiting for FTX to repay its customers. Once the debts are cleared, regulators will likely wipe out shareholders' claims.\n\nFTX's major equity holders include Sequoia Capital, Thoma Bravo, Singapore's Temasek Holdings Pte and the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan, according to a court filing last year.\n\nThe defunct exchange's resurgence comes on the heels of the crypto market's rebound from the bear market.\n\nFTX's Bittersweet Conundrum\n\nBitcoin at press time hovered above $60,000, reaching a new all-time high earlier this year, while Solana, a significant part of FTX's holdings, comfortably sits above $140 and has climbed up to the top five rankings as one of the year's top performers.\n\nThe market's resurgence has been a boon for FTX, especially considering the uncertainty surrounding the bankruptcy estate's ability to repay customers, with initial projections suggesting only a 90% reimbursement.\n\nWhile FTX appears now more confident, the market's recent performance presents a dilemma. The total crypto market cap has surged by 210% since November 2022. However, FTX's restructuring plan will compensate victims based on the cash value of digital assets held on the exchange on November 11, 2022, the date of the bankruptcy -- ignoring the accumulated gains over the past two years.\n\nFTX customers could potentially miss out on billions in gains due to the structure of the Chapter 11 plan. Although many users have contested the proposal, arguing it was unfair due to the crypto market healing, FTX attorney Andy Dietderich asserted that US bankruptcy was 'very clear,' stating:\n\nStill, given the market volatility, it is a positive development that claimants are at least receiving compensation. The recent market conditions could not have been accurately predicted when the Chapter 11 plan was proposed.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nFTX's collapse had a very lasting impact on the crypto landscape. However, the new plan signals a positive development for the industry and the affected users. It brings them closer to receiving the compensation they were owed, even though they were given little hope earlier last year.\n\nWill Cardano and Bitcoin Cash collaborate?\n\nCardano's Hoskinson Gauges Bitcoin Cash Integration With Poll\n\nBTC-e founder bites the dust for laundering billions:\n\nBTC-e Founder Admits $9B Money Laundering Conspiracy Charge.", "source": {"uri": "dailycoin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DailyCoin"}, "authors": [{"uri": "insha_zia@dailycoin.com", "name": "Insha Zia", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solana_(blockchain_platform)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solana (blockchain platform)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidation", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liquidation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario_Teachers'_Pension_Plan", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequoia_Capital", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sequoia Capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_trend", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market trend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temasek_Holdings", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Temasek Holdings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internal Revenue Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BTC-e", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BTC-e"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_Cash", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin Cash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_asset", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Digital asset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_11,_Title_11,_United_States_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Money laundering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Financial_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Financial Planning", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Consulting", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Urban_and_Regional_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Urban and Regional Planning", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Strategic", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Strategic", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://dailycoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ftx_sale_sell_assets_garage_dry_token_web-1200x800.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547890", "eventUri": "eng-9547890", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2011-11-", "textStart": 3050, "textEnd": 3061}], "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

The bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX plans to repay its creditors more than 100% of their claims, pending court approval. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency sector is becoming a hot topic for US voters. Here are three significant developments in the crypto market over the last 24 hours.\n\nContentsMajor Success from the Binance TeamSignificant Step from the FTX TeamUS Election Process Continues Major Success from the Binance Team\n\nThe research team behind the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, played a crucial role in leading law enforcement to arrest the ZKasino fraud suspect. Widespread public outrage initially led Binance's Crime Compliance and Investigation team to investigate the fake gambling platform.\n\nResearchers used a combination of blockchain data tracking and open-source intelligence (OSINT) methods to locate the attacker, and the Binance research team made a special statement on the matter:\n\nLatest technology news here: Newslinker.co\n\n\"We examined all the smart contracts of ZKasino with a type of behavioral network study to find out who was behind the contract and also who the signatories behind these addresses were.\"\n\nSignificant Step from the FTX Team\n\nFTX plans to pay billions in compensation for all creditor claims as well as the time value of their investments, with 98% of investors expected to recover up to 118%. This process is only for investors claiming $50,000 or less. The bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange announced on May 7th that the plan is subject to finalization and approval by the Delaware Bankruptcy Court.\n\nOnly creditors with allowed claims under $50,000 will be eligible for 118% recovery; FTX's anticipated figure covers 98% of creditors. FTX CEO and restructuring officer John J. Ray III shared the following statement:\n\n\"We are pleased to be in a position to propose a Chapter 11 plan that anticipates full repayment of bankruptcy claim amounts, as well as interest refunds for civil society creditors.\"\n\nFTX estimates that the total funds to be distributed to creditors will range between $14.5 and $16.3 billion. However, FTX's plan is still repaying the value of creditors' assets during the bankruptcy in November 2022, which has met with some reactions on social media.\n\nUS Election Process Continues\n\nThe cryptocurrency sector ranks high for voters in key US states; this indicates that voters may support candidates who have a positive stance on crypto assets. According to a survey conducted by Digital Currency Group and The Harris Poll, more than two-thirds of respondents somewhat or definitely agree that cryptocurrency is fairer for people like them and the financial system.\n\nIn key states including Michigan, Nevada, and Pennsylvania, more than 90% of survey respondents said they plan to vote in the 2024 presidential elections.\n\nYou can follow our news on Telegram, Facebook, Twitter & Coinmarketcap Disclaimer: The information contained in this article does not constitute investment advice.

The exchange estimates that it has between $14.5 billion and $16.3 billion to distribute to them.\n\nHere is a timeline of what led up to this week's announcement after an implosion at FTX kicked off what many had expected to become a \"crypto winter.\"\n\n2022\n\nNov. 2: Coindesk reports Alameda Reseach, Bankman-Fried's cryptocurrency trading firm, holds a large amount of FTT, a token issued by FTX, suggesting the finances of the two are intertwined and Alameda faces a cash crunch. The report spooks participants in the crypto market.\n\nNov. 6: Rival cryptocurrency exchange Binance announces that the firm plans to sell all its holdings in FTT. The price of FTT tanks.\n\nNov. 8: Binance founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao said his company had signed a letter of intent to buy FTX because the smaller exchange was experiencing a \"significant liquidity crunch.\" That deal would be contingent, however, on a look at the books at FTX. The price for bitcoin tumbles 13%.\n\nNov. 9: Cryptocurrency prices plunge and after getting a closer look at the finances of FTX, Binance retreated and said there would be no acquisition. \"In the beginning, our hope was to be able to support FTX's customers to provide liquidity, but the issues are beyond our control or ability to help,\" Binance said in a statement. Bitcoin prices drop another 14%.\n\nNov. 10: Cryptocurrency lender BlockFi announced it is \"not able to do business as usual\" and was pausing client withdrawals as a result of FTX's implosion.\n\nNov. 11: FTX files for Chapter 11 and Bankman-Fried resigns. John Ray III, a long-time bankruptcy litigator who is best known for having to clean up the mess made after the collapse of Enron, is named the new CEO.\n\nIn its bankruptcy filing, FTX listed more than 130 affiliated companies around the globe. The company valued its assets between $10 billion to $50 billion, with a similar estimate for its liabilities. Bitcoin falls 10%.\n\nNov. 17: Ray gives a damning description of FTX's operations under Bankman-Fried, from a lack of security controls to business funds being used to buy employees homes and luxuries.\n\nNov. 30: As part of a media blitz, Bankman-Fried tells New York Time's Andrew Ross-Sorkin, \"Look, I screwed up,\" and didn't knowingly misuse clients' funds.\n\nDec. 12: Bankman-Fried is arrested in the Bahamas, where FTX is headquartered.\n\nDec. 13: The U.S. government charges Bankman-Fried with a host of financial crimes, alleging he intentionally deceived customers and investors to enrich himself and others, while playing a central role in the company's multibillion-dollar collapse.\n\nFederal prosecutors said Bankman-Fried devised \"a scheme and artifice to defraud\" FTX's customers and investors beginning the year it was founded. He illegally diverted their money to cover expenses, debts and risky trades at Alameda Research, and to make lavish real estate purchases and large political donations, prosecutors said in a 13-page indictment.\n\nDec. 22: Bankman-Fried's parents agreed to sign a $250 million bond and keep him at their California home while he awaits trial.\n\n2023\n\nAugust 11: Judge revoked Bankman-Fried's bail and sent him to jail after concluding he had repeatedly tried to influence witnesses against him.\n\nOct. 3: Jury selection began for the trial.\n\nOct. 27: Bankman-Fried took the stand in his trial.

He faces a sentence of up to 115 years in prison.\n\nCNBC reports that prospects for former customers have since dramatically improved. Overall, the investments which had crashed in value at the time have since fully recovered - and that means that funds can be returned to customers.\n\nLawyers representing the bankruptcy estate of FTX told a judge in Delaware last week that they expect to fully repay customers and creditors with legitimate claims. Bankruptcy attorney Andrew Dietderich, who works with FTX's new leadership team, said \"there is still a great amount of work and risk\" ahead in getting all the money back to clients, but that the team has a \"strategy to achieve it.\"\n\nWhile it will doubtless be a huge relief to customers to recover their funds, whether the money is being repaid \"in full\" is a matter of perspective.\n\nAt the time of the collapse, Bitcoin was trading at around $16k, and they will be recovering that value.

Kavur took to X to outline his concerns and encourage a collective \"NO\" vote against the plan. For context, FTX creditors stand to lose over $10 billion should the proposed plan pass.\n\nThe activist highlighted the proposed repayment structure severely undervalues the claims of FTX customers. Specifically, the plan suggests paying out claims with an 18% return for those under $50,000 and a staggered 25% to 47% for claims over $50,000.\n\nNotably, this gross undervaluation arises because FTX is seeking to pay defrauded customers the monetary value of their assets as of the bankruptcy filing rather than the actual crypto assets. Illustratively, Bitcoin traded around $16K when FTX went bankrupt in November 2022 but has since reached $73,750 in 2024.\n\nNotably, this plan was drafted by the law firm Sullivan & Cromwell (S&C). Kavuri insists that S&C and the debtors owe customers the current value of their holdings, which could be three to ten times the petition prices. The FTX creditor activist argued that S&C is destroying an estimated $10 billion value of defrauded users with the plan.\n\nMeanwhile, Kavuri highlighted that the law firm included an exculpation clause that would effectively shield the firm and other parties from lawsuits related to misconduct. Essentially, the law firm is seeking to absolve key players from legal responsibility that may arise from the plan.\n\nFurthermore, the activist pointed out a clause that could lead to the forfeiture of claims if the issued checks are not cashed within a six-month window. This stipulation could disenfranchise creditors who may not cash their checks promptly.Ultimately, Kavuri asserts that each defendant should be held liable for the full current value of FTX customers' losses rather than the reduced figures proposed in the plan. Meanwhile, some commentators have suggested that voting against this plan may cost creditors an additional two years of waiting before getting their funds.\n\nThe post FTX Customers Face Potential $10B Loss with Proposed Compensation Plan appeared first on Coin Edition.", "source": {"uri": "za.investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com South Africa"}, "authors": [{"uri": "coin_edition@za.investing.com", "name": "Coin Edition", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_firm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law firm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sullivan_&_Cromwell", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sullivan & Cromwell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debtor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Debtor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_forfeiture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asset forfeiture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Compensation_and_Benefits", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Compensation and Benefits", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Urban_and_Regional_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Urban and Regional Planning", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Do-It-Yourself", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Do-It-Yourself", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Small_Business/Business_Plans", "label": "dmoz/Business/Small Business/Business Plans", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/akapi-images/800x450/ad0f7ce4f31f2a33a9521cf5dc5624d4_w_800_h_450.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547890", "eventUri": "eng-9547890", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

It owes customers and other creditors around $11 billion. FTX says that 98% of its non-government creditors will receive \"at least\" 118% of claims in cash within two months of the plan being approved.\n\nSome, including crypto loan creditors, could see up to 142% of their claims paid back, according to a court filing.\n\nOthers can expect to be paid in full and receive interest on their claims.\n\nBut don't get too excited just yet. The plan still needs to be approved by the bankruptcy court. While it seems to check all of the boxes on paper, one should expect this process to take a while to play out.\n\nFurther, creditors shouldn't expect to see their claims benefit from the recent crypto boom. Instead, the claims will be paid out according to November 2022 prices. Bitcoin hovered around $20,000 back then -- a far cry from its current level of $62,000.\n\nBut that shouldn't be a surprise after the judge said earlier this year that the bankruptcy code is \"very clear\" and that FTX doesn't meet the criteria for an exception.\n\nA press release about the new plan explained that debtors reached a series of settlements, including the IRS claims, an agreement with the CFTC, and a separate agreement with the DOJ.\n\nThe hope, according to the estate, is to resolve disputes \"without costly and protracted litigation.\" That's something, I think, everyone can agree on.\n\nMuch of the funds came from the sales of Alameda and FTX Ventures investments, including the firm's stake in Anthropic, which was approved for sale earlier this year. The estate also sold out of its position in Grayscale's bitcoin ETF.\n\nCEO John J. Ray, who took over from the now incarcerated Sam Bankman-Fried, expressed his optimism about the proposed plan, saying that the firm was \"pleased\" to be able to pay back creditors.\n\nWhile there's no denying that this plan is good news for creditors, the debtors previously teased that they had enough to pay people back. FTX lawyer Andrew Dietderich said in January that it expected to repay creditors in full \"eventually.\"\n\nAccording to the bankruptcy docket, the court scheduled two hearings for later this summer.\n\nApproval of the plan could represent one of the final steps in the closure of the FTX saga since Bankman-Fried was sentenced earlier this year after being found guilty of fraud.\n\nRead more from our opinion section: Given one more chance to defend himself, SBF blew it\n\nIt's been a long journey since Ray took over nearly two years ago and said the bankruptcy represented an \"unprecedented\" mess. (That, coming from the guy who took over Enron's bankruptcy, says a lot.)\n\nBinance has a checkered past when it comes to getting along with countries and regulators.\n\nThe exchange still struggles with this today, as countries like Nigeria and the Philippines either move to block the exchange from operating or -- in Nigeria's case -- detain executives and charge them with the same crimes as their employer.\n\nSpeaking of Nigeria, Binance stopped support for the naira as it continues to fight for the country to release Tigran Gambaryan, one of the aforementioned detained executives.\n\nBinance's own website claims that it's available in over 100 countries. However, it only lists 44 countries. Binance didn't return my multiple requests for comment on the discrepancy.\n\nHere's a fun little note: Binance's site says it supports 19 European countries but lists Europe as one of those countries, alongside others like the Czech Republic and France.\n\nDespite the multibillion-dollar settlement Binance agreed to pay the US government last year, operations in the US remain a sticky situation. Investors in the States -- well, really, just certain states -- can use the platform. Unfortunately, if you're based in a handful of states, including my home state of Texas, you're unable to use the US platform.\n\nThe exchange exited the Canadian market last year, citing regulatory concerns. Those worries didn't seem to faze Coinbase, though, which received registration as a restricted dealer last month.\n\nBinance is also blocked in China after the country took action against crypto a few years back. It ceased operations in South Korea back in 2020, citing low usage and volume.\n\nOver in Europe, Binance left the Netherlands last year and withdrew its application for a crypto license in Germany. But the firm still operates in France and is available in other European countries including Spain.\n\nThe exchange did admit that French authorities made an on-site visit in June of last year, claiming that it was \"fully collaborative\" with said authorities.\n\nAccording to a February report from Bloomberg, Binance is still trying to re-enter the UK market, but the company continues to face regulatory hurdles.\n\nOh, and did I mention that the company still doesn't have a headquarters? Though new CEO Richard Teng did say -- at Paris Blockchain Week -- that the company was mulling a \"few jurisdictions.\"\n\nTurns out Gary Gensler's not the biggest fan of crypto journalism.\n\nThe SEC Chair grew a bit frustrated yesterday during an interview with CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin over the latter's questioning on crypto.\n\nCrypto, Gensler stressed, is \"a small piece of our overall markets\" but \"an outsized piece of the scams and frauds and problems in our markets.\" As a result, \"you end up with, like, an outsized ratio of journalist questions and crypto journalists to market cap.\"\n\nGensler basically accused Sorkin (and other journalists, I guess?) of focusing too much on crypto.\n\nOkay, fair point, I suppose. But perhaps it's equally fair to say that the SEC is seeking a budgetary bump thanks to its strong focus on crypto. And Gensler has made it pretty clear that he thinks the SEC ought to have a bigger, not smaller, role in overseeing an industry that has attracted billions of dollars of capital over a relatively short period.\n\nThere ought to be an equal trade off. Want more power? Prepare to answer more questions. Seems pretty fair to me.\n\n-- Michael McSweeney", "source": {"uri": "blockworks.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "Blockworks"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

While some could recover as much as 142% of what they held, the vast majority are likely to receive 118%. The specific pay day is estimated to be months away.\n\nWhile the gains are unusual and impressive, the biggest winners in the FTX affair are those who trade bankruptcy claims. After the exchange collapsed in late 2022, a handful of hedge funds and individual investors moved quickly, and began buying up claims for a few cents on the dollar before the exchange even officially filed for bankruptcy. Data from Claims Market, an online brokerage platform that has facilitated the trade of over 500 claims, shows that the bid price of claims has risen from 10% to 101% as of Wednesday.\n\nChapter 11 filings, as of March 20, show the buyers set to make the largest returns from FTX scraps are hedge funds specializing in distressed debt. Attestor, Baupost, and Farallon, which had each bought claims worth over $520 million, $518 million, and $346 million, respectively, are leading the race. The funds have used alternative entity names confirmed by people close to the matter.\n\nLouis d'Origny, founder of claims buying platform FTX Creditor, who bet his personal funds on a full recovery, and set to profit over $25 million. He says he's \"incredibly, pleasantly surprised\" with the announcement. Ray has sold \"everything that wasn't nailed down to the floor,\" he said.\n\nThe lucrative recovery is partially due to the crypto market's renewal since 2022, with Bitcoin up over 190% since the exchange went bust. As a result, the company's crypto assets have appreciated in value. Likewise, FTX's shares in the AI startup Anthropic have also appreciated in value, and were sold for more than $880 million. In addition, FTX has 38 properties in the Bahamas, and recovered $2.6 billion in cash, according to data in a presentation filed as part of its case.\n\nBut not every claimant is happy with the results, with some investors arguing that the present day value of their crypto tokens should be honored. Arush Sehgal, an investor who had $4 million on the platform, and previous member of the FTX unsecured creditors' committee, told Fortune that Ray would have sold the estate's at \"market bottom prices\" in September 2023 had it not been for the UCC's intervention. \"The damage done to the estate assets by John Ray has now exceeded Bankman-Fried's original crime,\" he argues.\n\nLast month, Bloomberg reported that the FTX estate sold about two-thirds of its $2.6 billion in Solana tokens in a deeply discounted deal. The bankruptcy administrators overseeing FTX's estate sold SOL at $64 per token, sources close to the matter told Bloomberg, raising up to $1.9 billion for the estate. The token, however, is trading at around $148 at the time of publication.\n\nThese deals have outraged some victims, including Sunil Kavuri, who criticized Bankman-Fried's \"continuous lie that we will all be made full\" at his sentencing.", "source": {"uri": "fortune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fortune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ray", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Ray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hedge fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Bankman-Fried", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Bankman-Fried"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fortune (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_11,_Title_11,_United_States_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Broker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solana_(blockchain_platform)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Solana (blockchain platform)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bahamas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1451506223-e1715182050829.jpg?resize=1200,600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547890", "eventUri": "eng-9547890", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-20", "textStart": 1141, "textEnd": 1149}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

Under a plan filed in federal bankruptcy court in Delaware, virtually all FTX's creditors, including hundreds of thousands of ordinary investors who used the exchange to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, would receive cash payments equivalent to 118 percent of the assets they had stored on FTX, the lawyers said.\n\nThose payments would flow from a pool of assets that FTX's lawyers have pulled together in the 17 months since the exchange collapsed, the lawyers said.\n\nBut the recoveries come with a caveat. The amount owed to customers was calculated based on the value of their holdings at the time of FTX's bankruptcy in November 2022. That means customers won't reap the benefits of a recent surge in the crypto market that sent the price of Bitcoin to a record high. A customer who lost one Bitcoin when FTX imploded, for example, would be entitled to less than $20,000, even though a Bitcoin is now worth more than $60,000.\n\nRead more: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/08/business/ftx-bankruptcy-recovery.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 45}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547890", "eventUri": "eng-9547890", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

After Terra's implosion in May, the summer saw numerous bankruptcies from seemingly reputable crypto entities due to lacking risk management. Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) appeared to have a plan to save them all. People heralded him as the \"JP Morgan of Crypto\" after he made several nine-figure investments to rescue the crypto economy, similar to JP Morgan's early 1900s actions to backstop financial institutions. However, by November 2022, SBF's own companies faced jeopardy. On November 11, 2022, FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Now, almost 18 months later, it seems creditors will be more than compensated.\n\nOn Tuesday, the estate released details of the creditor cash recovery plan ranging from $14.5 billion to $16.3 billion. This figure includes interest for the duration of the recovery. Creditors with below $50,000 of assets at the time of bankruptcy will receive at least 118%. This class covers 98% of creditors. Those with greater than $50,000 will receive 118%-142%.\n\nMany question if this is sufficient compensation considering the total crypto market has grown by 170% since bankruptcy. Recently, the estate has also been auctioning its Solana holdings to build up its cash reserves to pay creditors. These sales have occurred at discounts to the current market price. Some amounts sold for as low as $64 to crypto hedge funds. However, they will vest over four years. Despite this, creditors with Solana in their FTX accounts are frustrated. They will now receive the value of their holdings at the time of the collapse plus interest, instead of the quantity of tokens they held. For example, someone who had $100,000 worth of Solana when FTX collapsed would now have around $900,000 if they had received the same amount of tokens. With the current repayment plan, they will receive up to $142,000.\n\nRepaying the amount in tokens held was allegedly not possible, especially for Bitcoin and Ethereum holders. At the time of bankruptcy, FTX only held 0.1% of the Bitcoin and 1.2% of the Ethereum customers had deposited or purchased. Due to this, the estate had to recover the funds through other means and retain them in cash to manage risk. For the crypto market, repaying creditors in cash is more than ideal. It may lead to a liquidity infusion of several billion dollars back into the market and fuel the next stage of the bull market. If the plan is approved in court, it is estimated the repayments could be concluded around later this year.\n\nIronically, FTX's demise marked the end of the previous cycle's bear market. Could it also now be a bullish influence and extend this cycle's bull market?", "source": {"uri": "cityam.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CityAM"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_asset", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Digital asset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPMorgan_Chase", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "JPMorgan Chase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solana_(blockchain_platform)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solana (blockchain platform)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Bankman-Fried", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Bankman-Fried"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blockchain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Risk management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_institution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial institution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_11,_Title_11,_United_States_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Price"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethereum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_trend", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market trend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hedge fund"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Consulting", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Strategic", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Strategic", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cryptography", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cryptography", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Associations", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://www.cityam.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/SBF.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547890", "eventUri": "eng-9547890", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2011-11-", "textStart": 707, "textEnd": 718}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

While many never expected to recover their funds, new court records filed this week suggest they could potentially recoup their losses with interest.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, FTX customers may be reimbursed for their entire losses from the firm's collapse in 2022. Additionally, they could receive interest of up to nine percent on their investments. Under a proposed plan, investors who filed claims for up to $50,000 would receive at least 118 percent of their investment, with some potentially receiving as much as 142 percent within 60 days of the plan taking effect.\n\nThe news follows the bankrupt crypto exchange's recovery of property valued between $14.5 billion and $16.3 billion from assets held by various government agencies in the US, Australia, and the Bahamas, as well as numerous private parties. According to the announcement, the monetized properties include an \"extraordinarily diverse collection of assets,\" most of which were proprietary investments held by Alameda or FTX Ventures businesses.\n\nThe biggest beneficiaries of the payback, however, will be a handful of hedge funds, not the actual investors who lost their hard-earned money. Many of the firms that trade bankruptcy claims reportedly bought up claims from FTX customers for a few cents on the dollar once the scam came to light. According to Fortune, Attestor, Baupost, and Farallon will be three of the biggest winners once the payments are disbursed, as they had bought claims worth over $520 million, $518 million, and $346 million, respectively.\n\nOne of the main factors behind the recovery is the surge in the value of Bitcoin, which is up nearly 200 percent in the last couple of years. The impressive rise has helped FTX's crypto assets appreciate significantly, allowing the company to use those funds to pay back its customers. The AI boom also helped the company, as its shares in the AI startup Anthropic recently sold for $880 million, a healthy premium over the price at which they were bought.\n\nThe FTX saga started in late 2022 when the US FTC opened an investigation into the firm's mishandling of withdrawal requests. This opened the proverbial Pandora's box, with investigators establishing that the company's founder and CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, was illegally siphoning money from the crypto exchange to his hedge fund, Alameda Research. Bankman-Fried was subsequently arrested and convicted for securities fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering. He was sentenced to 25 years in prison and is currently serving time at MDC Brooklyn.", "source": {"uri": "techspot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechSpot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kishalaya_kundu@techspot.com", "name": "Kishalaya Kundu", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hedge fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bahamas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alameda_Research", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alameda Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Bankman-Fried", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Bankman-Fried"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Detention_Center,_Brooklyn", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Detention Center, Brooklyn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securities_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Securities fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail_and_wire_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mail and wire fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fortune (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Trade Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Money laundering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://www.techspot.com/images2/news/bigimage/2024/05/2024-05-09-image-8.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547890", "eventUri": "eng-9547890", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

Specifically, the plan suggests paying out claims with an 18% return for those under $50,000 and a staggered 25% to 47% for claims over $50,000.\n\nNotably, this gross undervaluation arises because FTX is seeking to pay defrauded customers the monetary value of their assets as of the bankruptcy filing rather than the actual crypto assets.

The FTX creditor activist argued that S&C is destroying an estimated $10 billion value of defrauded users with the plan.\n\nMeanwhile, Kavuri highlighted that the law firm included an exculpation clause that would effectively shield the firm and other parties from lawsuits related to misconduct. Essentially, the law firm is seeking to absolve key players from legal responsibility that may arise from the plan.\n\nFurthermore, the activist pointed out a clause that could lead to the forfeiture of claims if the issued checks are not cashed within a six-month window. This stipulation could disenfranchise creditors who may not cash their checks promptly.\n\nUltimately, Kavuri asserts that each defendant should be held liable for the full current value of FTX customers' losses rather than the reduced figures proposed in the plan.

The plan outlines intentions to allocate over 118% of approved claims to a significant portion, approximately 98%, of its creditors. Additionally, the remaining creditors are slated to receive full compensation, accompanied by substantial added benefits reflecting the time value of their crypto assets. The exchange anticipates a substantial sum ranging between $14.5 billion to $16 billion earmarked for distribution.\n\nAt CoinFactiva they think that while the prospect of receiving 18% more than the owed amount is certainly appealing, it may not fully offset the absence of the assets themselves, particularly considering the significant appreciation in their value over the past two years. At the time of the exchange's collapse, Bitcoin traded at just under $16,000, with FTX possessing only 0.1% of the deposited amount. Since then, Bitcoin's price has nearly quadrupled.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to underscore that the plan remains subject to finalization and approval by the US Bankruptcy Court. Notably, only creditors with claims below $50,000 are designated to receive the 118% compensation, contingent upon court endorsement. Repayment procedures are slated to commence within 60 days following the plan's approval and implementation.\n\nThe post FTX's Amended Repayment Plan: A Ray of Hope for Creditors appeared first on CoinFactiva.com.", "source": {"uri": "cryptodaily.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "cryptodaily.co.uk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Compensation_and_Benefits", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Compensation and Benefits", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Urban_and_Regional_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Urban and Regional Planning", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Do-It-Yourself", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Do-It-Yourself", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Retirement_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Retirement Planning", "wgt": 13}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547890", "eventUri": "eng-9547890", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

Although FTX has the money to compensate victims, the nuts and bolts of its mechanisms are yet to be fleshed out, which will likely happen in court. This will determine who receives money first, how it is to be distributed, and whether interest should be paid.\n\nInterestingly, one of the key reasons for FTX's spike in asset value was thanks to the crypto market's renaissance over the past six months. This leaves a bit of a bad taste in the mouth, as FTX's mismanagement was a key reason for the market spiralling in the first place.\n\nControversially, it appears unlikely victims will be reaping the same benefits from cryptocurrency's recent surge. It has been posited that FTX will repay customers based on their cash value at the time of the collapse - when BTC was about 1/3rd of the value it is now.\n\nBut if there's anything we've learned from the FTX debacle to date, it's that there are probably a few more twists and turns in the narrative just around the corner.", "source": {"uri": "cryptonews.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Crypto News Australia"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_knight@cryptonews.com.au", "name": "Ben Knight", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Bankman-Fried", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Bankman-Fried"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swing (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidation", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liquidation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://cdn.cryptonews.com.au/2024/05/09143317/5924FTX.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547890", "eventUri": "eng-9547890", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

Despite these obstacles, the company has not gained from any increase in value of these absent cryptocurrencies throughout the bankruptcy process.\n\nFTX, now under new management, has unveiled an optimistic reorganization plan following its bankruptcy. The plan outlines a remarkable turnaround, promising 98% of creditors will receive 118% of their original claims in cash within 60 days of court approval. Additionally, certain creditors are slated to receive full repayment plus up to 9% interest. This approach marks a significant improvement from earlier projections, which estimated only a 90% repayment rate.\n\nAs highlighted in today's CNF YouTube video, the revival of FTX's finances is attributed to meticulous global asset recovery and liquidation efforts, not the recent upticks in the cryptocurrency market. Noteworthy moves include selling stakes in AI startup Anthropic. These strategic decisions have enabled FTX to amass funds ranging between $14.5 billion and $16.3 billion.\n\nThe plan, pending approval from a Delaware bankruptcy court, also proposes settlements for claims by major regulators like the IRS and CFTC, prioritizing repayments to users and investors. This strategy has been leveraged by former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried's legal team to argue for a reduced sentence, despite his ongoing appeal against a 25-year fraud sentence.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has experienced notable fluctuations, highlighted by a 21% drop in Solana's price after FTX announced the third tranche of its auction for locked Solana coins. This event was widely covered, with CNF reporting on the 'FTX Estate Sale Fallout: Solana Sees 21% Price Dip - Investors Evaluate Dumping Tokens,' which reflected investors' reconsideration of their holdings amid the sell-off.\n\nDespite this downturn, technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Awesome Oscillator (AO) point to a potentially bullish future for Solana.

It has to do with a longstanding practice that, due to numerous crypto bankruptcies across the last decade, is now being called into question: setting the value of the bankruptcy assets at the dollar value on the day the petition was filed, a practice known as \"dollarization.\"\n\nBecause bankruptcies can take years to play out, and especially because the most popular crypto assets can fluctuate almost exponentially in value, this means that creditors actually receive back a fraction of the dollar value of what they would have if they had been able to keep their crypto asset.\n\nIn short, the legal framework governing traditional financial instruments and currencies generally does not work for digital assets.\n\nThis issue of dollarization has been the subject of much debate in light of the bankrupt FTX estate's sale of locked Solana (SOL) tokens at around $60. Though FTX customers that held SOL had their claims dollarized at around US$14 per SOL as at the Bankruptcy Order, the price of SOL has rallied to more than US$200 (before correcting in line with the rest of the cryptocurrency market), severely impacting FTX customers who considered they had been effectively \"forced to sell\" at the bottom by the dollarization process. As explained by Matt Levine, a customer holding 10 SOL tokens worth US$143 in their FTX account at the time of bankruptcy would now receive around US$170, but the same 10 SOL tokens today are worth almost $1,500. Indeed, a commentator on X went so far as to describe the FTX dollarization process as \"probably the greatest anti-meritocratic mass redistribution of wealth\" they had ever seen.\n\nIn the context of traditional bankruptcy proceedings, the law is well settled. Under English law for example, the Insolvency Rules 2016, which set out the procedures for all company and personal insolvency proceedings in England and Wales, clearly mandate that debts in foreign currencies be converted to the local currency (GBP) at the exchange rate prevailing on the date the company went into liquidation or entered administration.\n\nThe rationale for this is simple -- dollarization aims to simplify the administration of the estate by consolidating all claims into a single fiat currency at a specified date, thereby avoiding the complexities and costs of dealing with multiple currencies. It takes the impact of currency volatility on the group of creditors out of the equation and leaves individual creditors to make their own decisions on hedging: dollarization crystallizes currency risk as at a specific date.\n\nIt's no surprise then that dollarization has either been codified in law or has become an accepted rule of practice for courts and insolvency practitioners in major bankruptcy jurisdictions, including the US and Singapore. But it also means that creditors could end up receiving a different \"base currency\" return on their claims due to fluctuations in exchange rates between the date of the bankruptcy and the date of payment. This risk may be tolerable for the most part given that the volatility of most major fiat currencies is low, barring a major global economic crisis. Most creditors and stakeholders are therefore prepared to accept such risks considering the costs involved for insolvency practitioners to preserve and pay their claims in the currency of the original debt.\n\nAll this has changed with cryptocurrency bankruptcies where dollarization is seen as unfair because it is not reflective of the realities of the digital asset base and digital creditor classes. While fiat currencies are generally unaffected by the bankruptcy of any one participant, the tight cryptocurrency ecosystem means that the failure of one major participant can lead to a sharp short-term decline in cryptocurrencies which the failing business is associated with. Dollarization has been hotly contested by creditors in the FTX Chapter 11 process, but Judge Dorsey, the presiding judge in the bankruptcy process has been clear: \"the debtors' use of the petition date for determining the value of the digital asset claims is appropriate. I have no wiggle on that. The [Bankruptcy] code says what it says and I am obligated to follow the code.\".\n\nInterestingly, crypto creditors are not alone in challenging dollarization. In the Lehman Brothers International (Europe) (LBIE) administration in the UK, a sudden and significant depreciation in the Pound in the period between the administration order and payment dates resulted in creditors on the one hand receiving 100 cents in Sterling terms, but seriously shortchanged in terms of original claims in a foreign currency, even though there was a surplus in the LBIE estate.\n\nThe English Supreme Court, reversing the decisions of the lower courts, held that because the requirement for dollarization of claims was codified under the Insolvency Rules 2016, there was little scope for judicial intervention to enable these creditors to recover their base currency shortfalls. Notably, in his dissenting judgment, Lord Clarke acknowledged the unsatisfactory nature of this ruling because, in circumstances where there was a surplus (as was the case with LBIE), it in effect gave shareholders a windfall at the expense of creditors.\n\nThe LBIE case has shown the statutory limitations of dollarization even for fiat currency claims, but the application of traditional insolvency law and practices to a crypto environment makes these limitations even less appropriate.\n\nFirst, cryptocurrencies, do not fit neatly within the definition of \"currencies\" as understood in the context of insolvency law. Recent case law in England and Singapore has recognized cryptocurrencies as a form of property, not currency. This distinction is crucial because it implies that creditors may have property related rights in the assets they hold on an exchange, rather than merely a claim for the return of a deposit in a certain currency.\n\nSecondly, those rights could be in the form of a trust claim (a claim that the customer, not the exchange, is the owner of the asset and exclusively entitled to it) or a contractual entitlement to delivery of a similar asset. If a customer is \"entitled\" to 1 BTC, the question arises whether they are entitled to 1 BTC, which can be identified or traced, or to damages for non-delivery of 1 BTC, with the latter involving the assessment of damages.\n\nThese are live issues in the FTX bankruptcy where FTX's terms of use, governed by English law, state that customers retain title to their assets, suggesting that customers retain beneficial ownership of the assets they deposit, akin to placing currency notes in a safety deposit box rather than depositing them into a bank account. This implies that customers may not be creditors of the estate but rather have a right to the in-kind return of the assets they deposited. Various FTX creditor groups have raised this before the US Bankruptcy Court.\n\nThirdly, the law needs to be able to address the realities of cryptocurrency business failure in terms of claims quantification and distributions to ensure equitable treatment of creditors, and in terms of orders of priorities to ensure there can be no windfall recoveries at the expense of more senior claimants.\n\nBankruptcy administrations, whether in the nature of liquidation or reorganization, are run for the benefit of all stakeholders, including shareholders, but recognition of the rights of creditors as senior stakeholders, as well as creditor involvement in and support of the administration process are fundamental. Cryptocurrency bankruptcies are no different and this requires the unique nature of crypto as a \"non-currency currency\" to be acknowledged and engagement with the crypto community on issues ranging from interim digital asset management to tokenization of claims.\n\nEven so, bankruptcy reorganization processes (such as a US Chapter 11 proceeding, an English Restructuring Plan, or an English or Singapore Scheme of Arrangement) offer some options for creativity. This is because the restructuring consideration offered in exchange for existing claims can take virtually whatever form creditors want, provided the debtor is in agreement and creditor class and fairness issues are respected.\n\nThe industry is already seeing the tokenization of reorganization claims and the options to allow for variable claim values, pegged to current and future digital asset market prices through the issuance of \"recovery tokens\" to creditors linked to different categories of assets, seem potentially limitless. For example, subject to resolving any creditor class and fairness issues, and debtor agreements, reorganization consideration could be structured as follows:\n\nA reorganization plan structured like this, with appropriate distribution and redemption options, could go some way to addressing future fluctuating crypto asset valuation concerns. But as things stand, without a change in the law (and absent any accepted trust claims), any reorganization would still involve a dollarization of crypto asset claims in the first instance, followed by \"conversion back\" into a recovery token.\n\nOne potential solution for this (and there will be others) might be to stipulate a recovery token redemption premium determined by reference to the difference between the dollarization amount and the linked crypto asset value at the time the recovery token is issued. For instance, if 1 BTC is $100 at the time of dollarization, the restructuring documents could establish a future date at which a redemption premium would be set, which would be at or near the date the recovery token is issued. Thus, if the value of BTC was $150 at that future date, the redemption premium would be $50. A reorganization plan or scheme solution such as this could also ensure \"true value\" recoveries ahead of other more junior stakeholders (and this could also be applied to fiat currency conversions).\n\nWhile courts have successfully been able to apply traditional legal principles to address many of the unique challenges posed by cryptocurrency in bankruptcy proceedings, the one area where there is still concern, and a deep sense of unfairness within the cryptocurrency community, is in the valuation of claims.\n\nThe continued adoption and evolution of digital assets, blockchain technology, and cryptocurrencies necessitates a re-evaluation of insolvency laws. Solutions such as issuances of recovery tokens, can allow for a distribution of assets that reflects the inherent volatility and liquidity of different cryptocurrencies.\n\nUltimately, jurisdictions that can provide a more flexible mechanism to balance these competing interests would likely benefit through increased investor confidence and investments.", "source": {"uri": "unchainedcrypto.com",

Adam Back weighed in on the conversation, suggesting that a significant portion, if not all, of the $15 billion could flow back into the cryptocurrency market - particularly BTC.\n\nBack's sentiment stems from a belief that disgruntled investors, angered by FTX's sale of Bitcoin at a low price during its collapse, would eagerly reinvest their newfound assets into the cryptocurrency, driving up demand and potentially pushing the price even higher.\n\nHe went further to suggest that while some may diversify into other coins, the majority would likely flock back to Bitcoin, viewing it as a safer and more reliable investment option.\n\nThis prediction comes at a time when Bitcoin's price has surged from $15,600 at the end of 2022 to a staggering $74,000 as a new all-time high this year, highlighting the resurgence and potential for gains on the cryptocurrency market.\n\nWith the prospect of a multi-billion-dollar influx of funds, the community eagerly awaits the outcome of the FTX estate's distribution plan and the impact it could have on the market.", "source": {"uri": "u.today", "dataType": "news", "title": "u.today"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gamza_khanzadaev@u.today", "name": "Gamza Khanzadaev", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Back", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adam Back"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satoshi Nakamoto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_11,_Title_11,_United_States_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coin"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Consulting", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Investment_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Investment Services", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Predictions", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Predictions", "wgt": 10}], "image": "https://u.today/sites/default/files/styles/twitter/public/2024-05/s2259.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547890", "eventUri": "eng-9547890", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 117, "relevance": 1}

The announcement says that 98% of FTX's users had less than $50,000 in assets, and as such, the vast majority of customers who lost their money should be able to get it back.\n\nThe plan does hinge on the approval of a Delaware bankruptcy court, where FTX's bankruptcy proceedings are playing out.

You're watching Coindesk Daily, I'm your host, Jen Sei. Nearly all FTX creditors will get 100 and 18% of their funds back in cash. That's according to the estate, the bankrupt exchange proposed a new reorganization plan that would see 98% of creditors get their money back under the plan. Other non governmental creditors would get back 100% of their claims plus up to 9% in interest. The arrangement is still subject to approval by the Delaware Bankruptcy Court, former NFL star and Tom Brady wrote. Rob Gronkowski will pay $1.9 million to settle claims brought against him by former customers of Voyager Digital. The settlement is still subject to approval by the court overseeing the civil lawsuit and would require the former New England's Patriot tight end to pay into a $2.4 million pool alongside other brand ambassadors. Voyager filed for bankruptcy in 2022 and the UK Minister says the government only has time to implement stablecoin and state legislation and Economic Secretary Bim AFO Lai said at the Financial Times Crypto and Digital Asset Summit that he's very confident the government will be able to achieve secondary legislation around staking in stable coins.

Following filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which saw the exchange collapse in November 2022, the company has now proposed a plan to distribute the majority of its assets to creditors and customers worldwide.\n\nWith the plan awaiting approval from the bankruptcy court, speculation is rife about how the recovered funds will be utilized. Adam Back weighed in on the conversation, suggesting that a significant portion, if not all, of the $15 billion could flow back into the cryptocurrency market - particularly BTC.\n\nBack's sentiment stems from a belief that disgruntled investors, angered by FTX's sale of Bitcoin at a low price during its collapse, would eagerly reinvest their newfound assets into the cryptocurrency, driving up demand and potentially pushing the price even higher.\n\nBTC to USD by CoinMarketCapHe went further to suggest that while some may diversify into other coins, the majority would likely flock back to Bitcoin, viewing it as a safer and more reliable investment option.\n\nThis prediction comes at a time when Bitcoin's price has surged from $15,600 at the end of 2022 to a staggering $74,000 as a new all-time high this year, highlighting the resurgence and potential for gains on the cryptocurrency market.\n\nWith the prospect of a multi-billion-dollar influx of funds, the community eagerly awaits the outcome of the FTX estate's distribution plan and the impact it could have on the market.", "source": {"uri": "investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Back", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Adam Back"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satoshi Nakamoto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_11,_Title_11,_United_States_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/LYNXMPED09124_L.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547890", "eventUri": "eng-9547890", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 107, "relevance": 1}

Some creditors have already received payments in fiat currency, prompting analysts to speculate that full bitcoin payouts may be imminent.\n\nThe Mt Gox cryptocurrency exchange collapsed following a hack in 2014. The trustees of the defunct exchange have set a 31 October deadline for reimbursing creditors.\n\nFTX creditor payout\n\nThe collapsed FTX cryptocurrency exchange could also impact the cryptocurrency market. On Wednesday, the firm said that once it has sold off its remaining assets, it will have as much as $16.3bn (\u00a313bn) to cover its debts to creditors, which stand at around $11bn.\n\nThe new CEO, John Ray III, who was tasked with navigating the fallen exchange through bankruptcy following its collapse in November 2022, said, \"We are pleased to be in a position to propose a Chapter 11 plan that contemplates the return of 100% of bankruptcy claim amounts, plus interest for non-governmental creditors.\"\n\nRead more: Bitcoin success with SEC fuels anticipation for ether spot ETF\n\nIn contrast to the Mt Gox payouts, which will be in cryptocurrency, FTX creditors could potentially receive between $14 to $16bn in fiat currency, pending bankruptcy court approval. DeFiance Capital CIO Arthur Cheong suggested that a portion of these funds may find their way back into the cryptocurrency market. \"Expect at least $3-$5bn of crypto-native liquidity to be injected back into the market,\" Cheong said in an X post on Wednesday.\n\nBitcoin liquidations rise\n\nThe recent downturn in bitcoin prices has prompted a significant liquidation of long positions on cryptocurrency exchanges. The volatility has led to the liquidation of more than $32m in bitcoin positions over the past 24 hours, with the majority, over $21m, consisting of long positions.\n\nAccording to CoinGlass data, the overall crypto market saw the liquidation of over $86m in long positions in the past 24 hours. This contributed to over $131m in total liquidations across major cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nLiquidations tend to occur during volatile price swings, such as unexpected downturns. When prices rise sharply, as recently observed in the cryptocurrency market, many traders may be compelled to liquidate their short positions due to the surge in asset values. This can intensify overall market volatility, set off a cascade effect and potentially cause a significant increase in price fluctuations.\n\nSpeaking this week on Yahoo Finance's The Morning Brief, Yahoo Finance Reporter, Jared Blikre, noted how \"last week saw the largest outflows from spot bitcoin ETFs to date.\"\n\nHe added that bitcoin reacted in a \"very characteristic\" way. The digital asset dipped but then rose back above a key support level.\n\nRead more: Crypto live prices\n\n\"I would say a low of $57,000 is a price you do not want to see if you're a bitcoin bull.

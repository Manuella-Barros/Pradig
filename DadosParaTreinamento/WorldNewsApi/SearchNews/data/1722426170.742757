{"id": 243300332, "title": "On the cusp of Assembly elections, what Hemant Soren\u2019s bail means for JMM", "text": "The bail for former Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren on Friday gives the JMM-led coalition government in his state a much-needed shot in the arm in the run-up to the Assembly polls due later this year. Right before his arrest in January 2023, Soren resigned from his post and made way for Champai Soren to take over as CM. In the wake of the arrest, Soren\u2019s wife Kalpana Soren became the face of the JMM. With her oratory skills, she was able to invoke the Jharkhand identity and create a strong base amongst women. Kalpana also participated in various national-level campaigns of the INDIA bloc and won the bypoll in Gandey, held along with the Lok Sabha elections, by 26,000 votes. In the recent Lok Sabha polls, the JMM-led coalition got six seats. The JMM got three seats on its own, with the Congress getting two. The BJP won seven seats, while its ally, the All Jharkhand Students' Union, got one. However, they lost all the five ST-reserved seats to the JMM coalition. The BJP also lost tribal-dominated Dumka, where it had fielded Soren\u2019s sister-in-law Sita Soren, by 22,000 votes, indicating the hold the JMM and its allies continue to have in the tribal pockets of the state - expected to have strengthened in the wake of the arrest of Soren. \u201cNothing worked in the BJP\u2019s favour in the tribal seats of Jharkhand in the Lok Sabha polls. The manner in which the BJP will strategise for the 28 tribal seats in the Assembly will be crucial,\u201d said a BJP leader. Soren's release is a new entry to the equation, with the JMM expected to try and reap the sympathy factor. A JMM leader admitted that Soren continuing in jail until the Assembly elections, so that the party could speak of the \u201cinjustice meted out to him\u201d, was what they were counting on first. \u201cWe also drew a parallel between Jesuit priest and rights activist Stan Swamy (who died while in custody in the Bhima Koregaon case) and Hemant Soren, for both facing action for raising their voices against oppressed classes. Both were jailed and injustice was meted to them. Now that Hemant Soren is out, there will be a change in strategy dealing with the situation,\u201d said the source. On Kalpana\u2019s role going forward, a party leader said: \u201cKalpana ji may get a Cabinet post, as we still do not know how the Enforcement Directorate will respond (to the bail to Soren). They might challenge the bail in higher courts or put a different case on Soren. In any situation, Kalpana Soren will be in active politics.\u201d In the BJP camp too, there is a sense that the campaign has to be changed in the light of the bail. The party put up a brave face, saying the BJP's Jharkhand Assembly election in-charges - Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and Union Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan - will plan a \u201crobust strategy\u201d. However, a BJP leader admitted that Soren's release from jail was a setback to the narrative the party was seeking to set. \u201cThe tribal population will ask how Soren has got bail\u2026 They will ask why the trial court gave (Delhi Chief Minister) Arvind Kejriwal bail. They will question the investigation. Now that Soren is out of jail, things will be harder for us.\u201d Officially, the party played it cool. BJP spokesperson Binay Singh: \u201cThe law has taken its course, and we respect that.\u201d", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/on-the-cusp-of-assembly-elections-what-hemant-sorens-bail-means-for-jmm-9421589/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/06/Hemant-Soren-3.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 04:07:24", "author": "Abhishek Angad", "authors": ["Abhishek Angad"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.285}

{"id": 231236120, "title": "Ira Winderman: Lakers&#8217; play for Dan Hurley a Heat reminder of when Bob Huggins almost was Pat Riley", "text": "MIAMI \u2014 For a moment, especially this moment, with UConn coach Dan Hurley emerging as the next potential Los Angeles Lakers coach, pause to consider a similar reality, one that likely would have led to a dramatically different Miami Heat reality. The NCAA-to-NBA pipeline hardly is a new concept. For every Billy Donovan and Brad Stevens who successfully have traversed the potential pitfalls of the direct ascension from college to NBA head coach in recent decades, there also have been the struggles for likes of Fred Hoiberg, Tim Floyd, Mike Montgomery, Lon Kruger, Jerry Tarkanian John Beilein and, yes, even former University of Miami and current Florida State coach Leonard Hamilton, and his disastrous 19-63 season with the Washington Wizards in 2000-2001. And then there was a moment in time in the spring of 1995 that mostly stands as a moment that history forgot \u2013 when Bob Huggins was going to be Pat Riley. Yes, the Bob Huggins who made Final Four appearances at Cincinnati in 1992 and West Virginia in 2010. The combined five-time Coach of the Year in two conferences. The 2022 inductee into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. And the coach who retired amid controversy a year ago. With a bit more haste by Huggins and a bit less by Riley, it well could have been Huggins, not Riley, who was introduced by Heat owner Micky Arison aboard Carnival\u2019s Imagination in the ship\u2019s Destiny lounge on Sept. 2, 1995. So, no, this latest play for Hurley is nothing new in terms of hope that NCAA success breeds something similar in the NBA, even with the recent failures outweighing the successes, Beilein most recently lasting all of 54 games with the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2019-20. All of which makes it all the more chilling thinking about what might have been these past three decades had there not been a pause with Huggins in June 1995, as Riley maneuvered his way from the New York Knicks to the Heat\u2019s front office and bench. Upon Riley\u2019s formal introduction, Arison in 1995 made it clear how close it had come to the sweat of Huggins instead of the style of Riley. \u201cWe came within 24 hours of hiring Bob Huggins,\u201d Arison said at the time. \u201cHad Pat not resigned that day, we would have that weekend probably hired Bob Huggins. We would have made him an offer. I don\u2019t want to assume, but I think he would have accepted it.\u201d In the wake of Riley faxing in his New York resignation and the Heat settling a tampering claim by the Knicks ($1 million and 1996 first-round pick Walter McCarty), Huggins said it was about more than being pushed aside. \u201cI pulled out. I pulled out because that\u2019s not what I wanted to do at that time,\u201d Huggins later said, having invested considerable time in researching the opening created by the dismissal of Kevin Loughery and then also of interim coach Alvin Gentry. \u201cAt this point in time in my life, I don\u2019t want to be in the NBA. It had nothing to do with Pat Riley.\u201d Under Riley, the Heat emerged from 1988 expansion team to championship cornerstone. While the cachet would help deliver the likes of Alonzo Mourning, Shaquille O\u2019Neal, LeBron James, Chris Bosh and others from his executive suite, there also was a level of coaching previously unseen with the Heat. In the ensuing years, few from the college ranks proved able to deliver to such a degree, with Stevens coming closest and Donovan showing the ability to endure. When it comes to a basis of comparison, one voice who experienced the Riley touch with the Heat and appreciates what is needed alongside James with the Lakers, said Hurley just might make it work with James and Anthony Davis \u201cI love it. I love it. I love shaking things up a little bit,\u201d former Heat captain Udonis Haslem, who played alongside James for four Heat seasons, said in his analyst role with ESPN. \u201cOftentimes when you have NBA veterans that have had an amount of success, we get comfortable. And I think for the Lakers, if they want to get back in those championship conversations, if they want to be considered a serious contender in the West, they\u2019ve got to get back comfortable being uncomfortable. \u201cSo I think bringing in a different personality, somebody with a little bit of energy . . . bringing in somebody that\u2019s going to get these guys back comfortable being uncomfortable, I think we can now start to put those guys back in those championship conversations. Because they have the talent with \u2018Bron and A.D.\u201d Twenty-nine years ago, the conversation might have been similar in the Heat locker room, had Huggins acted with a bit more haste and Riley with a bit less. The rest for the Heat is championship history. Now it appears the college door is about to swing the other way, with the NBA potentially to see if a college coach this time winds up in the right place at the right time, a franchise\u2019s legacy again in the balance. IN THE LANE GORAN 2.0?: A projected lottery pick who now possibly could fall to the Heat\u2019s No. 15 range in the wake of a pre-draft knee injury, Serbian guard Nikola Topic said he particularly appreciates comparisons to former Heat guard Goran Dragic. \u201cIt\u2019s great to hear that they compare me with him,\u201d Topi\u0107 told the Houston Chronicle. \u201cHe is a great player. I\u2019m really truly thankful for that. It is an amazing thing to compare to him.\u201d So, yes, it is possible the Heat next have a Nikola Topic to play alongside Nikola Jovic and compete against Nikola Jokic. \u201cOf course, Nikola Joki\u0107 is one of the best players in the world,\u201d Topi\u0107 said of the MVP leader of the NBA\u2019s Serbian delegation. \u201cEverybody wants to be like him. Of course, me too. In Serbia, of course, a lot of kids started playing basketball because of him, because they want to be like him one day. I really want to continue that list.\u201d THE FINAL STEP: After his father found himself falling short of the NBA Finals, including during his tenure with the Heat, Dallas Mavericks guard Tim Hardaway Jr. said he appreciates his current opportunity \u201cEspecially being the first in my family to do so,\u201d Hardaway said with a laugh, before continuing respectfully with, \u201cno, no. I wouldn\u2019t get to this point without my dad. He\u2019s always by my side. He\u2019s always a phone call away, always supporting me, always comes to the games. He\u2019s a phone call away when I\u2019m struggling, when I\u2019m not. Even if I\u2019m having great games, keep my head down, don\u2019t stop, keep that energy, keep that flow going.\u201d Even in what has become a reduced role, Hardaway is savoring the moment, appreciating his paternal influence. \u201cHe\u2019s always reiterating to me to always have fun. He\u2019s been telling me that since high school. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been trying to do my whole entire career.\u201d Hardaway was limited to 7:42 of mop-up duty in the Mavericks\u2019 Game 1 loss in Boston, missing both his attempts from the field. BACK AT IT: With former Heat forward Juwan Howard, after his uneven run at Michigan, back on an NBA bench as an Brooklyn Nets assistant coach, new Nets coach Jordi Fernandez addressed Howard reprising the assistant role held for six seasons with the Heat under Erik Spoelstra. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we have enough guys that have done it,\u201d Fernandez said to Newsday of his new staff. \u201cJuwan obviously has done it at a very high level, and some other coaches that have played at a high level, and they can still hoop with the guys. I think that\u2019s important, because a lot of times, you have to connect in different ways, and we have different backgrounds to connect with our guys in a different way.\u201d TAKE CHARGE MOMENT: Former Heat forward Shane Battier continues to have an impact beyond the court in South Florida, with 100% of the Class of 2024 from Battier Take Charge Foundation Guide Miami having been accepted into collegiate programs. Battier on Thursday helped commemorate the 18 students from the program who received Florida Prepaid scholarships. In all, more than $3 million in scholarships have been awarded through the program, with an honors ceremony held this past week at Florida Memorial University. The Battier Guide Miami Program launched in 2016, benefiting students at Miami Central and Booker T. Washington high schools. NUMBER 3.

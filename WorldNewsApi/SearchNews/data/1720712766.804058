{"id": 232089778, "title": "Violinist whose career was ended by celebrity fitness trainer's Pilates machine wins right to compensation", "text": "An acclaimed violinist whose career was wrecked by injuries she suffered at a celebrity fitness trainer\u2019s studio has won the right to compensation, and issued a warning to gym users of the hidden dangers of Pilates machines. Maya Meron, 44, was hospitalised with a fractured left elbow and serious abdominal injuries after an exercise machine at the Heartcore studio in Hampstead collapsed while she was using it. The award-winning musician, a Royal Academy of Music graduate who has toured the world and performed for the Berlin Philharmonic under Sir Simon Rattle, recalls the \u201cabsolute horror\u201d of being injured and realising her musical career was over. Instead of sympathy and support from the gym, Ms Meron said Heartcore denied the accident had happened as she described, forcing her to launch a four-year investigation to gather evidence to back-up her safety fears. She sued Heartcore Fitness Limited, the premium fitness brand founded by Jess Schuring which has London studios in Fulham, Kensington, St John\u2019s Wood, Chelsea, Notting Hill, and Bayswater. Ms Schuring, also known as Jessie Blum, counts Victoria Beckham, Elle McPherson and Robbie Williams among her celebrity clients. Ms Meron went undercover at Heartcore gyms, and sent a private investigator in to collect evidence on the way the Pilates machines are operated. She also enlisted the support of Sebastien Lagree, a fitness guru whose followers include the Duchess of Sussex, Jennifer Aniston, and Kim Kardashian. Heartcore has now been ordered to pay 85 per cent of Ms Meron\u2019s compensation claim, with a \u00a3250,000 upfront payment and the final bill due to be settled by a High Court judge. \u201cI have spent four and a half years of my life trying to prove this accident even happened\u201d, she told The Standard, speaking from a rehabilitation hospital after undergoing her latest bout of abdominal surgery. \u201cThey denied the accident ever happened, saying it\u2019s impossible.\u201d She signed up to Pilates to regain fitness after the birth of her twins, and was in the \u201cdownward facing dog\u201d position on Heartcore\u2019s Coreformer machine when the locking bar collapsed under the pressure, on March 11, 2019. \u201cI felt a crashing shudder to my whole body\u201d, Ms Meron set out in witness statements at Central London county court. \u201cI felt that I had been violently punched with an enormous blow to my stomach region.\u201d She said she felt \u201ctrauma and shock through my entire body\u201d as well as serious pain in both arms, and \u201crealise with absolute horror at that moment that my career playing my instrument was probably over\u201d. Ms Meron said she was taken out of the class \u201cas though nothing untoward had happened\u201d, and says she was denied the chance to speak to the class instructor or collect proper evidence including details of the machine she had been using. Undeterred, she signed up again to Heartcore classes to investigate the foot pedal mechanism on the Coreformer machine which is used to change the locking bar position. Posing as an \u201cinept beginner\u201d, she recorded the way instructors tell gymgoers how to use the machines. Her private investigator also collected evidence to show it is \u201cpossible for entire series of exercises to be performed on unlocked bars at Heartcore\u201d, when the person doing the exercise may wrongly believe the bar is safely secured. Mr Lagree, the California-based founder of Lagree Fitness, provided a witness statement in the claim, and has now spoken out about the lack of safety regulation over Pilates machines. He says Heartcore gyms had a \u201ccopycat\u201d version of his own Proformer machine, but with a modified design which he claims is unsafe, as the security of the locking bar cannot be easily checked before a workout begins. \u201cThis is a huge problem in the Pilates industry, of lots of people hurting themselves\u201d, he said. \u201cWhen I design my machines, I always ask \u2018is it safe? Is it effective?\u2019 Copycats don\u2019t think about \u2018what is the intention of this design\u2019.\u201d Ms Meron added: \u201cIt\u2019s a multi-billion dollar industry with nobody actually paying attention to the design of the machines. It\u2019s not regulated at all.\u201d Mr Lagree also called for more people who have suffered gym injuries to speak out like Ms Meron, to reveal the true scale of the problem. \u201cMore people should come forward if the get injured at the studio\u201d, he said. \u201cWe have to get the studios to act on it, and if they don\u2019t (come forward) the studios are going to continue doing it.\u201d Heartcore has been contacted for comment. At Central London County Court in December last year, a judge ruled after mediation between the parties that Heartcore should pay 85 per cent of Ms Meron\u2019s damages, as well as some of her legal costs. An initial payment of \u00a3250,000 in \u201cinterim damages\u201d had to be made by December 1.", "summary": "<p>Maya Meron went undercover at Heartcore gyms, and sent a private investigator in to collect evidence</p>", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/maya-meron-compensation-pilates-machine-injury-heartcore-fitness-limited-b1162938.html", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/06/07/14/18/fg_acd881su.jpeg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 17:00:56", "author": "Tristan Kirk", "authors": ["Tristan Kirk"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.261}

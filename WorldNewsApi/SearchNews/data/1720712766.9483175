{"id": 232089208, "title": "&#8216;Extremely&#8217; heavy rainfall over Maharashtra as monsoon arrives early over Mumbai, Pune", "text": "The Southwest monsoon on Sunday advanced over parts of Pune, Mumbai, and a majority of the geographical areas of Maharashtra, making steady and swift progress since its onset on May 30. Continuing its early onset trend this season, the monsoon onset over Mumbai and Pune was two days ahead of its normal date of June 11. With the latest advancement, the Northern Limit of Monsoon now passes through Thane, Ahmednagar, Beed, Nizamabad, Sukma, Malkangiri, Vizianagaram, and Islampur. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said Konkan and Madhya Maharashtra have been receiving widespread heavy rainfall during the last few days. With the monsoon onset, a 'red' alert has been issued with chances of extremely heavy rainfall (more than 204 mm in 24 hours) over coastal Karnataka, Konkan, and Madhya Maharashtra till Monday. Heavy rainfall will continue over these regions during the week ahead. These areas will remain under an 'orange' alert till Tuesday, as the monsoon activity is likely to continue through the week ahead. On Sunday, Pune (Shivajinagar) recorded 117 mm of rainfall and it became the third wettest June day since 1969. Thunder and heavy downpour had crippled the city and large parts of Mumbai late on Saturday, inundating most major roads and underpasses. Pune's Lohegaon and peripheral areas recorded 1398 mm during the past 24 hours, the IMD rainfall data showed. The average rainfall over Pune (Shivajinagar) for June is 156.3 mm. With Saturday\u2019s heavy spell, the city has surpassed the monthly average and has now received a total of 209.1 mm (till 8.30 am on Sunday), notably before the monsoon onset. Since 1969, the wettest June day over Pune was experienced in 1991, when the city recorded 529.5 mm against the annual rainfall of 763 mm. Northeast India, including Assam, Meghalaya, Sikkim, and Arunachal Pradesh, is bracing for extremely heavy rainfall which is expected during June 10-13, the IMD has warned. Since the early onset was realised over this region, it has been experiencing continuous rainfall this season so far. Meanwhile, heatwave conditions have returned to North and Northwest India where the monsoon is yet to arrive. Punjab, Haryana, Bihar, Jharkhand, Gangetic West Bengal, Jammu, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Delhi, Western Rajasthan, and Madhya Pradesh will remain under the grip of heatwave conditions till June 13. 'Severe' heatwave conditions will emerge over Uttar Pradesh till June 13, the IMD has forecast.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/india/rainfall-maharashtra-monsoon-arrives-early-mumbai-pune-9382128/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/06/rain.jpeg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 17:02:54", "author": null, "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.148}

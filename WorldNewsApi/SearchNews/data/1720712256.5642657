Mr Thakur, who held the sports, and information and broadcasting portfolios in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's last cabinet, has apparently been dropped, sources said. \"I extend my best wishes and congratulations to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on his third term and heartiest wishes to all his ministers and may they do a wonderful job and take the country forward in the next 5 years,\" he told reporters. Mr Thakur is one of the three former ministers -- along with Smiriti Irani and Narayan Rane -- who may not take oath today as part of the Modi 3.0 cabinet, sources have said. Unlike Ms Irani, both Mr Thakur and Mr Rane have won the general election from their constituencies. Mr Thakur won from Himachal Pradesh's Hamirpur and Mr Rane from Maharashtra's Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg. In a post on X, formerly Twitter, Mr Thakur has bid goodbye to the Modi 2.0 cabinet, which was dissolved after the election results came in on Tuesday. \"As I bid adieu to this amazing team, I am reminded that it is the dedication of each member that truly holds the strength. A great team can indeed move mountains,\" his post read. Expressing his gratitude to PM Modi, he added, \"Thank you to my wonderful team for making these years so memorable. Your invaluable contributions have played a crucial role in the Viksit Bharat journey, and you will always hold a special place in my heart\". As I bid adieu to this amazing team, I am reminded that it is the dedication of each member that truly holds the strength.

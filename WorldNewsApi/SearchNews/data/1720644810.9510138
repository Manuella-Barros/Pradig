Sienna Dell, who has an IV line that goes into her heart, became unwell and was blue lighted to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. The youngster and her mum, Mandy Dell, had been looking forward to seeing Taylor Swift at the first UK gig of the tour, after they couldn't get London tickets. But after spending all their savings and travelling 10 hours on the train from London to watch the pop icon perform Sienna only got to see a quarter of the concert. Sienna had to be rushed to hospital after developing a fever. Mandy said it was her 'dream come true' to attend and shared a video of her daughter getting emotional as Taylor Swift came on stage. Now she hopes her daughter can get another chance to see her idol on the Eras Tour which is travelling to Liverpool, Cardiff, London and Dublin later in the summer. She posted on Facebook appealing for tickets for another gig or a message from the megastar. \"We need you help, as many of you know we tried sooo hard to get sienna to the Taylor swift concert. We were thankfully able to secure tickets to Edinburgh after failing to secure London tickets. She prepped for months and we used all our savings to make this come true. \"We travelled from London to Scotland yesterday and she was buzzing, unfortunately 1/4 of the way through I had to keep removing sienna from the stadium as she wasn\u2019t feeling great, I thought as first it was just overwhelming / over excited but unfortunately sienna did become unwell and was blue lighted to Edinburgh hospital.\" \"She only got to see 1/4 of it ( video is of how emotional she got when Taylor first appeared. ) \"We would really like a second chance and for her to get the chance to either re do or a messsge from Taylor or anything at this point really. She is devastated. Could you help us reach Taylor Swift x\" She told a local newspaper: \"Sienna is a massive Taylor Swift fan and it was her dream to be at the concert and see her idol but sadly it was cut short. She is heartbroken. Sienna has been though a lot already and she deserved it so much, probably more than most due to her complex medical history so I just hope we can get a second chance at making that dream come true.

{"id": 225041484, "title": "Konkan\u2019s Alphonso mango growers make a killing from unseasonal flush as season enters last leg", "text": "Mango growers from Maharashtra\u2019s Konkan belt have reported an unexpected flush of Hapus variety, also called Alphonso, which has resulted in keeping their fruit in market well beyond the end of season. Farmers say their fruit would be available till mid-June - something which rarely happens in the state. Mandar Khedkar, whose mango orchards are in the Ratnagiri district of Konkan, said this unexpected harvest can be traced to the attack of thrifts which saw flower drop in November. \u201cSubsequent clear skies and conducive climate resulted in another flush and the fruit from that flush is now being sold in the market,\u201d he said. Only Hapus or Alphonso mangoes grown in the Konkan coast have earned the GI tag, though similar varieties from other regions are available in the market. Mango growers from Konkan normally tend to sell their mangoes to pulp manufacturers after the first week of May, due to quality concerns as well as the lack of labour to tend to the orchards. \u201cThis year the pulp manufacturers have procured mangoes at the rate of Rs 25-26/kg, which was economical for the growers,\u201d he said. As a result, 90 per cent of the growers had already sold their produce to the pulp manufacturers, but a few farmers like Khedkar had decided to go with the retail markets. Given the lower-than-expected arrivals, prices in retail markets of Pune and Mumbai have spiked. Khedkar said at present ready-to-eat Hapus mangoes are being sold at the rate of Rs 700-750/dozen in the wholesale markets. \u201cEarlier we were selling the same mangoes at around Rs 500-600 a dozen,\u201d he said. Khedkar said his orchards would be able to supply mangoes till June 20. \u201cThis is very unusual but the attack of thrifts in November has really turned out to be a blessing in disguise,\u201d he said. In Pune\u2019s market, similar varieties of mangoes from Karnataka are being sold at Rs 250-300 Rohan Ursal, a commission agent operating out of Pune\u2019s wholesale market, said quality and quantity wise mangoes from Karnataka are available in good amounts. \u201cThus customers are buying this in bulk,\u201d he said. Overall, Hapus growers from Konkan said they have had a good season. Mukukn Joshi, director of the Hapus Amba Utpadak Vikreta Sahakari Sangh \u2013 a cooperative body of Hapus growers- said the season saw farmers make good money. \u201cThe season will get over in the next 8-10 days,\u201d he said.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/konkan-alphonso-mango-unseasonal-flush-9359697/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/05/alphonso.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:54:08", "author": "Parthasarathi Biswas", "authors": ["Parthasarathi Biswas"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.205}

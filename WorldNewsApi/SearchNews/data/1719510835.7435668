{"id": 223691898, "title": "Cheap hotel beside cemetery at Kozukappara execution grounds in Tokyo is a scary place to stay", "text": "Things go bump in the night at this unique accommodation in Minami Senju. Back in the Edo period, (1603-1867) Tokyo was home to three major execution grounds, and one of them, Kozukappara, was located near present-day Minami-Senju Station. Today, this area is famous for its cheap hotels, and the site where criminals were once executed is now taken up by a longstanding temple called Ekoin, where you can find the graves of political activists from the end of the Edo period, including Yoshida Shoin. It\u2019s a fascinating site rich in history and rumoured hauntings, so if that sounds like something you\u2019d like to immerse yourself in, there\u2019s a way you can do that \u2014 by staying at the hotel next door. \u25bc Hotel on the left, cemetery on the right Our reporter Masanuki Sunakoma has made it his mission to stay at as many cheap hotels in Tokyo as possible, but this stay was a little unnerving, even for him. Still, it was incredibly cheap, with fees starting at just 3,500 yen (US$22.40) a night, so he took the plunge and made a booking, arriving at the hotel at night. The location was ideal, being just a three-minute walk from Minami-Senju Station, and the building itself was inviting, as it looked more like a family home than a hotel. Stepping into the lobby, Masanuki removed his shoes and placed them in a locker before stepping into a pair of slippers and signing in at the front desk. The lobby had a retro atmosphere, and the walls were decorated with certificates of commendation, giving it the feel of a hotel from the Showa-era (1926-1989). It had everything you\u2019d need for an overnight stay, though, with a mini-manga corner, a vending machine, and a microwave oven. At the back were the showers, toilets, and a water server. There\u2019s also a communal bath here, but when Masanuki visited it was unavailable as it was undergoing repairs. The guest rooms are on the next floor, so Masanuki headed up the stairs, where he found\u2026 \u25bc \u2026a view of the cemetery from the window. He wasn\u2019t expecting the graves to appear so close to the building, but there they were, looking strangely peaceful and majestic in the night. It was thrilling to think he would be able to sleep next to some famous historical figures, and looking at the shiny guest room floor, he couldn\u2019t help but feel it had an execution-like look to it. There were a lot of doors and corridors that made the place feel like a maze, and when he headed down one hallway he found a washroom area with toilets and sinks. To the side here was an emergency staircase cordoned off with a chain. Looking down, you can see a long staircase that goes straight to the bottom, like the entrance to a dungeon. It sent Masanuki\u2019s imagination into overdrive and he could feel shivers run down his spine, so he was happy when he opened the door to his room and found it looked bright and inviting inside. The room had a long and narrow hallway, where you\u2019d normally expect to find a bath or kitchen. However, this was no apartment \u2014 it was a cheap hotel room, so the only thing it needed was a bed, an air-conditioning unit, and some desks. It was compact with not a lot of room to swing a suitcase, but that suited Masanuki just fine as he\u2019d come with nothing but a backpack. The bed was comfy, with a nice, thick mattress but the pillow was a bit odd as it seemed flatter than usual. The tables were worn, but he\u2019d been provided with a yukata, towels and a hairdryer, which is what you\u2019d usually get to use during a hot spring stay. A lot of cheap hotels don\u2019t provide this service so it really helped to elevate his stay, and after changing into the yukata and enjoying a quick shower, Masanuki lay down on the bed and felt all the stresses of the day slip away. However, that\u2019s when something strange happened. As he drifted between wakefulness and the land of nod, he felt his body trembling. Forcing himself awake and opening his eyelids, he realised it wasn\u2019t just his body that was shaking \u2014 the whole room was too. Then he heard a roar from the distance, and as it got louder, so too did the tremor, prompting Masanuki to look out the window to find out what was going on. That\u2019s when he realised\u2026 \u25bc \u2026it was a train. From the window of his room, Masanuki could see the railway he\u2019d used earlier \u2014 the JR Joban Line \u2014 and as the hotel wasn\u2019t far from the railroad tracks, it seemed to receive a lot of noise and vibrations from passing trains. Breathing a sigh of relief that it wasn\u2019t anything more sinister, Masanuki checked the train timetable on his phone, where he found that the trains run about every 10 minutes until around 12:30 a.m. After that time, Masanuki was able to enjoy a quiet night of slumber, and when he woke in the morning, he mused at the fact that the scariest thing about the place were the trains and not the spirits next door. It was a thrilling stay that made Masanuki feel alive in more ways than one. He reckons it\u2019s great value for money, and he highly recommends it to anyone looking for a unique type of budget accommodation\u2026as long as you\u2019re not afraid of trains.

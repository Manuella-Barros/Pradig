{"id": 231294940, "title": "There was a ruckus about the stage in the NDA meeting, Jayant Chaudhary gave this clarification", "text": "New Delhi. A meeting of the NDA was called on Friday, in which Narendra Modi was elected the leader of the parliamentary party for the third time. All the allies of the BJP were invited to this meeting. All the parties included in the NDA were seen with Modi on the stage, but RLD leader Jayant Chaudhary was missing. Taking advantage of this, SP and Congress have made it an issue and called not giving him a place on the stage an insult to Jayant Chaudhary. Samajwadi Party (SP) shared these pictures of Jayant Chaudhary on its social media account and wrote sarcastically, \u2018RLD party chief Jayant Chaudhary was not even given a place on the stage, even though he has two seats, while the leaders of parties with one seat each have been seated together on the stage. SP further wrote, BJP\u2019s hatred towards Jat community and its dramatic false respect for late Chaudhary Charan Singh and Chaudhary Ajit Singh has been exposed. If Jayant Chaudhary is truly a farmer-friendly person, then he should distance himself from NDA and raise his voice against BJP on the issue of farmers\u2019 interests. One should not trade his self-respect and farmers\u2019 interests with BJP for petty and immediate greed. While talking to the media after the NDA Parliamentary Party meeting, Jayant Chaudhary did not say anything directly on this issue. He just said that Narendra Modi has been elected for the post of Prime Minister in the NDA Parliamentary Party meeting. We have had many discussions in the NDA meeting. The way PM Modi has worked for 10 years, he will work with the same energy in the future. He did not even mention his ministerial post. At the same time, a leader very close to Jayant Chaudhary said that not giving a speech on the stage is not a big issue. It is only a matter of mismanagement.", "summary": "<p>New Delhi.

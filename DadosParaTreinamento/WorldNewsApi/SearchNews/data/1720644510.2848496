{"id": 231220000, "title": "Mathews: I fly my flags to inspire and unite, not to divide", "text": "Last year my city councilmember stopped me as he strolled by. \u201cAre you Mexican?\u201d he asked. \u201cNope, I\u2019m Scots-Irish,\u201d I replied. \u201cBut\u2026 I\u2019m doing a lot of work there these days.\u201d The councilmember\u2019s question was not unprompted. I had been flying the flag of Mexico outside my house for six months. He assumed it was a statement. In fact, I\u2019m a serial flier of flags on the stand mounted next to my front door in the San Gabriel Valley. Over the years, I\u2019ve learned how quickly people make inaccurate assumptions about flags and their meanings. So, I\u2019ve felt unexpected sympathy for U.S. Supreme Court justice Samuel Alito, who has been criticized for flying an upside-down American flag outside his residence, and a Christian nationalist \u201cAppeal to Heaven\u201d flag at his beach house. Alito\u2019s critics say the flags demonstrate bias \u2014 an affinity with Trump supporters who deny the 2020 elections results and support the Jan. 6 insurrection \u2014 that violates judicial ethics. They believe he should recuse himself from Trump-related cases. Alito has blamed his wife for putting up the flags. For the record, I\u2019m no fan of Alito. He has cruelly and unreasonably stripped rights from Americans, and shown scorn and bad faith toward California. His integrity is questionable, given his naked partisanship and the favors he\u2019s accepted from rich people, including Eureka billionaire Rob Arkley. In short, Alito\u2019s scandalous, embarrassing presence on the Supreme Court makes me want to fly my own American flag upside down \u2014 traditionally a signal of dire distress for the nation. But I\u2019m not sure the flags on his houses should be held against him. Because I certainly wouldn\u2019t want my flag choices held against me. I don\u2019t think my flag choices are endorsements, or mean that I can\u2019t be an impartial journalist. Still, I\u2019m a citizen first and a reporter second. I retain the right to self-expression. I own dozens of cheap flags. Some are sports-related \u2014 flags for the Lakers, Dodgers and my wife\u2019s Green Bay Packers go up in the playoffs. But most of the flags I fly are of countries with which I have no ties of heritage or culture. I\u2019ve spent 16 years running an annual, traveling global democracy forum, and I often fly the flag of the country that will host us next. I had Mexico\u2019s flag up in advance of our 2023 Mexico City forum. Before that, I flew the Swiss flag, which prompted passersby to ask if I was a doctor or worked for the International Red Cross. Last week, after the completion of our forum in Bucharest, I took down my Romanian flag, and raised the blue-and-black of Botswana (host of the 2025 forum). I have practical reasons for flying these flags. My house is small. If I did early morning Zoom calls with forum hosts around the world, I\u2019d wake up my entire family. Instead, I do the calls on the porch, with the flag of whomever I\u2019m speaking with flapping behind me. Sometimes my flags get personal, even political. I communicate my heritage with the flags of Ireland or Scotland. When times are tough in California, I fly the state flag in solidarity. I\u2019ve mounted the flag of Hong Kong \u2014 where I lived as a child \u2014 to protest China\u2019s violence there. Flags can have dangerous power, especially at public sites. Just look at the pitched fights about the Pride or Confederate flags. It is no coincidence that armies carry flags into battle. Flags don\u2019t have to represent division. Different flags, flown by different neighbors, symbolize pluralism \u2014 our commitment to let people choose their loyalties. As Flag Day approaches, this eccentric flag lover urges you to allow everyone \u2014 even terrible judges \u2014 to fly whatever flags we wish.

It had tumbled a bit more than 6% after several weaker-than-expected reports raised worries the Federal Reserve had pressed the brakes too hard for too long on the U.S. economy through high interest rates in order to beat inflation.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 480 points, or 1.2%, as of 11 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 1.7% higher. The vast majority of stocks were climbing in a mirror opposite of the day before, from smaller companies that need U.S. households to keep spending to huge multinationals more dependent on the global economy.\n\nStronger-than-expected profit reports from several big U.S. companies helped drive the market. Kenvue, the company behind Tylenol and Band-Aids, jumped 12.7% after reporting stronger profit than expected thanks in part to higher prices for its products. Uber rolled 7.9% higher after easily topping profit forecasts for the latest quarter.\n\nCaterpillar veered from an early loss to a gain of 3.8% after reporting stronger earnings than expected but weaker revenue.\n\nSeveral technical factors may have accelerated the recent swoon for markets, beyond weak U.S. hiring data and other dispiriting U.S. economic reports, in what strategists at Barclays called \"a perfect storm\" for causing extreme market moves. One is centered in Tokyo, where a favorite trade for hedge funds and other investors began unraveling last week after the Bank of Japan made borrowing more expensive by raising interest rates above virtually zero.\n\nThat scrambled trades where investors had borrowed Japanese yen at low cost and invested it elsewhere around the world. The resulting exits from those investments may have helped accelerate the declines for markets around the world.\n\nJapan's Nikkei 225 jumped 10.2% Tuesday to claw back much of its 12.4% sell-off the day before, which was its worst since the Black Monday crash of 1987. Stocks in Tokyo rebounded as the value of the Japanese yen stabilized against the U.S. dollar following several days of sharp gains.\n\n\"The speed, the magnitude and the shock factor clearly demonstrate\" how much of the moves were driven by how traders were positioned, according to the strategists at Barclays led by Stefano Pascale and Anshul Gupta. That could indicate it wasn't just worries about the U.S. economy.\n\nStill, some voices along Wall Street are continuing to urge caution.\n\nBarry Bannister, chief equity strategist at Stifel, is warning more drops could be ahead because of a slowing U.S. economy and sticky inflation. He's forecasting both will be worse in the second half of this year than what much of Wall Street expects, while saying a measure of how expensive the U.S. stock market is still looks \"frothy\" when compared with bond yields and other financial conditions.\n\nThe stock market's \"dip is not a blip,\" he warned in a report, and called it \"too soon to jump back in.\"\n\nHe had been predicting a coming \"correction\" in U.S. stock prices for a while, including an acknowledgement in July that his initial call was early. That was a couple days before the S&P 500 set its latest all-time high and then began sinking.\n\nWhile fears are rising about a slowing U.S. economy, it is still growing, and a recession is far from a certainty. The U.S. stock market is also still up a healthy amount for the year so far, and the Federal Reserve says it has ample room to cut interest rates to help the economy if the job market weakens significantly.\n\nThe S&P 500 has romped to dozens of all-time highs this year, in part due to a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology, and critics have been saying that's sent stock prices too high in many cases.\n\nThey've pointed in particular to Nvidia, Apple and the other handful of Big Tech stocks in the \"Magnificent Seven\" that were the main reason the S&P 500 set so may records this year. Propelled in part by the mania around AI, they helped overshadow weakness across other areas of the stock market, which were struggling under the weight of high interest rates.\n\nA set of underwhelming profit reports recently, kicked off by Tesla and Alphabet, added to the pessimism and dragged Big Tech stocks lower. Nvidia dropped nearly 19% from the start of July through Monday on such concerns, but it rose 4.8% Tuesday and was one of the strongest forces pushing upward on the market.\n\nApple, though, fell another 0.8% and was the heaviest weight on the S&P 500.\n\nIn the bond market, Treasury yields were ticking higher to claw back some of their sharp drops since April, driven by rising expectations for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.86% from 3.78% late Monday. It had briefly dropped below 3.70% during Monday when fear in the market was spiking and investors were speculating the Federal Reserve could even have to call an emergency meeting to cut interest rates quickly.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Elaine Kurtenbach and Matt Ott contributed.", "source": {"uri": "baltimoresun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Baltimore Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It had tumbled a bit more than 6% on a raft of concerns, including worries the Federal Reserve had pressed the brakes too hard for too long on the U.S. economy through high interest rates in order to beat inflation.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 294 points, or 0.8%, while the Nasdaq composite gained 1%. Stocks of all kinds climbed in a mirror opposite of the day before, from smaller companies that need U.S. households to keep spending to huge multinationals more dependent on the global economy.\n\nStronger-than-expected profit reports from several big U.S. companies helped drive the market. Kenvue, the company behind Tylenol and Band-Aids, jumped 14.7% after reporting stronger profit than expected thanks in part to higher prices for its products. Uber rolled 10.9% higher after easily topping profit forecasts for the latest quarter.\n\nCaterpillar climbed 3% after the maker of heavy machinery reported stronger earnings than expected.\n\nThe whiplash moves for financial markets globally have been the result of several technical factors, not just worries ignited by several weaker-than-expected reports on the U.S. economy, in what strategists at Barclays called \"a perfect storm\" for causing extreme market moves. One is centered in Tokyo, where a favorite trade for hedge funds and other investors began unraveling last week after the Bank of Japan made borrowing more expensive by raising interest rates above virtually zero.\n\nThat scrambled trades where investors had borrowed Japanese yen at low cost and invested the cash elsewhere around the world. The resulting exits from those investments may have helped accelerate the declines for markets around the world.\n\nJapan's Nikkei 225 jumped 10.2% Tuesday to claw back much of its 12.4% sell-off the day before, which was its worst since the Black Monday crash of 1987.

He's forecasting both will be worse in the second half of this year than what much of Wall Street expects, while saying a measure of how expensive the U.S. stock market is still looks \"frothy\" when compared with bond yields and other financial conditions.\n\nThe stock market's \"dip is not a blip,\" he warned in a report, and called it \"too soon to jump back in.\"\n\nHe had been predicting a coming \"correction\" in U.S. stock prices for a while, including an acknowledgement in July that his initial call was early. That was a couple days before the S&P 500 set its latest all-time high and then began sinking.\n\nWhile fears are rising about a slowing U.S. economy, it is still growing, and many economists see a recession in the next year or so as unlikely. The U.S. stock market is also still up a healthy amount for the year so far, and the Federal Reserve says it has ample room to cut interest rates to help the economy if the job market weakens significantly.\n\nThe S&P 500 has romped to dozens of all-time highs this year and is still up nearly 10% this year so far, in part due to a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. Critics have been saying that euphoria has sent stock prices too high in many cases.\n\nThey've pointed in particular to Nvidia, Apple and the other handful of Big Tech stocks in the \"Magnificent Seven\" that were the main reason the S&P 500 set so may records this year. They helped overshadow weakness across other areas of the stock market, which were struggling under the weight of high interest rates.\n\nA set of underwhelming profit reports recently, kicked off by Tesla and Alphabet, added to the pessimism and dragged Big Tech stocks lower.

It had tumbled a bit more than 6% on a raft of concerns, including worries the Federal Reserve had pressed the brakes too hard for too long on the U.S. economy through high interest rates in order to beat inflation.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 294 points, or 0.8%, while the Nasdaq composite gained 1%. Stocks of all kinds climbed in a mirror opposite of the day before, from smaller companies that need U.S. households to keep spending to huge multinationals more dependent on the global economy.\n\nStronger-than-expected profit reports from several big U.S. companies helped drive the market. Kenvue, the company behind Tylenol and Band-Aids, jumped 14.7% after reporting stronger profit than expected thanks in part to higher prices for its products. Uber rolled 10.9% higher after easily topping profit forecasts for the latest quarter.\n\nCaterpillar climbed 3% after the maker of heavy machinery reported stronger earnings than expected.\n\nThe whiplash moves for financial markets globally have been the result of several technical factors, not just worries ignited by several weaker-than-expected reports on the U.S. economy, in what strategists at Barclays called \"a perfect storm\" for causing extreme market moves. One is centered in Tokyo, where a favorite trade for hedge funds and other investors began unraveling last week after the Bank of Japan made borrowing more expensive by raising interest rates above virtually zero.\n\nThat scrambled trades where investors had borrowed Japanese yen at low cost and invested the cash elsewhere around the world. The resulting exits from those investments may have helped accelerate the declines for markets around the world.\n\nJapan's Nikkei 225 jumped 10.2% Tuesday to claw back much of its 12.4% sell-off the day before, which was its worst since the Black Monday crash of 1987. Stocks in Tokyo rebounded as the value of the Japanese yen stabilized against the U.S. dollar following several days of sharp gains.\n\n\"The speed, the magnitude and the shock factor clearly demonstrate\" how much of the moves were driven by how traders were positioned, according to the strategists at Barclays led by Stefano Pascale and Anshul Gupta.\n\nStill, some voices along Wall Street are continuing to urge caution.\n\nBarry Bannister, chief equity strategist at Stifel, is warning more drops could be ahead because of a slowing U.S. economy and sticky inflation. He's forecasting both will be worse in the second half of this year than what much of Wall Street expects, while saying a measure of how expensive the U.S. stock market is still looks \"frothy\" when compared with bond yields and other financial conditions.\n\nThe stock market's \"dip is not a blip,\" he warned in a report, and called it \"too soon to jump back in.\"\n\nHe had been predicting a coming \"correction\" in U.S. stock prices for a while, including an acknowledgement in July that his initial call was early. That was a couple days before the S&P 500 set its latest all-time high and then began sinking.\n\nWhile fears are rising about a slowing U.S. economy, it is still growing, and many economists see a recession in the next year or so as unlikely. The U.S. stock market is also still up a healthy amount for the year so far, and the Federal Reserve says it has ample room to cut interest rates to help the economy if the job market weakens significantly.\n\nThe S&P 500 has romped to dozens of all-time highs this year and is still up nearly 10% this year so far, in part due to a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. Critics have been saying that euphoria has sent stock prices too high in many cases.\n\nThey've pointed in particular to Nvidia, Apple and the other handful of Big Tech stocks in the \"Magnificent Seven\" that were the main reason the S&P 500 set so may records this year. They helped overshadow weakness across other areas of the stock market, which were struggling under the weight of high interest rates.\n\nA set of underwhelming profit reports recently, kicked off by Tesla and Alphabet, added to the pessimism and dragged Big Tech stocks lower. Nvidia dropped nearly 19% from the start of July through Monday on such concerns, but it rose 3.8% Tuesday and was one of the strongest forces pushing upward on the market.\n\nApple, though, slipped another 1% and was the heaviest weight on the market.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 rose 53.70 points to 5,240.03.

It had tumbled a bit more than 6% after several weaker-than-expected reports raised worries the Federal Reserve had pressed the brakes too hard for too long on the U.S. economy through high interest rates in order to beat inflation.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 47 points, or 0.1%, as of 9:43 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.3% lower.\n\nStronger-than-expected profit reports from several big U.S. companies helped support the market. Kenvue, the company behind Tylenol and Band-Aids, jumped 13.5% after reporting stronger profit than expected thanks in part to higher prices for its products. Uber rolled 4.3% higher after easily topping profit forecasts for the latest quarter.\n\nCaterpillar veered from an early loss to a gain of 1.7% after reporting stronger earnings than expected but weaker revenue.\n\nSeveral technical factors may have accelerated the recent swoon for markets, beyond the weak U.S. hiring data and other reports, in what strategists at Barclays call \"a perfect storm\" for causing extreme market moves. One is centered in Tokyo, where a favorite trade for hedge funds and other investors began unraveling last week after the Bank of Japan made borrowing more expensive by raising interest rates above virtually zero.\n\nThat scrambled trades where investors had borrowed Japanese yen at low cost and invested it elsewhere around the world. The resulting exits from those trades may have helped accelerate the declines for markets around the world.\n\nBut Japan's Nikkei 225 jumped 10.2% Tuesday, following its 12.4% sell-off the day before, which was its worst since the Black Monday crash of 1987. Stocks in Tokyo rebounded as the value of the Japanese yen stabilized a bit against the U.S. dollar following several days of sharp gains.\n\n\"The speed, the magnitude and the shock factor clearly demonstrate\" how much of the moves were driven by how traders were positioned, rather than just worries about the economy, according to the strategists at Barclays led by Stefano Pascale and Anshul Gupta.\n\nStill, some voices along Wall Street are continuing to urge caution.\n\nBarry Bannister, chief equity strategist at Stifel, is warning more drops could be ahead because of a slowing U.S. economy and sticky inflation. He had been predicting a coming \"correction\" in U.S. stock prices for a while, including an acknowledgement in July that his initial call was early. That was two days before the S&P 500 set its latest all-time high and then began sinking.\n\nWhile fears are rising about a slowing U.S. economy, it is still growing, and a recession is far from a certainty. The U.S. stock market is also still up a healthy amount for the year so far. The S&P 500 has romped to dozens of all-time highs this year, in part due to a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology and critics have been saying prices looked too expensive.\n\nElsewhere, European markets were mostly left out of the rebound, with stock indexes down modestly in Germany France and the United Kingdom.\n\nAP Business Writers Elaine Kurtenbach and Matt Ott contributed.",

Stocks of all kinds climbed in a mirror opposite of the day before, from smaller companies that need U.S. households to keep spending to huge multinationals more dependent on the global economy.\n\nStronger-than-expected profit reports from several big U.S. companies helped drive the market. Kenvue, the company behind Tylenol and Band-Aids, jumped 14.7% after reporting stronger profit than expected thanks in part to higher prices for its products. Uber rolled 10.9% higher after easily topping profit forecasts for the latest quarter.\n\nCaterpillar climbed 3% after the maker of heavy machinery reported stronger earnings than expected.\n\nThe whiplash moves for financial markets globally have been the result of several technical factors, not just worries ignited by several weaker-than-expected reports on the U.S. economy, in what strategists at Barclays called \"a perfect storm\" for causing extreme market moves. One is centered in Tokyo, where a favorite trade for hedge funds and other investors began unraveling last week after the Bank of Japan made borrowing more expensive by raising interest rates above virtually zero.\n\nThat scrambled trades where investors had borrowed Japanese yen at low cost and invested the cash elsewhere around the world.

He's forecasting both will be worse in the second half of this year than what much of Wall Street expects, while saying a measure of how expensive the U.S. stock market is still looks \"frothy\" when compared with bond yields and other financial conditions.\n\nThe stock market's \"dip is not a blip,\" he warned in a report, and called it \"too soon to jump back in.\"\n\nHe had been predicting a coming \"correction\" in U.S. stock prices for a while, including an acknowledgement in July that his initial call was early. That was a couple days before the S&P 500 set its latest all-time high and then began sinking.\n\nWhile fears are rising about a slowing U.S. economy, it is still growing, and many economists see a recession in the next year or so as unlikely. The U.S. stock market is also still up a healthy amount for the year so far, and the Federal Reserve says it has ample room to cut interest rates to help the economy if the job market weakens significantly.\n\nThe S&P 500 has romped to dozens of all-time highs this year and is still up nearly 10% so far in 2024, in part due to a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. Critics have been saying that euphoria has sent stock prices too high in many cases.\n\nThey've pointed in particular to Nvidia, Apple and the other handful of Big Tech stocks in the \"Magnificent Seven\" that were the main reason the S&P 500 set so may records this year. They helped overshadow weakness across other areas of the stock market, which were struggling under the weight of high interest rates.\n\nA set of underwhelming profit reports recently, kicked off by Tesla and Alphabet, added to the pessimism and dragged Big Tech stocks lower. Nvidia dropped nearly 19% from the start of July through Monday on such concerns, but it rose 3.8% Tuesday and was one of the strongest forces pushing upward on the market.\n\nApple, though, slipped another 1% and was the heaviest weight on the market.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 rose 53.70 points to 5,240.03. The Dow added 294.39 to 38,997.66, and the Nasdaq gained 166.77 to 16,366.85.\n\nIn the bond market, Treasury yields climbed to claw back some of their sharp drops since April, which were driven by rising expectations for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.88% from 3.78% late Monday. It had briefly dropped below 3.70% during Monday when fear in the market was spiking and investors were speculating the Federal Reserve could even have to call an emergency meeting to cut interest rates quickly.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Elaine Kurtenbach and Matt Ott contributed.", "source": {"uri": "fortune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fortune"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It had tumbled a bit more than 6% after several weaker-than-expected reports raised worries the Federal Reserve had pressed the brakes too hard for too long on the U.S. economy through high interest rates in order to beat inflation.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 480 points, or 1.2%, as of 11 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 1.7% higher. The vast majority of stocks were climbing in a mirror opposite of the day before, from smaller companies that need U.S. households to keep spending to huge multinationals more dependent on the global economy.\n\nStronger-than-expected profit reports from several big U.S. companies helped drive the market. Kenvue, the company behind Tylenol and Band-Aids, jumped 12.7% after reporting stronger profit than expected thanks in part to higher prices for its products. Uber rolled 7.9% higher after easily topping profit forecasts for the latest quarter.\n\nCaterpillar veered from an early loss to a gain of 3.8% after reporting stronger earnings than expected but weaker revenue.\n\nSeveral technical factors may have accelerated the recent swoon for markets, beyond weak U.S. hiring data and other dispiriting U.S. economic reports, in what strategists at Barclays called \"a perfect storm\" for causing extreme market moves. One is centered in Tokyo, where a favorite trade for hedge funds and other investors began unraveling last week after the Bank of Japan made borrowing more expensive by raising interest rates above virtually zero.\n\nThat scrambled trades where investors had borrowed Japanese yen at low cost and invested it elsewhere around the world. The resulting exits from those investments may have helped accelerate the declines for markets around the world.\n\nJapan's Nikkei 225 jumped 10.2% Tuesday to claw back much of its 12.4% sell-off the day before, which was its worst since the Black Monday crash of 1987. Stocks in Tokyo rebounded as the value of the Japanese yen stabilized against the U.S. dollar following several days of sharp gains.\n\n\"The speed, the magnitude and the shock factor clearly demonstrate\" how much of the moves were driven by how traders were positioned, according to the strategists at Barclays led by Stefano Pascale and Anshul Gupta. That could indicate it wasn't just worries about the U.S. economy.\n\nStill, some voices along Wall Street are continuing to urge caution.\n\nBarry Bannister, chief equity strategist at Stifel, is warning more drops could be ahead because of a slowing U.S. economy and sticky inflation. He's forecasting both will be worse in the second half of this year than what much of Wall Street expects, while saying a measure of how expensive the U.S. stock market is still looks \"frothy\" when compared with bond yields and other financial conditions.\n\nThe stock market's \"dip is not a blip,\" he warned in a report, and called it \"too soon to jump back in.\"\n\nHe had been predicting a coming \"correction\" in U.S. stock prices for a while, including an acknowledgement in July that his initial call was early. That was a couple days before the S&P 500 set its latest all-time high and then began sinking.\n\nWhile fears are rising about a slowing U.S. economy, it is still growing, and a recession is far from a certainty. The U.S. stock market is also still up a healthy amount for the year so far, and the Federal Reserve says it has ample room to cut interest rates to help the economy if the job market weakens significantly.\n\nThe S&P 500 has romped to dozens of all-time highs this year, in part due to a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology, and critics have been saying that's sent stock prices too high in many cases.\n\nThey've pointed in particular to Nvidia, Apple and the other handful of Big Tech stocks in the \"Magnificent Seven\" that were the main reason the S&P 500 set so may records this year. Propelled in part by the mania around AI, they helped overshadow weakness across other areas of the stock market, which were struggling under the weight of high interest rates.\n\nA set of underwhelming profit reports recently, kicked off by Tesla and Alphabet, added to the pessimism and dragged Big Tech stocks lower. Nvidia dropped nearly 19% from the start of July through Monday on such concerns, but it rose 4.8% Tuesday and was one of the strongest forces pushing upward on the market.\n\nApple, though, fell another 0.8% and was the heaviest weight on the S&P 500.\n\nIn the bond market, Treasury yields were ticking higher to claw back some of their sharp drops since April, driven by rising expectations for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.86% from 3.78% late Monday. It had briefly dropped below 3.70% during Monday when fear in the market was spiking and investors were speculating the Federal Reserve could even have to call an emergency meeting to cut interest rates quickly.\n\nAP Business Writers Elaine Kurtenbach and Matt Ott contributed.\n\nMore from this section\n\nEnergyCAP Appoints Shawn Lankton as Chief Executive Officer\n\nAttorney Jenna Sutter Joins All Injuries Law Firm\n\nHarris selects Minnesota Gov.

Some calm is returning to Wall Street, and US stocks are holding steadier after Japan's market soared earlier Tuesday to bounce back from its worst loss since 1987.\n\nNew York, Aug 6 (AP) Some calm is returning to Wall Street, and US stocks are holding steadier after Japan's market soared earlier Tuesday to bounce back from its worst loss since 1987.\n\nThe S&P 500 was 0.2 per cent higher in early trading and on track to break a brutal three-day losing streak. It had tumbled a bit more than 6 per cent after several weaker-than-expected reports raised worries the Federal Reserve had pressed the brakes too hard for too long on the US economy through high interest rates in order to beat inflation.\n\nAlso Read | 'Hindus Are Very Afraid': Bangladesh ISKCON General Secretary Charu Chandra Das Brahmachari Seek's India's Help Amid Unrest (Watch Video).\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 47 points, or 0.1 per cent, as of 9:43 am Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.3 per cent lower.\n\nStronger-than-expected profit reports from several big US companies helped support the market. Kenvue, the company behind Tylenol and Band-Aids, jumped 13.5 per cent after reporting stronger profit than expected thanks in part to higher prices for its products. Uber rolled 4.3 per cent higher after easily topping profit forecasts for the latest quarter.\n\nAlso Read | Hiroshima, Nagasaki Atomic Bombings: Lok Sabha Pays Tributes to Victims of Nuclear Bomb Attack in Japanese Cities in August 1945.\n\nCaterpillar veered from an early loss to a gain of 1.7 per cent after reporting stronger earnings than expected but weaker revenue.\n\nSeveral technical factors may have accelerated the recent swoon for markets, beyond the weak US hiring data and other reports, in what strategists at Barclays call \"a perfect storm\" for causing extreme market moves. One is centred in Tokyo, where a favourite trade for hedge funds and other investors began unravelling last week after the Bank of Japan made borrowing more expensive by raising interest rates above virtually zero.\n\nThat scrambled trades where investors had borrowed Japanese yen at low cost and invested it elsewhere around the world. The resulting exits from those trades may have helped accelerate the declines for markets around the world.\n\nBut Japan's Nikkei 225 jumped 10.2 per cent Tuesday, following its 12.4 per cent sell-off the day before, which was its worst since the Black Monday crash of 1987. Stocks in Tokyo rebounded as the value of the Japanese yen stabilised a bit against the US dollar following several days of sharp gains.\n\n\"The speed, the magnitude and the shock factor clearly demonstrate\" how much of the moves were driven by how traders were positioned, rather than just worries about the economy, according to the strategists at Barclays led by Stefano Pascale and Anshul Gupta.\n\nStill, some voices along Wall Street are continuing to urge caution.\n\nBarry Bannister, chief equity strategist at Stifel, is warning more drops could be ahead because of a slowing US economy and sticky inflation. He had been predicting a coming \"correction\" in US stock prices for a while, including an acknowledgement in July that his initial call was early. That was two days before the S&P 500 set its latest all-time high and then began sinking.\n\nWhile fears are rising about a slowing US economy, it is still growing, and a recession is far from a certainty. The US stock market is also still up a healthy amount for the year so far. The S&P 500 has romped to dozens of all-time highs this year, in part due to a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology and critics have been saying prices looked too expensive.\n\nElsewhere, European markets were mostly left out of the rebound, with stock indexes down modestly in Germany France and the United Kingdom.

It had tumbled a bit more than 6 percent on a raft of concerns, including worries the Federal Reserve had pressed the brakes too hard for too long on the U.S. economy through high interest rates in order to beat inflation.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 294 points, or 0.8 percent , while the Nasdaq composite gained 1 percent . Stocks of all kinds climbed in a mirror opposite of the day before, from smaller companies that need U.S. households to keep spending to huge multinationals more dependent on the global economy.\n\nStronger-than-expected profit reports from several big U.S. companies helped drive the market. Kenvue, the company behind Tylenol and Band-Aids, jumped 14.7 percent after reporting stronger profit than expected thanks in part to higher prices for its products. Uber rolled 10.9 percent higher after easily topping profit forecasts for the latest quarter.\n\nCaterpillar climbed 3 percent after the maker of heavy machinery reported stronger earnings than expected.\n\nThe whiplash moves for financial markets globally have been the result of several technical factors, not just worries ignited by several weaker-than-expected reports on the U.S. economy, in what strategists at Barclays called \"a perfect storm\" for causing extreme market moves. One is centered in Tokyo, where a favorite trade for hedge funds and other investors began unraveling last week after the Bank of Japan made borrowing more expensive by raising interest rates above virtually zero.\n\nThat scrambled trades where investors had borrowed Japanese yen at low cost and invested the cash elsewhere around the world. The resulting exits from those investments may have helped accelerate the declines for markets around the world.\n\nJapan's Nikkei 225 jumped 10.2 percent Tuesday to claw back much of its 12.4 percent sell-off the day before, which was its worst since the Black Monday crash of 1987. Stocks in Tokyo rebounded as the value of the Japanese yen stabilized against the U.S. dollar following several days of sharp gains.\n\n\"The speed, the magnitude and the shock factor clearly demonstrate\" how much of the moves were driven by how traders were positioned, according to the strategists at Barclays led by Stefano Pascale and Anshul Gupta.\n\nStill, some voices along Wall Street are continuing to urge caution.\n\nBarry Bannister, chief equity strategist at Stifel, is warning more drops could be ahead because of a slowing U.S. economy and sticky inflation. He's forecasting both will be worse in the second half of this year than what much of Wall Street expects, while saying a measure of how expensive the U.S. stock market is still looks \"frothy\" when compared with bond yields and other financial conditions.\n\nThe stock market's \"dip is not a blip,\" he warned in a report, and called it \"too soon to jump back in.\"\n\nHe had been predicting a coming \"correction\" in U.S. stock prices for a while, including an acknowledgement in July that his initial call was early. That was a couple days before the S&P 500 set its latest all-time high and then began sinking.\n\nWhile fears are rising about a slowing U.S. economy, it is still growing, and many economists see a recession in the next year or so as unlikely. The U.S. stock market is also still up a healthy amount for the year so far, and the Federal Reserve says it has ample room to cut interest rates to help the economy if the job market weakens significantly.\n\nThe S&P 500 has romped to dozens of all-time highs this year and is still up nearly 10% so far in 2024, in part due to a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. Critics have been saying that euphoria has sent stock prices too high in many cases.\n\nThey've pointed in particular to Nvidia, Apple and the other handful of Big Tech stocks in the \"Magnificent Seven\" that were the main reason the S&P 500 set so may records this year. They helped overshadow weakness across other areas of the stock market, which were struggling under the weight of high interest rates.\n\nA set of underwhelming profit reports recently, kicked off by Tesla and Alphabet, added to the pessimism and dragged Big Tech stocks lower. Nvidia dropped nearly 19 percent from the start of July through Monday on such concerns, but it rose 3.8 percent Tuesday and was one of the strongest forces pushing upward on the market.\n\nApple, though, slipped another 1 percent and was the heaviest weight on the market.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 rose 53.70 points to 5,240.03. The Dow added 294.39 to 38,997.66, and the Nasdaq gained 166.77 to 16,366.85.\n\nIn the bond market, Treasury yields climbed to claw back some of their sharp drops since April, which were driven by rising expectations for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.88 percent from 3.78 percent late Monday. It had briefly dropped below 3.70 percent during Monday when fear in the market was spiking and investors were speculating the Federal Reserve could even have to call an emergency meeting to cut interest rates quickly.", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type":

Critics have been saying that euphoria has sent stock prices too high in many cases.\n\nThey've pointed in particular to Nvidia, Apple and the other handful of Big Tech stocks in the 'Magnificent Seven' that were the main reason the S&P 500 set so many records this year. They helped overshadow weakness across other areas of the stock market, which were struggling under the weight of high interest rates.\n\nA set of underwhelming profit reports recently, kicked off by Tesla and Alphabet, added to the pessimism and dragged Big Tech stocks lower. Nvidia dropped nearly 19% from the start of July through Monday on such concerns, but it rose 5.8% Tuesday and was one of the strongest forces pushing upward on the market.\n\nApple, though, slipped another 0.7% and was a heavy weight on the market.\n\nBond market\n\nIn the bond market, Treasury yields climbed to claw back some of their sharp drops since April, which were driven by rising expectations for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.89% from 3.78% late Monday. It had briefly dropped below 3.70% during Monday when fear in the market was spiking and investors were speculating the Federal Reserve could even have to call an emergency meeting to cut interest

It had tumbled a bit more than 6% on a raft of concerns, including worries the Federal Reserve had pressed the brakes too hard for too long on the U.S. economy through high interest rates in order to beat inflation.\n\n\"The market by any metric is 'oversold' and due for a bounce,\" said Quincy Krosby at LPL Financial. \"The lingering question now is whether the concerns that pushed the market into a cascade of selling are alleviated. Pockets of volatility are expected to continue.\"\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 294 points, or 0.8%, while the Nasdaq composite gained 1%. Stocks of all kinds climbed in a mirror opposite of Monday, from the smaller companies that need U.S. households to keep spending to the huge multinationals that are more dependent on the global economy.\n\nStronger-than-expected profit reports from several big U.S. companies helped drive the market. Shares of Kenvue, the company behind Tylenol and Band-Aids, jumped 14.7% after reporting stronger profit than expected thanks in part to higher prices for its products.

This, in our view, remains unlikely,\" analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote in a report published early Tuesday.\n\nThe bank's economists consider a U.S. recession in the coming year \"a risk rather than a likely outcome,\" they said, noting that \"very significant cash piles\" have been built up in money market funds that investors could tap to buy stocks at lower prices.\n\nBarry Bannister, chief equity strategist at Stifel, is warning more drops could be ahead because of a slowing U.S. economy and sticky inflation. He's forecasting both will be worse in the second half of this year than what much of Wall Street expects, while saying a measure of how expensive the U.S. stock market is still looks \"frothy\" when compared with bond yields and other financial conditions.\n\nThe stock market's \"dip is not a blip,\" he warned in a report, and called it \"too soon to jump back in.\"\n\nHe had been predicting a coming \"correction\" in U.S. stock prices for a while, including an acknowledgement in July that his initial call was early. That was a couple of days before the S&P 500 set its latest all-time high and then began sinking.\n\n\"Get used to the volatility,\" said Savita Subramanian at Bank of America Corp. \"The best hedge is owning high-quality stocks.\"\n\nWhile fears are rising about a slowing U.S. economy, it is still growing, and many economists see a recession in the next year or so as unlikely.\n\nThe U.S. stock market is also still up a healthy amount for the year so far, and the Federal Reserve says it has ample room to cut interest rates to help the economy if the job market weakens significantly.\n\nThe S&P 500 has romped to dozens of all-time highs this year and is still up nearly 10% so far in 2024, in part because of a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology.\n\nCritics have been saying that euphoria has sent stock prices too high in many cases.\n\nThey've pointed in particular to Nvidia, Apple and the other handful of tech stocks in the \"Magnificent Seven\" that were the main reason the S&P 500 set so may records this year. They helped overshadow weakness across other areas of the stock market, which were struggling under the weight of high interest rates.\n\nA set of underwhelming profit reports recently, kicked off by Tesla and Alphabet, added to the pessimism and dragged tech stocks lower.\n\nNvidia's share price has dropped nearly 19% from the start of July through Monday on such concerns, but it rose 3.8% Tuesday and was one of the strongest forces pushing upward on the market.\n\nApple, though, slipped another 1% and was the heaviest weight on the market.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 rose 53.70 points to 5,240.03.

But the index finished well above its weakest level of the day.\n\nThe S&P 500 climbed 1% to break a brutal three-day losing streak. It had tumbled a bit more than 6% on a raft of concerns, including worries the Federal Reserve had pressed the brakes too hard for too long on the U.S. economy through high interest rates in order to beat inflation.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 294 points, or 0.8%, while the Nasdaq composite gained 1%. Stocks of all kinds climbed in a mirror opposite of the day before, from smaller companies that need U.S. households to keep spending to huge multinationals more dependent on the global economy.\n\nStronger-than-expected profit reports from several big U.S. companies helped drive the market. Kenvue, the company behind Tylenol and Band-Aids, jumped 14.7% after reporting stronger profit than expected thanks in part to higher prices for its products. Uber rolled 10.9% higher after easily topping profit forecasts for the latest quarter.\n\nCaterpillar climbed 3% after the maker of heavy machinery reported stronger earnings than expected.\n\nThe whiplash moves for financial markets globally have been the result of several technical factors, not just worries ignited by several weaker-than-expected reports on the U.S. economy, in what strategists at Barclays called \"a perfect storm\" for causing extreme market moves. One is centered in Tokyo, where a favorite trade for hedge funds and other investors began unraveling last week after the Bank of Japan made borrowing more expensive by raising interest rates above virtually zero.\n\nThat scrambled trades where investors had borrowed Japanese yen at low cost and invested the cash elsewhere around the world. The resulting exits from those investments may have helped accelerate the declines for markets around the world.\n\nJapan's Nikkei 225 jumped 10.2% Tuesday to claw back much of its 12.4% sell-off the day before, which was its worst since the Black Monday crash of 1987. Stocks in Tokyo rebounded as the value of the Japanese yen stabilized against the U.S. dollar following several days of sharp gains.\n\n\"The speed, the magnitude and the shock factor clearly demonstrate\" how much of the moves were driven by how traders were positioned, according to the strategists at Barclays led by Stefano Pascale and Anshul Gupta.\n\nStill, some voices along Wall Street are continuing to urge caution.\n\nBarry Bannister, chief equity strategist at Stifel, is warning more drops could be ahead because of a slowing U.S. economy and sticky inflation. He's forecasting both will be worse in the second half of this year than what much of Wall Street expects, while saying a measure of how expensive the U.S. stock market is still looks \"frothy\" when compared with bond yields and other financial conditions.\n\nThe stock market's \"dip is not a blip,\" he warned in a report, and called it \"too soon to jump back in.\"\n\nHe had been predicting a coming \"correction\" in U.S. stock prices for a while, including an acknowledgement in July that his initial call was early. That was a couple days before the S&P 500 set its latest all-time high and then began sinking.\n\nWhile fears are rising about a slowing U.S. economy, it is still growing, and many economists see a recession in the next year or so as unlikely. The U.S. stock market is also still up a healthy amount for the year so far, and the Federal Reserve says it has ample room to cut interest rates to help the economy if the job market weakens significantly.\n\nThe S&P 500 has romped to dozens of all-time highs this year and is still up nearly 10% this year so far, in part due to a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. Critics have been saying that euphoria has sent stock prices too high in many cases.\n\nThey've pointed in particular to Nvidia, Apple and the other handful of Big Tech stocks in the \"Magnificent Seven\" that were the main reason the S&P 500 set so may records this year. They helped overshadow weakness across other areas of the stock market, which were struggling under the weight of high interest rates.\n\nA set of underwhelming profit reports recently, kicked off by Tesla and Alphabet, added to the pessimism and dragged Big Tech stocks lower. Nvidia dropped nearly 19% from the start of July through Monday on such concerns, but it rose 3.8% Tuesday and was one of the strongest forces pushing upward on the market.\n\nApple, though, slipped another 1% and was the heaviest weight on the market.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 rose 53.70 points to 5,240.03. The Dow added 294.39 to 38,997.66, and the Nasdaq gained 166.77 to 16,366.85.\n\nIn the bond market, Treasury yields climbed to claw back some of their sharp drops since April, which were driven by rising expectations for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.88% from 3.78% late Monday. It had briefly dropped below 3.70% during Monday when fear in the market was spiking and investors were speculating the Federal Reserve could even have to call an emergency meeting to cut interest rates quickly.\n\nThe Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index ended down 248.27 points, or 1.1%, at 21,979.36, its third straight day of declines and its lowest closing level since July 2.\n\nEarlier in the day, the TSX touched 21,659.26.\n\nThe Toronto market's materials group, which includes metal miners and fertilizer companies, lost 2.9% as gold prices fell. Technology declined 1.4% and financials, the TSX's most heavily weighted sector, ended 1% lower. Energy was down 0.4% even as the price of oil settled 0.4% higher at $73.20 a barrel.\n\nNine of the TSX's 10 main sectors lost ground. The exception was real estate, which ended nearly unchanged. The sector could benefit from the recent drop in borrowing costs.\n\nTraders are now pricing in a 68% chance the Fed will cut rates by 50 basis points at its next scheduled policy meeting on September 17-18, and a 32% chance of a 25 basis point reduction. A cut of at least 50 basis points was fully priced in on Monday, with a 75 basis point cut also seen possible, according to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool.\n\nThe growing expectations for aggressive rate cuts by the Federal Reserve is being perceived as giving the Bank of Canada more breathing room to cut rates in this country. As of late Tuesday, money markets were pricing in about 90% odds of a Bank of Canada quarter-point rate cut at its next policy meeting in September, and about 10% odds of a larger 50 basis point cut.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki",

It had tumbled a bit more than 6% after several weaker-than-expected reports raised worries the Federal Reserve had pressed the brakes too hard for too long on the U.S. economy through high interest rates in order to beat inflation.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 364 points, or 0.9%, as of 10:15 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.8% higher. The vast majority of stocks were climbing in a mirror opposite of the day before.\n\nStronger-than-expected profit reports from several big U.S. companies helped drive the market. Kenvue, the company behind Tylenol and Band-Aids, jumped 13.5% after reporting stronger profit than expected thanks in part to higher prices for its products. Uber rolled 7.4% higher after easily topping profit forecasts for the latest quarter.\n\nCaterpillar veered from an early loss to a gain of 3.3% after reporting stronger earnings than expected but weaker revenue.\n\nSeveral technical factors may have accelerated the recent swoon for markets, beyond weak U.S. hiring data and other dispiriting U.S. economic reports, in what strategists at Barclays called \"a perfect storm\" for causing extreme market moves. One is centered in Tokyo, where a favorite trade for hedge funds and other investors began unraveling last week after the Bank of Japan made borrowing more expensive by raising interest rates above virtually zero.\n\nThat scrambled trades where investors had borrowed Japanese yen at low cost and invested it elsewhere around the world. The resulting exits from those investments may have helped accelerate the declines for markets around the world.\n\nJapan's Nikkei 225 jumped 10.2% Tuesday to claw back much of its 12.4% sell-off the day before, which was its worst since the Black Monday crash of 1987. Stocks in Tokyo rebounded as the value of the Japanese yen stabilized against the U.S. dollar following several days of sharp gains.\n\n\"The speed, the magnitude and the shock factor clearly demonstrate\" how much of the moves were driven by how traders were positioned, according to the strategists at Barclays led by Stefano Pascale and Anshul Gupta. That indicates it wasn't just worries about the U.S. economy\n\nStill, some voices along Wall Street are continuing to urge caution.\n\nBarry Bannister, chief equity strategist at Stifel, is warning more drops could be ahead because of a slowing U.S. economy and sticky inflation. He's forecasting both will be worse in the second half of this year than what much of Wall Street expects, while saying a measure of how expensive the U.S. stock market is still looks \"frothy\" when compared with bond yields and other financial conditions.\n\nThe stock market's \"dip is not a blip,\" he warned in a report, and called it \"too soon to jump back in.\"\n\nHe had been predicting a coming \"correction\" in U.S. stock prices for a while, including an acknowledgement in July that his initial call was early. That was a couple days before the S&P 500 set its latest all-time high and then began sinking.\n\nWhile fears are rising about a slowing U.S. economy, it is still growing, and a recession is far from a certainty. The U.S. stock market is also still up a healthy amount for the year so far, and the Federal Reserve says it has ample room to cut interest rates to help the economy if the job market weakens significantly.\n\nThe S&P 500 has romped to dozens of all-time highs this year, in part due to a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology, and critics have been saying that's sent stock prices too high in many cases.\n\nThey've pointed in particular to Nvidia, Apple and the other handful of Big Tech stocks in the \"Magnificent Seven\" that were the main reason the S&P 500 set so may records this year. Propelled in part by the mania around AI, they helped overshadow weakness across other areas of the stock market, which were struggling under the weight of high interest rates.\n\nA set of underwhelming profit reports recently, kicked off by Tesla and Alphabet, added to the pessimism and dragged Big Tech stocks lower. Nvidia dropped nearly 19% from the start of July through Monday on such concerns, but it rose 3.2% Tuesday and was one of the strongest forces pushing upward on the market.\n\nApple, though, fell another 2.3% and was the heaviest weight on the S&P 500.\n\nIn the bond market, Treasury yields were ticking higher to claw back some of their sharp drops since April, driven by rising expectations for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.83% from 3.78% late Monday. It had briefly dropped below 3.70% during Monday when fear in the market was spiking and investors were speculating the Federal Reserve could even have to cut rates at an emergency meeting.\n\nElsewhere, European markets were mostly left out of the global rebound, with stock indexes close to flat or down modestly in Germany France and the United Kingdom.\n\nAP Business Writers

It had tumbled a bit more than 6% after several weaker-than-expected reports raised worries the Federal Reserve had pressed the brakes too hard for too long on the U.S. economy through high interest rates in order to beat inflation.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 480 points, or 1.2%, as of 11 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 1.7% higher. The vast majority of stocks were climbing in a mirror opposite of the day before, from smaller companies that need U.S. households to keep spending to huge multinationals more dependent on the global economy.\n\nStronger-than-expected profit reports from several big U.S. companies helped drive the market. Kenvue, the company behind Tylenol and Band-Aids, jumped 12.7% after reporting stronger profit than expected thanks in part to higher prices for its products. Uber rolled 7.9% higher after easily topping profit forecasts for the latest quarter.\n\nCaterpillar veered from an early loss to a gain of 3.8% after reporting stronger earnings than expected but weaker revenue.\n\nSeveral technical factors may have accelerated the recent swoon for markets, beyond weak U.S. hiring data and other dispiriting U.S. economic reports, in what strategists at Barclays called \"a perfect storm\" for causing extreme market moves. One is centered in Tokyo, where a favorite trade for hedge funds and other investors began unraveling last week after the Bank of Japan made borrowing more expensive by raising interest rates above virtually zero.\n\nThat scrambled trades where investors had borrowed Japanese yen at low cost and invested it elsewhere around the world. The resulting exits from those investments may have helped accelerate the declines for markets around the world.\n\nJapan's Nikkei 225 jumped 10.2% Tuesday to claw back much of its 12.4% sell-off the day before, which was its worst since the Black Monday crash of 1987. Stocks in Tokyo rebounded as the value of the Japanese yen stabilized against the U.S. dollar following several days of sharp gains.\n\n\"The speed, the magnitude and the shock factor clearly demonstrate\" how much of the moves were driven by how traders were positioned, according to the strategists at Barclays led by Stefano Pascale and Anshul Gupta. That could indicate it wasn't just worries about the U.S. economy.\n\nStill, some voices along Wall Street are continuing to urge caution.\n\nBarry Bannister, chief equity strategist at Stifel, is warning more drops could be ahead because of a slowing U.S. economy and sticky inflation. He's forecasting both will be worse in the second half of this year than what much of Wall Street expects, while saying a measure of how expensive the U.S. stock market is still looks \"frothy\" when compared with bond yields and other financial conditions.\n\nThe stock market's \"dip is not a blip,\" he warned in a report, and called it \"too soon to jump back in.\"\n\nHe had been predicting a coming \"correction\" in U.S. stock prices for a while, including an acknowledgement in July that his initial call was early. That was a couple days before the S&P 500 set its latest all-time high and then began sinking.\n\nWhile fears are rising about a slowing U.S. economy, it is still growing, and a recession is far from a certainty. The U.S. stock market is also still up a healthy amount for the year so far, and the Federal Reserve says it has ample room to cut interest rates to help the economy if the job market weakens significantly.\n\nThe S&P 500 has romped to dozens of all-time highs this year, in part due to a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology, and critics have been saying that's sent stock prices too high in many cases.\n\nThey've pointed in particular to Nvidia, Apple and the other handful of Big Tech stocks in the \"Magnificent Seven\" that were the main reason the S&P 500 set so may records this year. Propelled in part by the mania around AI, they helped overshadow weakness across other areas of the stock market, which were struggling under the weight of high interest rates.\n\nA set of underwhelming profit reports recently, kicked off by Tesla and Alphabet, added to the pessimism and dragged Big Tech stocks lower. Nvidia dropped nearly 19% from the start of July through Monday on such concerns, but it rose 4.8% Tuesday and was one of the strongest forces pushing upward on the market.\n\nApple, though, fell another 0.8% and was the heaviest weight on the S&P 500.\n\nIn the bond market, Treasury yields were ticking higher to claw back some of their sharp drops since April, driven by rising expectations for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.86% from 3.78% late Monday. It had briefly dropped below 3.70% during Monday when fear in the market was spiking and investors were speculating the Federal Reserve could even have to call an emergency meeting to cut interest rates quickly.\n\nAP Business Writers Elaine Kurtenbach and Matt Ott contributed.", "source": {"uri": "bostonherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It had tumbled a bit more than 6 percent on a raft of concerns, including worries the Federal Reserve had pressed the brakes too hard for too long on the US economy through high interest rates in order to beat inflation.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 294 points, or 0.8 percent, while the Nasdaq composite gained 1 percent. Stocks of all kinds climbed in a mirror opposite of the day before, from smaller companies that need US households to keep spending to huge multinationals more dependent on the global economy.\n\nStronger-than-expected profit reports from several big US companies helped drive the market. Kenvue, the company behind Tylenol and Band-Aids, jumped 14.7 percent after reporting stronger profit than expected thanks in part to higher prices for its products. Uber rolled 10.9 percent higher after easily topping profit forecasts for the latest quarter.\n\nCaterpillar climbed 3 percent after the maker of heavy machinery reported stronger earnings than expected.\n\nThe whiplash moves for financial markets globally have been the result of several technical factors, not just worries ignited by several weaker-than-expected reports on the US economy, in what strategists at Barclays called \"a perfect storm\" for causing extreme market moves. One is centered in Tokyo, where a favorite trade for hedge funds and other investors began unraveling last week after the Bank of Japan made borrowing more expensive by raising interest rates above virtually zero.\n\nThat scrambled trades where investors had borrowed Japanese yen at low cost and invested the cash elsewhere around the world. The resulting exits from those investments may have helped accelerate the declines for markets around the world.\n\nJapan's Nikkei 225 jumped 10.2 percent Tuesday to claw back much of its 12.4 percent sell-off the day before, which was its worst since the Black Monday crash of 1987. Stocks in Tokyo rebounded as the value of the Japanese yen stabilized against the US dollar following several days of sharp gains.\n\n\"The speed, the magnitude and the shock factor clearly demonstrate\" how much of the moves were driven by how traders were positioned, according to the strategists at Barclays led by Stefano Pascale and Anshul Gupta.\n\nStill, some voices along Wall Street are continuing to urge caution.\n\nBarry Bannister, chief equity strategist at Stifel, is warning more drops could be ahead because of a slowing US economy and sticky inflation. He's forecasting both will be worse in the second half of this year than what much of Wall Street expects, while saying a measure of how expensive the US stock market is still looks \"frothy\" when compared with bond yields and other financial conditions.\n\nThe stock market's \"dip is not a blip,\" he warned in a report, and called it \"too soon to jump back in.\"\n\nHe had been predicting a coming \"correction\" in US stock prices for a while, including an acknowledgement in July that his initial call was early. That was a couple days before the S&P 500 set its latest all-time high and then began sinking.\n\nWhile fears are rising about a slowing US economy, it is still growing, and many economists see a recession in the next year or so as unlikely. The US stock market is also still up a healthy amount for the year so far, and the Federal Reserve says it has ample room to cut interest rates to help the economy if the job market weakens significantly.\n\nThe S&P 500 has romped to dozens of all-time highs this year and is still up nearly 10 percent so far in 2024, in part due to frenzy around artificial intelligence technology. Critics have been saying that euphoria has sent stock prices too high in many cases.\n\nThey've pointed in particular to Nvidia, Apple and the other handful of Big Tech stocks in the \"Magnificent Seven\" that were the main reason the S&P 500 set so may records this year. They helped overshadow weakness across other areas of the stock market, which were struggling under the weight of high interest rates.\n\nA set of underwhelming profit reports recently, kicked off by Tesla and Alphabet, added to the pessimism and dragged Big Tech stocks lower. Nvidia dropped nearly 19 percent from the start of July through Monday on such concerns, but it rose 3.8 percent Tuesday and was one of the strongest forces pushing upward on the market.\n\nApple, though, slipped another 1 percent and was the heaviest weight on the market.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 rose 53.70 points to 5,240.03. The Dow added 294.39 to 38,997.66, and the Nasdaq gained 166.77 to 16,366.85.\n\nIn the bond market, Treasury yields climbed to claw back some of their sharp drops since April, which were driven by rising expectations for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.88 percent from 3.78 percent late Monday. It had briefly dropped below 3.70 percent during Monday when fear in the market was spiking and investors were speculating the Federal Reserve could even have to call an emergency meeting to cut interest rates quickly.", "source": {"uri": "businessmirror.com.ph", "dataType": "news", "title": "BusinessMirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stan_choe@businessmirror.com.ph", "name": "Stan Choe", "type":

The resulting exits from those investments may have helped accelerate the declines for markets around the world.\n\nJapan's Nikkei 225 jumped 10.2% Tuesday to claw back much of its 12.4% sell-off the day before, which was its worst since the Black Monday crash of 1987. Stocks in Tokyo rebounded as the value of the Japanese yen stabilized against the U.S. dollar following several days of sharp gains.\n\n\"The speed, the magnitude and the shock factor clearly demonstrate\" how much of the moves were driven by how traders were positioned, according to the strategists at Barclays led by Stefano Pascale and Anshul Gupta. That could indicate it wasn't just worries about the U.S. economy.\n\nStill, some voices along Wall Street are continuing to urge caution.\n\nRelated Story: Stock Market Today: Wall Street Slumps and 10-Year Yield Tumbles Below 4% on ...\n\nBarry Bannister, chief equity strategist at Stifel, is warning more drops could be ahead because of a slowing U.S. economy and sticky inflation. He's forecasting both will be worse in the second half of this year than what much of Wall Street expects, while saying a measure of how expensive the U.S. stock market is still looks \"frothy\" when compared with bond yields and other financial conditions.\n\nThe stock market's \"dip is not a blip,\" he warned in a report, and called it \"too soon to jump back in.\"\n\nHe had been predicting a coming \"correction\" in U.S. stock prices for a while, including an acknowledgement in July that his initial call was early. That was a couple days before the S&P 500 set its latest all-time high and then began sinking.\n\nWhile fears are rising about a slowing U.S. economy, it is still growing, and a recession is far from a certainty. The U.S. stock market is also still up a healthy amount for the year so far, and the Federal Reserve says it has ample room to cut interest rates to help the economy if the job market weakens significantly.\n\nThe S&P 500 has romped to dozens of all-time highs this year, in part due to a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology, and critics have been saying that's sent stock prices too high in many cases.\n\nThey've pointed in particular to Nvidia, Apple and the other handful of Big Tech stocks in the \"Magnificent Seven\" that were the main reason the S&P 500 set so may records this year. Propelled in part by the mania around AI, they helped overshadow weakness across other areas of the stock market, which were struggling under the weight of high interest rates.\n\nRelated Story: Stock Market Today: A Widespread Rally on Wall Street Sends Stocks Rising, Both ...\n\nA set of underwhelming profit reports recently, kicked off by Tesla and Alphabet, added to the pessimism and dragged Big Tech stocks lower. Nvidia dropped nearly 19% from the start of July through Monday on such concerns, but it rose 4.8% Tuesday and was one of the strongest forces pushing upward on the market.\n\nApple, though, fell another 0.8% and was the heaviest weight on the S&P 500.\n\nIn the bond market, Treasury yields were ticking higher to claw back some of their sharp drops since April, driven by rising expectations for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.86% from 3.78% late Monday. It had briefly dropped below 3.70% during Monday when fear in the market was spiking and investors were speculating the Federal Reserve could even have to call an emergency meeting to cut interest rates quickly.", "source": {"uri": "gvwire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GV Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@gvwire.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency":

Stocks of all kinds climbed in a mirror opposite of the day before, from smaller companies that need US households to keep spending to huge multinationals more dependent on the global economy.\n\nStronger-than-expected profit reports from several big US companies helped drive the market. Kenvue, the company behind Tylenol and Band-Aids, jumped 14.7 percent after reporting stronger profit than expected thanks in part to higher prices for its products. Uber rolled 10.9 percent higher after easily topping profit forecasts for the latest quarter.\n\nCaterpillar climbed 3 percent after the maker of heavy machinery reported stronger earnings than expected.\n\nThe whiplash moves for financial markets globally have been the result of several technical factors, not just worries ignited by several weaker-than-expected reports on the US economy, in what strategists at Barclays called \"a perfect storm\" for causing extreme market moves. One is centered in Tokyo, where a favorite trade for hedge funds and other investors began unraveling last week after the Bank of Japan made borrowing more expensive by raising interest rates above virtually zero.\n\nThat scrambled trades where investors had borrowed Japanese yen at low cost and invested the cash elsewhere around the world. The resulting exits from those investments may have helped accelerate the declines for markets around the world.\n\nJapan's Nikkei 225 jumped 10.2 percent Tuesday to claw back much of its 12.4 percent sell-off the day before, which was its worst since the Black Monday crash of 1987. Stocks in Tokyo rebounded as the value of the Japanese yen stabilized against the US dollar following several days of sharp gains.\n\n\"The speed, the magnitude, and the shock factor clearly demonstrate\" how much of the moves were driven by how traders were positioned, according to the strategists at Barclays led by Stefano Pascale and Anshul Gupta.\n\nStill, some voices along Wall Street are continuing to urge caution.\n\nBarry Bannister, chief equity strategist at Stifel, is warning more drops could be ahead because of a slowing US economy and sticky inflation. He's forecasting both will be worse in the second half of this year than what much of Wall Street expects, while saying a measure of how expensive the US stock market is still looks \"frothy\" when compared with bond yields and other financial conditions.\n\nThe stock market's \"dip is not a blip,\" he warned in a report, and called it \"too soon to jump back in.\"\n\nHe had been predicting a coming \"correction\" in US stock prices for a while, including an acknowledgement in July that his initial call was early. That was a couple days before the S&P 500 set its latest record high and then began sinking.\n\nWhile fears are rising about a slowing US economy, it is still growing, and many economists see a recession in the next year or so as unlikely. The US stock market is also still up a healthy amount for the year so far, and the Federal Reserve says it has ample room to cut interest rates to help the economy if the job market weakens significantly.\n\nThe S&P 500 has romped to dozens of record highs this year and is still up nearly 10 percent so far in 2024, in part due to a frenzy around artificial intelligence technology. Critics have been saying that euphoria has sent stock prices too high in many cases.\n\nThey've pointed in particular to Nvidia, Apple, and the other handful of Big Tech stocks in the \"Magnificent Seven\" that were the main reason the S&P 500 set so may records this year. They helped overshadow weakness across other areas of the stock market, which were struggling under the weight of high interest rates.\n\nA set of underwhelming profit reports recently, kicked off by Tesla and Alphabet, added to the pessimism and dragged Big Tech stocks lower. Nvidia dropped nearly 19 percent from the start of July through Monday on such concerns, but it rose 3.8 percent Tuesday and was one of the strongest forces pushing upward on the market.\n\nApple, though, slipped another 1 percent and was the heaviest weight on the market.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 rose 53.70 points to 5,240.03. The Dow added 294.39 to 38,997.66, and the Nasdaq gained 166.77 to 16,366.85.\n\nIn the bond market, Treasury yields climbed to claw back some of their sharp drops since April, which were driven by rising expectations for coming cuts to interest rates by the Fed.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

A weaker yen tends to help profits of export manufacturers that earn most of their revenue overseas, and a surge in the yen's value after the BOJ's rate hike led to big gains for the Japanese currency late last week.\n\nIn recent months the dollar had traded at a near four decade high level of 160 yen.\n\nThe unwinding of the carry trades plus worries over the outlook for the U.S. economy sent markets tumbling late last week and into Monday's session.\n\nElsewhere in Asia on Wednesday, Hong Kong's Hang Seng was the outlier, giving up 0.3% to 16,647.34. The Shanghai Composite index gained 0.2%, to 2,873.25.\n\nSouth Korea's Kospi jumped 2.6% to 2,587.78 and the benchmark in Taiwan jumped more than 3% -- both markets were among the biggest losers in Monday's sell-offs due to heavy weighting of technology shares that have seen the biggest losses in the past few weeks.\n\nThe S&P/ASX 200 in Australia was up 0.4% at 7,712.20.\n\nOn Tuesday, the S&P 500 climbed 1% to break a brutal three-day losing streak. It had tumbled a bit more than 6% on a raft of concerns, including worries the Federal Reserve had pressed the brakes too hard for too long on the U.S. economy through high interest rates in order to beat inflation.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 53.70 points to 5,240.03. The Dow added 294.39, or 0.8%, to 38,997.66, and the Nasdaq gained 166.77, or 1%, to 16,366.85.\n\nStocks of all kinds climbed in a mirror opposite of the day before, from smaller companies that need U.S. households to keep spending to huge multinationals more dependent on the global economy.\n\nStronger-than-expected profit reports from several big U.S. companies helped drive the market. Kenvue, the company behind Tylenol and Band-Aids, jumped 14.7% after reporting stronger profit than expected thanks in part to higher prices for its products. Uber rolled 10.9% higher after easily topping profit forecasts for the latest quarter.\n\nCaterpillar climbed 3% after the maker of heavy machinery reported stronger earnings than expected.\n\nWhile fears are rising about a slowing U.S. economy, it is still growing, and many economists see a recession in the next year or so as unlikely. The U.S. stock market is also still up a healthy amount for the year so far, and the Federal Reserve says it has ample room to cut interest rates to help the economy if the job market weakens significantly.\n\nThe S&P 500 has romped to dozens of all-time highs this year and is still up nearly 10% so far in 2024, in part due to a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. Critics have been saying that euphoria has sent stock prices too high in many cases.\n\nIn the bond market, Treasury yields climbed to claw back some of their sharp drops since April, which were driven by rising expectations for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.88% from 3.78% late Monday. It had briefly dropped below 3.70% during Monday when fear in the market was spiking and investors were speculating the Federal Reserve could even have to call an emergency meeting to cut interest rates quickly.\n\nIn other dealings early Wednesday, U.S. benchmark crude oil was down 15 cents at $73.05 per barrel.

One is centred in Tokyo, where a favourite trade for hedge funds and other investors began unravelling last week after the Bank of Japan made borrowing more expensive by raising interest rates above virtually zero.\n\nThat scrambled trades where investors had borrowed Japanese yen at low cost and invested it elsewhere around the world. The resulting exits from those trades may have helped accelerate the declines for markets around the world.\n\nBut Japan's Nikkei 225 jumped 10.2 per cent Tuesday, following its 12.4 per cent sell-off the day before, which was its worst since the Black Monday crash of 1987. Stocks in Tokyo rebounded as the value of the Japanese yen stabilised a bit against the US dollar following several days of sharp gains.\n\n\"The speed, the magnitude and the shock factor clearly demonstrate\" how much of the moves were driven by how traders were positioned, rather than just worries about the economy, according to the strategists at Barclays led by Stefano Pascale and Anshul Gupta.\n\nStill, some voices along Wall Street are continuing to urge caution.\n\nBarry Bannister, chief equity strategist at Stifel, is warning more drops could be ahead because of a slowing US economy and sticky inflation. He had been predicting a coming \"correction\" in US stock prices for a while, including an acknowledgement in July that his initial call was early. That was two days before the S&P 500 set its latest all-time high and then began sinking.\n\nWhile fears are rising about a slowing US economy, it is still growing, and a recession is far from a certainty. The US stock market is also still up a healthy amount for the year so far. The S&P 500 has romped to dozens of all-time highs this year, in part due to a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology and critics have been saying prices looked too expensive.\n\nElsewhere, European markets were mostly left out of the rebound, with stock indexes down modestly in Germany France and the United Kingdom.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@indianexpress.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Japan", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barclays", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barclays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japanese yen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dow Jones Industrial Average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hedge fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikkei_225", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nikkei 225"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock market index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education and Training", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/08/Wall-Street-Charging-Bull.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795086", "eventUri": "eng-9795086", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

A weaker yen tends to help profits of export manufacturers that earn most of their revenue overseas, and a surge in the yen's value after the BOJ's rate hike led to big gains for the Japanese currency late last week.\n\nIn recent months the dollar had traded at a near four decade high level of 160 yen.\n\nThe unwinding of the carry trades plus worries over the outlook for the U.S. economy sent markets tumbling late last week and into Monday's session.\n\nElsewhere in Asia on Wednesday, Hong Kong's Hang Seng was the outlier, giving up 0.3% to 16,647.34. The Shanghai Composite index gained 0.2%, to 2,873.25.\n\nSouth Korea's Kospi jumped 2.6% to 2,587.78 and the benchmark in Taiwan jumped more than 3% -- both markets were among the biggest losers in Monday's sell-offs due to heavy weighting of technology shares that have seen the biggest losses in the past few weeks.\n\nThe S&P/ASX 200 in Australia was up 0.4% at 7,712.20.\n\nOn Tuesday, the S&P 500 climbed 1% to break a brutal three-day losing streak. It had tumbled a bit more than 6% on a raft of concerns, including worries the Federal Reserve had pressed the brakes too hard for too long on the U.S. economy through high interest rates in order to beat inflation.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 53.70 points to 5,240.03. The Dow added 294.39, or 0.8%, to 38,997.66, and the Nasdaq gained 166.77, or 1%, to 16,366.85.\n\nStocks of all kinds climbed in a mirror opposite of the day before, from smaller companies that need U.S. households to keep spending to huge multinationals more dependent on the global economy.\n\nStronger-than-expected profit reports from several big U.S. companies helped drive the market. Kenvue, the company behind Tylenol and Band-Aids, jumped 14.7% after reporting stronger profit than expected thanks in part to higher prices for its products. Uber rolled 10.9% higher after easily topping profit forecasts for the latest quarter.\n\nCaterpillar climbed 3% after the maker of heavy machinery reported stronger earnings than expected.\n\nWhile fears are rising about a slowing U.S. economy, it is still growing, and many economists see a recession in the next year or so as unlikely. The U.S. stock market is also still up a healthy amount for the year so far, and the Federal Reserve says it has ample room to cut interest rates to help the economy if the job market weakens significantly.\n\nThe S&P 500 has romped to dozens of all-time highs this year and is still up nearly 10% so far in 2024, in part due to a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. Critics have been saying that euphoria has sent stock prices too high in many cases.\n\nIn the bond market, Treasury yields climbed to claw back some of their sharp drops since April, which were driven by rising expectations for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.88% from 3.78% late Monday. It had briefly dropped below 3.70% during Monday when fear in the market was spiking and investors were speculating the Federal Reserve could even have to call an emergency meeting to cut interest rates quickly.\n\nIn other dealings early Wednesday, U.S. benchmark crude oil was down 15 cents at $73.05 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, declined 17 cents to $76.31.\n\nAP Business Writers Stan Choe and Matt Ott contributed.\n\nMore from this section\n\nEnergyCAP Appoints Shawn Lankton as Chief

The S&P 500 was 1% higher early Wednesday and on pace for solid back-to-back gains following a brutal three-day losing streak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 251 points, and the Nasdaq composite rose 1.6%. A measure of how much professional investors are paying to protect from future losses in the S&P 500 eased. Treasury yields also climbed in an indication that investors are feeling less need to own the safest investments.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nWall Street pointed sharply higher Wednesday as anxiety about a softening U.S. economy took a back seat to another trove of mostly strong corporate earnings reports.\n\nFutures for the S&P 500 jumped 1% and futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8%. Futures for the technology-heavy Nasdaq were up 1.3%.\n\nJapanese markets also clawed back more of the losses from Monday's wipeout. The country's benchmark Nikkei 225 index finished 1.2% higher after a Bank of Japan official suggested the central bank would refrain from raising interest rates while markets are unstable.\n\nThe Walt Disney Co. said Wednesday that it had returned to profitability in the third quarter as the entertainment giant's combined streaming business started making money for the first time. Its shares were essentially unchanged before the bell.\n\nShopify jumped 18% after the maker of online commerce software posted strong results and raised its guidance. The Canadian company saw its second-quarter revenue grow 21% over last year's quarter and said it expects similar growth in the current quarter.\n\nShares in CVS Health were largely unchanged after the retail pharmacy and health care giant slashed its 2024 forecast for a third time. CVS continues to struggle with its health insurance business, with its operating income from that segment plunging 39%. CVS said the leader of that segment, Executive Vice President Brian Kane, has left the company.\n\nAirbnb tumbled more than 14% after it reported a 15% decline in second quarter profit and told investors that it saw some signs of slowing demand in the U.S. The online vacation rental booker's revenue outlook disappointed investors.\n\nOn Tuesday, the S&P 500 climbed 1% to break a brutal three-day losing streak. It had tumbled a bit more than 6% on a raft of concerns, including worries the Federal Reserve had pressed the brakes too hard for too long on the U.S. economy through high interest rates in order to beat inflation.\n\nThe Dow added 0.8% and the Nasdaq gained 1%.\n\nStocks of all kinds climbed in a mirror opposite of the day before, from smaller companies that need U.S. households to keep spending to huge multinationals more dependent on the global economy.\n\nWhile fears have risen that the U.S. economy might be slowing too quickly, it is still growing. Many economists see a recession in the next year or so as unlikely. The U.S. stock market is also still up a healthy amount for the year so far, and the Federal Reserve says it has ample room to cut interest rates to help the economy.\n\nIn Europe at midday, Germany's DAX added 1% as an increase in factory output in June offset concern over weaker-than-expected exports.\n\nThe CAC 40 in Paris gained 1.4% and London's FTSE 100 was 1.1% higher.\n\nThe Nikkei index bounced during the day but ultimately gained more than 400 points to close at 35,089.62. It soared more than 10% on Tuesday, recovering a large share of the losses it suffered Monday, its worst day since 1987.\n\nThe gains followed remarks by a Bank of Japan official who noted that even though the central bank had raised interest rates a week earlier, to 0.25% from 0.1%, monetary policy remains lax.\n\nThe interest rate hike, however modest, set in motion a domino effect of selling by traders to adjust to higher costs for carry trades -- a favorite trade for hedge funds and other investors -- due to higher interest rates and a rise in the value of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar. That accentuated the scale of the declines, especially in Tokyo.\n\nSpeaking to business leaders in the northern island of Hokkaido, Shinichi Uchida, a BOJ vice governor, acknowledged the recent market turmoil, triggered in part by concerns over the outlook for the U.S. economy, and said he believed the U.S. would have a \"soft landing,\" avoiding a recession.\n\nJapan's central bank can afford to wait, he said, and \"will not raise its policy interest rate when financial and capital markets are unstable.\"\n\nUchida's comments \"acted like a financial security blanket, calming jittery markets and effectively signaling continued protective intervention,\" Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary.\n\nThe dollar rebounded against the yen early Wednesday, jumping to 147.01 yen from 144.32 late Tuesday. A weaker yen tends to help profits of export manufacturers that earn most of their revenue overseas, and the yen had surged after the rate hike last week after trading recently at a near four decade low level of 160 yen to the dollar.\n\nAlso Wednesday, China reported that its exports rose 7% in July from a year earlier. That was well below the near-10% forecasts of most economists and the slowest rate of growth in three months. It also reflected a low base. Exports jumped 8.6% year-on-year in June, much more than expected.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng closed 1.4% higher at 16,877.86. The Shanghai Composite index edged up 0.1% to 2,869.83.\n\nSouth Korea's Kospi jumped 1.8% to 2,568.41 and the benchmark in Taiwan jumped 3.9% -- both markets were among the biggest losers in Monday's sell-offs due to heavy weighting of technology shares that have seen the biggest losses in the past few weeks.\n\nThe S&P/ASX 200 in Australia rose 0.3% to 7,699.80.\n\nIn other dealings Wednesday, U.S. benchmark crude oil picked up $1.66 to $74.86 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, also added $1.66 to $78.14.\n\nThe euro fell to $1.0921 from $1.0928.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2024 BY CHANNEL 3000. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

Critics have been saying that euphoria has sent stock prices too high in many cases.\n\nIn the bond market, Treasury yields climbed to claw back some of their sharp drops since April, which were driven by rising expectations for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.88% from 3.78% late Monday.

A weaker yen tends to help profits of export manufacturers that earn most of their revenue overseas, and a surge in the yen's value after the BOJ's rate hike led to big gains for the Japanese currency late last week.\n\nIn recent months the dollar had traded at a near four decade high level of 160 yen.\n\nThe unwinding of the carry trades plus worries over the outlook for the U.S. economy sent markets tumbling late last week and into Monday's session.\n\nElsewhere in Asia on Wednesday, Hong Kong's Hang Seng was the outlier, giving up 0.3% to 16,647.34. The Shanghai Composite index gained 0.2%, to 2,873.25.\n\nSouth Korea's Kospi jumped 2.6% to 2,587.78 and the benchmark in Taiwan jumped more than 3% -- both markets were among the biggest losers in Monday's sell-offs due to heavy weighting of technology shares that have seen the biggest losses in the past few weeks.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 53.70 points to 5,240.03. The Dow added 294.39, or 0.8%, to 38,997.66, and the Nasdaq gained 166.77, or 1%, to 16,366.85.\n\nStocks of all kinds climbed in a mirror opposite of the day before, from smaller companies that need U.S. households to keep spending to huge multinationals more dependent on the global economy.\n\nStronger-than-expected profit reports from several big U.S. companies helped drive the market. Kenvue, the company behind Tylenol and Band-Aids, jumped 14.7% after reporting stronger profit than expected thanks in part to higher prices for its products. Uber rolled 10.9% higher after easily topping profit forecasts for the latest quarter.\n\nCaterpillar climbed 3% after the maker of heavy machinery reported stronger earnings than expected.\n\nWhile fears are rising about a slowing U.S. economy, it is still growing, and many economists see a recession in the next year or so as unlikely. The U.S. stock market is also still up a healthy amount for the year so far, and the Federal Reserve says it has ample room to cut interest rates to help the economy if the job market weakens significantly.\n\nThe S&P 500 has romped to dozens of all-time highs this year and is still up nearly 10% so far in 2024, in part due to a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. Critics have been saying that euphoria has sent stock prices too high in many cases.\n\nIn the bond market, Treasury yields climbed to claw back some of their sharp drops since April, which were driven by rising expectations for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.88% from 3.78% late Monday. It had briefly dropped below 3.70% during Monday when fear in the market was spiking and investors were speculating the Federal Reserve could even have to call an emergency meeting to cut interest rates quickly.\n\nIn other dealings early Wednesday, U.S. benchmark crude oil was down 15 cents at $73.05 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, declined 17 cents to $76.31.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Stan Choe and Matt Ott contributed.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Futures for the technology-heavy Nasdaq were up 1.3%.\n\nJapanese markets also clawed back more of the losses from Monday's wipeout. The country's benchmark Nikkei 225 index finished 1.2% higher after a Bank of Japan official suggested the central bank would refrain from raising interest rates while markets are unstable.\n\nThe Walt Disney Co. said Wednesday that it had returned to profitability in the third quarter as the entertainment giant's combined streaming business started making money for the first time. Its shares were essentially unchanged before the bell.\n\nShopify jumped 18% after the maker of online commerce software posted strong results and raised its guidance. The Canadian company saw its second-quarter revenue grow 21% over last year's quarter and said it expects similar growth in the current quarter.\n\nShares in CVS Health were largely unchanged after the retail pharmacy and health care giant slashed its 2024 forecast for a third time. CVS continues to struggle with its health insurance business, with its operating income from that segment plunging 39%. CVS said the leader of that segment, Executive Vice President Brian Kane, has left the company.\n\nAirbnb tumbled more than 14% after it reported a 15% decline in second quarter profit and told investors that it saw some signs of slowing demand in the U.S. The online vacation rental booker's revenue outlook disappointed investors.\n\nOn Tuesday, the S&P 500 climbed 1% to break a brutal three-day losing streak. It had tumbled a bit more than 6% on a raft of concerns, including worries the Federal Reserve had pressed the brakes too hard for too long on the U.S. economy through high interest rates in order to beat inflation.\n\nThe Dow added 0.8% and the Nasdaq gained 1%.\n\nStocks of all kinds climbed in a mirror opposite of the day before, from smaller companies that need U.S. households to keep spending to huge multinationals more dependent on the global economy.\n\nWhile fears have risen that the U.S. economy might be slowing too quickly, it is still growing. Many economists see a recession in the next year or so as unlikely. The U.S. stock market is also still up a healthy amount for the year so far, and the Federal Reserve says it has ample room to cut interest rates to help the economy.\n\nIn Europe at midday, Germany's DAX added 1% as an increase in factory output in June offset concern over weaker-than-expected exports.\n\nThe CAC 40 in Paris gained 1.4% and London's FTSE 100 was 1.1% higher.\n\nThe Nikkei index bounced during the day but ultimately gained more than 400 points to close at 35,089.62. It soared more than 10% on Tuesday, recovering a large share of the losses it suffered Monday, its worst day since 1987.\n\nThe gains followed remarks by a Bank of Japan official who noted that even though the central bank had raised interest rates a week earlier, to 0.25% from 0.1%, monetary policy remains lax.\n\nThe interest rate hike, however modest, set in motion a domino effect of selling by traders to adjust to higher costs for carry trades - a favorite trade for hedge funds and other investors - due to higher interest rates and a rise in the value of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar. That accentuated the scale of the declines, especially in Tokyo.\n\nSpeaking to business leaders in the northern island of Hokkaido, Shinichi Uchida, a BOJ vice governor, acknowledged the recent market turmoil, triggered in part by concerns over the outlook for the U.S. economy, and said he believed the U.S. would have a \"soft landing,\" avoiding a recession.\n\nJapan's central bank can afford to wait, he said, and \"will not raise its policy interest rate when financial and capital markets are unstable.\"\n\nUchida's comments \"acted like a financial security blanket, calming jittery markets and effectively signaling continued protective intervention,\" Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary.\n\nThe dollar rebounded against the yen early Wednesday, jumping to 147.01 yen from 144.32 late Tuesday. A weaker yen tends to help profits of export manufacturers that earn most of their revenue overseas, and the yen had surged after the rate hike last week after trading recently at a near four decade low level of 160 yen to the dollar.\n\nAlso Wednesday, China reported that its exports rose 7% in July from a year earlier. That was well below the near-10% forecasts of most economists and the slowest rate of growth in three months. It also reflected a low base. Exports jumped 8.6% year-on-year in June, much more than expected.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng closed 1.4% higher at 16,877.86. The Shanghai Composite index edged up 0.1% to 2,869.83.\n\nSouth Korea's Kospi jumped 1.8% to 2,568.41 and the benchmark in Taiwan jumped 3.9% - both markets were among the biggest losers in Monday's sell-offs due to heavy weighting of technology shares that have seen the biggest losses in the past few weeks.\n\nThe S&P/ASX 200 in Australia rose 0.3% to 7,699.80.\n\nIn other dealings Wednesday, U.S. benchmark crude oil picked up $1.66 to $74.86 per barrel.

It had soared more than 10% on Tuesday, recovering a large share of the losses it suffered Monday, its worst day since 1987.\n\nThe gains followed remarks by a Bank of Japan official who noted that even though the central bank had raised interest rates a week earlier, to 0.25% from 0.1%, monetary policy remains lax.\n\n\"Given that actual inflation and inflation expectations have risen, this rate is very low in real terms ... and implies highly accommodative financial conditions,\" Shinichi Uchida, a vice governor of the central bank, said in a speech to business leaders in Hokkaido.\n\nThe interest rate hike, however modest, set in motion a domino effect of selling by traders to adjust to higher costs for carry trades -- a favorite trade for hedge funds and other investors -- due to higher interest rates and a rise in the value of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar.\n\nThe dollar rebounded sharply against the yen early Wednesday, jumping to 147.53 yen during from 144.32 late Tuesday. A weaker yen tends to help profits of export manufacturers that earn most of their revenue overseas, and a surge in the yen's value after the BOJ's rate hike led to big gains for the Japanese currency late last week.\n\nIn recent months the dollar had traded at a near four decade high level of 160 yen.\n\nIt was the unwinding of carry trades plus worries over the outlook for the U.S. economy that sent markets tumbling late last week and into Monday's session.\n\nOn Wednesday, China reported that its exports rose 7% in July from a year earlier. That was well below the near-10% forecasts of most economists and the slowest rate of growth in three months. It also reflected a low base. Exports jumped 8.6% year-on-year in June.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng erased early losses and rose 1.6% to 16,917.49. The Shanghai Composite index gained 0.4%, to 2,879.15.\n\nSouth Korea's Kospi jumped 2.3% to 2,579.10 and the benchmark in Taiwan jumped 3.6% -- both markets were among the biggest losers in Monday's sell-offs due to heavy weighting of technology shares that have seen the biggest losses in the past few weeks.\n\nThe S&P/ASX 200 in Australia was up 0.8% at 7,738.20.\n\nOn Tuesday, the S&P 500 climbed 1% to break a brutal three-day losing streak. It had tumbled a bit more than 6% on a raft of concerns, including worries the Federal Reserve had pressed the brakes too hard for too long on the U.S. economy through high interest rates in order to beat inflation.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 53.70 points to 5,240.03. The Dow added 294.39, or 0.8%, to 38,997.66, and the Nasdaq gained 166.77, or 1%, to 16,366.85.\n\nStocks of all kinds climbed in a mirror opposite of the day before, from smaller companies that need U.S. households to keep spending to huge multinationals more dependent on the global economy.\n\nWhile fears have risen that the U.S. economy might be slowing too quickly, it is still growing. Many economists see a recession in the next year or so as unlikely. The U.S. stock market is also still up a healthy amount for the year so far, and the Federal Reserve says it has ample room to cut interest rates to help the economy if the job market weakens significantly.\n\nThe S&P 500 has romped to dozens of all-time highs this year and is still up nearly 10% so far in 2024, in part due to a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. Critics have been saying that euphoria has sent stock prices too high in many cases.\n\nIn the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.88% from 3.78% late Monday. It had briefly dropped below 3.70% during Monday when fear in the market was spiking and investors were speculating the Federal Reserve could even have to call an emergency meeting to cut interest rates quickly.\n\nIn other dealings Wednesday, U.S. benchmark crude oil was up 17 cents at $73.37 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, added 17 cents to $76.65.\n\nThe euro fell to $1.0912 from $1.0928.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley

The S&P 500 was 1% higher early Wednesday and on pace for solid back-to-back gains following a brutal three-day losing streak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 251 points, and the Nasdaq composite rose 1.6%. A measure of how much professional investors are paying to protect from future losses in the S&P 500 eased. Treasury yields also climbed in an indication that investors are feeling less need to own the safest investments. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below. Wall Street pointed sharply higher Wednesday as anxiety about a softening U.S. economy took a back seat to another trove of mostly strong corporate earnings reports. Futures for the S&P 500 jumped 1% and futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8%. Futures for the technology-heavy Nasdaq were up 1.3%. Japanese markets also clawed back more of the losses from Monday's wipeout. The country's benchmark Nikkei 225 index finished 1.2% higher after a Bank of Japan official suggested the central bank would refrain from raising interest rates while markets are unstable. The Walt Disney Co. said Wednesday that it had returned to profitability in the third quarter as the entertainment giant's combined streaming business started making money for the first time. Its shares were essentially unchanged before the bell. Shopify jumped 18% after the maker of online commerce software posted strong results and raised its guidance. The Canadian company saw its second-quarter revenue grow 21% over last year's quarter and said it expects similar growth in the current quarter. Shares in CVS Health were largely unchanged after the retail pharmacy and health care giant slashed its 2024 forecast for a third time. CVS continues to struggle with its health insurance business, with its operating income from that segment plunging 39%. CVS said the leader of that segment, Executive Vice President Brian Kane, has left the company. Airbnb tumbled more than 14% after it reported a 15% decline in second quarter profit and told investors that it saw some signs of slowing demand in the U.S. The online vacation rental booker's revenue outlook disappointed investors. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 climbed 1% to break a brutal three-day losing streak. It had tumbled a bit more than 6% on a raft of concerns, including worries the Federal Reserve had pressed the brakes too hard for too long on the U.S. economy through high interest rates in order to beat inflation. The Dow added 0.8% and the Nasdaq gained 1%. Stocks of all kinds climbed in a mirror opposite of the day before, from smaller companies that need U.S. households to keep spending to huge multinationals more dependent on the global economy. While fears have risen that the U.S. economy might be slowing too quickly, it is still growing. Many economists see a recession in the next year or so as unlikely. The U.S. stock market is also still up a healthy amount for the year so far, and the Federal Reserve says it has ample room to cut interest rates to help the economy. In Europe at midday, Germany's DAX added 1% as an increase in factory output in June offset concern over weaker-than-expected exports. The CAC 40 in Paris gained 1.4% and London's FTSE 100 was 1.1% higher. The Nikkei index bounced during the day but ultimately gained more than 400 points to close at 35,089.62. It soared more than 10% on Tuesday, recovering a large share of the losses it suffered Monday, its worst day since 1987. The gains followed remarks by a Bank of Japan official who noted that even though the central bank had raised interest rates a week earlier, to 0.25% from 0.1%, monetary policy remains lax. The interest rate hike, however modest, set in motion a domino effect of selling by traders to adjust to higher costs for carry trades - a favorite trade for hedge funds and other investors - due to higher interest rates and a rise in the value of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar. That accentuated the scale of the declines, especially in Tokyo. Speaking to business leaders in the northern island of Hokkaido, Shinichi Uchida, a BOJ vice governor, acknowledged the recent market turmoil, triggered in part by concerns over the outlook for the U.S. economy, and said he believed the U.S. would have a \"soft landing,\"\u009d avoiding a recession. Japan's central bank can afford to wait, he said, and \"will not raise its policy interest rate when financial and capital markets are unstable.\"\u009d Uchida's comments \"acted like a financial security blanket, calming jittery markets and effectively signaling continued protective intervention,\"\u009d Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. The dollar rebounded against the yen early Wednesday, jumping to 147.01 yen from 144.32 late Tuesday. A weaker yen tends to help profits of export manufacturers that earn most of their revenue overseas, and the yen had surged after the rate hike last week after trading recently at a near four decade low level of 160 yen to the dollar. Also Wednesday, China reported that its exports rose 7% in July from a year earlier. That was well below the near-10% forecasts of most economists and the slowest rate of growth in three months. It also reflected a low base. Exports jumped 8.6% year-on-year in June, much more than expected. Hong Kong's Hang Seng closed 1.4% higher at 16,877.86. The Shanghai Composite index edged up 0.1% to 2,869.83. South Korea's Kospi jumped 1.8% to 2,568.41 and the benchmark in Taiwan jumped 3.9% - both markets were among the biggest losers in Monday's sell-offs due to heavy weighting of technology shares that have seen the biggest losses in the past few weeks. The S&P/ASX 200 in Australia rose 0.3% to 7,699.80. In other dealings Wednesday, U.S. benchmark crude oil picked up $1.66 to $74.86 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, also added $1.66 to $78.14.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 15 points, or less than 0.1%, as of 1:24 p.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.2% higher.\n\nSeveral reasons were likely behind the slide for markets worldwide, and one of them that's centered in Japan seems to be calming. The Bank of Japan raised its main interest rate by only a bit last week, but the move nevertheless sent aftershocks worldwide. It scrambled a favorite trade among some hedge funds and other investors, who borrowed money for very cheap in Japanese yen and then invested it elsewhere around the world.\n\nSpeaking to business leaders in the northern island of Hokkaido, Shinichi Uchida, deputy governor of the Bank of Japan, acknowledged the recent market turmoil, which was also triggered in part by concerns about the slowing U.S. economy.\n\nJapan's central bank can afford to wait, he said, and \"will not raise its policy interest rate when financial and capital markets are unstable.\" He also said he believed the U.S. economy would have a \"soft landing\" and avoid a recession, even if fears have risen the Federal Reserve has kept interest rates too high for too long in hopes of stifling inflation.\n\nThe Japanese promise offered a balm for markets, nervous about additional moves by the Bank of Japan, which only recently ended its yearslong campaign to keep interest rates below zero.\n\nBut it also highlights how risks may remain, suggesting there's still room left for the popular \"carry\" trade to unwind and that some hedge funds and other investors may \"still remain offsides,\" according to John Lynch, chief investment officer for Comerica Wealth Management.\n\nJapan's rate hike last week sent the value of the Japanese yen soaring, and the resulting exit of investments by those hedge funds likely slapped turbochargers onto market losses, including the worst drop for the Nikkei 225 since the Black Monday crash of 1987.\n\nStill, several signals of improved optimism continued to light up on Wall Street. A measure of how much investors are paying to protect from future losses in the S&P 500 index eased. Treasury yields also climbed in an indication investors are feeling less need to own the safest of investments.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.95% from 3.90% late Tuesday. It had briefly dropped below 3.70% on Monday, when fear in the market was spiking and investors were speculating the Federal Reserve could even have to call an emergency meeting to cut interest rates quickly.\n\nThe yield on the two-year Treasury, which more closely tracks expectations for Fed action, rose to 4.02% from 3.99% late Tuesday.\n\nThe first thing Darrell Cronk, chief investment officer for Wealth & Investment Management at Wells Fargo, does when he wakes each morning now is to check on the two-year yield and the Japanese yen. The former shows where the market wants or needs the Fed's main interest rate to go, he says, while the second shows how much the \"carry\" trade is unwinding.\n\nThe expectation on Wall Street is for the Fed to cut its main interest rate at its next scheduled meeting next month by either the traditional quarter of a percentage point or the more severe half of a point.\n\nIn the meantime, earnings reports from the biggest U.S. companies continue to roll in, and the growth for those in the S&P 500 index may end up being the best since 2021, according to FactSet.\n\nThe Walt Disney Co. delivered stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected, and its streaming business reported a profit for the first time. But its stock nevertheless slipped 3.5% after it warned recent softness it saw at its U.S. theme parks could continue for \"the next few quarters.\"\n\nAirbnb tumbled 14.6% after its profit in the second quarter fell short of analysts' expectations, and it told investors that it saw some signs of slowing demand in the U.S.\n\nSuper Micro Computer dropped 17.4% after also reporting weaker results than Wall Street expected. It had been one of the year's biggest winners amid investors' frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology, and its stock soared more than 300% in the year's first two and a half months. But such extreme moves caused critics to say the AI bonanza sent many stock prices too high.\n\nThey've pointed in particular to Nvidia and the other handful of Big Tech stocks in the \"Magnificent Seven\" that were the main reason the S&P 500 set so may records this year. A set of underwhelming profit reports recently, kicked off by Tesla and Alphabet, added to the pessimism and dragged Big Tech stocks lower.\n\nBut Microsoft's 0.5% gain and Apple's 2.1% climb on Wednesday were the two biggest forces pushing the S&P 500 higher.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes climbed across much of Europe and Asia.\n\nAP Business Writer Matt Ott contributed.", "source":

Uber rolled 10.9% higher after easily topping profit forecasts for the latest quarter. Caterpillar climbed 3% after the maker of heavy machinery reported stronger earnings than expected. Nvidia rose 3.8% Tuesday and was one of the strongest forces pushing upward on the market.\n\nThe whiplash moves for financial markets globally have been the result of several technical factors, not just worries ignited by several weaker-than-expected reports on the US economy, in what strategists at Barclays called \"a perfect storm\" for causing extreme market moves. One is centered in Tokyo, where a favorite trade for hedge funds and other investors began unraveling last week after the Bank of Japan made borrowing more expensive by raising interest rates above virtually zero. Japan's Nikkei 225 jumped 10.2% Tuesday to claw back much of its 12.4% sell-off the day before, which was its worst since the Black Monday crash of 1987.\n\n\"The speed, the magnitude, and the shock factor clearly demonstrate\" how much of the moves were driven by how traders were positioned, according to the strategists at Barclays. It wasn't just worries about the US economy, but some voices along Wall Street are continuing to urge caution. Barry Bannister, chief equity strategist at Stifel, is warning more drops could be ahead because of a slowing US economy and sticky inflation.

Futures for the technology-heavy Nasdaq were up 1.3%.\n\nJapanese markets also clawed back more of the losses from Monday's wipeout. The country's benchmark Nikkei 225 index finished 1.2% higher after a Bank of Japan official suggested the central bank would refrain from raising interest rates while markets are unstable.\n\nThe Walt Disney Co. said Wednesday that it had returned to profitability in the third quarter as the entertainment giant's combined streaming business started making money for the first time. Its shares were essentially unchanged before the bell.\n\nShopify jumped 18% after the maker of online commerce software posted strong results and raised its guidance. The Canadian company saw its second-quarter revenue grow 21% over last year's quarter and said it expects similar growth in the current quarter.\n\nShares in CVS Health were largely unchanged after the retail pharmacy and health care giant slashed its 2024 forecast for a third time. CVS continues to struggle with its health insurance business, with its operating income from that segment plunging 39%. CVS said the leader of that segment, Executive Vice President Brian Kane, has left the company.\n\nAirbnb tumbled more than 14% after it reported a 15% decline in second quarter profit and told investors that it saw some signs of slowing demand in the U.S. The online vacation rental booker's revenue outlook disappointed investors.\n\nOn Tuesday, the S&P 500 climbed 1% to break a brutal three-day losing streak. It had tumbled a bit more than 6% on a raft of concerns, including worries the Federal Reserve had pressed the brakes too hard for too long on the U.S. economy through high interest rates in order to beat inflation.\n\nThe Dow added 0.8% and the Nasdaq gained 1%.\n\nStocks of all kinds climbed in a mirror opposite of the day before, from smaller companies that need U.S. households to keep spending to huge multinationals more dependent on the global economy.\n\nWhile fears have risen that the U.S. economy might be slowing too quickly, it is still growing. Many economists see a recession in the next year or so as unlikely. The U.S. stock market is also still up a healthy amount for the year so far, and the Federal Reserve says it has ample room to cut interest rates to help the economy.\n\nIn Europe at midday, Germany's DAX added 1% as an increase in factory output in June offset concern over weaker-than-expected exports.\n\nThe CAC 40 in Paris gained 1.4% and London's FTSE 100 was 1.1% higher.\n\nThe Nikkei index bounced during the day but ultimately gained more than 400 points to close at 35,089.62. It soared more than 10% on Tuesday, recovering a large share of the losses it suffered Monday, its worst day since 1987.\n\nThe gains followed remarks by a Bank of Japan official who noted that even though the central bank had raised interest rates a week earlier, to 0.25% from 0.1%, monetary policy remains lax.\n\nThe interest rate hike, however modest, set in motion a domino effect of selling by traders to adjust to higher costs for carry trades -- a favorite trade for hedge funds and other investors -- due to higher interest rates and a rise in the value of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar. That accentuated the scale of the declines, especially in Tokyo.\n\nSpeaking to business leaders in the northern island of Hokkaido, Shinichi Uchida, a BOJ vice governor, acknowledged the recent market turmoil, triggered in part by concerns over the outlook for the U.S. economy, and said he believed the U.S. would have a \"soft landing,\" avoiding a recession.\n\nJapan's central bank can afford to wait, he said, and \"will not raise its policy interest rate when financial and capital markets are unstable.\"\n\nUchida's comments \"acted like a financial security blanket, calming jittery markets and effectively signaling continued protective intervention,\" Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary.\n\nThe dollar rebounded against the yen early Wednesday, jumping to 147.01 yen from 144.32 late Tuesday. A weaker yen tends to help profits of export manufacturers that earn most of their revenue overseas, and the yen had surged after the rate hike last week after trading recently at a near four decade low level of 160 yen to the dollar.\n\nAlso Wednesday, China reported that its exports rose 7% in July from a year earlier. That was well below the near-10% forecasts of most economists and the slowest rate of growth in three months. It also reflected a low base. Exports jumped 8.6% year-on-year in June, much more than expected.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng closed 1.4% higher at 16,877.86. The Shanghai Composite index edged up 0.1% to 2,869.83.\n\nSouth Korea's Kospi jumped 1.8% to 2,568.41 and the benchmark in Taiwan jumped 3.9% -- both markets were among the biggest losers in Monday's sell-offs due to heavy weighting of technology shares that have seen the biggest losses in the past few weeks.\n\nThe S&P/ASX 200 in Australia rose 0.3% to 7,699.80.\n\nIn other dealings Wednesday, U.S. benchmark crude oil picked up $1.66 to $74.86 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, also added $1.66 to $78.14.\n\nThe euro fell to $1.0921 from $1.0928.\n\nMore from this section\n\nEmpowering Youth and Adults with the Truth About

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 179 points, or 0.5%, as of 2:30 p.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.6% lower.\n\nStocks swung lower as Nvidia, one of Wall Street's most influential companies, went from a morning gain of 4.4% and pushing strongly upward on the S&P 500 to a loss of 3.8% that made it the index's heaviest weight. Nvidia and other Big Tech stocks have been largely struggling the last month on worries their prices shot too high amid Wall Street's frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology.\n\nA profit report from Super Micro Computer, whose stock more than quadrupled in the first two and a half months of the year, helped further mar excitement around AI. Even though its revenue soared 143% in the latest quarter, profit for the company that sells server and storage systems used in AI and other computing fell short of analysts' high expectations. Its stock tumbled 19.4%.\n\nStill, the day's moves for U.S. stock indexes looked like modest ripples compared with the waves that have been crashing through global markets since last week. The S&P 500 is coming off a 1% rally that broke a brutal three-day losing streak where it tumbled a bit more than 6%.\n\nSeveral reasons were likely behind the slide for markets worldwide, and one of them that's centered in Japan seems to be calming. The Bank of Japan raised its main interest rate by only a bit last week, but the move nevertheless sent aftershocks worldwide. It scrambled a favorite trade among some hedge funds and other investors, who borrowed money for very cheap in Japanese yen and then invested it elsewhere around the world.\n\nSpeaking to business leaders in the northern island of Hokkaido, Shinichi Uchida, deputy governor of the Bank of Japan, acknowledged the recent market turmoil, which was also triggered in part by concerns about the slowing U.S. economy.\n\nJapan's central bank can afford to wait, he said, and \"will not raise its policy interest rate when financial and capital markets are unstable.\" He also said he believed the U.S. economy would have a \"soft landing\" and avoid a recession, even if fears have risen the Federal Reserve has kept interest rates too high for too long in hopes of stifling inflation.\n\nThe Japanese promise offered a balm for markets, nervous about additional moves by the Bank of Japan, which only recently ended its yearslong campaign to keep interest rates below zero.\n\nBut it also highlights how risks may remain, suggesting there's still room left for the popular \"carry\" trade to unwind and that some hedge funds and other investors may \"still remain offsides,\" according to John Lynch, chief investment officer for Comerica Wealth Management.\n\nJapan's rate hike last week sent the value of the Japanese yen soaring, and the resulting exit of investments by those hedge funds likely slapped turbochargers onto market losses, including the worst drop for the Nikkei 225 since the Black Monday crash of 1987.\n\nThe value of the Japanese yen is one of the first things Darrell Cronk, chief investment officer for Wealth & Investment Management at Wells Fargo, checks now when he wakes each morning because it shows how much the \"carry\" trade is unwinding.\n\nThe other thing Cronk checks is the two-year Treasury yield, which he says shows where the market wants or needs the Federal Reserve to take its main interest rate.\n\nTreasury yields tumbled sharply Monday, when fear in the market was spiking and investors were speculating the Federal Reserve could even have to call an emergency meeting to cut interest rates quickly. But they've steadied since then.\n\nThe yield on the two-year Treasury edged up to 4.00% Wednesday from 3.99% late Tuesday.\n\nThe expectation on Wall Street is for the Fed to cut its main interest rate at its next scheduled meeting next month by either the traditional quarter of a percentage point or the more severe half of a point.\n\nIn the meantime, earnings reports from the biggest U.S. companies continue to roll in, and the growth for those in the S&P 500 index may end up being the best since 2021, according to FactSet.\n\nThe Walt Disney Co. delivered stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected, and its streaming business reported a profit for the first time. But its stock nevertheless fell 3.1% after it warned recent softness it saw at its U.S. theme parks could continue for \"the next few quarters.\"\n\nAirbnb tumbled 14.4% after its profit in the second quarter fell short of analysts' expectations, and it told investors that it saw some signs of slowing demand in the U.S.\n\nHelping to limit the market's losses was Apple, which rose 1.2%. It was clawing back losses from earlier in the week after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed it had slashed its ownership stake in the iPhone maker.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes climbed across much of Europe and Asia.\n\nAP Business Writer Matt Ott contributed.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors":

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 377 points, or 1%, as of 10:20 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 1.6% higher.\n\nSeveral reasons were likely behind the slide for markets worldwide, and one of them that's centered in Japan seems to be calming.

A measure of how much investors are paying to protect from future losses in the S&P 500 index eased. Treasury yields also climbed in an indication investors are feeling less need to own the safest of investments.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.93% from 3.90% late Tuesday. It had briefly dropped below 3.70% during Monday when fear in the market was spiking and investors were speculating the Federal Reserve could even have to call an emergency meeting to cut interest rates quickly.\n\nThe yield on the two-year Treasury, which more closely tracks expectations for Fed action, rose to 4.01% from 3.99% late Tuesday.\n\nThe first thing Darrell Cronk, chief investment officer for Wealth & Investment Management at Wells Fargo, does when he wakes each morning now is to check on the two-year yield and the Japanese yen. The former shows where the market wants or needs the Fed's main interest rate to go, he says, while the second shows how much the \"carry\" trade is unwinding.\n\nThe expectation on Wall Street is for the Fed to cut its main interest rate at its next scheduled meeting next month by either the traditional quarter of a percentage point or the more severe half of a point.\n\nIn the meantime, earnings reports from the biggest U.S. companies continue to roll in, and the growth for those in the S&P 500 index may end up being the best since 2021, according to FactSet.\n\nCVS Health beat analysts' expectations for profit in the latest quarter, but its revenue fell short. It also cut its forecast for profit over the full year, and its stock slipped 0.9%.\n\nThe Walt Disney Co. also topped forecasts for earnings in the latest quarter, and its streaming business reported a profit for the first time. But its stock nevertheless fell 1.8% after it warned that softness it saw at its U.S. theme parks at the end of the last quarter could continue for \"the next few quarters.\"\n\nAirbnb tumbled 14.9% after its profit in the second quarter fell short of analysts' expectations, and it told investors that it saw some signs of slowing demand in the U.S.\n\nSuper Micro Computer dropped 15.5% after also reporting weaker results than Wall Street expected. It had been one of the year's biggest winners amid investors' frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology, and its stock soared more than 300% in the year's first two and a half months. But such extreme moves caused critics to say the AI bonanza sent many stock prices too high.\n\nThey've pointed in particular to Nvidia and the other handful of Big Tech stocks in the \"Magnificent Seven\" that were the main reason the S&P 500 set so may records this year. Their immense strength helped overshadow weakness across other areas of the stock market, which were struggling under the weight of high interest rates. A set of underwhelming profit reports recently, kicked off by Tesla and Alphabet, added to the pessimism and dragged Big Tech stocks lower.\n\nNvidia dropped nearly 19% from the start of July through Monday on such concerns, but it rose 0.9% Wednesday and was one of the stronger forces pushing upward on the market.\n\nMicrosoft's 2.3% gain and Apple's 2.1% climb were the two biggest forces pushing the S&P 500 higher.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes climbed across much of Europe and Asia.", "source": {"uri": "ksn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KSN-TV"}, "authors": [{"uri":

In London, the FTSE 100 was 0.9% higher at 8,089.70.\n\nThe future for the S&P 500 jumped 1% and that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7%.\n\nThe Nikkei index bounced during the day but ultimately gained more than 400 points to close at 35,089.62. It soared more than 10% on Tuesday, recovering a large share of the losses it suffered Monday, its worst day since 1987.\n\nThe gains followed remarks by a Bank of Japan official who noted that even though the central bank had raised interest rates a week earlier, to 0.25% from 0.1%, monetary policy remains lax.\n\nThe interest rate hike, however modest, set in motion a domino effect of selling by traders to adjust to higher costs for carry trades - a favorite trade for hedge funds and other investors - due to higher interest rates and a rise in the value of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar. That accentuated the scale of the declines, especially in Tokyo.\n\nSpeaking to business leaders in the northern island of Hokkaido, Shinichi Uchida, a BOJ vice governor, acknowledged the recent market turmoil, triggered in part by concerns over the outlook for the U.S. economy, and said he believed the U.S. would have a \"soft landing,\" avoiding a recession.\n\nJapan's central bank can afford to wait, he said, and \"will not raise its policy interest rate when financial and capital markets are unstable.\"\n\nUchida's comments \"acted like a financial security blanket, calming jittery markets and effectively signaling continued protective intervention,\" Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary.\n\nThe dollar rebounded against the yen early Wednesday, jumping to 146.78 yen from 144.32 late Tuesday. A weaker yen tends to help profits of export manufacturers that earn most of their revenue overseas, and the yen had surged after the rate hike last week after trading recently at a near four decade low level of 160 yen to the dollar.\n\nAlso Wednesday, China reported that its exports rose 7% in July from a year earlier. That was well below the near-10% forecasts of most economists and the slowest rate of growth in three months. It also reflected a low base. Exports jumped 8.6% year-on-year in June, much more than expected.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng closed 1.4% higher at 16,877.86. The Shanghai Composite index edged up 0.1% to 2,869.83.\n\nSouth Korea's Kospi jumped 1.8% to 2,568.41 and the benchmark in Taiwan jumped 3.9% - both markets were among the biggest losers in Monday's sell-offs due to heavy weighting of technology shares that have seen the biggest losses in the past few weeks.\n\nThe S&P/ASX 200 in Australia rose 0.3% to 7,699.80.\n\nOn Tuesday, the S&P 500 climbed 1% to break a brutal three-day losing streak. It had tumbled a bit more than 6% on a raft of concerns, including worries the Federal Reserve had pressed the brakes too hard for too long on the U.S. economy through high interest rates in order to beat inflation.\n\nThe Dow added 0.8% and the Nasdaq gained 1%.\n\nStocks of all kinds climbed in a mirror opposite of the day before, from smaller companies that need U.S. households to keep spending to huge multinationals more dependent on the global economy.\n\nWhile fears have risen that the U.S. economy might be slowing too quickly, it is still growing. Many economists see a recession in the next year or so as unlikely. The U.S. stock market is also still up a healthy amount for the year so far, and the Federal Reserve says it has ample room to cut interest rates to help the economy.\n\nIn other dealings Wednesday, U.S. benchmark crude oil picked up 35 cents to $73.55 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, added 36 cents to $76.84.", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 251 points, or 0.6%, as of 9:35 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 1.9% higher.\n\nSeveral reasons were likely behind the slide for markets worldwide, and one of them that's centered in Japan seems to be calming. The Bank of Japan raised its main interest rate by only a bit last week, but the move nevertheless sent aftershocks worldwide. It scrambled a favorite trade among some hedge funds and other investors, who borrowed money for very cheap in Japanese yen and then invested it elsewhere around the world.\n\nJapan's rate hike sent the value of the Japanese yen soaring, and the resulting exit of investments by those hedge funds and other investors likely slapped turbochargers onto market losses, including the worst drop for the Nikkei 225 since the Black Monday crash of 1987.\n\nSpeaking to business leaders in the northern island of Hokkaido, Shinichi Uchida, deputy governor of the Bank of Japan, acknowledged the recent market turmoil, which was also triggered in part by concerns about the slowing U.S. economy.\n\nJapan's central bank can afford to wait, he said, and \"will not raise its policy interest rate when financial and capital markets are unstable.\" He also said he believed the U.S. economy would have a \"soft landing\" and avoid a recession, even if fears have risen the Federal Reserve has kept interest rates too high for too long in hopes of stifling inflation.\n\nThe Japanese promise offered a balm for markets, nervous about additional moves by the Bank of Japan, which only recently ended its yearslong campaign to keep interest rates below zero. But it also highlights how some risks may remain, suggesting there's still room left for the unwind of the popular \"carry\" trade and that some hedge funds and other investors \"still remain offsides,\" according to John Lynch, chief investment officer for Comerica Wealth Management.\n\nStill, several signals of improved optimism continued to light up on Wall Street. A measure of how much professional investors are paying to protect from future losses in the S&P 500 index eased. Treasury yields also climbed in an indication that that investors are feeling less need to own the safest of investments.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.93% from 3.90% late Tuesday. It had briefly dropped below 3.70% during Monday when fear in the market was spiking and investors were speculating the Federal Reserve could even have to call an emergency meeting to cut interest rates quickly.\n\nThe expectation on Wall Street is for the Fed to cut its main interest rate at its next scheduled meeting next month by either the traditional quarter of a percentage point or the more severe half of a point.\n\nIn the meantime, earnings reports from the biggest U.S. companies continue to roll in, and the growth for those in the S&P 500 index may end up being the best since 2021, according to FactSet.\n\nCVS Health beat analysts' expectations for profit in the latest quarter, but its revenue fell short. It also cut its forecast for profit over the full year, and its stock fell 1.3%.\n\nAirbnb tumbled 14.3% after its profit in the second quarter fell short of analysts' expectations, and it told investors that it saw some signs of slowing demand in the U.S.\n\nSuper Micro Computers dropped 14.4% after also reporting weaker results than Wall Street expected. It had been one of the year's biggest winners amid investors' frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. It soared more than 300% in the year's first two and a half months, but such moves caused critics to say the AI bonanza sent many stock prices too high.\n\nThey've pointed in particular to Nvidia, Apple and the other handful of Big Tech stocks in the \"Magnificent Seven\" that were the main reason the S&P 500 set so may records this year. Their immense strength helped overshadow weakness across other areas of the stock market, which were struggling under the weight of high interest rates.\n\nA set of underwhelming profit reports recently, kicked off by Tesla and Alphabet, added to the pessimism and dragged Big Tech stocks lower.\n\nNvidia dropped nearly 19% from the start of July through Monday on such concerns, but it rose 3.7% Wednesday and was one of the strongest forces pushing upward on the market following a similar gain on Tuesday. Microsoft and Apple were also pushing the market higher.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes climbed across much of Europe and Asia as calm headed westward.\n\nAP Business Writer Matt Ott

A weaker yen tends to help profits of export manufacturers that earn most of their revenue overseas, and a surge in the yen's value after the BOJ's rate hike led to big gains for the Japanese currency late last week.\n\nIn recent months the dollar had traded at a near four decade high level of 160 yen.\n\nThe unwinding of the carry trades plus worries over the outlook for the U.S. economy sent markets tumbling late last week and into Monday's session.\n\nElsewhere in Asia on Wednesday, Hong Kong's Hang Seng was the outlier, giving up 0.3% to 16,647.34. The Shanghai Composite index gained 0.2%, to 2,873.25.\n\nSouth Korea's Kospi jumped 2.6% to 2,587.78 and the benchmark in Taiwan jumped more than 3% -- both markets were among the biggest losers in Monday's sell-offs due to heavy weighting of technology shares that have seen the biggest losses in the past few weeks.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 53.70 points to 5,240.03. The Dow added 294.39, or 0.8%, to 38,997.66, and the Nasdaq gained 166.77, or 1%, to 16,366.85.\n\nStocks of all kinds climbed in a mirror opposite of the day before, from smaller companies that need U.S. households to keep spending to huge multinationals more dependent on the global economy.\n\nStronger-than-expected profit reports from several big U.S. companies helped drive the market. Kenvue, the company behind Tylenol and Band-Aids, jumped 14.7% after reporting stronger profit than expected thanks in part to higher prices for its products. Uber rolled 10.9% higher after easily topping profit forecasts for the latest quarter.\n\nCaterpillar climbed 3% after the maker of heavy machinery reported stronger earnings than expected.\n\nWhile fears are rising about a slowing U.S. economy, it is still growing, and many economists see a recession in the next year or so as unlikely. The U.S. stock market is also still up a healthy amount for the year so far, and the Federal Reserve says it has ample room to cut interest rates to help the economy if the job market weakens significantly.\n\nThe S&P 500 has romped to dozens of all-time highs this year and is still up nearly 10% so far in 2024, in part due to a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. Critics have been saying that euphoria has sent stock prices too high in many cases.\n\nIn the bond market, Treasury yields climbed to claw back some of their sharp drops since April, which were driven by rising expectations for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.88% from 3.78% late Monday. It had briefly dropped below 3.70% during Monday when fear in the market was spiking and investors were speculating the Federal Reserve could even have to call an emergency meeting to cut interest rates quickly.\n\nIn other dealings early Wednesday, U.S. benchmark crude oil was down 15 cents at $73.05 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, declined 17 cents to $76.31.\n\nAP Business Writers Stan Choe and Matt Ott contributed.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 251 points, or 0.6%, as of 9:35 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 1.9% higher.\n\nSeveral reasons were likely behind the slide for markets worldwide, and one of them that's centered in Japan seems to be calming. The Bank of Japan raised its main interest rate by only a bit last week, but the move nevertheless sent aftershocks worldwide. It scrambled a favorite trade among some hedge funds and other investors, who borrowed money for very cheap in Japanese yen and then invested it elsewhere around the world.\n\nJapan's rate hike sent the value of the Japanese yen soaring, and the resulting exit of investments by those hedge funds and other investors likely slapped turbochargers onto market losses, including the worst drop for the Nikkei 225 since the Black Monday crash of 1987.\n\nSpeaking to business leaders in the northern island of Hokkaido, Shinichi Uchida, deputy governor of the Bank of Japan, acknowledged the recent market turmoil, which was also triggered in part by concerns about the slowing U.S. economy.\n\nJapan's central bank can afford to wait, he said, and \"will not raise its policy interest rate when financial and capital markets are unstable.\" He also said he believed the U.S. economy would have a \"soft landing\" and avoid a recession, even if fears have risen the Federal Reserve has kept interest rates too high for too long in hopes of stifling inflation.\n\nThe Japanese promise offered a balm for markets, nervous about additional moves by the Bank of Japan, which only recently ended its yearslong campaign to keep interest rates below zero. But it also highlights how some risks may remain, suggesting there's still room left for the unwind of the popular \"carry\" trade and that some hedge funds and other investors \"still remain offsides,\" according to John Lynch, chief investment officer for Comerica Wealth Management.\n\nStill, several signals of improved optimism continued to light up on Wall Street. A measure of how much professional investors are paying to protect from future losses in the S&P 500 index eased. Treasury yields also climbed in an indication that that investors are feeling less need to own the safest of investments.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.93% from 3.90% late Tuesday. It had briefly dropped below 3.70% during Monday when fear in the market was spiking and investors were speculating the Federal Reserve could even have to call an emergency meeting to cut interest rates quickly.\n\nThe expectation on Wall Street is for the Fed to cut its main interest rate at its next scheduled meeting next month by either the traditional quarter of a percentage point or the more severe half of a point.\n\nIn the meantime, earnings reports from the biggest U.S. companies continue to roll in, and the growth for those in the S&P 500 index may end up being the best since 2021, according to FactSet.\n\nCVS Health beat analysts' expectations for profit in the latest quarter, but its revenue fell short. It also cut its forecast for profit over the full year, and its stock fell 1.3%.\n\nAirbnb tumbled 14.3% after its profit in the second quarter fell short of analysts' expectations, and it told investors that it saw some signs of slowing demand in the U.S.\n\nSuper Micro Computers dropped 14.4% after also reporting weaker results than Wall Street expected. It had been one of the year's biggest winners amid investors' frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. It soared more than 300% in the year's first two and a half months, but such moves caused critics to say the AI bonanza sent many stock prices too high.\n\nThey've pointed in particular to Nvidia, Apple and the other handful of Big Tech stocks in the \"Magnificent Seven\" that were the main reason the S&P 500 set so may records this year. Their immense strength helped overshadow weakness across other areas of the stock market, which were struggling under the weight of high interest rates.\n\nA set of underwhelming profit reports recently, kicked off by Tesla and Alphabet, added to the pessimism and dragged Big Tech stocks lower.\n\nNvidia dropped nearly 19% from the start of July through Monday on such concerns, but it rose 3.7% Wednesday and was one of the strongest forces pushing upward on the market following a similar gain on Tuesday. Microsoft and Apple were also pushing the market higher.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes climbed across much of Europe and Asia as calm headed westward.\n\nAP Business Writer Matt Ott

That was well below the near-10% forecasts of most economists and the slowest rate of growth in three months. It also reflected a low base. Exports jumped 8.6% year-on-year in June.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng erased early losses and rose 1.6% to 16,917.49.

It had tumbled a bit more than 6% on a raft of concerns, including worries the Federal Reserve had pressed the brakes too hard for too long on the U.S. economy through high interest rates in order to beat inflation.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 53.70 points to 5,240.03. The Dow added 294.39, or 0.8%, to 38,997.66, and the Nasdaq gained 166.77, or 1%, to 16,366.85.\n\nStocks of all kinds climbed in a mirror opposite of the day before, from smaller companies that need U.S. households to keep spending to huge multinationals more dependent on the global economy.\n\nWhile fears have risen that the U.S. economy might be slowing too quickly, it is still growing. Many economists see a recession in the next year or so as unlikely. The U.S. stock market is also still up a healthy amount for the year so far, and the Federal Reserve says it has ample room to cut interest rates to help the economy if the job market weakens significantly.\n\nThe S&P 500 has romped to dozens of all-time highs this year and is still up nearly 10% so far in 2024, in part due to a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. Critics have been saying that euphoria has sent stock prices too high in many cases.\n\nIn the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.88% from 3.78% late Monday. It had briefly dropped below 3.70% during Monday when fear in the market was spiking and investors were speculating the Federal Reserve could even have to call an emergency meeting to cut interest rates quickly.\n\nIn other dealings Wednesday, U.S. benchmark crude oil was up 17 cents at $73.37 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, added 17 cents to $76.65.\n\nThe euro fell to $1.0912 from $1.0928.\n\nMore from this section\n\nReformed Gangster Disciples Boss, Harold 'Noonie G' Ward Hosts

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 395 points, or 1%, as of 11:40 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 1.5% higher.\n\nSeveral reasons were likely behind the slide for markets worldwide, and one of them that's centered in Japan seems to be calming. The Bank of Japan raised its main interest rate by only a bit last week, but the move nevertheless sent aftershocks worldwide. It scrambled a favorite trade among some hedge funds and other investors, who borrowed money for very cheap in Japanese yen and then invested it elsewhere around the world.\n\nSpeaking to business leaders in the northern island of Hokkaido, Shinichi Uchida, deputy governor of the Bank of Japan, acknowledged the recent market turmoil, which was also triggered in part by concerns about the slowing U.S. economy.\n\nJapan's central bank can afford to wait, he said, and \"will not raise its policy interest rate when financial and capital markets are unstable.\" He also said he believed the U.S. economy would have a \"soft landing\" and avoid a recession, even if fears have risen the Federal Reserve has kept interest rates too high for too long in hopes of stifling inflation.\n\nThe Japanese promise offered a balm for markets, nervous about additional moves by the Bank of Japan, which only recently ended its yearslong campaign to keep interest rates below zero.\n\nBut it also highlights how risks may remain, suggesting there's still room left for the popular \"carry\" trade to unwind and that some hedge funds and other investors may \"still remain offsides,\" according to John Lynch, chief investment officer for Comerica Wealth Management.\n\nJapan's rate hike last week sent the value of the Japanese yen soaring, and the resulting exit of investments by those hedge funds likely slapped turbochargers onto market losses, including the worst drop for the Nikkei 225 since the Black Monday crash of 1987.\n\nStill, several signals of improved optimism continued to light up on Wall Street. A measure of how much investors are paying to protect from future losses in the S&P 500 index eased. Treasury yields also climbed in an indication investors are feeling less need to own the safest of investments.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.94% from 3.90% late Tuesday. It had briefly dropped below 3.70% on Monday, when fear in the market was spiking and investors were speculating the Federal Reserve could even have to call an emergency meeting to cut interest rates quickly.\n\nThe yield on the two-year Treasury, which more closely tracks expectations for Fed action, rose to 4.02% from 3.99% late Tuesday.\n\nThe first thing Darrell Cronk, chief investment officer for Wealth & Investment Management at Wells Fargo, does when he wakes each morning now is to check on the two-year yield and the Japanese yen. The former shows where the market wants or needs the Fed's main interest rate to go, he says, while the second shows how much the \"carry\" trade is unwinding.\n\nThe expectation on Wall Street is for the Fed to cut its main interest rate at its next scheduled meeting next month by either the traditional quarter of a percentage point or the more severe half of a point.\n\nIn the meantime, earnings reports from the biggest U.S. companies continue to roll in, and the growth for those in the S&P 500 index may end up being the best since 2021, according to FactSet.\n\nThe Walt Disney Co. delivered stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected, and its streaming business reported a profit for the first time. But its stock nevertheless slipped 1.6% after it warned recent softness it saw at its U.S. theme parks could continue for \"the next few quarters.\"\n\nAirbnb tumbled 12.3% after its profit in the second quarter fell short of analysts' expectations, and it told investors that it saw some signs of slowing demand in the U.S.\n\nSuper Micro Computer dropped 15.5% after also reporting weaker results than Wall Street expected. It had been one of the year's biggest winners amid investors' frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology, and its stock soared more than 300% in the year's first two and a half months. But such extreme moves caused critics to say the AI bonanza sent many stock prices too high.\n\nThey've pointed in particular to Nvidia and the other handful of Big Tech stocks in the \"Magnificent Seven\" that were the main reason the S&P 500 set so may records this year. A set of underwhelming profit reports recently, kicked off by Tesla and Alphabet, added to the pessimism and dragged Big Tech stocks lower.\n\nBut Microsoft's 1.9% gain and Apple's 3% climb on Wednesday were the two biggest forces pushing the S&P 500 higher.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes climbed across much of Europe and Asia.", "source": {"uri": "baynews9.com", "dataType": "news",

The S&P 500 was 1% higher early Wednesday and on pace for solid back-to-back gains following a brutal three-day losing streak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 251 points, and the Nasdaq composite rose 1.6%. A measure of how much professional investors are paying to protect from future losses in the S&P 500 eased. Treasury yields also climbed in an indication that investors are feeling less need to own the safest investments.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nWall Street pointed sharply higher Wednesday as anxiety about a softening U.S. economy took a back seat to another trove of mostly strong corporate earnings reports.\n\nFutures for the S&P 500 jumped 1% and futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8%. Futures for the technology-heavy Nasdaq were up 1.3%.\n\nJapanese markets also clawed back more of the losses from Monday's wipeout. The country's benchmark Nikkei 225 index finished 1.2% higher after a Bank of Japan official suggested the central bank would refrain from raising interest rates while markets are unstable.\n\nThe Walt Disney Co. said Wednesday that it had returned to profitability in the third quarter as the entertainment giant's combined streaming business started making money for the first time. Its shares were essentially unchanged before the bell.\n\nShopify jumped 18% after the maker of online commerce software posted strong results and raised its guidance. The Canadian company saw its second-quarter revenue grow 21% over last year's quarter and said it expects similar growth in the current quarter.\n\nShares in CVS Health were largely unchanged after the retail pharmacy and health care giant slashed its 2024 forecast for a third time. CVS continues to struggle with its health insurance business, with its operating income from that segment plunging 39%. CVS said the leader of that segment, Executive Vice President Brian Kane, has left the company.\n\nAirbnb tumbled more than 14% after it reported a 15% decline in second quarter profit and told investors that it saw some signs of slowing demand in the U.S. The online vacation rental booker's revenue outlook disappointed investors.\n\nStocks of all kinds climbed in a mirror opposite of the day before, from smaller companies that need U.S. households to keep spending to huge multinationals more dependent on the global economy.\n\nWhile fears have risen that the U.S. economy might be slowing too quickly, it is still growing. Many economists see a recession in the next year or so as unlikely. The U.S. stock market is also still up a healthy amount for the year so far, and the Federal Reserve says it has ample room to cut interest rates to help the economy.\n\nIn Europe at midday, Germany's DAX added 1% as an increase in factory output in June offset concern over weaker-than-expected exports.\n\nThe CAC 40 in Paris gained 1.4% and London's FTSE 100 was 1.1% higher.\n\nThe Nikkei index bounced during the day but ultimately gained more than 400 points to close at 35,089.62. It soared more than 10% on Tuesday, recovering a large share of the losses it suffered Monday, its worst day since 1987.\n\nThe gains followed remarks by a Bank of Japan official who noted that even though the central bank had raised interest rates a week earlier, to 0.25% from 0.1%, monetary policy remains lax.\n\nThe interest rate hike, however modest, set in motion a domino effect of selling by traders to adjust to higher costs for carry trades -- a favorite trade for hedge funds and other investors -- due to higher interest rates and a rise in the value of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar. That accentuated the scale of the declines, especially in Tokyo.\n\nSpeaking to business leaders in the northern island of Hokkaido, Shinichi Uchida, a BOJ vice governor, acknowledged the recent market turmoil, triggered in part by concerns over the outlook for the U.S. economy, and said he believed the U.S. would have a \"soft landing,\" avoiding a recession.\n\nJapan's central bank can afford to wait, he said, and \"will not raise its policy interest rate when financial and capital markets are unstable.\"\n\nUchida's comments \"acted like a financial security blanket, calming jittery markets and effectively signaling continued protective intervention,\" Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary.\n\nThe dollar rebounded against the yen early Wednesday, jumping to 147.01 yen from 144.32 late Tuesday. A weaker yen tends to help profits of export manufacturers that earn most of their revenue overseas, and the yen had surged after the rate hike last week after trading recently at a near four decade low level of 160 yen to the dollar.\n\nAlso Wednesday, China reported that its exports rose 7% in July from a year earlier. That was well below the near-10% forecasts of most economists and the slowest rate of growth in three months. It also reflected a low base. Exports jumped 8.6% year-on-year in June, much more than expected.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng closed 1.4% higher at 16,877.86. The Shanghai Composite index edged up 0.1% to 2,869.83.\n\nSouth Korea's Kospi jumped 1.8% to 2,568.41 and the benchmark in Taiwan jumped 3.9% -- both markets were among the biggest losers in Monday's sell-offs due to heavy weighting of technology shares that have seen the biggest losses in the past few weeks.\n\nThe S&P/ASX 200 in Australia rose 0.3% to 7,699.80.\n\nIn other dealings Wednesday, U.S. benchmark crude oil picked up $1.66 to $74.86 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, also added $1.66 to $78.14.", "source": {"uri": "kurv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "710 KURV - The Valley's News/Talk Station"}, "authors": [],

It soared more than 10% on Tuesday, recovering a large share of the losses it suffered Monday, its worst day since 1987.\n\nThe gains followed remarks by a Bank of Japan official who noted that even though the central bank had raised interest rates a week earlier, to 0.25% from 0.1%, monetary policy remains lax.\n\nThe interest rate hike, however modest, set in motion a domino effect of selling by traders to adjust to higher costs for carry trades -- a favorite trade for hedge funds and other investors -- due to higher interest rates and a rise in the value of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar. That accentuated the scale of the declines, especially in Tokyo.\n\nSpeaking to business leaders in the northern island of Hokkaido, Shinichi Uchida, a BOJ vice governor, acknowledged recent market turmoil, triggered in part by concerns over the outlook for the U.S. economy, and said he believed the U.S. would have a \"soft landing,\" avoiding a recession.\n\nJapan's central bank can afford to wait, he said, and \"will not raise its policy interest rate when financial and capital markets are unstable.\"\n\nUchida's comments \"acted like a financial security blanket, calming jittery markets and effectively signaling continued protective intervention,\" Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary.\n\nThe dollar rebounded against the yen early Wednesday, jumping to 146.51 yen from 144.32 late Tuesday. A weaker yen tends to help profits of export manufacturers that earn most of their revenue overseas, and the yen had surged after the rate hike last week after trading recently at a near four decade low level of 160 yen to the dollar.\n\nAlso Wednesday, China reported that its exports rose 7% in July from a year earlier. That was well below the near-10% forecasts of most economists and the slowest rate of growth in three months. It also reflected a low base. Exports jumped 8.6% year-on-year in June, much more than expected.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng erased early losses and rose 1.2% to 16,849.74. The Shanghai Composite index gained 0.1%, to 2,869.83.\n\nSouth Korea's Kospi jumped 1.8% to 2,568.41 and the benchmark in Taiwan jumped 3.9% -- both markets were among the biggest losers in Monday's sell-offs due to heavy weighting of technology shares that have seen the biggest losses in the past few weeks.\n\nThe S&P/ASX 200 in Australia rose 0.3% to 7,699.80.\n\nOn Tuesday, the S&P 500 climbed 1% to break a brutal three-day losing streak. It had tumbled a bit more than 6% on a raft of concerns, including worries the Federal Reserve had pressed the brakes too hard for too long on the U.S. economy through high interest rates in order to beat inflation.\n\nThe Dow added 0.8% and the Nasdaq gained 1%.\n\nStocks of all kinds climbed in a mirror opposite of the day before, from smaller companies that need U.S. households to keep spending to huge multinationals more dependent on the global economy.\n\nWhile fears have risen that the U.S. economy might be slowing too quickly, it is still growing. Many economists see a recession in the next year or so as unlikely. The U.S. stock market is also still up a healthy amount for the year so far, and the Federal Reserve says it has ample room to cut interest rates to help the economy.\n\nThe S&P 500 has romped to dozens of all-time highs this year and is still up nearly 10% so far in 2024, in part due to a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. Critics have been saying that euphoria has sent stock prices too high in many cases.\n\nIn other dealings Wednesday, U.S. benchmark crude oil picked up 2 cents to $73.22 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, added 5 cents to $76.53.\n\nThe euro fell to $1.0926 from $1.0928.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley

In London, the FTSE 100 was 0.9% higher at 8,089.70.\n\nThe future for the S&P 500 jumped 1% and that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7%.\n\nThe Nikkei index bounced during the day but ultimately gained more than 400 points to close at 35,089.62. It soared more than 10% on Tuesday, recovering a large share of the losses it suffered Monday, its worst day since 1987.\n\nThe gains followed remarks by a Bank of Japan official who noted that even though the central bank had raised interest rates a week earlier, to 0.25% from 0.1%, monetary policy remains lax.\n\nThe interest rate hike, however modest, set in motion a domino effect of selling by traders to adjust to higher costs for carry trades -- a favorite trade for hedge funds and other investors -- due to higher interest rates and a rise in the value of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar. That accentuated the scale of the declines, especially in Tokyo.\n\nSpeaking to business leaders in the northern island of Hokkaido, Shinichi Uchida, a BOJ vice governor, acknowledged the recent market turmoil, triggered in part by concerns over the outlook for the U.S. economy, and said he believed the U.S. would have a \"soft landing,\" avoiding a recession.\n\nJapan's central bank can afford to wait, he said, and \"will not raise its policy interest rate when financial and capital markets are unstable.\"\n\nUchida's comments \"acted like a financial security blanket, calming jittery markets and effectively signaling continued protective intervention,\" Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary.\n\nThe dollar rebounded against the yen early Wednesday, jumping to 146.78 yen from 144.32 late Tuesday. A weaker yen tends to help profits of export manufacturers that earn most of their revenue overseas, and the yen had surged after the rate hike last week after trading recently at a near four decade low level of 160 yen to the dollar.\n\nAlso Wednesday, China reported that its exports rose 7% in July from a year earlier. That was well below the near-10% forecasts of most economists and the slowest rate of growth in three months. It also reflected a low base. Exports jumped 8.6% year-on-year in June, much more than expected.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng closed 1.4% higher at 16,877.86. The Shanghai Composite index edged up 0.1% to 2,869.83.\n\nSouth Korea's Kospi jumped 1.8% to 2,568.41 and the benchmark in Taiwan jumped 3.9% -- both markets were among the biggest losers in Monday's sell-offs due to heavy weighting of technology shares that have seen the biggest losses in the past few weeks.\n\nThe S&P/ASX 200 in Australia rose 0.3% to 7,699.80.\n\nOn Tuesday, the S&P 500 climbed 1% to break a brutal three-day losing streak. It had tumbled a bit more than 6% on a raft of concerns, including worries the Federal Reserve had pressed the brakes too hard for too long on the U.S. economy through high interest rates in order to beat inflation.\n\nThe Dow added 0.8% and the Nasdaq gained 1%.\n\nStocks of all kinds climbed in a mirror opposite of the day before, from smaller companies that need U.S. households to keep spending to huge multinationals more dependent on the global economy.\n\nWhile fears have risen that the U.S. economy might be slowing too quickly, it is still growing. Many economists see a recession in the next year or so as unlikely. The U.S. stock market is also still up a healthy amount for the year so far, and the Federal Reserve says it has ample room to cut interest rates to help the economy.\n\nIn other dealings Wednesday, U.S. benchmark crude oil picked up 35 cents to $73.55 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, added 36 cents to $76.84.\n\nThe euro fell to $1.0913 from $1.0928.", "source": {"uri": "santamariatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Santa Maria

The S&P 500 fell 0.8% Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6%, and the Nasdaq composite dropped 1%. Stocks swung lower as Nvidia, one of Wall Street's most influential companies, went from a morning gain to a loss of 5.1%, making it the heaviest weight on the S&P 500. Nvidia and other Big Tech stocks have been struggling on worries their prices shot too high amid Wall Street's frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below. NEW YORK (AP) - U.S. stocks are subdued Wednesday after a morning rally gave way to modest declines, but Wall Street is still holding relatively steady compared with its manic swings over the last week. The S&P 500 was 0.4% lower in afternoon trading after an earlier jump of 1.7% evaporated. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 179 points, or 0.5%, as of 2:30 p.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.6% lower. Stocks swung lower as Nvidia, one of Wall Street's most influential companies, went from a morning gain of 4.4% and pushing strongly upward on the S&P 500 to a loss of 3.8% that made it the index's heaviest weight. Nvidia and other Big Tech stocks have been largely struggling the last month on worries their prices shot too high amid Wall Street's frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. A profit report from Super Micro Computer, whose stock more than quadrupled in the first two and a half months of the year, helped further mar excitement around AI. Even though its revenue soared 143% in the latest quarter, profit for the company that sells server and storage systems used in AI and other computing fell short of analysts' high expectations. Its stock tumbled 19.4%. Still, the day's moves for U.S. stock indexes looked like modest ripples compared with the waves that have been crashing through global markets since last week. The S&P 500 is coming off a 1% rally that broke a brutal three-day losing streak where it tumbled a bit more than 6%. Several reasons were likely behind the slide for markets worldwide, and one of them that's centered in Japan seems to be calming. The Bank of Japan raised its main interest rate by only a bit last week, but the move nevertheless sent aftershocks worldwide. It scrambled a favorite trade among some hedge funds and other investors, who borrowed money for very cheap in Japanese yen and then invested it elsewhere around the world. Speaking to business leaders in the northern island of Hokkaido, Shinichi Uchida, deputy governor of the Bank of Japan, acknowledged the recent market turmoil, which was also triggered in part by concerns about the slowing U.S. economy. Japan's central bank can afford to wait, he said, and \"will not raise its policy interest rate when financial and capital markets are unstable.\"\u009d He also said he believed the U.S. economy would have a \"soft landing\"\u009d and avoid a recession, even if fears have risen the Federal Reserve has kept interest rates too high for too long in hopes of stifling inflation. The Japanese promise offered a balm for markets, nervous about additional moves by the Bank of Japan, which only recently ended its yearslong campaign to keep interest rates below zero. But it also highlights how risks may remain, suggesting there's still room left for the popular \"carry\"\u009d trade to unwind and that some hedge funds and other investors may \"still remain offsides,\"\u009d according to John Lynch, chief investment officer for Comerica Wealth Management. Japan's rate hike last week sent the value of the Japanese yen soaring, and the resulting exit of investments by those hedge funds likely slapped turbochargers onto market losses, including the worst drop for the Nikkei 225 since the Black Monday crash of 1987. The value of the Japanese yen is one of the first things Darrell Cronk, chief investment officer for Wealth & Investment Management at Wells Fargo, checks now when he wakes each morning because it shows how much the \"carry\"\u009d trade is unwinding. The other thing Cronk checks is the two-year Treasury yield, which he says shows where the market wants or needs the Federal Reserve to take its main interest rate. Treasury yields tumbled sharply Monday, when fear in the market was spiking and investors were speculating the Federal Reserve could even have to call an emergency meeting to cut interest rates quickly. But they've steadied since then. The yield on the two-year Treasury edged up to 4.00% Wednesday from 3.99% late Tuesday. The expectation on Wall Street is for the Fed to cut its main interest rate at its next scheduled meeting next month by either the traditional quarter of a percentage point or the more severe half of a point. In the meantime, earnings reports from the biggest U.S. companies continue to roll in, and the growth for those in the S&P 500 index may end up being the best since 2021, according to FactSet. The Walt Disney Co. delivered stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected, and its streaming business reported a profit for the first time. But its stock nevertheless fell 3.1% after it warned recent softness it saw at its U.S. theme parks could continue for \"the next few quarters.\"\u009d Airbnb tumbled 14.4% after its profit in the second quarter fell short of analysts' expectations, and it told investors that it saw some signs of slowing demand in the U.S. Helping to limit the market's losses was Apple, which rose 1.2%. It was clawing back losses from earlier in the week after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed it had slashed its ownership stake in the iPhone maker. In stock markets abroad, indexes climbed across much of Europe and Asia. ___ AP Business Writer Matt Ott contributed.", "source": {"uri": "medicinehatnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medicine

It soared more than 10% on Tuesday, recovering a large share of the losses it suffered Monday, its worst day since 1987.\n\nThe gains followed remarks by a Bank of Japan official who noted that even though the central bank had raised interest rates a week earlier, to 0.25% from 0.1%, monetary policy remains lax.\n\nThe interest rate hike, however modest, set in motion a domino effect of selling by traders to adjust to higher costs for carry trades -- a favorite trade for hedge funds and other investors -- due to higher interest rates and a rise in the value of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar. That accentuated the scale of the declines, especially in Tokyo.\n\nSpeaking to business leaders in the northern island of Hokkaido, Shinichi Uchida, a BOJ vice governor, acknowledged recent market turmoil, triggered in part by concerns over the outlook for the U.S. economy, and said he believed the U.S. would have a \"soft landing,\" avoiding a recession.\n\nJapan's central bank can afford to wait, he said, and \"will not raise its policy interest rate when financial and capital markets are unstable.\"\n\nUchida's comments \"acted like a financial security blanket, calming jittery markets and effectively signaling continued protective intervention,\" Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary.\n\nThe dollar rebounded against the yen early Wednesday, jumping to 146.51 yen from 144.32 late Tuesday. A weaker yen tends to help profits of export manufacturers that earn most of their revenue overseas, and the yen had surged after the rate hike last week after trading recently at a near four decade low level of 160 yen to the dollar.\n\nAlso Wednesday, China reported that its exports rose 7% in July from a year earlier. That was well below the near-10% forecasts of most economists and the slowest rate of growth in three months. It also reflected a low base. Exports jumped 8.6% year-on-year in June, much more than expected.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng erased early losses and rose 1.2% to 16,849.74. The Shanghai Composite index gained 0.1%, to 2,869.83.\n\nSouth Korea's Kospi jumped 1.8% to 2,568.41 and the benchmark in Taiwan jumped 3.9% -- both markets were among the biggest losers in Monday's sell-offs due to heavy weighting of technology shares that have seen the biggest losses in the past few weeks.\n\nThe S&P/ASX 200 in Australia rose 0.3% to 7,699.80.\n\nOn Tuesday, the S&P 500 climbed 1% to break a brutal three-day losing streak. It had tumbled a bit more than 6% on a raft of concerns, including worries the Federal Reserve had pressed the brakes too hard for too long on the U.S. economy through high interest rates in order to beat inflation.\n\nThe Dow added 0.8% and the Nasdaq gained 1%.\n\nStocks of all kinds climbed in a mirror opposite of the day before, from smaller companies that need U.S. households to keep spending to huge multinationals more dependent on the global economy.\n\nWhile fears have risen that the U.S. economy might be slowing too quickly, it is still growing. Many economists see a recession in the next year or so as unlikely. The U.S. stock market is also still up a healthy amount for the year so far, and the Federal Reserve says it has ample room to cut interest rates to help the economy.\n\nThe S&P 500 has romped to dozens of all-time highs this year and is still up nearly 10% so far in 2024, in part due to a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. Critics have been saying that euphoria has sent stock prices too high in many cases.\n\nIn other dealings Wednesday, U.S. benchmark crude oil picked up 2 cents to $73.22 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, added 5 cents to $76.53.\n\nThe euro fell to $1.0926 from $1.0928.", "source": {"uri": "santamariatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Santa Maria

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 179 points, or 0.5%, as of 2:30 p.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.6% lower.\n\nStocks swung lower as Nvidia, one of Wall Street's most influential companies, went from a morning gain of 4.4% and pushing strongly upward on the S&P 500 to a loss of 3.8% that made it the index's heaviest weight. Nvidia and other Big Tech stocks have been largely struggling the last month on worries their prices shot too high amid Wall Street's frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology.\n\nA profit report from Super Micro Computer, whose stock more than quadrupled in the first two and a half months of the year, helped further mar excitement around AI. Even though its revenue soared 143% in the latest quarter, profit for the company that sells server and storage systems used in AI and other computing fell short of analysts' high expectations. Its stock tumbled 19.4%.\n\nStill, the day's moves for U.S. stock indexes looked like modest ripples compared with the waves that have been crashing through global markets since last week. The S&P 500 is coming off a 1% rally that broke a brutal three-day losing streak where it tumbled a bit more than 6%.\n\nSeveral reasons were likely behind the slide for markets worldwide, and one of them that's centered in Japan seems to be calming. The Bank of Japan raised its main interest rate by only a bit last week, but the move nevertheless sent aftershocks worldwide. It scrambled a favorite trade among some hedge funds and other investors, who borrowed money for very cheap in Japanese yen and then invested it elsewhere around the world.\n\nSpeaking to business leaders in the northern island of Hokkaido, Shinichi Uchida, deputy governor of the Bank of Japan, acknowledged the recent market turmoil, which was also triggered in part by concerns about the slowing U.S. economy.\n\nJapan's central bank can afford to wait, he said, and \"will not raise its policy interest rate when financial and capital markets are unstable.\" He also said he believed the U.S. economy would have a \"soft landing\" and avoid a recession, even if fears have risen the Federal Reserve has kept interest rates too high for too long in hopes of stifling inflation.\n\nThe Japanese promise offered a balm for markets, nervous about additional moves by the Bank of Japan, which only recently ended its yearslong campaign to keep interest rates below zero.\n\nBut it also highlights how risks may remain, suggesting there's still room left for the popular \"carry\" trade to unwind and that some hedge funds and other investors may \"still remain offsides,\" according to John Lynch, chief investment officer for Comerica Wealth Management.\n\nJapan's rate hike last week sent the value of the Japanese yen soaring, and the resulting exit of investments by those hedge funds likely slapped turbochargers onto market losses, including the worst drop for the Nikkei 225 since the Black Monday crash of 1987.\n\nThe value of the Japanese yen is one of the first things Darrell Cronk, chief investment officer for Wealth & Investment Management at Wells Fargo, checks now when he wakes each morning because it shows how much the \"carry\" trade is unwinding.\n\nThe other thing Cronk checks is the two-year Treasury yield, which he says shows where the market wants or needs the Federal Reserve to take its main interest rate.\n\nTreasury yields tumbled sharply Monday, when fear in the market was spiking and investors were speculating the Federal Reserve could even have to call an emergency meeting to cut interest rates quickly. But they've steadied since then.\n\nThe yield on the two-year Treasury edged up to 4.00% Wednesday from 3.99% late Tuesday.\n\nThe expectation on Wall Street is for the Fed to cut its main interest rate at its next scheduled meeting next month by either the traditional quarter of a percentage point or the more severe half of a point.\n\nIn the meantime, earnings reports from the biggest U.S. companies continue to roll in, and the growth for those in the S&P 500 index may end up being the best since 2021, according to FactSet.\n\nThe Walt Disney Co. delivered stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected, and its streaming business reported a profit for the first time. But its stock nevertheless fell 3.1% after it warned recent softness it saw at its U.S. theme parks could continue for \"the next few quarters.\"\n\nAirbnb tumbled 14.4% after its profit in the second quarter fell short of analysts' expectations, and it told investors that it saw some signs of slowing demand in the U.S.\n\nHelping to limit the market's losses was Apple, which rose 1.2%. It was clawing back losses from earlier in the week after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed it had slashed its ownership stake in the iPhone maker.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes climbed across much of Europe and Asia.\n\nAP Business Writer Matt Ott contributed.\n\nMore from this section\n\nReformed Gangster Disciples Boss, Harold 'Noonie G' Ward Hosts Citywide Voter

It soared more than 10% on Tuesday, recovering a large share of the losses it suffered Monday, its worst day since 1987.\n\nThe gains followed remarks by a Bank of Japan official who noted that even though the central bank had raised interest rates a week earlier, to 0.25% from 0.1%, monetary policy remains lax.\n\nThe interest rate hike, however modest, set in motion a domino effect of selling by traders to adjust to higher costs for carry trades -- a favorite trade for hedge funds and other investors -- due to higher interest rates and a rise in the value of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar. That accentuated the scale of the declines, especially in Tokyo.\n\nSpeaking to business leaders in the northern island of Hokkaido, Shinichi Uchida, a BOJ vice governor, acknowledged recent market turmoil, triggered in part by concerns over the outlook for the U.S. economy, and said he believed the U.S. would have a \"soft landing,\" avoiding a recession.\n\nJapan's central bank can afford to wait, he said, and \"will not raise its policy interest rate when financial and capital markets are unstable.\"\n\nUchida's comments \"acted like a financial security blanket, calming jittery markets and effectively signaling continued protective intervention,\" Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary.\n\nThe dollar rebounded against the yen early Wednesday, jumping to 146.51 yen from 144.32 late Tuesday. A weaker yen tends to help profits of export manufacturers that earn most of their revenue overseas, and the yen had surged after the rate hike last week after trading recently at a near four decade low level of 160 yen to the dollar.\n\nAlso Wednesday, China reported that its exports rose 7% in July from a year earlier. That was well below the near-10% forecasts of most economists and the slowest rate of growth in three months. It also reflected a low base. Exports jumped 8.6% year-on-year in June, much more than expected.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng erased early losses and rose 1.2% to 16,849.74. The Shanghai Composite index gained 0.1%, to 2,869.83.\n\nSouth Korea's Kospi jumped 1.8% to 2,568.41 and the benchmark in Taiwan jumped 3.9% -- both markets were among the biggest losers in Monday's sell-offs due to heavy weighting of technology shares that have seen the biggest losses in the past few weeks.\n\nThe S&P/ASX 200 in Australia rose 0.3% to 7,699.80.\n\nOn Tuesday, the S&P 500 climbed 1% to break a brutal three-day losing streak. It had tumbled a bit more than 6% on a raft of concerns, including worries the Federal Reserve had pressed the brakes too hard for too long on the U.S. economy through high interest rates in order to beat inflation.\n\nThe Dow added 0.8% and the Nasdaq gained 1%.\n\nStocks of all kinds climbed in a mirror opposite of the day before, from smaller companies that need U.S. households to keep spending to huge multinationals more dependent on the global economy.\n\nWhile fears have risen that the U.S. economy might be slowing too quickly, it is still growing. Many economists see a recession in the next year or so as unlikely. The U.S. stock market is also still up a healthy amount for the year so far, and the Federal Reserve says it has ample room to cut interest rates to help the economy.\n\nThe S&P 500 has romped to dozens of all-time highs this year and is still up nearly 10% so far in 2024, in part due to a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. Critics have been saying that euphoria has sent stock prices too high in many cases.\n\nIn other dealings Wednesday, U.S. benchmark crude oil picked up 2 cents to $73.22 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, added 5 cents to $76.53.\n\nThe euro fell to $1.0926 from $1.0928.\n\nMore from this section\n\nReformed Gangster Disciples Boss, Harold 'Noonie G' Ward Hosts

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 395 points, or 1%, as of 11:40 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 1.5% higher.\n\nSeveral reasons were likely behind the slide for markets worldwide, and one of them that's centered in Japan seems to be calming. The Bank of Japan raised its main interest rate by only a bit last week, but the move nevertheless sent aftershocks worldwide. It scrambled a favorite trade among some hedge funds and other investors, who borrowed money for very cheap in Japanese yen and then invested it elsewhere around the world.\n\nSpeaking to business leaders in the northern island of Hokkaido, Shinichi Uchida, deputy governor of the Bank of Japan, acknowledged the recent market turmoil, which was also triggered in part by concerns about the slowing U.S. economy.\n\nJapan's central bank can afford to wait, he said, and \"will not raise its policy interest rate when financial and capital markets are unstable.\" He also said he believed the U.S. economy would have a \"soft landing\" and avoid a recession, even if fears have risen the Federal Reserve has kept interest rates too high for too long in hopes of stifling inflation.\n\nRelated Story: The Next Month in the Economy Could be Crucial for the Presidential Election\n\nThe Japanese promise offered a balm for markets, nervous about additional moves by the Bank of Japan, which only recently ended its yearslong campaign to keep interest rates below zero.\n\nBut it also highlights how risks may remain, suggesting there's still room left for the popular \"carry\" trade to unwind and that some hedge funds and other investors may \"still remain offsides,\" according to John Lynch, chief investment officer for Comerica Wealth Management.\n\nJapan's rate hike last week sent the value of the Japanese yen soaring, and the resulting exit of investments by those hedge funds likely slapped turbochargers onto market losses, including the worst drop for the Nikkei 225 since the Black Monday crash of 1987.\n\nRelated Story: Wall Street Rallies to Bounce Back From Its Worst Day in Nearly 2 Years, as ...\n\nStill, several signals of improved optimism continued to light up on Wall Street. A measure of how much investors are paying to protect from future losses in the S&P 500 index eased. Treasury yields also climbed in an indication investors are feeling less need to own the safest of investments.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.94% from 3.90% late Tuesday. It had briefly dropped below 3.70% on Monday, when fear in the market was spiking and investors were speculating the Federal Reserve could even have to call an emergency meeting to cut interest rates quickly.\n\nThe yield on the two-year Treasury, which more closely tracks expectations for Fed action, rose to 4.02% from 3.99% late Tuesday.\n\nThe first thing Darrell Cronk, chief investment officer for Wealth & Investment Management at Wells Fargo, does when he wakes each morning now is to check on the two-year yield and the Japanese yen. The former shows where the market wants or needs the Fed's main interest rate to go, he says, while the second shows how much the \"carry\" trade is unwinding.\n\nThe expectation on Wall Street is for the Fed to cut its main interest rate at its next scheduled meeting next month by either the traditional quarter of a percentage point or the more severe half of a point.\n\nRelated Story: Dow Drops 1,000 Points, and Japanese Stocks Suffer Worst Crash Since 1987 on ...\n\nIn the meantime, earnings reports from the biggest U.S. companies continue to roll in, and the growth for those in the S&P 500 index may end up being the best since 2021, according to FactSet.\n\nThe Walt Disney Co. delivered stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected, and its streaming business reported a profit for the first time. But its stock nevertheless slipped 1.6% after it warned recent softness it saw at its U.S. theme parks could continue for \"the next few quarters.\"\n\nAirbnb tumbled 12.3% after its profit in the second quarter fell short of analysts' expectations, and it told investors that it saw some signs of slowing demand in the U.S.\n\nSuper Micro Computer dropped 15.5% after also reporting weaker results than Wall Street expected. It had been one of the year's biggest winners amid investors' frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology, and its stock soared more than 300% in the year's first two and a half months. But such extreme moves caused critics to say the AI bonanza sent many stock prices too high.\n\nThey've pointed in particular to Nvidia and the other handful of Big Tech stocks in the \"Magnificent Seven\" that were the main reason the S&P 500 set so may records this year. A set of underwhelming profit reports recently, kicked off by Tesla and Alphabet, added to the pessimism and dragged Big Tech stocks lower.\n\nBut Microsoft's 1.9% gain and Apple's 3% climb on Wednesday were the two biggest forces pushing the S&P 500 higher.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes climbed across much of Europe and Asia.", "source": {"uri": "gvwire.com", "dataType": "news",

Japan's Nikkei 225 index fell shortly after the open, but then recovered as the index climbed back up.\n\nThe Nikkei index was up 2.3% at 35,464.61 by mid-morning.\n\nIt had risen more than 10% on Tuesday, recovering much of the losses it had suffered. worst day since 1987.\n\nThe gains followed comments from a Bank of Japan official who noted that while the central bank had raised interest rates, interest rates a week earlier, from 0.1% to 0.25%, monetary policy remains lax.\n\nThe rate hike, however modest, set off a domino effect of selling by traders to adjust to higher costs for carry trades -- a favorite trade for hedge funds and other investors - as a result of higher interest rates and a rise in the value of the Japanese yen against the US dollar.\n\nThe dollar rebounded sharply against the yen early Wednesday, jumping to 146.47 yen from 144.44 late Tuesday. A weaker yen typically helps the profits of export manufacturers that earn most of their revenue abroad, and a rise in the yen after the BOJ's rate hike led to big gains for the Japanese currency late last week.\n\nIn recent months, the dollar has traded at 160 yen, its highest level in nearly four decades.\n\nThe unwinding of carry trades and concerns about the outlook for the US economy sent markets tumbling late last week and into Monday's session.\n\nElsewhere in Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng was the outlier on Wednesday, down 0.3% to 16,647.34. The Shanghai Composite index rose 0.2% to 2,873.25.\n\nSouth Korea's Kospi rose 2.6% to 2,587.78 and Taiwan's benchmark rose more than 3%. Both markets were among the biggest losers in Monday's selloff, amid a heavy focus on technology stocks that have suffered the biggest losses in recent weeks.\n\nThe S&Australia's P/ASX 200 rose 0.4% to 7,712.20.\n\nOn Tuesday is the S&P500 rose 1%, breaking a brutal three-day record losing streakIt was down just over 6% on a series of concerns, including worries that the Federal Reserve had hit the brakes too hard for too long American economy Through high interest rates to beat inflation.\n\nThe S&The P 500 rose 53.70 points to 5,240.03. The Dow rose 294.39 points, or 0.8 percent, to 38,997.66, and the Nasdaq gained 166.77 points, or 1 percent, to 16,366.85.\n\nStocks of all shapes and sizes rose in a mirror image of the day before, from smaller companies that rely on U.S. household spending to large multinationals that are more dependent on the global economy.\n\nStronger-than-expected earnings reports from several major U.S. companies helped drive the market. Kenvue, the company behind Tylenol and Band-Aids, rose 14.7% after reporting stronger-than-expected earnings, helped by higher prices for its products. Uber rose 10.9% after easily beating earnings estimates for its latest quarter.\n\nCaterpillar rose 3% after the heavy equipment maker reported better-than-expected profit.\n\nWhile fears of a slowing U.S. economy are growing, they are still growing, and many economists see a recession in the next year or so as unlikely. The U.S. stock market is also still up sharply for the year so far, and the Federal Reserve says there is plenty of room to cut interest rates to help the economy if the labor market weakens significantly.\n\nThe S&P500 has hit dozens of record highs this year and is still up nearly 10% so far in 2024, partly due to a madness surrounding artificial intelligence technology. Critics say euphoria has in many cases pushed stock prices too high.\n\nIn the bond market, U.S. Treasury yields rose, reversing some of the sharp declines since April that were driven by rising expectations of upcoming rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 3.88% from 3.78% late Monday. It had briefly fallen below 3.70% on Monday as market fears mounted and investors speculated that the Federal Reserve might have to call an emergency meeting to cut rates quickly.\n\nIn other trading early Wednesday, benchmark U.S. crude fell 15 cents to $73.05 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 17 cents to $76.31.\n\n___\n\nAP Business journalists Stan Choe and Matt Ott contributed.", "source": {"uri": "nybreaking.com", "dataType": "news",

Futures for the technology-heavy Nasdaq were up 1.3%.\n\nJapanese markets also clawed back more of the losses from Monday's wipeout. The country's benchmark Nikkei 225 index finished 1.2% higher after a Bank of Japan official suggested the central bank would refrain from raising interest rates while markets are unstable.\n\nThe Walt Disney Co. said Wednesday that it had returned to profitability in the third quarter as the entertainment giant's combined streaming business started making money for the first time. Its shares were essentially unchanged before the bell.\n\nShopify jumped 18% after the maker of online commerce software posted strong results and raised its guidance. The Canadian company saw its second-quarter revenue grow 21% over last year's quarter and said it expects similar growth in the current quarter.\n\nShares in CVS Health were largely unchanged after the retail pharmacy and health care giant slashed its 2024 forecast for a third time. CVS continues to struggle with its health insurance business, with its operating income from that segment plunging 39%. CVS said the leader of that segment, Executive Vice President Brian Kane, has left the company.\n\nAirbnb tumbled more than 14% after it reported a 15% decline in second quarter profit and told investors that it saw some signs of slowing demand in the U.S. The online vacation rental booker's revenue outlook disappointed investors.\n\nStocks of all kinds climbed in a mirror opposite of the day before, from smaller companies that need U.S. households to keep spending to huge multinationals more dependent on the global economy.\n\nWhile fears have risen that the U.S. economy might be slowing too quickly, it is still growing. Many economists see a recession in the next year or so as unlikely. The U.S. stock market is also still up a healthy amount for the year so far, and the Federal Reserve says it has ample room to cut interest rates to help the economy.\n\nIn Europe at midday, Germany's DAX added 1% as an increase in factory output in June offset concern over weaker-than-expected exports.\n\nThe CAC 40 in Paris gained 1.4% and London's FTSE 100 was 1.1% higher.\n\nThe Nikkei index bounced during the day but ultimately gained more than 400 points to close at 35,089.62. It soared more than 10% on Tuesday, recovering a large share of the losses it suffered Monday, its worst day since 1987.\n\nThe gains followed remarks by a Bank of Japan official who noted that even though the central bank had raised interest rates a week earlier, to 0.25% from 0.1%, monetary policy remains lax.\n\nThe interest rate hike, however modest, set in motion a domino effect of selling by traders to adjust to higher costs for carry trades -- a favorite trade for hedge funds and other investors -- due to higher interest rates and a rise in the value of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar. That accentuated the scale of the declines, especially in Tokyo.\n\nSpeaking to business leaders in the northern island of Hokkaido, Shinichi Uchida, a BOJ vice governor, acknowledged the recent market turmoil, triggered in part by concerns over the outlook for the U.S. economy, and said he believed the U.S. would have a \"soft landing,\" avoiding a recession.\n\nJapan's central bank can afford to wait, he said, and \"will not raise its policy interest rate when financial and capital markets are unstable.\"\n\nUchida's comments \"acted like a financial security blanket, calming jittery markets and effectively signaling continued protective intervention,\" Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary.\n\nThe dollar rebounded against the yen early Wednesday, jumping to 147.01 yen from 144.32 late Tuesday. A weaker yen tends to help profits of export manufacturers that earn most of their revenue overseas, and the yen had surged after the rate hike last week after trading recently at a near four decade low level of 160 yen to the dollar.\n\nAlso Wednesday, China reported that its exports rose 7% in July from a year earlier. That was well below the near-10% forecasts of most economists and the slowest rate of growth in three months. It also reflected a low base. Exports jumped 8.6% year-on-year in June, much more than expected.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng closed 1.4% higher at 16,877.86. The Shanghai Composite index edged up 0.1% to 2,869.83.\n\nSouth Korea's Kospi jumped 1.8% to 2,568.41 and the benchmark in Taiwan jumped 3.9% -- both markets were among the biggest losers in Monday's sell-offs due to heavy weighting of technology shares that have seen the biggest losses in the past few weeks.\n\nThe S&P/ASX 200 in Australia rose 0.3% to 7,699.80.\n\nIn other dealings Wednesday, U.S. benchmark crude oil picked up $1.66 to $74.86 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, also added $1.66 to $78.14.", "source": {"uri": "hosted.ap.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Associated Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 510 points, or 1.3%, as of 10:15 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 1.8% higher.\n\nTreasury yields also climbed in the bond market, a signal investors are feeling less worried about the economy, after a report showed fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week. The number was also better than economists expected.\n\nIt was exactly a week ago that worse-than-expected data on unemployment claims helped enflame worries that the Federal Reserve has kept interest rates at too high of an economy-slowing level for too long in order to beat inflation.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 261 points, or 0.7%, as of 9:35 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 1.3% higher.\n\nTreasury yields also climbed in the bond market, a signal that investors are feeling less worried about the economy, after a report showed fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week. The number was also better than economists expected.\n\nIt was exactly a week ago that worse-than-expected data on unemployment claims helped enflame worries that the Federal Reserve has kept interest rates too high for too long in order to beat inflation. That, along with a rate hike by the Bank of Japan that sent shockwaves worldwide by scrambling a favorite trade among some hedge funds, helped send markets tumbling globally.\n\nAt the worst of it, at least so far, the S&P 500 was down roughly 9% from its record set last month. Such drops are regular occurrences on Wall Street, with \"corrections\" of 10% happening about every year or two.\n\nWhat made this past drop more scary was how quickly and sharply it happened. A measure of how much investors are paying to protect themselves from future drops for the S&P 500 surged toward the highest level since the COVID crash of 2020.\n\nStill, the market's swings look more like a \"positioning-driven crash\" driven by too many investors piling into similar trades having to exit them all at once, rather than the start of a long-term downward market caused by a recession, say strategists at BNP Paribas.\n\nThey say it looks more similar to the \"flash crash\" of 2010 than the 2008 global financial crisis or the 2020 recession caused by the pandemic.\n\nOf course, markets have been quick to turn over the past week regardless of any long-term predictions.\n\n\"Today's jobless claims data may ease some of the concerns raised by last week's soft jobs report,\" said Chris Larkin, managing director, trading and investing, at E-Trade from Morgan Stanley. \"But with inflation data due out next week and the stock market still working through its biggest pullback of the year, it's unclear how much this will move the sentiment needle.\"\n\nIn the meantime, big U.S. companies continue to turn in profit reports for the spring that are mostly better than analysts expected.\n\nEli Lilly jumped 10.4% to help lead the market after it delivered stronger profit and revenue than Wall Street had forecast. Sales of its Mounjaro diabetes treatment and its Zepbound weight-loss counterpart are booming, and the company raised its financial forecast for the year.\n\nRobinhood Markets rose 5.2% after reporting stronger growth in profit than expected. It benefited from growth in trading for options, cryptocurrencies and stocks.\n\nThey helped offset an 8.7% drop for McKesson, which topped analysts' expectations for profit in the latest quarter but fell short on revenue. It said growth slowed in its medical-surgical business.\n\nBumble, the Texas-based dating app, lost about a third of its value, 34.4%, after its forecast for revenue in the third quarter came in well below Wall Street's.\n\nIn the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.00% from 3.95% late Wednesday.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed in Asia and down modestly in Europe. In Japan, which has been home to some of the market's wildest moves, the NIkkei 225 ticked down by 0.7%. That looks like a ripple after its tidal swings of down 12.4% and up 10.2% to start the week. ___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed.\n\nMore from this section\n\nHarris introduces new running mate Minnesota Gov.

{"id": 232085280, "title": "European Elections 2024 \u2013 Ireland South: Grace O\u2019Sullivan pessimistic about retaining European seat amid \u2018shif", "text": "Ms O'Sullivan also raised the spectre of what she referred to as \"shifting sands\" in terms of the Green Party's position within the Coalition given that both Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael had polled quite well while the Green Party appeared to have lost ground. \"There is a lot of, as they say, shifting sands. Sinn F\u00e9in have not had a great day either you know. Who knows? The Taoiseach (Simon Harris) might run for an early (general) election - there is so much after the outcomes of the local and the European elections.\" \"Obviously, every party is going to have to reassess and decide which way to go. I think with the climate crisis we face - the existential crisis - the situation in terms of biodiversity loss, that is something that the whole Nature Restoration Law was very challenging.\" \"We are going to have to decide for ourselves as a nation what way we want to go? Do we want an island that is liveable with clean water, air and that we are not accelerating climate change or are we going to sit back and let it all wash over us.\" She admitted she faces a tough fight to hold her MEP berth in the five seat Ireland South constituency and stressed that transfers were the key. A first count in Ireland South is not expected before Monday morning. Elections 2024: Second day of the count kicks off \"I would like to be further ahead,\" she said. \"To be honest, it feels like it is slipping away. We had a great campaign in 2019 and we were on the 'green wave.' But things have shifted in people's minds. I am getting a sense that the tide is going out in a way.\" \"It is a pity because, genuinely, over the past five years I have worked very, very hard.\" \"I am not out of the game yet. I am still holding on and hoping that with the transfers something positive might come. But I am very proud of the work that I have done.\" \"I think people have other things on their mind - the cost of living, the whole situation with migration and housing and public services. There is a whole range of different reasons.\" \"We have also seen a big upsurge in the number of independent candidates who put themselves forward.\" The MEP said she was very disappointed by the Local Government election results and with talented Green politicians losing their seats. \"I am very disappointed, to be honest. We have some brilliant local councillors who will lose their seats. They have been really good performers. But at the end of the day that is democracy.\" \"The people decide and they put in who they want at a particular time and this is what the people want.\" \"It looks like it is not going to be a great day for the Greens. It is unfortunate we are not seeing the returns we would like to see.\"", "summary": "<p>IRELAND South MEP Grace O'Sullivan admitted she was pessimistic about her chances of retaining her MEP berth as she admitted that cost of living issues had caused \"the tide to go out\" for many Green Party candidates.</p>", "url": "https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/elections-2024/european-election/european-elections-2024-ireland-south-grace-osullivan-pessimistic-about-retaining-european-seat-amid-shifting-sands/a835616249.html", "image": "https://focus.independent.ie/thumbor/S3KPPjZ7LCdPlXyng0z8Oe--weU=/0x0:960x640/550x550/prod-mh-ireland/2a143285-2916-4702-b9db-9de2b08fa9dc/09785174-4c93-4f62-bae7-bee6897ac54d/2a143285-2916-4702-b9db-9de2b08fa9dc.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:29:32", "author": "Ralph Riegel", "authors": ["Ralph Riegel"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": 0.115}

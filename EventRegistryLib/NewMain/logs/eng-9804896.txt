They include 18 minors, six of whom are unaccompanied.\n\nStrovolidou said although the U.N. has supplied the asylum seekers with military food rations, tents, blankets, toilets and washing facilities, they remain exposed to extreme heat, dust and humidity.\n\n\"Their humanitarian needs are increasing, and their physical and psychological condition is deteriorating as they continue to remain in these conditions, some for nearly three months,\" Strovolidou told The Associated Press.\n\nShe said some are survivors of gender-based violence and trafficking and people suffering from serious illnesses such as cancer, asthma and serious mental health issues.\n\nCyprus was split in 1974 when Turkey invaded after supporters of a union with Greece mounted a coup with the backing of the junta then ruling Greece. Cyprus joined the EU in 2004, but only the south enjoys full membership benefits.\n\nAleem Siddique, spokesman for the U.N. peacekeeping force in Cyprus, urged an immediate end to the \"pushbacks\" and for Cypriot authorities to live up to their obligations under international and EU law.\n\n\"In nearly all instances, the asylum seekers found their way into government-controlled areas from where they were intercepted by the Cyprus Police and forcibly dumped into the buffer zone after having their passports and mobile phones confiscated,\" Siddique told AP.\n\nHe said the U.N. has shared video evidence of the \"pushback operations\" with Cypriot authorities.\n\n\"The buffer zone is not a refugee camp,\" Siddique said.\n\nThe Cyprus government has taken a tough line with migrant crossings along the 180-kilometer (120 mile) length of the buffer zone, insisting that it would not permit it to become a gateway for illegal migration.\n\nDeputy Minister for Migration Nicholas Ioannides said earlier this week that the government doesn't want to be at odds with the U.N. and is in talks with the UNHCR to resolve the issue.\n\nWhat complicates the issue are the peculiarities of the buffer zone itself, which isn't a formal border and as such. Cypriot authorities say the U.N. is mistaken when it speaks about pushbacks that specifically pertain to \"expulsions at recognized sea or land borders.\"\n\nIn a written statement to AP, the ministry said migrants who cross the buffer zone arrive on the island's north from Turkey -- a safe country -- and then cross southward along remote stretches of the porous buffer zone where there are no physical barriers preventing crossings.\n\nAccording to an established legal framework, Cypriot police and other authorities are lawfully empowered to conduct \"effective surveillance\" of the buffer zone in order to combat illegal migration by \"discouraging people from circumventing checks\" at all eight lawful crossing points.\n\nThe ministry said given the \"tremendous migratory pressures\" Cyprus is under, the government has adopted a \"principled stance\" to avoid turning the buffer zone into a \"route for irregular migration\" while offering humanitarian assistance to stranded migrants.\n\nHuman rights lawyer Nicoletta Charalambidou is contesting the Cypriot government's claim that it's acting in line with international and EU law.\n\nShe has launched legal action on behalf of 46 stranded migrants to get Cypriot authorities to allow them to submit asylum applications.\n\n\"The government has an obligation to allow these people to file asylum claims,\" she told AP.

The migrants have been living in tents in the buffer zone between the Turkish-controlled north and the Republic of Cyprus.\n\nA group of around 70 people have been camped out in the demilitarized zone patrolled by the United Nations since Cyprus refused to allow them to cross to the southern side of the so-called Green Line to seek asylum. The number of migrants stranded in the buffer zone has been growing since late May. Coming from countries including Somalia, Sudan, Congo, Syria, Iran and Afghanistan, all reached the area through North Cyprus via Turkey.\n\nThe Commission underlined on Thursday that the government of Cyprus, which is an EU-member state, has an obligation to provide the migrants with access to asylum.\n\n\"The possibility for any person to apply for international protection on a Member State's territory, including at is border or in a transit zone, is established in EU law,\" a spokesperson for the Commission told the Cyprus Mail newspaper, adding that they were closely monitoring the situation and were in contact with both the Cypriot authorities and the UNHCR in Cyprus.\n\nWe will not allow the Green Line to become a route for migrants\n\nThe Commission's call for Cyprus to grant the migrants access to asylum procedures comes after the country's Deputy Migration Minister Nicholas Ioannides repeated that the government would not allow the Green Line to become a route for migrants to enter Cyprus.\n\n\"It is our firm position that we do not want to create a new route via the Green Line, especially now that we are not facing arrivals by sea,\" Ioannides said Wednesday.\n\nAfter visiting two asylum seeker reception centers in Kofinou and Limnes, the deputy minister added that the government did \"not want to clash either with UNFICYP [UN peacekeeping] or the UNHCR,\" the Cyprus Mail reported. Talks were planned with the UN refugee agency to try to resolve the problem of those stranded in the buffer zone, Ioannides added.\n\nIoannides insisted that the European Union had no role in the situation. \"The important thing is that there is no intervention from the EU, in terms of pressures to Cyprus, because they understand the situation,\" he said.\n\nThe statement prompted a strong reaction from KISA, a Cypriot anti-racist organization working with migrants, which demanded a \"clear public statement from the EU\" with regard to Ioannides' comments.\n\n'Dire conditions'\n\nThe Cyprus government says it is offering assistance to the migrants in the buffer zone. But officials, including from UNHCR, say the migrants, including children, are living in \"dire\" conditions.\n\nBritish High Commissioner Irfan Siddiq posted on X late last month: \"Despite UN efforts, these people -including children -- are living in dire conditions.\" He added, \"an urgent solution is needed to relocate these people to more humane conditions and to allow for the processing of their asylum claims.\"\n\nMudassir, an Afghan man in the buffer zone, told the news agency AFP that there were \"a lot of snakes\" in the area and \"things were really difficult.\"\n\nHe said said he had attempted to cross the Green Line at night to claim asylum from Cypriot police, but had been brought to the buffer zone by them instead. \"We feel hopeless in these extremely harsh conditions,\" he said.\n\nAnother man, Lawrence from Nigeria, said he had fled his home country on a student visa to escape anti-LGBTQI+ discrimination. He too said he had been stopped by Cypriot police when trying to cross and had been \"petrified.\"\n\n\"At some point I just gave up on everything,\" Lawrence told AFP. \"My dream was to finish college and have a normal life, anywhere.\"\n\nAn Iranian man, Hussein Zare, was also among the group living in UN tents in searing heat when he spoke to AFP in July. He said he had hoped to gain entry to the EU via Cyprus and start a new life in France.\n\nZare explained that he had flown in May from Iran to Istanbul, with his wife and daughter, and then on to North Cyrus. He claimed that when they tried to cross the Green Line, the police arrested them and brought them to the buffer zone.\n\n\"The government has blocked us in this area,\" said Zare.\n\nThe Iranian is one of a group of migrants who have hired a lawyer, with the help of UNHCR, to get permission to file asylum applications in the Republic.\n\nCyprus insists that Turkey is responsible for the migrants' claims. In a statement, the government said: \"Since these people traveled through Turkey to the occupied areas [North Cyprus], it is Turkey's responsibility to provide them with access to asylum procedures.\"\n\nMigrants sue over alleged pushbacks\n\n46 of the migrants in the buffer zone have joined a lawsuit against the government, saying they are being denied access to asylum proceedings and accusing the authorities of pushbacks.\n\nAllegations of pushbacks - a prohibited practice under international law - have also come from NGOs and the UN refugee agency. Emilia Strovolidou, public information officer for the UNHCR, told the Cyprus Mail this week that ten people, including four unaccompanied minors, were subject to a pushback on Tuesday (August 6).\n\nThe paper reported that migrants who tried to apply for asylum away not at the informal border but at the Pournara reception center had allegedly been returned to the buffer zone in unmarked vehicles. The UN has also said that migrants have been \"dumped\" in the zone.\n\nAsked to comment on the lawsuit, Ioannides said: \"The executive authority cannot interfere in court proceedings, so a solution will be found in court.\"\n\nAlso read: UN urges Cyprus to start asylum process for migrants in the buffer zone\n\n'Significant changes' to migration laws planned\n\nIn comments to the Cyprus Kathimerini newspaper, Ioannides said his government was planning \"significant changes to the country's migration laws, which will soon be presented to parliament.\"\n\nAccording to Kathimerini, the reforms will include speeding up the processing of asylum applications and making it easier to deport those who are refused asylum.\n\nThe President of the Houses of Parliament, Annita Demetriou, reportedly told Ioannides that she would make sure parliament prioritizes the review and approval of these new measures, calling the migration issue \"urgent\".", "source": {"uri": "infomigrants.net",

The United Nations refugee agency on Friday accused government authorities in ethnically divided Cyprus of rounding up dozens of migrants and forcing them back inside a U.N.-controlled buffer zone that they crossed to seek asylum.\n\nNicosia (Cyprus), Aug 9 (AP) The United Nations refugee agency on Friday accused government authorities in ethnically divided Cyprus of rounding up dozens of migrants and forcing them back inside a U.N.-controlled buffer zone that they crossed to seek asylum.\n\nUNHCR spokeswoman Emilia Strovolidou said that as many as 99 asylum seekers were \"pushed back\" into the buffer zone between mid-May and Aug. 8.\n\nAlso Read | Innocent Indian-Origin Man Dies in US Prison: Kris Maharaj Passes Away After Spending 38 Years Behind Bars for Murders He Never Committed.\n\nThe asylum seekers entered the European Union member country from the breakaway Turkish Cypriot north and crossed the buffer zone into the south where they could file their applications with the internationally recognized government.\n\nOf those 99 migrants, 76 people from countries including Syria, Iran, Afghanistan, Nigeria, Somalia, Bangladesh, Sudan, Iraq and Gaza remain stranded in two locations inside the buffer zone, to the west and east of the capital Nicosia. They include 18 minors, six of whom are unaccompanied.\n\nAlso Read | Wrestler Arrested on Sexual Assault Charges: Egyptian Olympic Wrestler Mohamed Elsayed Arrested in Paris for Allegedly Groping Woman Outside Paris Cafe.\n\nStrovolidou said although the U.N. has supplied the asylum seekers with military food rations, tents, blankets, toilets and washing facilities, they remain exposed to extreme heat, dust and humidity.\n\n\"Their humanitarian needs are increasing, and their physical and psychological condition is deteriorating as they continue to remain in these conditions, some for nearly three months,\" Strovolidou told The Associated Press.\n\nShe said some are survivors of gender-based violence and trafficking and people suffering from serious illnesses such as cancer, asthma and serious mental health issues.\n\nCyprus was split in 1974 when Turkiye invaded after supporters of a union with Greece mounted a coup with the backing of the junta then ruling Greece. Cyprus joined the EU in 2004, but only the south enjoys full membership benefits.\n\nAleem Siddique, spokesman for the U.N. peacekeeping force in Cyprus, urged an immediate end to the \"pushbacks\" and for Cypriot authorities to live up to their obligations under international and EU law.\n\n\"In nearly all instances, the asylum seekers found their way into government-controlled areas from where they were intercepted by the Cyprus Police and forcibly dumped into the buffer zone after having their passports and mobile phones confiscated,\" Siddique told AP.\n\nHe said the U.N. has shared video evidence of the \"pushback operations\" with Cypriot authorities.\n\n\"The buffer zone in not a refugee camp,\" Siddique said.\n\nThe Cyprus government has taken a tough line with migrant crossings along the 180-kilometer (120 mile) length of the buffer zone, insisting that it would not permit it to become a gateway for illegal migration.\n\nDeputy Minister for Migration Nicholas Ioannides said earlier this week that the government doesn't want to be at odds with the U.N. and is in talks with the UNHCR to resolve the issue.\n\nWhat complicates the issue are the peculiarities of the buffer zone itself, which isn't a formal border and as such. Cypriot authorities say the U.N. is mistaken when it speaks about pushbacks that specifically pertain to \"expulsions at recognized sea or land borders.\"\n\nIn a written statement to AP, the ministry said migrants who cross the buffer zone arrive on the island's north from Turkiye -- a safe country -- and then cross southward along remote stretches of the porous buffer zone where there are no physical barriers preventing crossings.\n\nAccording to an established legal framework, Cypriot police and other authorities are lawfully empowered to conduct \"effective surveillance\" of the buffer zone in order to combat illegal migration by \"discouraging people from circumventing checks\" at all eight lawful crossing points.\n\nThe ministry said given the \"tremendous migratory pressures\" Cyprus is under, the government has adopted a \"principled stance\" to avoid turning the buffer zone into a \"route for irregular migration\" while offering humanitarian assistance to stranded migrants.\n\nHuman rights lawyer Nicoletta Charalambidou is contesting the Cypriot government's claim that it's acting in line with international and EU law.\n\nShe has launched legal action on behalf of 46 stranded migrants to get Cypriot authorities to allow them to submit asylum applications.\n\n\"The government has an obligation to allow these people to file asylum claims,\" she told AP. She added that asylum applications should be assessed individually to determine if conditions of safety exist in Turkiye for each applicant.

They include 18 minors, six of whom are unaccompanied.\n\nStrovolidou said although the U.N. has supplied the asylum seekers with military food rations, tents, blankets, toilets and washing facilities, they remain exposed to extreme heat, dust and humidity.\n\n\"Their humanitarian needs are increasing, and their physical and psychological condition is deteriorating as they continue to remain in these conditions, some for nearly three months,\" Strovolidou told The Associated Press.\n\nA girl runs next to the tents at a camp inside the U.N controlled buffer zone that divide the north part of the Turkish occupied area from the south Greek Cypriots at Aglantzia area in the divided capital Nicosia, Cyprus, Friday, Aug, 9, 2024. (AP Photo/Petros Karadjias)\n\nShe said some are survivors of gender-based violence and trafficking and people suffering from serious illnesses such as cancer, asthma and serious mental health issues.\n\nCyprus was split in 1974 when Turkey invaded after supporters of a union with Greece mounted a coup with the backing of the junta then ruling Greece. Cyprus joined the EU in 2004, but only the south enjoys full membership benefits.\n\nAleem Siddique, spokesman for the U.N. peacekeeping force in Cyprus, urged an immediate end to the \"pushbacks\" and for Cypriot authorities to live up to their obligations under international and EU law.\n\n\"In nearly all instances, the asylum seekers found their way into government-controlled areas from where they were intercepted by the Cyprus Police and forcibly dumped into the buffer zone after having their passports and mobile phones confiscated,\" Siddique told AP.\n\nHe said the U.N. has shared video evidence of the \"pushback operations\" with Cypriot authorities.\n\n\"The buffer zone is not a refugee camp,\" Siddique said.\n\nThe Cyprus government has taken a tough line with migrant crossings along the 180-kilometer (120 mile) length of the buffer zone, insisting that it would not permit it to become a gateway for illegal migration.\n\nDeputy Minister for Migration Nicholas Ioannides said earlier this week that the government doesn\u00b4t want to be at odds with the U.N. and is in talks with the UNHCR to resolve the issue.\n\nWhat complicates the issue are the peculiarities of the buffer zone itself, which isn\u00b4t a formal border and as such. Cypriot authorities say the U.N. is mistaken when it speaks about pushbacks that specifically pertain to \"expulsions at recognized sea or land borders.\"\n\nIn a written statement to AP, the ministry said migrants who cross the buffer zone arrive on the island\u00b4s north from Turkey - a safe country - and then cross southward along remote stretches of the porous buffer zone where there are no physical barriers preventing crossings.\n\nAccording to an established legal framework, Cypriot police and other authorities are lawfully empowered to conduct \"effective surveillance\" of the buffer zone in order to combat illegal migration by \"discouraging people from circumventing checks\" at all eight lawful crossing points.\n\nThe ministry said given the \"tremendous migratory pressures\" Cyprus is under, the government has adopted a \"principled stance\" to avoid turning the buffer zone into a \"route for irregular migration\" while offering humanitarian assistance to stranded migrants.\n\nHuman rights lawyer Nicoletta Charalambidou is contesting the Cypriot government\u00b4s claim that it\u00b4s acting in line with international and EU law.\n\nShe has launched legal action on behalf of 46 stranded migrants to get Cypriot authorities to allow them to submit asylum applications.\n\n\"The government has an obligation to allow these people to file asylum claims,\" she told AP. She added that asylum applications should be assessed individually to determine if conditions of safety exist in Turkey for each applicant.\n\n____\n\nFollow AP\u00b4s global migration coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/migration\n\nA refugee man stands in front of tent at a camp inside the U.N controlled buffer zone that divide the north part of the Turkish occupied area from the south Greek Cypriots at Aglantzia area in the divided capital Nicosia, Cyprus, Friday, Aug, 9, 2024.

This is why we are in dialogue with them to solve the problem.\"\n\nAsked how long the existing situation would continue considering there are plenty of points where migrants could cross through, and whether a solution would actually be found, Ioannides said \"the Green Line regulation allows us to monitor the Green Line over illegal migration.\"\n\nThe buffer zone will not become a route for migrants, he said.\n\nCurrently, talks are underway to assess how the problem can be solved. \"We do not ignore the humanitarian aspect, this is why we offer help, whatever it is these people need.\"\n\nLast week, sources told the Cyprus Mail the brunt of the food offerings were provided by the UN which is struggling as resources are dwindling.\n\nAsked whether Cyprus would seek out the help of the EU, the deputy minister said \"the EU is currently not involved and does not need to be.\n\n\"The important thing is that there is no intervention from the EU, in terms of pressures to Cyprus, because they understand the situation.\"\n\nIn June, the European Commission told the Cyprus Mail it was closely monitoring the situation and in contact with Cypriot authorities, while it stressed the right to apply for asylum.\n\nWhere the lawsuit is concerned, Charalambidou said \"it is clear the Republic of Cyprus is violating EU and international law.\"\n\nPeople should have access to asylum procedures and the government is actively preventing this from happening, she told the Cyprus Mail.\n\nShe echoed statements made by legal experts in the past that the buffer zone is part of the Republic's territory and individuals there should have access to asylum in any case.\n\nNonetheless, \"the majority of the migrants had in fact entered government-controlled areas and pushed back to the buffer zone.\"\n\nThere were even cases where people had even gone to Pournara and sent back to the buffer zone against their wish, Charalambidou said.\n\n\"These people are not illegal migrants. They are asylum seekers and come from countries where prima facie they have valid asylum claims.\"\n\nThe countries include Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Afghanistan and Iran. Charalambidou is taking on the case pro bono, and the UNHCR is covering stamp expenses.\n\nAccording to the deputy minister of migration, ongoing discussions with the UN are not only limited to the individuals currently in the buffer zone \"but the broader approach of [migrant] flows from Turkey, via the occupied territories to the free areas\".\n\nThe efforts are centred on \"regulating the situation\" so the Green Line does not become a route for migrants, as well as solving the existing problem of the people currently stuck there, he said.\n\n\"The Green Line is not a border. We do not ever want to become a border. It is a peculiar situation, we have a military occupation, and we should take this fact into account, that it is not a border.\"\n\nCommenting on the conditions in Kofinou, Ioannides described \"respectable living conditions\" for asylum seekers waiting for their applications to be examined.\n\n\"The conditions are very good, there is a/c and food. The children go to school and that is very important. We are interested in the well-being of these people.\"\n\nAs far as the Limnes reception centre is concerned, Ioannides specified it is a huge project under construction which can accommodate 1,000 individuals and a pre-departure site of 800 spots.\n\nThe latter is for people who are to be returned to their country of origin.\n\n\"Cyprus is exerting a very important effort to meet its international obligations but ensure legality is safeguarded.\"\n\nSo far this year, there are more migrant returns than arrivals and efforts towards better infrastructure are geared to migrants allowed to remain in the Republic.", "source": {"uri": "cyprus-mail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cyprus Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

(AP)\n\nThe United Nations refugee agency on Friday accused government authorities in ethnically divided Cyprus of rounding up dozens of migrants and forcing them back inside a UN-controlled buffer zone that they crossed to seek asylum.\n\nUNHCR spokeswoman Emilia Strovolidou said that as many as 99 asylum seekers were \"pushed back\" into the buffer zone between mid-May and Aug. 8.\n\nThe asylum seekers entered the European Union member country from the breakaway Turkish Cypriot north and crossed the buffer zone into the south where they could file their applications with the internationally recognized government.\n\nOf those 99 migrants, 76 people from countries including Syria, Iran, Afghanistan, Nigeria, Somalia, Bangladesh, Sudan, Iraq and Gaza remain stranded in two locations inside the buffer zone, to the west and east of the capital Nicosia. They include 18 minors, six of whom are unaccompanied.\n\nStrovolidou said although the UN has supplied the asylum seekers with military food rations, tents, blankets, toilets and washing facilities, they remain exposed to extreme heat, dust and humidity.\n\n\"Their humanitarian needs are increasing, and their physical and psychological condition is deteriorating as they continue to remain in these conditions, some for nearly three months,\" Strovolidou told The Associated Press.\n\nShe said some are survivors of gender-based violence and trafficking and people suffering from serious illnesses such as cancer, asthma and serious mental health issues.\n\nCyprus was split in 1974 when T\u00fcrkiye invaded after supporters of a union with Greece mounted a coup with the backing of the junta then ruling Greece. Cyprus joined the EU in 2004, but only the south enjoys full membership benefits.\n\nAleem Siddique, spokesman for the UN peacekeeping force in Cyprus, urged an immediate end to the \"pushbacks\" and for Cypriot authorities to live up to their obligations under international and EU law.\n\n\"In nearly all instances, the asylum seekers found their way into government-controlled areas from where they were intercepted by the Cyprus Police and forcibly dumped into the buffer zone after having their passports and mobile phones confiscated,\" Siddique told AP.\n\nHe said the UN has shared video evidence of the \"pushback operations\" with Cypriot authorities.\n\n\"The buffer zone in not a refugee camp,\" Siddique said.\n\nThe Cyprus government has taken a tough line with migrant crossings along the 180-kilometer (120 mile) length of the buffer zone, insisting that it would not permit it to become a gateway for illegal migration.\n\nDeputy Minister for Migration Nicholas Ioannides said earlier this week that the government doesn't want to be at odds with the UN and is in talks with the UNHCR to resolve the issue.\n\nWhat complicates the issue are the peculiarities of the buffer zone itself, which isn't a formal border and as such. Cypriot authorities say the UN is mistaken when it speaks about pushbacks that specifically pertain to \"expulsions at recognized sea or land borders.\"\n\nIn a written statement to AP, the ministry said migrants who cross the buffer zone arrive on the island's north from T\u00fcrkiye -- a safe country -- and then cross southward along remote stretches of the porous buffer zone where there are no physical barriers preventing crossings.\n\nAccording to an established legal framework, Cypriot police and other authorities are lawfully empowered to conduct \"effective surveillance\" of the buffer zone in order to combat illegal migration by \"discouraging people from circumventing checks\" at all eight lawful crossing points.\n\nThe ministry said given the \"tremendous migratory pressures\" Cyprus is under, the government has adopted a \"principled stance\" to avoid turning the buffer zone into a \"route for irregular migration\" while offering humanitarian assistance to stranded migrants.\n\nHuman rights lawyer Nicoletta Charalambidou is contesting the Cypriot government's claim that it's acting in line with international and EU law.\n\nShe has launched legal action on behalf of 46 stranded migrants to get Cypriot authorities to allow them to submit asylum applications.\n\n\"The government has an obligation to allow these people to file asylum claims,\" she told AP. She added that asylum applications should be assessed individually to determine if conditions of safety exist in T\u00fcrkiye for each applicant.", "source": {"uri": "english.aawsat.com", "dataType":

All the migrants currently stranded reached the buffer zone through the north. Ioannides criticised the fact that they travelled via Turkey, which he described as a safe country.\n\nOn Wednesday, Ioannides underlined the EU had stayed out of the matter as it was understanding of the situation.\n\nSpeaking to the Cyprus Mail on Thursday, a spokesperson for the EU Commission said it was closely monitoring the situation and was in contact with Cypriot authorities and the UNCHR in Cyprus.\n\n\"The possibility for any person to apply for international protection on a Member State's territory, including at its border or in a transit zone, is established in EU law.\"\n\nWith Cyprus being a member state, the spokesperson specified there was \"an obligation to provide access to the procedure for international protection. This is an important element of the right to asylum guaranteed by the Charter of Fundamental Rights (Article 18) and of the respect for the Geneva Convention.\"\n\nThe spokesperson added that the Commission \"has been working closely over the last few years to support Cyprus in managing challenges related to irregular arrivals, even during periods of exceptionally high arrivals.\" They declined to comment specifically on Ioannides' statements.\n\nDuring the visit in Avlona, Ioannides specified there was an ongoing dialogue with the UNHCR so a solution can be found.\n\nHowever, he acknowledged that the issue is complex, involving humanitarian, political and legal dimensions and requires broader discussion for resolution.\n\n\"It is a matter of concern to us; we are mindful of the humanitarian aspect, which is why we are providing necessities to these people,\" he said. On the other hand, \"it is our firm position that we do not want to create a new route via the Green Line, especially now that we are not facing arrivals by sea.\"", "source": {"uri": "cyprus-mail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cyprus Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Buffer zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Buffer_Zone_in_Cyprus", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Buffer Zone in Cyprus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Executive (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Commission_on_Human_Rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Commission on Human Rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_of_Fundamental_Rights_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Conventions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geneva Conventions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cyprus Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_High_Commissioner_for_Refugees", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union law"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://cms.cyprus-mail.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/buffer-zone-01-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9804896", "eventUri": "eng-9804896", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2784313725490196, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

We are not ignoring the humanitarian aspect, so we are providing assistance, whatever these people need. However, we must balance between our policy, our position that we will not allow the passage of migrants, while on the other hand keeping in mind the humanitarian aspect,\" he said.\n\nAsked whether the Republic has asked or will ask for the help of the European Union on this issue, the Deputy Minister of Migration replied that \"the EU at the moment does not have any involvement and does not need to. The important thing is that there is no intervention by the EU to put pressure on the Republic of Cyprus, because they understand the situation.\"\n\nHe also added that \"the Green Line is not a border, we never want it to be a border, it is a peculiar situation, we have a military occupation and we have to keep this fact in mind, that it is not a border\".\n\n\"This is not what happens in other European countries where migrants come via the borders with other countries, we have a military occupation, we have other rules and we have to take them into account to deal with the situation,\" he noted.\n\nReferring to his visit to the accommodation center in Kofinou, he said that \"I wanted to see personally the situation at the accommodation center in Kofinou but also to see the progress of works in 'Limnes'\".\n\nHe added that in Kofinou \"there are decent living conditions for the people staying there, they are asylum seekers who are waiting for their applications to be examined and they stay until their asylum applications are examined. The conditions are very good, there is air conditioning and food, the little children go to school and that is very important, we care about the well-being of these people.\"\n\nOn his visit to the \"Limnes\" Accommodation Centre, he said that a huge project is under construction, it is a 1,000-bed center that can accommodate 1,000 people and a pre-departure center with 800 places.\"\n\nHe explained that \"the Accommodation Centers are not permanent homes for these people, they are centers that are created for asylum seekers, once they submit their application and are entitled to stay in the Republic until their application is examined\".\n\nHe also described as very important the pre-departure centre \"which will be able to accommodate up to 800 people for the purpose of their repatriation. This center is not about permanent residence either, but a place where those persons who are illegally in the Republic of Cyprus will be detained with a view to being deported,\" he added\n\n\"It is very important that the Republic of Cyprus makes an effort to meet its international obligations but at the same time to preserve legality\", stressed Ioannides, adding that \"already this year we have more returns of foreigners than flows.\"\n\nHe also noted that \"the creation of infrastructure contributes to this effort to give emphasis only to those foreigners who are entitled to remain in the Republic after their application has been examined. If their application is examined and rejected then they will have to be repatriated.\"\n\nWe consider, he continued, \"these projects to be very important and we hope that they will be completed soon so that the Republic of Cyprus can implement its immigration policy.\"\n\nThe Deputy Minister was asked whether, due to the situation in the Middle East region, an increase in migration flows is expected and whether the Republic is ready and has the infrastructure to receive these people.\n\nThe Republic of Cyprus, he replied, \"has taken advantage of the experience it has gained unfortunately, due to the crises in our region. There are the National Plans and there is also the National Plan 'Nafkratis' which concerns the Deputy Ministry of Migration and International Protection\".\n\n\"We have a planning, our officials are experienced, they have knowledge of the practices that should be followed, we hope that the situation will not escalate. We will not have what many people expect, but if any conflict occurs and if there are migratory flows, then we will put in place the national planning so that we can deal with the situation\", he concluded.\n\nAccording to UNHCR Cyprus, at the beginning of July there were two locations in the UN Buffer Zone where a total of 37 asylum seekers were staying, twenty-five (25) in Aglantzia and twelve (12) in Akaki, including 8 children in total, 4 in Aglantzia and 4 in Akaki.\n\nAs regards the origin of the asylum seekers, UNHCR Cyprus said that people staying in Aglantzia come from Afghanistan, Iran, Sudan and Cameroon, while most people staying in Akaki come from Syria.\n\nThe UN-controlled buffer zone is a 180-kilometre line spanning across the island and took its final shape after the 1974 invasion of Turkey and the occupation of 37% of the island's territory.", "source": {"uri": "parikiaki.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Parikiaki"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

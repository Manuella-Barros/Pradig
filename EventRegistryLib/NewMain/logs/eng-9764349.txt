Marquee-name programs are loading up with experienced additions, including four- and five-star talents, across the four power conferences. That includes in the ACC, where a transfer-bolstered Florida State won the conference title last season while Miami, Louisville, California, North Carolina State and Syracuse all have top-25 transfer classes for this fall. That could represent an added challenge for the Tigers in returning to the top of the league.\n\n\"In the past, pre-portal, you would look into the junior-college areas, sometimes find a transfer that was a (graduate) to fill a spot where maybe you had an injury or player left early to go to the NFL,\" Wolfpack coach Dave Doeren said. \"Obviously now there's outflow and inflow coming in at different times differently than there ever has been.\"\n\nAt minimum, it has made it easier for coaches to bolster talented rosters or quickly turn around programs after taking over a new job. The movement between rosters remains steady, except when it comes to inbound traffic toward the South Carolina campus that borders Lake Hartwell.\n\nSwinney has defended his approach almost stubbornly amid questions about the team's lack of portal activity and the risk of falling behind the nation's best. He points to the Tigers luring top-flight classes of high school recruits (Clemson has amassed nine top-10 classes in the past 10 years) and then keeping them around.\n\n\"I said earlier today: If I took a job somewhere else, I'd be the greatest portal recruiter ever because half of my roster would be gone and I'd have to put it together,\" Swinney said. \"But if you study our team, our retention is as good anybody in the country. Guys graduate, they stay, and we recruit.\"\n\nHe can also point to a long run of success that included winning six straight ACC titles with accompanying trips to the College Football Playoff from 2015-20. But as NCAA rules loosened to allow portal movement to grow, Clemson has lost 10 games in the past three seasons -- matching its total for the seven seasons before that -- and last year's 9-4 mark ended a run of 12 straight years with 10 wins or more.\n\nClemson has also won the ACC just once (2022) since that long, dominating run and hasn't made the CFP since the 2020 team that featured No. 1 overall NFL draft pick Trevor Lawrence at quarterback.\n\nMeanwhile, there's a lot of available talent moving throughout the sport.\n\nThe 67 other schools in the Power Four conferences -- the ACC, Big 12, Big Ten and Southeastern -- along with Notre Dame, added 1,063 transfers for the upcoming season at an average of 15.9 per school, according to 247Sports. Roughly 17% of those (179) are considered four-star prospects. Six were five-star additions, with Ohio State landing two, while Alabama, Texas, Oregon and Mississippi got the others.\n\nIn the ACC specifically, schools added an average of 14.8 transfers, with 2.2 of those being four-star talents.\n\nBig Ten\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- When Michigan and Washington arrived at Lucas Oil Stadium on Thursday, it marked the first time they'd been on the same field since January's national championship game.\n\nMuch has changed in six months.\n\nTheir big-name coaches, Jim Harbaugh and Kalen DeBoer, have moved on to new homes in Los Angeles and Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Their strong-armed quarterbacks, J.J. McCarthy and Michael Penix Jr., and workhorse running backs, Blake Corum and Dillon Johnson, are in NFL training camps. Washington even switched conferences.\n\nBut as the Wolverines and Huskies prepare for a new season, there is one common motivator fueling both teams -- getting back to the expanded 12-team playoff and a possible rematch.\n\n\"It's cool,\" Washington quarterback Carson Bruener said when asked about reuniting with Michigan at Lucas Oil Stadium for the final day of the Big Ten's preseason media blitz. \"Unfortunately, we lost (that game) and I was hoping for a win and everyone on the UW side was hoping for a win. We fell short, but that goal is still there.\"\n\nJust how much of an overhaul has there been in the two programs?\n\nConsider that new Huskies coach Jedd Fisch acknowledged Thursday he was rooting for his old boss, Harbaugh, in the title game. Fisch, hired by Washington after three years as Arizona's coach, worked as Michigan's passing game coordinator in 2015 and '16.\n\nOf course, back then, Fisch couldn't have predicted he'd be here, leading the other team.\n\nFisch brought 21 staff members with him from Arizona and added 46 new scholarship players. Bruener, the son of former NFL tight end Mark Bruener, is expected to replace Penix behind center, and with only one returning starter, Fisch knows the odds are stacked against him.\n\nFirst-time head coach Sherrone Moore faces his own daunting challenge in Ann Arbor.\n\nThe Wolverines started the offseason with five returning starters, then lost all-conference safety Rod Moore to a torn ACL in spring practice. While the most glaring need is finding someone to replace McCarthy, another pressing concern is finding five new starters on an offensive line that lost its top six players to the NFL.", "source":

Standing in front of the southwest tunnel at Lucas Oil Stadium, Washington's football coach wore a gray suit and a purple tie, leaning against a wall sporting the Big Ten logo.\n\nFisch is relatively relaxed. He and his family have been enjoying the Seattle summer's \"crystal blue skies.\" His presence in Indianapolis, however, is a reminder that football season is approaching quickly.\n\n\"It's an incredible time of year to be in Seattle,\" he said. \"We're trying to soak it all in for these final three days.\"\n\nFisch addressed the assembled media on Thursday on the final day of Big Ten media days at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, along with sixth-year defensive back Kamren Fabiculanan, fifth-year linebacker Carson Bruener and junior running back Jonah Coleman.\n\n\"This experience and this opportunity, to be the head football coach at the University of Washington, being the first year of joining the Big Ten, is an absolute privilege,\" Fisch said during his opening remarks. \"I don't take it lightly. I'm extremely excited about this opportunity, and believe we have a great football team that will be able to showcase and compete for championships year in and year out.\"\n\nFisch introduced Washington to its new conference, laying out his expectations and goals for the upcoming season on the main stage. Fisch talked about Washington's recent successes against Oregon, Texas and USC -- mentioning those three schools by name -- and Washington's record during the past two seasons.\n\nOf course, Fisch wasn't the coach of the Huskies when they went 25-3 from 2022-23. Those wins all belong to Kalen DeBoer, now at Alabama. Fisch addressed Washington's turnover.\n\nThe Huskies are a massive question mark entering the 2024 season. Fisch said there are 46 new scholarship players on Washington's roster. The coaching, training and strength staffs are completely new. Only 39 players remain from the team which played Michigan in the College Football Playoff championship game on Jan. 8.\n\n\"It's a true reboot, but so is college football,\" Fisch said. \"It is a whole lot of new. Everything we're doing now with revenue share and NIL, with all the changes and the roster size, we believe this is the perfect time to rebrand and reboot.\"\n\nWashington's roster has gone through immense change even since it played its spring game at Husky Stadium on May 3. UW added 14 players during the spring transfer portal period at almost every position. Fisch said his pitch to portal players was simply that Washington was a team in transition, with opportunities for anyone who wanted that chance.\"\n\n\"We're a program that doesn't have a two-deep,\" Fisch said. \"If you want to come and impact the program, you should come. If you feel like you just want to be a part of something that you don't know anything about, and don't know if you'll have a chance to make it, then go somewhere else.\"\n\nWashington's offensive line needed more attention than any other position group. The Huskies lost all five starters from the unit which won the 2023 Joe Moore Award as the best offensive line in college football. During spring practices, UW only had seven scholarship offensive lineman active as junior Gaard Memmelaar and sophomore Landen Hatchett recovered from season-ending injuries.\n\nBut Fisch said he feels good about the group entering fall camp. Washington has 14 scholarship offensive linemen, including three spring portal additions: senior center D'Angalo Titialii, a former Eastside Catholic standout, from Portland State, sixth-year guard Enokk Vimahi from Ohio State and junior tackle Maximus McCree from Iowa Central Community College.\n\n\"I don't know how many more offensive lineman we can play,\" Fisch said. \"Our goal is to let those guys compete. ... We've got 10 guys that are going to be competing their tail off to be one of the five starters.\"\n\nFisch's expectations for the season are fairly simple amid all this change. He said he wants Washington to be competitive, the toughest team on everyone's schedule. Fisch said the coaching staff has told their players \"there is no scoreboard.\"\n\nDuring his first season at Arizona, Fisch endured a 1-11 debut season. He elevated them to 5-7 in 2022 before registering the Wildcats' first 10-win season since 2014 during the 2023 season. Fisch has previously asserted Washington won't be as big of a rebuild, although he did not name any specific targets.\n\n\"We just need to go out there and play our best games,\" Fisch said, \"and see what that looks like.\"", "source": {"uri": "seattletimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Seattle Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andy_yamashita@seattletimes.com", "name": "Andy Yamashita",

His razor sharp-edged voice made people sit up and listen to him.\n\nHowever, his message in Indianapolis on Thursday regarding his initial Husky football team was more slick in presentation than heavy on substance, which is one way you deal with a rebuild.\n\n\"Our expectation is we're going to be the toughest team they play every week and we'll let the score take care of itself,\" Fisch said. \"We're not going to count wins and losses right now and figure out what that looks like -- we tell our team there is no scoreboard. We just need to play our best game and see what that looks like.\"\n\nTranslated, that sounds a lot like he might be bracing for a four- or five-loss season in the Huskies' Big Ten debut with nearly an all-new lineup after the UW celebrated a 14-1 season, which the coach duly noted to his media audience at Lucas Oil Stadium.\n\n\"We have to build that success with a brand-new team, something that's never been done before in college football,\" Fisch said.\n\nPeople at Marshall and a few other college football programs that dealt with past tragedy might disagree with that statement, but his point was taken.\n\nFisch rattled off how he has 36 UW scholarship players returning meshed with 35 transfers from 12 different schools -- and 46 scholarship newcomers in all.\n\n\"It's a total reboot,\" he said, \"but so is all of college football.\"\n\nFisch traveled to the Big Ten event with senior linebacker Carson Bruener, senior safety Kamren Fabiculanan and junior running back Jonah Coleman. They're a week away from opening fall football camp.\n\nSoftening the coming challenge of the rebuild, Fisch noted how the UW has beaten Oregon in its past three meetings and Texas and USC in each of the past two matchups with them.\n\n\"We respect our past, but we're excited about the future,\" the coach said.\n\nInterestingly, the Huskies traveled to Indiana without their starting quarterback, Mississippi State transfer Will Rogers, yet Fisch was asked about him nonetheless.\n\n\"He has 40 starts and he's the son of a coach,\" the UW coach said. \"He has an incredible football mind, football acumen. He played in Coach [Mike] Leach's system for three years and last year played in more of a pro system, playing more under center and with more tight ends. ... He'll be asked to control the line of scrimmage and he'll be really good at that, too.\"\n\nFisch initially was not pressed about his offensive line, which appears to be his biggest unknown, with five new starters coming. However, he spoke about overall physicality, which he expects to emerge from the Huskies.\n\n\"I want our team to be the hardest opponent that anybody plays,\" Fisch said. \"We want our opponents to feel they left that game and played two games in a row.\"", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedd_Fisch", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jedd Fisch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_Oil_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lucas Oil Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Washington", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Washington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Thundering_Herd_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marshall Thundering Herd football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Huskies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington Huskies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_State_Bulldogs_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mississippi State Bulldogs football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_scrimmage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Line of scrimmage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carson,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carson, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Carson, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2603,h_1464,x_0,y_220/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/inside_the_huskies/01j3nd00xd3d6hrq9snc.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764349", "eventUri": "eng-9764349", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

We have four players on our team that recorded one start. We are now starting over and it's a true reboot, but so is college football. It's a whole lot of new.\"\n\nFisch, who replaced former coach Kalen DeBoer, said he brought 12 players and 21 staff members with him from Arizona, where he led the Wildcats to one of the most impressive turnarounds in the sport during his three-year tenure there. Arizona was 1-11 in 2021 but finished last season 10-3 and ranked No. 14 in the College Football Playoff selection committee's final poll and No. 11 in the Associated Press poll. Fisch said his current offensive assistants have coached together for four years and have been together for every game with Fisch as a head coach.\n\n\"So proud those guys were a part of 1-11 to 10-3 transition where we ended up finishing 11th in the country,\" he said. \" ... This group came here at the University of Washington because we believe in Husky football. We believe we have a chance at an opportunity to win championships like we have in the past. This is a program that has won two national championships. This is a program that's won 18 conference championships. And this is a program that we believe will continue on that track.\"\n\nThe question is if the Huskies can maintain it after such sweeping turnover. According to ESPN's Bill Connelly, Washington returns just 36% of its production from last season. That includes just 19% of its offensive production, which is the lowest of all 134 FBS teams. The Huskies will have experience at quarterback, where Mississippi State transfer Will Rogers started 40 games over four seasons. The receiving corps, though, is one of the most depleted in the country, as 10 of the top 11 pass catchers from a year ago are gone. Receiver Giles Jackson is the lone returner, with 106 yards.\n\nWhen asked what realistic expectations are for this season, Fisch said they want to be \"the hardest opponent that everybody plays.\"\n\n\"I want our opponents to feel like they left that game and they played two games in a row,\" he said. \"Our expectation is that we're going to be the toughest team that they play every week, and then from there, we'll let the score take care of itself. \"We're not going to count wins and losses right now and try to figure out what that looks like,\" he said. \"We tell our team there is no scoreboard.

Star quarterback Michael Penix Jr. and others are gone, but Fisch and his staff still feel great about where things stand as the program makes the transition to the Big Ten.\n\nFamiliar matchups against Washington State and Oregon await, as do new tests against the likes of Penn State and Iowa, as well as a title game rematch against Michigan in early October. While pegged to finish No. 10 in Cleveland.com's 2024 Big Ten media poll earlier this week, expectations remain high for UW.\n\nFrom a recruiting aspect, Fisch is looking to take the Huskies to new heights. After inking top-20 classes for three consecutive cycles (2018-2020), Washington has finished inside the top 30 of the On3 Industry Team Recruiting Rankings just once.\n\nThings are looking good so far in the 2025 cycle, as the Huskies currently check in at No. 19 in the nation and No. 6 in the Big Ten. The class features 23 commitments, including seven four-stars.\n\n\"I think recruiting has gone extremely well for us and we're going to continue to build,\" Fisch told On3's Steve Wiltfong on Thursday at Big Ten Media Days. \"I think we're gonna get a few more big hits here soon and a few surprises towards the season. I think we have the chance to have the type of class that we all dream of.\"\n\nCompeting with Oregon in the Pacific Northwest is always a challenge, as is competing with the recruiting titans in the Big Ten on a yearly basis. Fisch, who's previously spent time on staff Michigan, Minnesota, Miami and UCLA, knows what it takes to win a recruiting battle.\n\nWhen looking at his staff, however, Fisch also sees a wave of NFL experience, providing a different angle that some programs can't match. If getting to the next level is your goal, then the Huskies feel they have the best staff in the nation to help you understand what needs to be done to get there. Fisch himself has spent time on seven different NFL staffs since 2002.\n\n\"I think that we have the most access to the NFL of any program in the country. We have the most relationships, we try to be identical to an NFL program in the way we practice, in the way we compete, in the way we talk to our guys and the way we prepare them for the next level,\" he said.\n\n\"We have the privilege of having about 100 years of coaching experience at the next level ... on top of that, I just think that being at Washington right now with the athletics and academics is the greatest place to be.\"\n\nWhen asked how Washington stacks up to other programs in NIL, Fisch was blunt in his response: Some programs have the luxury of having an outpouring of support in that space, and that currently isn't the case with the Huskies. He also knows that that won't be the case for long, as revenue-sharing is on the way to help even things out:\n\n\"We're behind where they are substantially at this point. But we know that when revenue share kicks in we're going to be equal, then we're going to be able to utilize Seattle to our advantage and then hopefully surpass some of them.\"\n\n\"You know, some of these teams are having rosters that are 10 million dollars higher than ours. We've got to find a way to continue to enhance that, but on top of that, understand that when revenue share kicks in, we're all going to be playing with the same cap.\"", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hunter_shelton@on3.com", "name": "Hunter Shelton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Huskies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington Huskies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Penix_Jr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Penix Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalen_DeBoer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kalen DeBoer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_State_Cougars_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington State Cougars football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedd_Fisch", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jedd Fisch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Football_Playoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College Football Playoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Northwest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Northwest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/01/17135104/Jedd-Fisch-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764349", "eventUri": "eng-9764349", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

Marquee-name programs are loading up with experienced additions, including four- and five-star talents, across the four power conferences. That includes in the ACC, where a transfer-bolstered Florida State won the conference title last season while Miami, Louisville, California, North Carolina State and Syracuse all have top-25 transfer classes for this fall. That could represent an added challenge for the Tigers in returning to the top of the league.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The movement between rosters remains steady, except when it comes to inbound traffic toward the South Carolina campus that borders Lake Hartwell.\n\nSwinney has defended his approach almost stubbornly amid questions about the team's lack of portal activity and the risk of falling behind the nation's best. He points to the Tigers luring top-flight classes of high school recruits (Clemson has amassed nine top-10 classes in the past 10 years) and then keeping them around.\n\n\"I said earlier today: If I took a job somewhere else, I'd be the greatest portal recruiter ever because half of my roster would be gone and I'd have to put it together,\" Swinney said. \"But if you study our team, our retention is as good anybody in the country. Guys graduate, they stay, and we recruit.\"\n\nHe can also point to a long run of success that included winning six straight ACC titles with accompanying trips to the College Football Playoff from 2015-20. But as NCAA rules loosened to allow portal movement to grow, Clemson has lost 10 games in the past three seasons -- matching its total for the seven seasons before that -- and last year's 9-4 mark ended a run of 12 straight years with 10 wins or more.\n\nClemson has also won the ACC just once (2022) since that long, dominating run and hasn't made the CFP since the 2020 team that featured No. 1 overall NFL draft pick Trevor Lawrence at quarterback.\n\nMeanwhile, there's a lot of available talent moving throughout the sport.\n\nThe 67 other schools in the Power Four conferences -- the ACC, Big 12, Big Ten and Southeastern -- along with Notre Dame, added 1,063 transfers for the upcoming season at an average of 15.9 per school, according to 247Sports. Roughly 17% of those (179) are considered four-star prospects. Six were five-star additions, with Ohio State landing two, while Alabama, Texas, Oregon and Mississippi got the others.\n\nIn the ACC specifically, schools added an average of 14.8 transfers, with 2.2 of those being four-star talents.\n\nBig Ten\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- When Michigan and Washington arrived at Lucas Oil Stadium on Thursday, it marked the first time they'd been on the same field since January's national championship game.\n\nMuch has changed in six months.\n\nTheir big-name coaches, Jim Harbaugh and Kalen DeBoer, have moved on to new homes in Los Angeles and Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Their strong-armed quarterbacks, J.J. McCarthy and Michael Penix Jr., and workhorse running backs, Blake Corum and Dillon Johnson, are in NFL training camps. Washington even switched conferences.\n\nBut as the Wolverines and Huskies prepare for a new season, there is one common motivator fueling both teams -- getting back to the expanded 12-team playoff and a possible rematch.\n\n\"It's cool,\" Washington quarterback Carson Bruener said when asked about reuniting with Michigan at Lucas Oil Stadium for the final day of the Big Ten's preseason media blitz. \"Unfortunately, we lost (that game) and I was hoping for a win and everyone on the UW side was hoping for a win. We fell short, but that goal is still there.\"\n\nJust how much of an overhaul has there been in the two programs?\n\nConsider that new Huskies coach Jedd Fisch acknowledged Thursday he was rooting for his old boss, Harbaugh, in the title game. Fisch, hired by Washington after three years as Arizona's coach, worked as Michigan's passing game coordinator in 2015 and '16.\n\nOf course, back then, Fisch couldn't have predicted he'd be here, leading the other team.\n\nFisch brought 21 staff members with him from Arizona and added 46 new scholarship players. Bruener, the son of former NFL tight end Mark Bruener, is expected to replace Penix behind center, and with only one returning starter, Fisch knows the odds are stacked against him.\n\nFirst-time head coach Sherrone Moore faces his own daunting challenge in Ann Arbor.\n\nThe Wolverines started the offseason with five returning starters, then lost all-conference safety Rod Moore to a torn ACL in spring practice. While the most glaring need is finding someone to replace McCarthy, another pressing concern is finding five new starters on an offensive line that lost its top six players to the NFL.\n\n0 Comments

Their strong-armed quarterbacks, J.J. McCarthy and Michael Penix Jr., and workhorse running backs, Blake Corum and Dillon Johnson, are in NFL training camps. Washington even switched conferences.\n\nBut as the Wolverines and Huskies prepare for a new season, there is one common motivator fueling both teams -- getting back to the expanded 12-team playoff and a possible rematch.\n\n\"It's cool,\" Washington quarterback Carson Bruener said when asked about reuniting with Michigan at Lucas Oil Stadium for the final day of the Big Ten's preseason media blitz. \"Unfortunately, we lost (that game) and I was hoping for a win and everyone on the UW side was hoping for a win. We fell short, but that goal is still there.\"\n\nJust how much of an overhaul has there been in the two programs?\n\nConsider that new Huskies coach Jedd Fisch acknowledged Thursday he was rooting for his old boss, Harbaugh, in the title game. Fisch, hired by Washington after three years as Arizona's coach, worked as Michigan's passing game coordinator in 2015 and '16.\n\nOf course, back then, Fisch couldn't have predicted he'd be here, leading the other team.\n\n\"I hope nobody took any pictures of how I was dressed for the national championship game and holds it against me in Seattle,\" Fisch said, drawing laughter. \"My wife and I are very close with Jim and (his wife) Sarah, and I talked to him the day of the game. I talked to him the morning after, and I didn't have any expectation of coaching at Washington.\"\n\nNow, Fisch finds himself leading a big rebuild a program record-tying 10 Huskies were drafted in April.\n\nFisch brought 21 staff members with him from Arizona and added 46 new scholarship players. Bruener, the son of former NFL tight end Mark Bruener, is expected to replace Penix behind center, and with only one returning starter, Fisch knows the odds are stacked against him.\n\n\"It's never been done before, and we're excited about that challenge,\" he said. \"We have four players on our team that recorded one start. It's a true reboot, but so is college football. It is a whole lot of new.\"\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nFirst-time head coach Sherrone Moore faces his own daunting challenge in Ann Arbor.\n\nThe Wolverines started the offseason with five returning starters, then lost all-conference safety Rod Moore to a torn ACL in spring practice. While the most glaring need is finding someone to replace McCarthy, another pressing concern is finding five new starters on an offensive line that lost its top six players to the NFL.\n\nStill, Moore isn't about to start lowering the expectations at Michigan, which has an FBS-leading 1,004 all-time wins -- and certainly not after the Wolverines won their first national championship since 1997. He's challenging his players to repeat the feat.\n\n\"We're always hunting regardless of whether people are coming after us or we're coming after them. We're not in the mentality of sitting back and waiting to see what goes on, we're going to attack our process,\" he said. \"I think every year, our goal is to win (the title). When you're at Michigan, that should be your goal every single year.\"\n\nThursday won't be the last time these teams meet, either.\n\nThey'll square off in a rematch on Oct. 5 in Seattle, a game the Huskies have been anticipating for months.\n\n\"I've got that date circled on my calendar, but we can't overlook any opponent,\" Washington safety Kamryn Fabiculanan said.\n\nWith a little luck, Washington and Michigan could come back to Indianapolis for the Big Ten title game on Dec. 7. And if they play as well as they did in 2023, perhaps there could be a playoff rematch.\n\nBut getting back will be much trickier with new coaches and without the veterans who took them to the title game.\n\n\"Team 145 has really done a really good job up to this point in taking the necessary steps to be elite, to do all the things that we set out to do -- win the big games, beat our rivals, beat Ohio State, win the Big Ten, go to College Football Playoff and win it,\" Moore said. \"For us, that's something we strive to do.\"\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

You had 13 of those guys playing in the NFL right now.

Such is the case for Washington as it heads to the Big Ten.\n\nThe Huskies will still have lofty expectations, of course. You don't go from the national championship game to suddenly being OK with only a bowl win, for example.\n\n\"We had to teach them what we would expect on a daily basis,\" Jedd Fisch said. \"And they've embraced it. They've worked extremely hard together. They've found a way to really open up their arms and embrace all the different type of players we brought in from all the different communities.\"\n\nThe Huskies will have the luxury of a coach who has already proven he can engineer a tough turnaround.

And if they play as well as they did in 2023, perhaps there could be a playoff rematch.\n\nBut getting back will be much trickier with new coaches and without the veterans who took them to the title game.\n\n\"Team 145 has really done a really good job up to this point in taking the necessary steps to be elite, to do all the things that we set out to do -- win the big games, beat our rivals, beat Ohio State, win the Big Ten, go to College Football Playoff and win it,\" Moore said. \"For us, that's something we strive to do.\"\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

Marquee-name programs are loading up with experienced additions, including four- and five-star talents, across the four power conferences. That includes in the ACC, where a transfer-bolstered Florida State won the conference title last season while Miami, Louisville, California, North Carolina State and Syracuse all have top-25 transfer classes for this fall. That could represent an added challenge for the Tigers in returning to the top of the league.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The movement between rosters remains steady, except when it comes to inbound traffic toward the South Carolina campus that borders Lake Hartwell.\n\nSwinney has defended his approach almost stubbornly amid questions about the team's lack of portal activity and the risk of falling behind the nation's best. He points to the Tigers luring top-flight classes of high school recruits (Clemson has amassed nine top-10 classes in the past 10 years) and then keeping them around.\n\n\"I said earlier today: If I took a job somewhere else, I'd be the greatest portal recruiter ever because half of my roster would be gone and I'd have to put it together,\" Swinney said. \"But if you study our team, our retention is as good anybody in the country. Guys graduate, they stay, and we recruit.\"\n\nHe can also point to a long run of success that included winning six straight ACC titles with accompanying trips to the College Football Playoff from 2015-20. But as NCAA rules loosened to allow portal movement to grow, Clemson has lost 10 games in the past three seasons -- matching its total for the seven seasons before that -- and last year's 9-4 mark ended a run of 12 straight years with 10 wins or more.\n\nClemson has also won the ACC just once (2022) since that long, dominating run and hasn't made the CFP since the 2020 team that featured No. 1 overall NFL draft pick Trevor Lawrence at quarterback.\n\nMeanwhile, there's a lot of available talent moving throughout the sport.\n\nThe 67 other schools in the Power Four conferences -- the ACC, Big 12, Big Ten and Southeastern -- along with Notre Dame, added 1,063 transfers for the upcoming season at an average of 15.9 per school, according to 247Sports. Roughly 17% of those (179) are considered four-star prospects. Six were five-star additions, with Ohio State landing two, while Alabama, Texas, Oregon and Mississippi got the others.\n\nIn the ACC specifically, schools added an average of 14.8 transfers, with 2.2 of those being four-star talents.\n\nBig Ten\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- When Michigan and Washington arrived at Lucas Oil Stadium on Thursday, it marked the first time they'd been on the same field since January's national championship game.\n\nMuch has changed in six months.\n\nTheir big-name coaches, Jim Harbaugh and Kalen DeBoer, have moved on to new homes in Los Angeles and Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Their strong-armed quarterbacks, J.J. McCarthy and Michael Penix Jr., and workhorse running backs, Blake Corum and Dillon Johnson, are in NFL training camps. Washington even switched conferences.\n\nBut as the Wolverines and Huskies prepare for a new season, there is one common motivator fueling both teams -- getting back to the expanded 12-team playoff and a possible rematch.\n\n\"It's cool,\" Washington quarterback Carson Bruener said when asked about reuniting with Michigan at Lucas Oil Stadium for the final day of the Big Ten's preseason media blitz. \"Unfortunately, we lost (that game) and I was hoping for a win and everyone on the UW side was hoping for a win. We fell short, but that goal is still there.\"\n\nJust how much of an overhaul has there been in the two programs?\n\nConsider that new Huskies coach Jedd Fisch acknowledged Thursday he was rooting for his old boss, Harbaugh, in the title game. Fisch, hired by Washington after three years as Arizona's coach, worked as Michigan's passing game coordinator in 2015 and '16.\n\nOf course, back then, Fisch couldn't have predicted he'd be here, leading the other team.\n\nFisch brought 21 staff members with him from Arizona and added 46 new scholarship players. Bruener, the son of former NFL tight end Mark Bruener, is expected to replace Penix behind center, and with only one returning starter, Fisch knows the odds are stacked against him.\n\nFirst-time head coach Sherrone Moore faces his own daunting challenge in Ann Arbor.\n\nThe Wolverines started the offseason with five returning starters, then lost all-conference safety Rod Moore to a torn ACL in spring practice. While the most glaring need is finding someone to replace McCarthy, another pressing concern is finding five new starters on an offensive line that lost its top six players to the NFL.\n\n0 Comments

Marquee-name programs are loading up with experienced additions, including four- and five-star talents, across the four power conferences. That includes in the ACC, where a transfer-bolstered Florida State won the conference title last season while Miami, Louisville, California, North Carolina State and Syracuse all have top-25 transfer classes for this fall. That could represent an added challenge for the Tigers in returning to the top of the league.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The movement between rosters remains steady, except when it comes to inbound traffic toward the South Carolina campus that borders Lake Hartwell.\n\nSwinney has defended his approach almost stubbornly amid questions about the team's lack of portal activity and the risk of falling behind the nation's best. He points to the Tigers luring top-flight classes of high school recruits (Clemson has amassed nine top-10 classes in the past 10 years) and then keeping them around.\n\n\"I said earlier today: If I took a job somewhere else, I'd be the greatest portal recruiter ever because half of my roster would be gone and I'd have to put it together,\" Swinney said. \"But if you study our team, our retention is as good anybody in the country. Guys graduate, they stay, and we recruit.\"\n\nHe can also point to a long run of success that included winning six straight ACC titles with accompanying trips to the College Football Playoff from 2015-20. But as NCAA rules loosened to allow portal movement to grow, Clemson has lost 10 games in the past three seasons -- matching its total for the seven seasons before that -- and last year's 9-4 mark ended a run of 12 straight years with 10 wins or more.\n\nClemson has also won the ACC just once (2022) since that long, dominating run and hasn't made the CFP since the 2020 team that featured No. 1 overall NFL draft pick Trevor Lawrence at quarterback.\n\nMeanwhile, there's a lot of available talent moving throughout the sport.\n\nThe 67 other schools in the Power Four conferences -- the ACC, Big 12, Big Ten and Southeastern -- along with Notre Dame, added 1,063 transfers for the upcoming season at an average of 15.9 per school, according to 247Sports. Roughly 17% of those (179) are considered four-star prospects. Six were five-star additions, with Ohio State landing two, while Alabama, Texas, Oregon and Mississippi got the others.\n\nIn the ACC specifically, schools added an average of 14.8 transfers, with 2.2 of those being four-star talents.\n\nBig Ten\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- When Michigan and Washington arrived at Lucas Oil Stadium on Thursday, it marked the first time they'd been on the same field since January's national championship game.\n\nMuch has changed in six months.\n\nTheir big-name coaches, Jim Harbaugh and Kalen DeBoer, have moved on to new homes in Los Angeles and Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Their strong-armed quarterbacks, J.J. McCarthy and Michael Penix Jr., and workhorse running backs, Blake Corum and Dillon Johnson, are in NFL training camps. Washington even switched conferences.\n\nBut as the Wolverines and Huskies prepare for a new season, there is one common motivator fueling both teams -- getting back to the expanded 12-team playoff and a possible rematch.\n\n\"It's cool,\" Washington quarterback Carson Bruener said when asked about reuniting with Michigan at Lucas Oil Stadium for the final day of the Big Ten's preseason media blitz. \"Unfortunately, we lost (that game) and I was hoping for a win and everyone on the UW side was hoping for a win. We fell short, but that goal is still there.\"\n\nJust how much of an overhaul has there been in the two programs?\n\nConsider that new Huskies coach Jedd Fisch acknowledged Thursday he was rooting for his old boss, Harbaugh, in the title game. Fisch, hired by Washington after three years as Arizona's coach, worked as Michigan's passing game coordinator in 2015 and '16.\n\nOf course, back then, Fisch couldn't have predicted he'd be here, leading the other team.\n\nFisch brought 21 staff members with him from Arizona and added 46 new scholarship players. Bruener, the son of former NFL tight end Mark Bruener, is expected to replace Penix behind center, and with only one returning starter, Fisch knows the odds are stacked against him.\n\nFirst-time head coach Sherrone Moore faces his own daunting challenge in Ann Arbor.\n\nThe Wolverines started the offseason with five returning starters, then lost all-conference safety Rod Moore to a torn ACL in spring practice. While the most glaring need is finding someone to replace McCarthy, another pressing concern is finding five new starters on an offensive line that lost its top six players to the NFL.\n\n0 Comments

While the most glaring need is finding someone to replace McCarthy, another pressing concern is finding five new starters on an offensive line that lost its top six players to the NFL.\n\nStill, Moore isn't about to start lowering the expectations at Michigan, which has an FBS-leading 1,004 all-time wins -- and certainly not after the Wolverines won their first national championship since 1997. He's challenging his players to repeat the feat.\n\n\"We're always hunting regardless of whether people are coming after us or we're coming after them. We're not in the mentality of sitting back and waiting to see what goes on, we're going to attack our process,\" he said. \"I think every year, our goal is to win (the title). When you're at Michigan, that should be your goal every single year.\"\n\nThursday won't be the last time these teams meet, either.\n\nThey'll square off in a rematch on Oct. 5 in Seattle, a game the Huskies have been anticipating for months.\n\n\"I've got that date circled on my calendar, but we can't overlook any opponent,\" Washington safety Kamryn Fabiculanan said.\n\nWith a little luck, Washington and Michigan could come back to Indianapolis for the Big Ten title game on Dec. 7. And if they play as well as they did in 2023, perhaps there could be a playoff rematch.\n\nBut getting back will be much trickier with new coaches and without the veterans who took them to the title game.\n\n\"Team 145 has really done a really good job up to this point in taking the necessary steps to be elite, to do all the things that we set out to do -- win the big games, beat our rivals, beat Ohio State, win the Big Ten, go to College Football Playoff and win it,\" Moore said. \"For us, that's something we strive to do.\"\n\n___\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

The movement between rosters remains steady, except when it comes to inbound traffic toward the South Carolina campus that borders Lake Hartwell.\n\nSwinney has defended his approach almost stubbornly amid questions about the team's lack of portal activity and the risk of falling behind the nation's best. He points to the Tigers luring top-flight classes of high school recruits (Clemson has amassed nine top-10 classes in the past 10 years) and then keeping them around.\n\n\"I said earlier today: If I took a job somewhere else, I'd be the greatest portal recruiter ever because half of my roster would be gone and I'd have to put it together,\" Swinney said. \"But if you study our team, our retention is as good anybody in the country. Guys graduate, they stay, and we recruit.\"\n\nHe can also point to a long run of success that included winning six straight ACC titles with accompanying trips to the College Football Playoff from 2015-20. But as NCAA rules loosened to allow portal movement to grow, Clemson has lost 10 games in the past three seasons -- matching its total for the seven seasons before that -- and last year's 9-4 mark ended a run of 12 straight years with 10 wins or more.\n\nClemson has also won the ACC just once (2022) since that long, dominating run and hasn't made the CFP since the 2020 team that featured No. 1 overall NFL draft pick Trevor Lawrence at quarterback.\n\nMeanwhile, there's a lot of available talent moving throughout the sport.\n\nThe 67 other schools in the Power Four conferences -- the ACC, Big 12, Big Ten and Southeastern -- along with Notre Dame, added 1,063 transfers for the upcoming season at an average of 15.9 per school, according to 247Sports. Roughly 17% of those (179) are considered four-star prospects. Six were five-star additions, with Ohio State landing two, while Alabama, Texas, Oregon and Mississippi got the others.\n\nIn the ACC specifically, schools added an average of 14.8 transfers, with 2.2 of those being four-star talents.\n\nBig Ten\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- When Michigan and Washington arrived at Lucas Oil Stadium on Thursday, it marked the first time they'd been on the same field since January's national championship game.\n\nMuch has changed in six months.\n\nTheir big-name coaches, Jim Harbaugh and Kalen DeBoer, have moved on to new homes in Los Angeles and Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Their strong-armed quarterbacks, J.J. McCarthy and Michael Penix Jr., and workhorse running backs, Blake Corum and Dillon Johnson, are in NFL training camps. Washington even switched conferences.\n\nBut as the Wolverines and Huskies prepare for a new season, there is one common motivator fueling both teams -- getting back to the expanded 12-team playoff and a possible rematch.\n\n\"It's cool,\" Washington quarterback Carson Bruener said when asked about reuniting with Michigan at Lucas Oil Stadium for the final day of the Big Ten's preseason media blitz. \"Unfortunately, we lost (that game) and I was hoping for a win and everyone on the UW side was hoping for a win. We fell short, but that goal is still there.\"\n\nJust how much of an overhaul has there been in the two programs?\n\nConsider that new Huskies coach Jedd Fisch acknowledged Thursday he was rooting for his old boss, Harbaugh, in the title game. Fisch, hired by Washington after three years as Arizona's coach, worked as Michigan's passing game coordinator in 2015 and '16.\n\nOf course, back then, Fisch couldn't have predicted he'd be here, leading the other team.\n\nFisch brought 21 staff members with him from Arizona and added 46 new scholarship players. Bruener, the son of former NFL tight end Mark Bruener, is expected to replace Penix behind center, and with only one returning starter, Fisch knows the odds are stacked against him.\n\nFirst-time head coach Sherrone Moore faces his own daunting challenge in Ann Arbor.\n\nThe Wolverines started the offseason with five returning starters, then lost all-conference safety Rod Moore to a torn ACL in spring practice. While the most glaring need is finding someone to replace McCarthy, another pressing concern is finding five new starters on an offensive line that lost its top six players to the NFL.\n\nBe the first

Marquee-name programs are loading up with experienced additions, including four- and five-star talents, across the four power conferences. That includes in the ACC, where a transfer-bolstered Florida State won the conference title last season while Miami, Louisville, California, North Carolina State and Syracuse all have top-25 transfer classes for this fall. That could represent an added challenge for the Tigers in returning to the top of the league.\n\nCardinals' TV ratings on record-low pace amid continuing distribution problems: Media Views Tammie Holland, longtime St. Louis radio personality, dies at 53 Third bear sighting reported in southern Illinois, sheriff says Ranch in Wildwood is sanctuary for abused miniature horses Woman from Valley Park drowns in Big River trying to help another canoeist Former St. Louis Rams lineman ordered to pay $500,000 to injured worker Kohn's Kosher Deli facing lawsuit of nearly $150,000 O'Fallon, Mo., woman charged with making politically motivated false child sex abuse claim Messenger: A disturbing twist in the case of security guards who tackled BJC patient Messenger: He fixed up his mobile home. He made it too nice. The city wants him out. St. Louis Public Schools halts hiring over questions on new administrator from Texas BenFred: So, you're looking to trade with the Cardinals. Who are you (realistically) targeting? BenFred: Smart contract stance lets Cardinals be nimble as Goldschmidt tries to salvage season Ankle injury interrupts Tommy Edman's rehab games, delays his return: Cardinals Extra Lawsuit accuses Archdiocese of St. Louis of allowing clergy to abuse children\n\n\"In the past, pre-portal, you would look into the junior-college areas, sometimes find a transfer that was a (graduate) to fill a spot where maybe you had an injury or player left early to go to the NFL,\" Wolfpack coach Dave Doeren said. \"Obviously now there's outflow and inflow coming in at different times differently than there ever has been.\"\n\nAt minimum, it has made it easier for coaches to bolster talented rosters or quickly turn around programs after taking over a new job. The movement between rosters remains steady, except when it comes to inbound traffic toward the South Carolina campus that borders Lake Hartwell.\n\nSwinney has defended his approach almost stubbornly amid questions about the team's lack of portal activity and the risk of falling behind the nation's best. He points to the Tigers luring top-flight classes of high school recruits (Clemson has amassed nine top-10 classes in the past 10 years) and then keeping them around.\n\n\"I said earlier today: If I took a job somewhere else, I'd be the greatest portal recruiter ever because half of my roster would be gone and I'd have to put it together,\" Swinney said. \"But if you study our team, our retention is as good anybody in the country. Guys graduate, they stay, and we recruit.\"\n\nHe can also point to a long run of success that included winning six straight ACC titles with accompanying trips to the College Football Playoff from 2015-20. But as NCAA rules loosened to allow portal movement to grow, Clemson has lost 10 games in the past three seasons -- matching its total for the seven seasons before that -- and last year's 9-4 mark ended a run of 12 straight years with 10 wins or more.\n\nClemson has also won the ACC just once (2022) since that long, dominating run and hasn't made the CFP since the 2020 team that featured No. 1 overall NFL draft pick Trevor Lawrence at quarterback.\n\nMeanwhile, there's a lot of available talent moving throughout the sport.\n\nThe 67 other schools in the Power Four conferences -- the ACC, Big 12, Big Ten and Southeastern -- along with Notre Dame, added 1,063 transfers for the upcoming season at an average of 15.9 per school, according to 247Sports. Roughly 17% of those (179) are considered four-star prospects. Six were five-star additions, with Ohio State landing two, while Alabama, Texas, Oregon and Mississippi got the others.\n\nIn the ACC specifically, schools added an average of 14.8 transfers, with 2.2 of those being four-star talents.\n\nBig Ten\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- When Michigan and Washington arrived at Lucas Oil Stadium on Thursday, it marked the first time they'd been on the same field since January's national championship game.\n\nMuch has changed in six months.\n\nTheir big-name coaches, Jim Harbaugh and Kalen DeBoer, have moved on to new homes in Los Angeles and Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Their strong-armed quarterbacks, J.J. McCarthy and Michael Penix Jr., and workhorse running backs, Blake Corum and Dillon Johnson, are in NFL training camps. Washington even switched conferences.\n\nBut as the Wolverines and Huskies prepare for a new season, there is one common motivator fueling both teams -- getting back to the expanded 12-team playoff and a possible rematch.\n\n\"It's cool,\" Washington quarterback Carson Bruener said when asked about reuniting with Michigan at Lucas Oil Stadium for the final day of the Big Ten's preseason media blitz. \"Unfortunately, we lost (that game) and I was hoping for a win and everyone on the UW side was hoping for a win. We fell short, but that goal is still there.\"\n\nJust how much of an overhaul has there been in the two programs?\n\nConsider that new Huskies coach Jedd Fisch acknowledged Thursday he was rooting for his old boss, Harbaugh, in the title game. Fisch, hired by Washington after three years as Arizona's coach, worked as Michigan's passing game coordinator in 2015 and '16.\n\nOf course, back then, Fisch couldn't have predicted he'd be here, leading the other team.\n\nFisch brought 21 staff members with him from Arizona and added 46 new scholarship players. Bruener, the son of former NFL tight end Mark Bruener, is expected to replace Penix behind center, and with only one returning starter, Fisch knows the odds are stacked against him.\n\nFirst-time head coach Sherrone Moore faces his own daunting challenge in Ann Arbor.\n\nThe Wolverines started the offseason with five returning starters, then lost all-conference safety Rod Moore to a torn ACL in spring practice. While the most glaring need is finding someone to replace McCarthy, another pressing concern is finding five new starters on an offensive line that lost its top six players to the NFL.\n\n0 Comments",

The movement between rosters remains steady, except when it comes to inbound traffic toward the South Carolina campus that borders Lake Hartwell.\n\nSwinney has defended his approach almost stubbornly amid questions about the team's lack of portal activity and the risk of falling behind the nation's best. He points to the Tigers luring top-flight classes of high school recruits (Clemson has amassed nine top-10 classes in the past 10 years) and then keeping them around.\n\n\"I said earlier today: If I took a job somewhere else, I'd be the greatest portal recruiter ever because half of my roster would be gone and I'd have to put it together,\" Swinney said. \"But if you study our team, our retention is as good anybody in the country. Guys graduate, they stay, and we recruit.\"\n\nHe can also point to a long run of success that included winning six straight ACC titles with accompanying trips to the College Football Playoff from 2015-20. But as NCAA rules loosened to allow portal movement to grow, Clemson has lost 10 games in the past three seasons -- matching its total for the seven seasons before that -- and last year's 9-4 mark ended a run of 12 straight years with 10 wins or more.\n\nClemson has also won the ACC just once (2022) since that long, dominating run and hasn't made the CFP since the 2020 team that featured No. 1 overall NFL draft pick Trevor Lawrence at quarterback.\n\nMeanwhile, there's a lot of available talent moving throughout the sport.\n\nThe 67 other schools in the Power Four conferences -- the ACC, Big 12, Big Ten and Southeastern -- along with Notre Dame, added 1,063 transfers for the upcoming season at an average of 15.9 per school, according to 247Sports. Roughly 17% of those (179) are considered four-star prospects. Six were five-star additions, with Ohio State landing two, while Alabama, Texas, Oregon and Mississippi got the others.\n\nIn the ACC specifically, schools added an average of 14.8 transfers, with 2.2 of those being four-star talents.\n\nBig Ten\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- When Michigan and Washington arrived at Lucas Oil Stadium on Thursday, it marked the first time they'd been on the same field since January's national championship game.\n\nMuch has changed in six months.\n\nTheir big-name coaches, Jim Harbaugh and Kalen DeBoer, have moved on to new homes in Los Angeles and Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Their strong-armed quarterbacks, J.J. McCarthy and Michael Penix Jr., and workhorse running backs, Blake Corum and Dillon Johnson, are in NFL training camps. Washington even switched conferences.\n\nBut as the Wolverines and Huskies prepare for a new season, there is one common motivator fueling both teams -- getting back to the expanded 12-team playoff and a possible rematch.\n\n\"It's cool,\" Washington quarterback Carson Bruener said when asked about reuniting with Michigan at Lucas Oil Stadium for the final day of the Big Ten's preseason media blitz. \"Unfortunately, we lost (that game) and I was hoping for a win and everyone on the UW side was hoping for a win. We fell short, but that goal is still there.\"\n\nJust how much of an overhaul has there been in the two programs?\n\nConsider that new Huskies coach Jedd Fisch acknowledged Thursday he was rooting for his old boss, Harbaugh, in the title game. Fisch, hired by Washington after three years as Arizona's coach, worked as Michigan's passing game coordinator in 2015 and '16.\n\nOf course, back then, Fisch couldn't have predicted he'd be here, leading the other team.\n\nFisch brought 21 staff members with him from Arizona and added 46 new scholarship players. Bruener, the son of former NFL tight end Mark Bruener, is expected to replace Penix behind center, and with only one returning starter, Fisch knows the odds are stacked against him.\n\nFirst-time head coach Sherrone Moore faces his own daunting challenge in Ann Arbor.\n\nThe Wolverines started the offseason with five returning starters, then lost all-conference safety Rod Moore to a torn ACL in spring practice. While the most glaring need is finding someone to replace McCarthy, another pressing concern is finding five new starters on an offensive line that lost its top six players to the NFL.\n\nBe the first

Marquee-name programs are loading up with experienced additions, including four- and five-star talents, across the four power conferences. That includes in the ACC, where a transfer-bolstered Florida State won the conference title last season while Miami, Louisville, California, North Carolina State and Syracuse all have top-25 transfer classes for this fall. That could represent an added challenge for the Tigers in returning to the top of the league.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nTwo dead following Sunday night two-vehicle accident in Sioux City's westside Woodbury County Court Report for July 22, 2024 Specialty dog boutique store, Urban Mutts, opens in Sioux City Jason's Frozen Treats open second dine-in ice cream parlor BNSF Railway wants to remove collapsed Big Sioux River train bridge One dead after early Saturday morning collision in Sioux City Sioux City substitute teachers to receive extra pay for outside of normal day work Iowa nursing home resident suffocated while trapped in bed rails, state says Marriage licenses for Woodbury County for July 23, 2024 River-Cade crowns 2024 Queen of the River and princesses in Sioux City ceremony UPDATED: Okoboji lakes fall below target for lifting boat speeding limits Sioux City man charged with sexually abusing minor Woman's body recovered from overturned Jeep in Sac County river State baseball: Scrapy dynamic duo sends Crusaders to state title game, down top seed Wahlert Postmaster concerned about dogs in Ingleside Avenue area biting mail carriers\n\n\"In the past, pre-portal, you would look into the junior-college areas, sometimes find a transfer that was a (graduate) to fill a spot where maybe you had an injury or player left early to go to the NFL,\" Wolfpack coach Dave Doeren said. \"Obviously now there's outflow and inflow coming in at different times differently than there ever has been.\"\n\nAt minimum, it has made it easier for coaches to bolster talented rosters or quickly turn around programs after taking over a new job. The movement between rosters remains steady, except when it comes to inbound traffic toward the South Carolina campus that borders Lake Hartwell.\n\nSwinney has defended his approach almost stubbornly amid questions about the team's lack of portal activity and the risk of falling behind the nation's best. He points to the Tigers luring top-flight classes of high school recruits (Clemson has amassed nine top-10 classes in the past 10 years) and then keeping them around.\n\n\"I said earlier today: If I took a job somewhere else, I'd be the greatest portal recruiter ever because half of my roster would be gone and I'd have to put it together,\" Swinney said. \"But if you study our team, our retention is as good anybody in the country. Guys graduate, they stay, and we recruit.\"\n\nHe can also point to a long run of success that included winning six straight ACC titles with accompanying trips to the College Football Playoff from 2015-20. But as NCAA rules loosened to allow portal movement to grow, Clemson has lost 10 games in the past three seasons -- matching its total for the seven seasons before that -- and last year's 9-4 mark ended a run of 12 straight years with 10 wins or more.\n\nClemson has also won the ACC just once (2022) since that long, dominating run and hasn't made the CFP since the 2020 team that featured No. 1 overall NFL draft pick Trevor Lawrence at quarterback.\n\nMeanwhile, there's a lot of available talent moving throughout the sport.\n\nThe 67 other schools in the Power Four conferences -- the ACC, Big 12, Big Ten and Southeastern -- along with Notre Dame, added 1,063 transfers for the upcoming season at an average of 15.9 per school, according to 247Sports. Roughly 17% of those (179) are considered four-star prospects. Six were five-star additions, with Ohio State landing two, while Alabama, Texas, Oregon and Mississippi got the others.\n\nIn the ACC specifically, schools added an average of 14.8 transfers, with 2.2 of those being four-star talents.\n\nBig Ten\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- When Michigan and Washington arrived at Lucas Oil Stadium on Thursday, it marked the first time they'd been on the same field since January's national championship game.\n\nMuch has changed in six months.\n\nTheir big-name coaches, Jim Harbaugh and Kalen DeBoer, have moved on to new homes in Los Angeles and Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Their strong-armed quarterbacks, J.J. McCarthy and Michael Penix Jr., and workhorse running backs, Blake Corum and Dillon Johnson, are in NFL training camps. Washington even switched conferences.\n\nBut as the Wolverines and Huskies prepare for a new season, there is one common motivator fueling both teams -- getting back to the expanded 12-team playoff and a possible rematch.\n\n\"It's cool,\" Washington quarterback Carson Bruener said when asked about reuniting with Michigan at Lucas Oil Stadium for the final day of the Big Ten's preseason media blitz. \"Unfortunately, we lost (that game) and I was hoping for a win and everyone on the UW side was hoping for a win. We fell short, but that goal is still there.\"\n\nJust how much of an overhaul has there been in the two programs?\n\nConsider that new Huskies coach Jedd Fisch acknowledged Thursday he was rooting for his old boss, Harbaugh, in the title game. Fisch, hired by Washington after three years as Arizona's coach, worked as Michigan's passing game coordinator in 2015 and '16.\n\nOf course, back then, Fisch couldn't have predicted he'd be here, leading the other team.\n\nFisch brought 21 staff members with him from Arizona and added 46 new scholarship players. Bruener, the son of former NFL tight end Mark Bruener, is expected to replace Penix behind center, and with only one returning starter, Fisch knows the odds are stacked against him.\n\nFirst-time head coach Sherrone Moore faces his own daunting challenge in Ann Arbor.\n\nThe Wolverines started the offseason with five returning starters, then lost all-conference safety Rod Moore to a torn ACL in spring practice. While the most glaring need is finding someone to replace McCarthy, another pressing concern is finding five new starters on an offensive line that lost its top six players to the NFL.\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or

Almog Meir Jan, 22, was held in Gaza for eight months after being kidnapped from the Nova music festival on 7 October. He was one of four hostages who were rescued from central Gaza on Saturday, in an air and ground raid that also killed scores of Palestinians. In the months before Almog's release, the health of his father Yossi deteriorated and he was \"glued to the television\", his sister Dina told Israeli broadcaster Kan. \"He was worried that he (Almog) was in the hands of murderers and about what was happening to him and what he was going through,\" Ms Jan said. Yossi Jan is believed to have died of a heart attack. \u201cMy brother died of grief and didn\u2019t get to see his son return,\" Dina Jan said. The rescue of Almog Jan and three other hostages was met with jubilation and relief in Israel, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netyanhu praised special forces for operating \"creatively and bravely\". But the humanitarian toll of the operation, which included a barrage of Israeli airstrikes, has sparked condemnation.", "summary": "Yossi Jan's health deteriorated over the eight months his sun was held hostage in Gaza, relatives say", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3ggz960040o", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/864a/live/ae7badd0-2668-11ef-80aa-699d54c46324.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:36:13", "author": "Jake Lapham", "authors": ["Jake Lapham"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.295}

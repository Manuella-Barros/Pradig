This weekend, ABC will air a four-episode series that goes behind the scenes with Clark, the No. 1 pick of the Indiana Fever; South Carolina All-American Kamilla Cardoso, now a rookie with the Chicago Sky; and UCLA super sophomore Kiki Rice. With support from Peyton Manning's Omaha Productions, ESPN's cameras were given unparalleled access, embedded with the three players all season. The result is a compelling four-hour series that is likely to bring more new fans to the game.\n\nPeople will tune in for Clark, a generational talent who's helped draw thousands - millions? - of new eyeballs to women's basketball. She knows it, too. In the first episode, Clark talks about feeling \"a responsibility to lead the women's game,\" heady stuff for a 22-year-old.\n\nAnd while viewers will see a side of Clark typically closed off to outsiders - her boyfriend is featured heavily and interviewed numerous times - the most compelling parts of the series feature Cardoso, who left her poverty-stricken family in Brazil in hopes of going pro and changing their future financially. (UCLA's Rice is a somewhat odd fit at times, mostly because she's two years behind Clark and Cardoso, but her inclusion gives newcomers one more name to follow throughout college.)\n\nCardoso's story in particular will likely make viewers ache. When her national team, Brazil, is knocked out of its Olympic-qualifying tournament, Cardoso is inconsolable. Her emotion is raw, real and heartbreaking. (Cardoso was recently injured in Chicago's first preseason game and will be re-evaluated in four to six weeks.)\n\nThe series will broadcast first on ABC, with Episodes 1 and 2 airing at 1 p.m. ET Saturday - a lead-in to that day's NBA playoff coverage - and Episodes 3 and 4 airing at 12:30 p.m. ET Sunday. All episodes will be available to stream on ESPN+ as well.\n\nBrian Lockhart, the senior vice president of original content and ESPN films, told USA TODAY Sports that \"when we can provide (viewers) with stakes and characters, that's when you get real investment.\" As Lockhart sees it, while women's sports continue to grow in popularity, casual fans need this type of storytelling to become even more connected to the game.\n\nHe's seen it firsthand in other sports. Lockhart compared the rise of women's hoops and its potential to dominate the airwaves with UFC's recent explosion.\n\n\"When I first came over to ESPN+ (in 2019), UFC was a big thing but as a business, ESPN and ESPN+ said, 'Let's go all in,' \" Lockhart said. \"And when ESPN gets behind something and gives it the platform, the storytelling and the news and information (power), I think those three pillars, when we put those together, it can turn something that's known into something you can't live without.\"\n\nThe series was directed by Kristen Lappas, whose other projects include \"Dream On,\" a documentary chronicling the 1996 U.S. Olympic women's basketball team and its role in helping launch the WNBA, and \"Blackfeet Boxing: Not Invisible,\" which earned Lappas an Emmy.\n\nShe said she's optimistic that viewers will learn from the series, especially if they're new to women's sports, that \"the women's game has the same intensity, it's not a softer product.\" She's also hopeful it will spark more people to want - even demand - stories that center on women athletes.\n\n\"The access we got (for \"Full Court Press\") was unlike anything I've ever experienced,\" Lappas said. \"Coaches were saying to us, 'we want people to see inside our program; we want to grow the game.'\n\n\"And that is the hope, right? That this series draws more people to games, more people to the sport. There's this entire untapped world of stories, past generations and present generation ... and I think right now, people are craving more female storytelling.\"\n\nNo argument here. In fact, as I finished the series, I only had one question.\n\nHow soon can they start filming Part 2?\n\nEmail Lindsay Schnell at lschnell@usatoday.com or follow her on social media

From Iowa's historic preseason game that broke attendance records all the way through the WNBA draft in April, the series uses unparalleled access, exclusive interviews, and unique game footage, to transport audiences into the lives of these exceptional athletes. Full Court Press follows them as they steer their celebrated programs towards a national championship, all while navigating the pressures that come with representing the game during a pivotal era in women's basketball.\n\nFull Court Press has been embedded with these three players throughout this record-breaking season, capturing key moments such as Kamilla Cardoso's game-winning three-pointer to send South Carolina to the SEC Championship; documenting Kiki Rice's experiences as the first college athlete, male or female, to have an NIL deal with Jordan brand; and filming the lead up to Caitlin Clark passing Kelsey Plum as the all-time leading scorer in NCAA women's basketball and passing Pete Maravich as the all-time leading scorer in the history of NCAA collegiate basketball in her final year at Iowa. The show will take audiences from Paris to Brazil, from sold out arenas in Baton Rouge to Iowa City for the biggest matchups, all to give fans a window into this unique moment in the history of the sport.\n\nCaitlin Clark | University of Iowa, Senior Guard\n\nCaitlin Clark is finishing the 2023-24 season as one of the most accomplished players in college basketball history, with the Iowa senior guard capturing a number of records, headlined by the all-time NCAA scoring mark. Before heading to the WNBA as the likely number one overall pick in the draft, Caitlin looks to lead her team back to the NCAA championship game - this time leaving with the title.\n\nKamilla Cardoso | University of South Carolina, Senior Center\n\nSouth Carolina center Kamilla Cardoso returns to the Gamecocks for her senior year, this time in a starting role. There were high expectations on the Brazilian stepping in for former national player of the year Aliyah Boston, and she's delivered, leading the team to a perfect regular season, and hitting her first career three pointer vs Tennessee in the SEC tournament semifinals, advancing South Carolina to the championship game. Cardoso, a potential top-5 pick in the WNBA draft, also traveled home to Montes Claros to play with the Brazilian national team when they attempted to qualify for the Olympics.\n\nKiki Rice | UCLA, Sophomore Guard\n\nKiki Rice was the number-two ranked recruit in the country out of high school, and she's has been a standout in her second year at UCLA. As the youngest of the featured athletes in the series, Rice is no stranger to the spotlight and is poised to help the Bruins reach their first Final Four.\n\n\"I remember what it meant to the University of Tennessee and the entire state when Pat Summitt led the Lady Vols to back-to-back national titles during my time in Knoxville,\" said Peyton Manning, founder of Omaha Productions. \"We're excited to share the stories of these three amazing women to a national audience at this incredible moment for women's basketball.\"\n\nDirector Kristen Lappas said: \"As someone who has grown up a devout fan of the women's game, I am thrilled that we are able to make this show at this pivotal moment in the history of the sport. To be able to pull back the curtain and document Caitlin Clark's historic season has been a privilege for our entire team. Each of our three players brings a unique set of storylines to the table, and we hope we're able to capture both the excitement and the complexities surrounding what it means to be an elite female basketball player in 2024.\"\n\nBrian Lockhart, SVP, Original Content and ESPN Films, said: \"Fan support and excitement over women's basketball is at an all-time high and we're seeing it reflected across many platforms at ESPN. With Full Court Press, we've had unprecedented access to the biggest players in the game, and our Original Content team is proud to have helped develop a series that showcases the fun and competitive spirit of this special moment in women's sports.\"\n\nFollowing its initial linear broadcast on ABC, with Episodes 1 & 2 airing on Saturday, May 11th at 1pm ET and Episodes 3 & 4 airing on Sunday, May 12th at 12:30pm ET, all episodes will be immediately available to stream on ESPN+.", "source": {"uri": "kimt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KIMT-TV 3 Mason City"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The former Iowa guard is one of three women's basketball players showcased in the new ESPN docuseries Full Court Press, which will give viewers a behind-the-scenes look into the lives of Caitlin, South Carolina's Kamilla Cardoso, and UCLA's Kiki Rice during the 2023-24 NCAA season. And, after that record-breaking women's basketball season, the docuseries is sure to be exhilarating.\n\n\"From Iowa's historic preseason game that broke attendance records all the way through the WNBA draft in April, the series uses unparalleled access, exclusive interviews, and unique game footage, to transport audiences into the lives of these exceptional athletes,\" a March press release from ESPN reads.\n\nFans are already getting excited about the series, thanks to a glamorous Full Court Press premiere in Indianapolis on May 6. At the event, Caitlin continued her streak of sporting Prada on major red carpets (like the WNBA draft, NBD), rocking a cropped cotton jacket, matching pants, a Prada tank top, and a Prada Re-Edition 2002 shoulder bag. The 2024 No.1 draft pick's white heels, however, came from Stuart Weitzman.\n\nThe 2023-24 season was huge for women's college basketball, and this docuseries is premiering right before the 2024 WNBA season kicks off. Ahead, everything to know about Full Court Press, including what it's about and how to watch it.\n\nFull Court Press follows Caitlin, Kamilla, and Kiki throughout the 2023-24 women's college basketball season. The four-episode docuseries, co-produced by ESPN and Peyton Manning's Omaha Productions, will include exclusive interviews, BTS footage, and recaps of the biggest matchups from the season.\n\n\"As someone who has grown up a devout fan of the women's game, I am thrilled that we are able to make this show at this pivotal moment in the history of the sport,\" Full Court Press director Kristen Lappas said in a March press release. \"To be able to pull back the curtain and document Caitlin Clark's historic season has been a privilege for our entire team.\"\n\nIf you'll remember, Caitlin had a pretty historic final season with the Iowa Hawkeyes. This season, she smashed the NCAA's all-time scoring record, becoming the leading scorer for men's and women's basketball. She also became the organization's Division I three-point record-holder and nabbed the title of Naismith National Player of the Year for the second year in a row. And once she was picked up by the Indiana Fever as the No.1 overall draft pick, her jersey immediately became the top-selling draft pick jersey ever.\n\nMeanwhile, Kamilla and Kiki had major years as well. Kamilla helped lead the University of South Carolina Gamecocks to become national champions, while Kiki's UCLA Bruins made it to the Sweet 16 (and, as a sophomore and the number-two ranked recruit in the country, Kiki has a long college career ahead of her).\n\n\"Each of our three players brings a unique set of storylines to the table, and we hope we're able to capture both the excitement and the complexities surrounding what it means to be an elite female basketball player in 2024,\" Lappas continued in the release.\n\nIs there a 'Full Court Press' trailer?\n\nYep! The trailer dropped on March 18. In it, Caitlin, Kamilla, and Kiki each reveal their unique struggles throughout the most recent season.\n\n\"The hardest thing about being Caitlin Clark?\" the star guard says in the trailer, over footage of her relaxing in a hot tub. \"Having to feel like you're always on.\"\n\n\"I don't think anybody fully grasps the pressure she's under,\" an unnamed man adds.\n\nMeanwhile, Kamilla, a native of Brazil, discusses the sacrifices she's made to play basketball in the United States, while Kiki talks about the expectations that come with playing for a school like UCLA. Watch the full trailer below:\n\nEpisodes 1 and 2 of Full Court Press will air on ABC on Saturday, May 11th at 1 p.m. ET.

Episodes one and two air Saturday at 1 p.m. followed by episodes three and four at 12:30 p.m. on Sunday, airing just days before the WNBA season tips off Tuesday. All four episodes will immediately become available to stream on ESPN+.\n\nThe series follows Clark, the senior guard at Iowa, South Carolina center Kamilla Cardoso, whose undefeated squad beat Clark's in the women's final last month, and UCLA sophomore guard Kiki Rice, one of a handful of younger stars hoping to keep women's college basketball on its impressive recent trajectory.\n\nCameras followed the three players throughout the college preseason, regular season and postseason. The series culminates at the recent WNBA Draft, which, like the women's college final, set viewership records for ESPN.\n\nThe series is directed by Kristen Lappas and is produced by Peyton Manning's Omaha Productions and Words & Pictures in partnership with ESPN+.\n\n\"I've been immersed in this world since early 2021, when I began making a 30 for 30 for ESPN on the 1996 women's national basketball team and their grueling 14-month journey to the Atlanta Olympic Games. A lot of the relationships I developed during that project helped us earn trust early on with the athletes and programs featured in Full Court Press,\" said Lappas. \"Even though we all knew how pivotal this moment was in women's hoops, thanks in large part to Caitlin Clark, the reality of what happened this season exceeded any of our original expectations. We absolutely caught lightning in a bottle.\"\n\nThe project sparked in part because Manning, the founder of Omaha Productions and no stranger to navigating life as an athletic sensation in college, had developed a close relationship with Clark. She became the first athlete to commit to the show.\n\n\"From there, we wanted to make sure we chose to follow elite players on top teams, who also had compelling backstories and different stakes from Caitlin. Diversifying the cast was crucial. We wanted to make sure that each woman had her own challenges and was at a different stage in her life and career,\" said Lappas.\n\nChoosing a player from South Carolina, the current cream of the crop for women's basketball and winner of three national championships since 2017, was a no-brainer.\n\n\"Kamilla Cardoso grew up in Montes Claros, raised by a single mother who made her living selling spices on the street. Kamilla came to America at 15 years old with the dream of playing high-level collegiate basketball and eventually making it to the WNBA to give her family a better life,\" said Lappas. After averaging 14.4 points per game for the Gamecocks as a senior, Cardoso went No. 3 in the WNBA Draft.\n\n\"Kiki Rice comes from a fascinating upbringing in D.C., where she grew up around politics due to her aunt Susan Rice's various appointments,\" said Lappas. She earned national player of the year honors as a high school senior and averaged 13.2 points and 5.7 rebounds per game last season.\n\n\"On paper, these three women could not have been more different. Yet they also had so much in common. They each played for a top-10 program, they each wanted to bring a national title back to their school, and each player had to navigate this new world of what it is to be a female collegiate athlete in 2024,\" said Lappas.\n\nShe said that while Clark, in particular, has become the focus of national media attention, the series reminds people that these are still college students just navigating life.\n\n\"Our superstar producer Hannah Beir basically lived out in Iowa for the past five months,\" said Lappas. \"Before shoots, she'd ask Caitlin if we could pick her up breakfast and coffee, and it became sort of a tradition. We both got a kick out of her order: a bacon, egg and cheese breakfast sandwich and an iced caramel macchiato with vanilla sweet cream cold foam. It is the most classic college breakfast order. Here is this elite superstar athlete who has become an icon of her generation, but it reminds you that she's still just a kid.\n\n\"When her mom comes into town, she still helps her with laundry and dishes. It makes it even more impressive that at 22 years old, she is carrying her sport with such poise and maturity. She is just the most down-to-earth person. It is very refreshing, and I hope she stays that way.\"", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This weekend, ABC will air a four-episode series that goes behind the scenes with Clark, the No. 1 pick of the Indiana Fever; South Carolina All-American Kamilla Cardoso, now a rookie with the Chicago Sky; and UCLA super sophomore Kiki Rice. With support from Peyton Manning's Omaha Productions, ESPN's cameras were given unparalleled access, embedded with the three players all season. The result is a compelling four-hour series that is likely to bring more new fans to the game.\n\nPeople will tune in for Clark, a generational talent who's helped draw thousands - millions? - of new eyeballs to women's basketball. She knows it, too. In the first episode, Clark talks about feeling \"a responsibility to lead the women's game,\" heady stuff for a 22-year-old.\n\nAnd while viewers will see a side of Clark typically closed off to outsiders - her boyfriend is featured heavily and interviewed numerous times - the most compelling parts of the series feature Cardoso, who left her poverty-stricken family in Brazil in hopes of going pro and changing their future financially. (UCLA's Rice is a somewhat odd fit at times, mostly because she's two years behind Clark and Cardoso, but her inclusion gives newcomers one more name to follow throughout college.)\n\nCardoso's story in particular will likely make viewers ache. When her national team, Brazil, is knocked out of its Olympic-qualifying tournament, Cardoso is inconsolable. Her emotion is raw, real and heartbreaking. (Cardoso was recently injured in Chicago's first preseason game and will be re-evaluated in four to six weeks.)\n\nThe series will broadcast first on ABC, with Episodes 1 and 2 airing at 1 p.m. ET Saturday - a lead-in to that day's NBA playoff coverage - and Episodes 3 and 4 airing at 12:30 p.m. ET Sunday. All episodes will be available to stream on ESPN+ as well.\n\nBrian Lockhart, the senior vice president of original content and ESPN films, told USA TODAY Sports that \"when we can provide (viewers) with stakes and characters, that's when you get real investment.\" As Lockhart sees it, while women's sports continue to grow in popularity, casual fans need this type of storytelling to become even more connected to the game.\n\nHe's seen it firsthand in other sports. Lockhart compared the rise of women's hoops and its potential to dominate the airwaves with UFC's recent explosion.\n\n\"When I first came over to ESPN+ (in 2019), UFC was a big thing but as a business, ESPN and ESPN+ said, 'Let's go all in,' \" Lockhart said. \"And when ESPN gets behind something and gives it the platform, the storytelling and the news and information (power), I think those three pillars, when we put those together, it can turn something that's known into something you can't live without.\"\n\nThe series was directed by Kristen Lappas, whose other projects include \"Dream On,\" a documentary chronicling the 1996 U.S. Olympic women's basketball team and its role in helping launch the WNBA, and \"Blackfeet Boxing: Not Invisible,\" which earned Lappas an Emmy.\n\nShe said she's optimistic that viewers will learn from the series, especially if they're new to women's sports, that \"the women's game has the same intensity, it's not a softer product.\" She's also hopeful it will spark more people to want - even demand - stories that center on women athletes.\n\n\"The access we got (for \"Full Court Press\") was unlike anything I've ever experienced,\" Lappas said. \"Coaches were saying to us, 'we want people to see inside our program; we want to grow the game.'\n\n\"And that is the hope, right? That this series draws more people to games, more people to the sport. There's this entire untapped world of stories, past generations and present generation ... and I think right now, people are craving more female storytelling.\"\n\nNo argument here. In fact, as I finished the series, I only had one question.\n\nHow soon can they start filming Part 2?\n\nEmail Lindsay Schnell at lschnell@usatoday.com or follow her on social media

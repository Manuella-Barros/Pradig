making sure that movies and music videos, among other things, do not depict or glorify dangerous things like smoking tobacco, criminal activity, ritual killings, or money rituals.\n\nThe Executive Director of NFVCB, Dr. Shaibu Husseini gave the charge at the National Stakeholders' Engagement on Smoke-Free Nollywood held in Enugu.\n\nHe commended the Corporate Accountability and Public Participation Africa (CAPPA) for putting up the event as part of its corporate social responsibility in Nigeria's creative industry.\n\nHe said that the film industry occupies a central position in the entertainment and creative sector, adding that \"it is imperative that we continue to place the highest premium on the progress of the film industry.\"\n\nHusseini noted that \"we are facing an industry emergency requiring bold and ambitious actions from all parents, guardians and stakeholders.\"\n\nHe invited the public and private sector participants \"to see the gathering as an important platform to forge strategic partnership in order to mobilise scarce funding and create innovative models to assist in educating/sensitizing mothers, youth and the general public to combat the hydra-headed menace in the form of unapproved and unclassified content.\"\n\nEarlier in a remark, the executive Director of CAPPA, Akinbode Oluwafemi had stressed the need for stakeholders to work towards a Smoke-Free Nollywood.\n\nOluwefemi stated that \"we are at a point where we must stop the globalisation of smoking and instead promote a healthy lifestyle.\n\n\"There is a need to reverse the role movies and music videos play in painting smoking and tobacco use as a cool way of life.\"\n\nHe revealed that studies had shown that smoking remained prevalent in Nigerian movies in contravention of the NTC-Act and the Tobacco Control Regulations 2019, which explicitly prohibited tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorships in movies and entertainment.\n\nThe CAPPA boss commended the Executive Director of the National Film and Video Censors Board, Dr. Husseini, for taking the bold step to dialogue with stakeholders in the industry towards a Nigerian screen free of

Executive Director/CEO of the National Film and Video Censors Board (NFVCB), Dr. Shaibu Husseini, has announced that the Federal Government has approved the prohibition of money rituals and the glamorization of vices in Nigerian films.\n\nDr. Husseini made this disclosure at a National Stakeholders Engagement on Smoke-Free Nollywood, held in Enugu on Wednesday.\n\nThe event was organized by the NFVCB and Corporate Accountability and Public Participation Africa (CAPPA).\n\nThe event brought together movie producers, directors, and actors from across the country, as well as leaders of various guilds and associations in the Nigerian film industry.\n\nThe new regulations aim to promote a more responsible and ethical film industry in Nigeria, and to prevent the promotion of harmful and illegal activities through film.\n\nHusseini said that Nigeria was facing an industry emergency requiring bold and ambitious actions from all parents, guardians and stakeholders.\n\n\"When my predecessor approached the former Minister of Information, Alhaji Lai Muhammed, on the need to make subsidiary legislation to curtail the display of smoking in Nigerian movies, he saw the need to include money rituals.\n\n\"Others included in the regulation are ritual killings and glamorising other crimes in order to further sanitise the film industry.\n\n\"Today, I am delighted to announce to you that the Minister of Arts, Culture and the Creative Economy, Hannatu Musawa, pursuant to section 65 of the NFVCB Act 2004 has approved the regulation.\n\n\"The minister has approved the 'Prohibition of Money Ritual, Ritual Killing, Tobacco, Tobacco Products, Nicotine Product Promotion and Glamorisation display in Movies, Musical Videos and Skits Regulations 2024'.\n\n\"We have also forwarded the approved copy to the Federal Ministry of Justice for Gazette,\" he said.\n\nHusseini said the sensitisation programme was to educate stakeholders on the danger inherent in smoking in Nigerian movies.\n\nAccording to him, besides the health implications, glamorising smoking in films poses a negative influence on teens and young adults who constitute the largest segment of Nigerian movie viewers.\n\nHe said that the board was set to undertake detailed enlightenment programmes in secondary schools, tertiary institutions, local communities, faith groups and other institutions.\n\n\"As you all know, the film industry occupies a central position in the entertainment and creative sector, and it is imperative that we continue to place the highest premium on the progress of the film industry.\n\n\"The NFVCB supports smoke-free movies and smoke-free Nollywood, and we, therefore, seek your collaboration to develop creative content that discourages smoking and promotes positive health messages.\n\n\"After a series of engagements, the NFVCB in collaboration with the CAPPA decided to do a 'subsidiary regulations' to cater for smoking in movies since this aspect was not expressly spelt out in the extant Law.\n\n\"The NFVCB is well prepared to take leadership in this regard and has planned and begun implementing innovative ways to achieve its mandate,\" he said.\n\nNAN reports that it is the duty of the Board to register all film and video outlets across the country and to keep a register of such registered outlets among other functions.", "source":

National Stakeholders Engagement on Smoke-Free Nollywood to sensitise filmmakers on Tuesday in Enugu.\n\nMovie producers, directors and actors drawn from different parts of the country, as well as leader of various guilds and associations in the Nigerian film industry were present at event.\n\nIn a remark, Dr Shaibu Husseini, Executive Director of NFVCB, said the sensitisation programme was to educate stakeholders on the danger inherent in consumption of smoking in Nigerian movies.\n\nAccording to him, besides the health implications, glamourisation of smoking in films poses negative influence on teens and young adults who constitute the largest segment of Nigeria movie viewers.\n\n\"As you all know, the film industry occupies a central position in the entertainment and creative sector and it is imperative that we continue to place the highest premium on the progress of the film industry.\n\n\"The NFVCB supports smoke-free movies and supports smoke-free Nollywood, and we therefore seek your collaboration to develop creative content that discourages smoking and promotes positive health messages.\n\n\"In spite the obvious fact that our culture and heritage are part of our existence, we tend to pay less than optimal attention to the movies that are produced.\n\n\"This continued until recently when this group, CAPPA decided to reach out to the developers and regulators of the film industry to put an end to the menace of smoking in movies.\n\n\"Therefore, after series of engagements, the NFVCB in collaboration with the CAPPA decided to do a 'subsidiary regulations' to cater for smoking in movies since this aspect was not expressly spelt out in the extant Law.\n\n\"The NFVCB is well prepared to take leadership in this regard and has planned and began implementing innovative ways to achieve its mandate.\n\n\"Most especially at this crucial time when the National Assembly is insisting that there is \"Need to Curb the rising spate of cultism, trafficking, consumption of Illicit drugs and other substances among youths in Nigeria\", he said.\n\nThe NFVCB helmsman added that the board was set to undertake detailed enlightenment programmes in secondary schools, tertiary institutions, local communities, faith groups and other institutions.\n\nMr Akinbode Oluwafemi, Executive Director of CAPPA , said Nollywood has a role to play in ensuring that the growing concerns of non-communicable diseases in Nigeria is addressed.\n\nAccording to him, there is need to reverse the role movies and music videos play in \"the painting of smoking and tobacco use as a cool way of life.\"\n\n\"Tobacco is a killer and it currently kills over 8 million people annually, with over 75 percent of this from developing countries, where unfortunately Nigeria belongs.\n\n\"Today smoking still remains very prevalent in our movies, in contravention of the NTC Act and the Tobacco Control Regulations 2019, which explicitly prohibits tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorships in movies and entertainment.\n\n\"As we tell the Nigerian story, shape our future and build a society that is genuinely productive, we strongly believe that Nollywood has a role to play in stopping non-communicable diseases in Nigeria.\n\n\"With more than five million young Nigerians .aged 15 years addicted to smoking cigarettes, our jobs as movie practitioners and parents should include preparing our children for a smoke-free future.\n\n\"I want to specially thank the Executive Director of the NFVCB . for welcoming us with open arms in support and collaboration for this very important initiative,\" he said\n\nHe explained that CAPPA) is a Pan-African organisation with robust interest in working with African communities to build partnerships towards the

and CAPPA for the initiative.\n\nNuhu, who was represented by Mr Brian Etuk, Director Public Affairs of NFC, said the corporation was willing to engage stakeholders across the country on issues that will engender growth of the film industry.\n\n\"The NFC believes in partnerships that works, collaborations that pull efforts towards the same direction and in this dispensation, the joint efforts by the NFC and NFVCB shall be felt within the film industry.\n\n\"This workshop is apt and it takes its ample place in our collective quest of using film/movies to address societal moral issues, which has become prevalent, especially among our youthful population.\"he said.(NAN)", "source": {"uri": "realnewsmagazine.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Realnews Magazine"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The NFVCB, under Dr. Husseini's leadership has expressed concerns about the potential impact such portrayals can have on the audience, especially the youth, who form a significant portion of the movie-watching demographic.\n\n\"We have also forwarded the approved copy to the Federal Ministry of Justice for Gazette,\" he said.\n\nThe move is not just about censorship but about encouraging filmmakers to explore alternative narratives and storytelling methods that promote positive values. The Nigerian film industry, popularly known as Nollywood, is one of the largest in the world and has a profound influence on the cultural and social fabric of the nation. By implementing these regulations, the NFVCB hopes to foster a more responsible and ethical filmmaking environment.\n\nThis decision has been met with various reactions from different stakeholders within the industry. While some applaud the government's initiative to curb negative influences, others are concerned about the implications for creative freedom. The NFVCB has assured that the regulations are not meant to stifle creativity but to guide it towards more constructive and beneficial paths.\n\nThe prohibition is part of a broader initiative to engage various stakeholders, including movie producers, directors, actors, and guilds, in a dialogue about the future of Nollywood and its role in society. The NFVCB has planned detailed enlightenment programs to educate these stakeholders about the dangers and responsibilities associated with film content.\n\nAs the regulation takes effect, it will be interesting to observe how Nollywood adapts and evolves. The industry has always been known for its dynamic storytelling and ability to address societal issues. With this new directive, filmmakers have the opportunity to lead the way in creating content that not only entertains but also educates and inspires positive change.\n\nThe Federal Government's approval of this prohibition reflects a commitment to the cultural integrity and moral compass of the nation. It is a call to action for the Nigerian film industry to harness its power and influence for the greater good, paving the way for a new era of Nollywood that champions virtue over vice.", "source": {"uri": "tekedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tekedia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prohibition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Ministry_of_Justice_and_Consumer_Protection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Demography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nicotine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Storytelling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Textile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Censorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Age of Enlightenment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guild", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guild"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Morality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society", "label": "dmoz/Society", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.tekedia.com/wp-content/uploads/asgarosforum/6789/NollyWood.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9587740", "eventUri": "eng-9587740", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

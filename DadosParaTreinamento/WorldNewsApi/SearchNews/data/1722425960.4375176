The \"Malibu\" singer, 31, left a comment on a recent video posted by Pop Choir Australia on TikTok of its members (many of them elderly people) singing her hit song \"Used to Be Young.\" \"You're all STILL beautiful! This video lit my heart up. O A Moment like this is why I wrote U2BY!\" Cyrus wrote in the comments of the TikTok video on Friday, June 28. \"Physical youth comes and goes but the soul can stay young forever!! love you all! Thanks for making my day.\" The video featured a large group of people, dressed in casual clothes, harmonizing to the ballad. Many of the singers appeared to be elderly and some of them used wheelchairs. Although many of the people in the Australian group appear older, per its website, Pop Choir is for anyone who loves to sing. \"Pop Choir is the choir reimagined and is for everyone and anyone who loves to sing!\" the website reads. \"A tired and over worked professional or a stressed-out parent, someone who loves to belt out there favourite tune in the car or shower or the next Guy Sebastian. Pop Choir is singing fun for everyone and surprisingly cool!\" The choirs often perform at local community events after instructors teach them how to harmonize pop hits.

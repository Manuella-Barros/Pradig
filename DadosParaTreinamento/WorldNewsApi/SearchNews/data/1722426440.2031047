We've stopped contacting one another because both sides are focusing on the task at hand,\" a smiling Sommer told reporters at Berlin's Olympiastadion on Friday.

The opposition changes,\" Sommer said.

It's a wonderful stadium and the atmosphere should be great,\" he added. Given that Italy have been involved in seven penalty shoot-outs at the Euros, Sommer might find himself the centre of attention if it comes down to spot kicks, and coach Murat Yakin said his side was ready. \"Everyone has taken a penalty in training, we've jotted down some notes but of course, it's not the same thing, taking a penalty on the training ground as opposed to taking one in a match situation with all of the pressure that pertains to that,\" Yakin told reporters. \"To be honest, I don't want to go to penalties. I hope we can win the game prior to that, because penalties are a lottery, and we know it's not particularly nice thing to go through. But yes, we have practised that as well. And we hope that if we go to penalties, we can win them as well,\" he added. The Swiss coach said there would be some changes to the starting line-up, but that everyone is fit and ready to play. \"There's an excellent mood in the camp. And we have fought really hard to make it this far, and we can't wait to get out there and play against Italy,\" Yakin said.

Accessing the DLC in Elden Ring requires players to defeat Mohg and Radahn.\n\nGAMERANT VIDEO OF THE DAY\n\nSCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nFromSoftware has released a new update for Elden Ring in preparation for the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC that allows players to finally summon Torrent during the final boss fight against the Elden Beast. Elden Ring players acquire their trusty mount Torrent very early on in the game, allowing them to quickly traverse the Lands Between.\n\nTorrent isn't usable in many Elden Ring boss fights, but there are others where players can indeed mount their steed. One such fight that lets Elden Ring players summon Torrent is the Radahn boss fight, one of the required bosses that players must beat if they hope to play Shadow of the Erdtree. As of the latest update, there's yet another Elden Ring boss that can be fought while mounted on Torrent, and that is the very last boss in the game, the Elden Beast .\n\n3:19\n\nRelated\n\nElden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree - Official Launch Trailer\n\nFrom Software releases the official launch trailer for Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree, showcasing new gameplay and boss battles.\n\nThe final boss fight in Elden Ring is a two-phase battle. The first half of the fight is against Radagon, and the second-half of the battle sees players go head-to-head with the Elden Beast. The Elden Beast portion of the fight has long been criticized for how long it can take to actually run up to the creature and attack it, but that has been addressed in the new update. After downloading the latest Elden Ring update, players will be able to utilize Torrent during the final boss fight. While this may not make the boss battle all that easier, it will definitely make it less tedious, and should make players less apprehensive about the game's climactic battle.\n\nElden Ring Now Lets You Use Torrent in Final Boss Fight\n\nOf course, Elden Ring players may want to hold off on fighting the Elden Beast right now anyway. Accessing the Elden Ring DLC does not require players to defeat Radagon or the Elden Beast, though players do have to defeat Mohg, Lord of Blood and Starscourge Radahn . Players are certainly free to fight Elden Ring's final boss, but they should be careful not to start a New Game+ run afterward. Doing so will put players in a fresh version of the Lands Between where they will have to defeat Mohg and Radahn all over again.\n\nClose\n\nSoon, the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC will be upon us, and Elden Ring players will be able to use Torrent as they explore the new open world area. Elden Ring's DLC has earned rave reviews from critics, and so fans of the game should definitely be excited to return to FromSoftware's massive open world adventure.\n\nElden Ring\n\nElden Ring is a fantasy action-RPG adventure set in a world co-created by Hidetaka Miyazaki, the creator of the influential Dark Souls video game series, and George R.R. Martin, the author of the best-selling fantasy series A Song of Ice and Fire. This collaboration between two renowned creators has resulted in FromSoftware's largest game to date, filled with danger and discovery at every turn. Hidetaka Miyazaki, president and game director of FromSoftware, has a history of directing highly acclaimed games in franchises such as Armored Core and Dark Souls.\n\nPlatform(s) PS5 , Xbox One , PS4 , Xbox Series X , Xbox Series S , PC\n\nReleased February 25, 2022\n\nDeveloper(s) From Software\n\nPublisher(s) Bandai Namco Entertainment , From Software\n\nGenre(s) RPG , Action\n\nMultiplayer Online Co-Op , Online Multiplayer\n\nEngine Proprietary\n\nESRB M for Mature: Blood and Gore, Language, Suggestive Themes, Violence\n\nHow Long To Beat 58 Hours\n\nMetascore 96\n\nPlatforms That Support Crossplay PS4 & PS5 and Xbox One & Xbox Series X|S\n\nPS Plus Availability N/A\n\nExpand\n\nSee at Playstation StoreSee at Xbox Games StoreSee at Steam", "source": {"uri": "gamerant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Game Rant"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dalton_cooper@gamerant.com", "name": "Dalton Cooper", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boss_(video_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boss (video games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elden_Ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elden Ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downloadable_content", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Downloadable content"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FromSoftware", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FromSoftware"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_world", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Open world"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gameplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gameplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Series_X_and_Series_S", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xbox Series X and Series S"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_5", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_(service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steam (service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandai_Namco_Entertainment", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bandai Namco Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidetaka_Miyazaki", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hidetaka Miyazaki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Game_Plus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Game Plus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Software_Rating_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Software Rating Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "A Song of Ice and Fire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Role-playing video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_role-playing_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Action role-playing game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Souls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dark Souls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_R._R._Martin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George R.

But players of the base game are also getting a lovely treat, in the form of a major quality-of-life update to the base game's final boss battle.\n\nAccording to Bandai Namco's patch notes for version 1.12 of Elden Ring, developer FromSoftware has added a \"new feature to summon spectral steed during the Elden Beast boss battle.\" Elden Ring players who have faced the Elden Beast will know what a relief it is to have Torrent available in this situation, as the final boss battle involves a torturous amount of running from one side of the battle arena to the other, back and forth, and back and forth again, while chasing the always-moving monster.\n\nWhile the Elden Beast battle was a majestic and challenging final confrontation, the incessant running around players had to do to get in a few swipes of a sword or get within spellcasting range was something of a nightmare. Especially since the Elden Beast is a two-parter; one needs to defeat another boss, Radagon, before facing the beast, and failure in the second part meant repeating the first.\n\nBut the ability to summon Torrent in the Elden Beast boss fight isn't the only major quality-of-life update for Elden Ring in patch 1.12. FromSoft has added a new \"Recent Items\" tab to players' inventory screen, letting them easily find the latest thing (weapon, cookbook, talisman, etc.) they've picked up. Newly obtained items are marked with a \"!\" symbol, which will be hugely important for players acquiring a ton of new stuff with Shadow of the Erdtree. (Note that the Recent Items tab is an opt-in feature in the game's settings menu, and having used it for the past week, I highly recommend turning it on!)\n\nElden Ring patch 1.12 does a whole lot more.

That's reflected in the immediate positive reaction to the change, which was casually noted in a single line stuffed in the middle of the \"new inventory features\" section.\n\nInterestingly, some players said the change isn't so much a nerf of the Elden Beast fight, but just a quality of life change. \"It doesn't make the fight easier just less annoying to keep running around everywhere,\" redditor SirSabza wrote. \"With how big Elden Beast is I'd rather not get knocked off my horse every 5 seconds.\"\n\nOthers have also expressed wonderment that it took this long to make the change, and of course there's speculation that diehard soulslikers will consider the addition of Torrent an asterisk in the record books: \"'I platinumed Elden Ring when you couldn't use Torrent for Elden Beast' will be the new 'I beat Radahn pre-patch',\" _wirving_ wrote.\n\nSo that's obviously a highlight, but for my money the big winner is an entirely different addition supporting poor, overlooked mouse and keyboard players like me: \"Added key assignments to open the map in the Key Settings menu.\"\n\nPreviously, you see, you couldn't remap Elden Ring's \"map\" keybind, and worse, the game provided absolutely no indication (that I noticed or remember, anyway) about what key it was even bound to. Even worse than that, the damn thing is G. Who presses G for \"map?\" And why? M is the obvious choice, Tab is an acceptable alternative; hell, I can live with mashing Esc and then having to select it from a menu. But G?\n\nYes, for the record, I played Elden Ring with a mouse and keyboard, and frankly I did pretty well by it. But I was never not at least slightly annoyed by the horrendous M&K interface: I get that soulslikes are supposed to be difficult but I don't think an endless struggle with shitty controls is meant to be part of that. (And yes, much of my clearly-still-fresh irritation arises from the fact that I jumped back into Elden Ring a couple nights ago and had to look up how to get into the map, again. Mashing G is counter-intuitive nonsense, and I apologize for nothing.)\n\nMouse-and-keyboard warriors will also appreciate the addition of a new \"lock-on change threshold\" for mouse controls (actually labelled \"target changing sensitivity\" in the keyboard/mouse settings), which will hopefully help reduce the incidence of accidentally switching to the wrong target in the heat of battle. We've all been there, right? (Right?)\n\nThe patch also makes numerous improvements to Elden Ring's inventory functionality, including a marker for newly acquired items and a new tab that displays all your recently snagged stuff in one place. Note that these additions are not switched on by default: You'll need to go into the display menu in Elden Ring's settings and enable them if you want to use them.\n\nThere's a whole lot more going on in this patch, including balance adjustments for both PvP and PvE gameplay, and numerous bug fixes -- you can see the full Elden Ring 1.12 patch notes below.

Said boss always made a brilliant first impression, then quickly fumbles its introduction with a nasty second phase that has players hoofin' it -- quite literally, after today's update.\n\nSpoilers ahead for anyone who hasn't experienced Elden Ring's base-game content.\n\nElden Ring's final boss, Radagon of the Golden Order, is an incredible fight. The score swells, the one-on-one combat shines, and the spectacle of his attacks dazzle. Then, a second phase comes along and sours the whole affair: the Elden Beast. Well, starting today, that wet blanket of a fight is going to be a lot more bearable as the Tarnished's trusty companion rushes to the rescue.\n\nTorrent, the spectral steed who carried us all across the Lands Between, can now be summoned to help players fight the Elden Beast as of today's pre-DLC patch. Why is this important? Well, mostly because the entire Elden Beast fight seems to have been designed with Torrent in mind from the start.\n\nThe Elden Beast loves, and I mean just adores wasting the player's time by flying the length of the arena away every four to five seconds. Prior to today's patch, you spent most of this encounter simply running after the thing, dodging its merciless ranged attacks before reaching it, doing one or two hits of damage, and repeating the process. Not anymore.\n\nFurther helped by this addition is \"hitless\" runs: self-imposed challenges where players attempt the entire game without taking so much as a papercut's worth of damage. Elden Stars, an attack used by the boss, features aggressive homing missiles that are nearly impossible for a player to dodge on foot.

You can ride your favourite horse into the Elden Beast.\n\nJust let that last line sink in a minute. Not only has FromSoft made a DLC that's already taken the metascore crown among both games released in 2024 and DLCs released ever, and put out another trailer for you to take in, it's made it possible to bring an animal buddy along for a bit of help once you've slapped up Radagon.\n\nIn the notes for patch 1.12, this momentous change is expressed in the following terms: \"Added new feature to summon spectral steed during the Elden Beast the boss battle.\" Quite frankly, that's not spelling out just how cool something is in traditional FromSoft fashion.\n\nBasically, the boss fight that everyone's been saying 'This kinda feels like it was built for you to be able to charge about on a horse in, since you have to spend a bunch of time running around', now lets you charge about on a horse into it. Seriously, once both you and the beast are down to just a titchy little bit of health, you can go full Braveheart, yell that it'll never taker your freedom, and gallop forth into glory.\n\nYou'll probably die or just awkwardly bounce off of the beast in the process, but quite frankly you've spent enough time being intelligent and rolling around the big man timing your attacks perfectly. It's time for you to go brainless mode in a fashion that isn't just a club build.\n\nSome players on Reddit are even claiming that a few of the Beast's attacks might well have been rebalanced to better suit you having Torrent if you choose to summon him, which is cool if accurate.\n\nIf you're wondering, patch 1.12's other big highlights are the fact that it adds five new hairdos to the game, and makes a bunch of balancing tweaks and adjustments to weapons and skills - with that last part being designed to improve both the PvP and PvE experience.\n\nIf you've left your Elden Ring DLC prep to the last minute and are looking for guides to getting anything in the Lands Between done, make sure to check out our huge array of recently updated ones for everything from reaching Mohgwyn Palace to getting Adula's Moonblade.", "source": {"uri": "vg247.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "VG247"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downloadable_content", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Downloadable content"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boss_(video_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boss (video games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacritic", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metacritic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braveheart_(soundtrack)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Braveheart (soundtrack)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elden_Ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elden Ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_versus_environment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Player versus environment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_versus_player", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Player versus player"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reddit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Equestrian", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Equestrian", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Design/Fashion", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Design/Fashion", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western_Performance", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western Performance", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Patches", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Patches", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Patches", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Patches", "wgt": 14}], "image": "https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/elden-ring-patch-adds-torrent-final-boss-fight-01.jpg?width=1200&height=600&fit=crop&enable=upscale&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669076", "eventUri": "eng-9669076", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

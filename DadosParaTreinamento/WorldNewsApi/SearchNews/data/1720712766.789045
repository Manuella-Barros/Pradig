{"id": 232096680, "title": "Israel keeps pounding central Gaza as Palestinian death toll in hostage rescue raid rises to 274", "text": "Israeli forces pounded central Gaza anew on Sunday, a day after killing 274 Palestinians during a hostage rescue raid, and tanks advanced further into Rafah in an apparent bid to seal off part of the southern city, residents and Hamas media said. Palestinians remained in shock over Saturday\u2019s death toll, the worst over a 24-hour period of the Gaza war for months and including many women and children, Palestinian doctors said. In an update on Sunday, Gaza\u2019s health ministry said 274 Palestinians were killed \u2013 up from 210 it reported on Saturday \u2013 and 698 were injured when Israeli special force commandos stormed into the densely populated al-Nuseirat camp to rescue four hostages held since October by Hamas militants. Sixty-four of the dead were children and 57 were women, the Hamas-run Gaza government media office said on Sunday. Israel\u2019s military said a special forces officer was killed in exchanges of fire with militants emerging from cover in residential blocks, and that it knew of \u201cunder 100\u201d Palestinians killed, though not how many of them were fighters or civilians. Hamas\u2019 armed wing said on Sunday three Israeli hostages, including one with US citizenship, were killed during the raid, but provided no names. It released a video of what appeared to be corpses with censor bars obscuring their faces. A Hamas assertion on Saturday that some hostages had died was rejected as \u201ca blatant lie\u201d by the Israeli military. Gaza\u2019s health ministry said another 798 Palestinians were injured in the Israeli raid, and one of them, four-year-old Tawfiq Abu Youssef, was in critical condition when visited in hospital on Sunday by his father Raed. The boy was first thought to have died before he moved his hand slightly while in the arms of a relative rushing him to hospital \u2013 captured in a video that went viral on social media. \u201cI had already dug his grave,\u201d his father said, adding that most members of his extended family were among those killed in the raid. In central Gaza on Sunday, Israeli strikes on houses in the city of Deir al-Balah and in the nearby al-Bureij refugee camp killed three Palestinians in each location, while tanks shelled parts of al-Nuseirat and al-Maghazi camps, doctors said. The Israeli military said in a statement its forces were continuing operations east of al-Bureij and Deir al-Balah, killing a number of Palestinian gunmen and destroying militant infrastructure. Israel sent forces into Rafah in May in what it called a mission to wipe out Hamas\u2019 last intact combat units after eight months of war, in which Israeli forces have bombed much of the rest of Gaza to rubble while advancing against fierce resistance from militants embedded in crowded cities and built-up camps. Israeli tank forces have since seized Gaza\u2019s entire border strip with Egypt running through Rafah to the Mediterranean coast and invaded many districts of the city of 280,000 residents, prompting around one million displaced people who had been sheltering in Rafah to flee elsewhere. On Sunday, tanks advanced into two new districts in an apparent effort to complete the encirclement of the entire eastern side of Rafah, touching off clashes with dug-in Hamas-led armed groups, according to residents trapped in their homes. Palestinian doctors said an Israeli air strike on a house in Tel Al-Sultan in western Rafah killed two people. The Israeli military said troops of its 162nd division were raiding some districts of Rafah where they had located \u201cnumerous additional terror tunnel shafts, mortars, and [other] weapons\u201d belonging to Palestinian Islamist militants. Hamas precipitated the war with a lightning cross-border attack into Israel last October 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. About half the hostages were freed during a brief November truce. Israel\u2019s ensuing air and ground war in Gaza has killed at least 37,084 Palestinians, the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory said in its Sunday update. The ministry says thousands more dead are feared buried under the rubble. Attempts by the United States and regional countries to broker a deal that would release all remaining hostages in return for a ceasefire have repeatedly stumbled on Israeli and Hamas intransigence over terms for an end to the war. A humanitarian catastrophe has unfolded as the war has dragged on, with more than three-quarters of Gaza\u2019s 2.3 million population displaced, malnutrition widespread and basic infrastructure in ruins. Gaza\u2019s conflict has destabilised the wider Middle East, drawing in Hamas\u2019 main supporter Iran and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah, which has been clashing with Israel along its northern border for months, raising fears of all-out war. Concern about an escalation in Israeli-Hezbollah hostilities and a sharp decline in expectations of a Gaza ceasefire have weakened Israel\u2019s shekel currency by 3 per cent to 3.75 to the dollar since June 4.", "summary": "Hamas says 3 hostages including a US citizen were killed in Israeli rescue raid; Gaza\u2019s health ministry reported 274 Palestinians killed in al-Nuseirat camp.", "url": "https://www.scmp.com/news/world/middle-east/article/3265975/israel-keeps-pounding-central-gaza-palestinian-death-toll-hostage-rescue-raid-rises-274", "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/06/10/a3c40e0d-e4c2-4bc9-aed9-e44688e40bf3_12997b06.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 17:00:51", "author": "Reuters", "authors": ["Reuters"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "cn", "sentiment": -0.243}

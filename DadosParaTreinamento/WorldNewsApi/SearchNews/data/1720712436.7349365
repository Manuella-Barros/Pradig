She emphasized that Mr. Modi had essentially lost the mandate he sought and, consequently, forfeited the right to leadership.Despite this setback, Sonia Gandhi noted, Mr. Modi intended to proceed with his swearing-in ceremony again, instead of acknowledging his failure. She expressed scepticism regarding any anticipation of a change in the substance and style of his governance or his responsiveness to the will of the people.Regarding nbsp; Modis upcoming oath-taking ceremony, Trinamool Congress leader Sudip Bandyopadhyay remarked that while he may be assuming office as Prime Minister for a third term, his mandate did not compare to that of Jawaharlal Nehru, the only other PM to have enjoyed three consecutive terms.Bandyopadhyay, who was re-elected as the leader of the TMC in Lok Sabha, also mentioned that the Opposition would adopt a positive role in the proceedings of Parliament.

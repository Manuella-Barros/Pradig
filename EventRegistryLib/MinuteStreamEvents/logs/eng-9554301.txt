On several occasions, Israeli extremists threatened our staff with guns.\"\n\nUNRWA, which coordinates nearly all aid to Gaza, has been in crisis since January when Israel accused about a dozen of its 13,000 Gaza employees of being involved in the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel.\n\nThis led many donor nations, including its top donor the United States, to abruptly suspend funding to the agency, threatening its efforts to deliver desperately-needed aid in Gaza, although several have since resumed payments.\n\nAn independent review group of UNRWA, led by French former foreign minister Catherine Colonna, found some \"neutrality-related issues\" but said Israel had yet to provide evidence for its chief allegations.\n\nQatar's foreign ministry issued a statement Thursday condemning \"in the strongest terms the attack by Israeli settlers on the UNRWA headquarters\".\n\nThe ministry slammed the \"systematic Israeli targeting of UNRWA\", maintaining it was aimed \"to liquidate it and deprive millions of Palestinians of its necessary services\".\n\nCreated in 1949, the agency employs around 30,000 people in the Palestinian territories, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria.", "source":

Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., are pushing the State Department to recover any federal funds that have been distributed to UNRWA for Palestine Refugees in the Near East.\n\nThe Biden administration announced in January it would stop any additional funding to the agency. Yet, just before the freeze, UNRWA had already received $121 million in U.S. taxpayer dollars.\n\n\"For way too long, UNRWA has masqueraded as a relief organization, while in reality serving as an incubator for Palestinian terrorists,\" Mast said in a statement. \"Intelligence reports indicate that as many as 10 percent of UNRWA workers have direct links to Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihadists. It's ludicrous that our hard-earned American tax dollars were going to fund this crap.\"\n\nMark Swanson \u2709\n\nMark Swanson, a Newsmax writer and editor, has nearly three decades of experience covering news, culture and politics.", "source": {"uri": "newsmax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsMax"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_swanson@newsmax.com", "name": "Mark Swanson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNRWA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UNRWA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Jerusalem", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "East Jerusalem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Lazzarini", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philippe Lazzarini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_settlement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israeli settlement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsmax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newsmax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Gottheimer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Gottheimer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_East", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Near East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jihadism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jihadism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Emergency_Services", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Emergency Services", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Safety_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Safety Engineering", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Emergency_Preparation/Safety", "label": "dmoz/Home/Emergency Preparation/Safety", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=ee095836-4388-48e6-a8f5-d5157015fe70&SiteName=Newsmax&maxsidesize=280", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554301", "eventUri": "eng-9554301", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 788, "textEnd": 794}], "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

allegations of its lack of impartiality, ultimately aims to liquidate it and deprive millions of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon of its necessary services, especially with the continuation of the brutal war on the sector.\n\nIn this context, the Ministry stressed the need for the international community to stand firmly in line to confront this plan to avoid its disastrous humanitarian repercussions.\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs renewed the State of Qatar's full support for UNRWA, based on its firm and supportive position for the legitimate rights of the brotherly Palestinian people, foremost of which is their right to establish their independent state on the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.", "source": {"uri":

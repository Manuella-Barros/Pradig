It added that the army is attacking Ukrainian fighters trying to advance into the area from Ukraine's Sumy region.\n\n\"Attempts by individual units to break through deep into the territory in the Kursk direction are being suppressed,\" the ministry said.\n\nUkrainian troops had advanced as much as 9 miles into Russian territory, according to the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank.\n\nThe data hasn't been officially confirmed.\n\nKyiv has not commented on the incursion. In a video address to the nation late Thursday, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy did not mention the fighting in the Kursk region but emphasized that \"Russia brought the war to our land, and it should feel what it has done.\n\n\"Ukrainians know how to achieve their goals,\" Zelenskyy said, adding that he received three \"productive reports, exactly the kind our country needs now\" on Thursday from the commander of Ukraine's armed forces, Oleksandr Syrskyi.\n\nRussia says the military has stemmed Ukrainian advances in the border area about 320 miles southwest of Moscow, but military bloggers and open source data indicate Ukrainian troops have made gains in several areas in Kursk.\n\nThe Kursk region's acting governor, Alexei Smirnov, briefed Russian President Vladimir Putin on conditions there by video link Thursday. Smirnov said the region plans to equip gas stations with electronic warfare units and to provide them with unspecified armored defense.\n\nKursk regional authorities reported Wednesday that at least five civilians, including two ambulance workers, were killed. Russia's Health Ministry said 66 civilians, including nine children, have been wounded in the Kursk region in the three days of fighting.\n\nPutin, who described the incursion as a \"large-scale provocation\" that involved \"indiscriminate shelling of civilian buildings, residential houses and ambulances,\" was briefed on the situation by his top military and security officials on Wednesday.\n\nGen. Valery Gerasimov, the chief of the Russian military's General Staff, told Putin via video link that about 100 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed in the battle and more than 200 others were wounded.\n\nIt wasn't possible to independently verify the Russian claims. During the war, now in its third year, disinformation and propaganda have played a central role.\n\nWhatever the next step by Ukrainian forces, the attack appeared to push the limits on attacking inside Russia with American-provided equipment and put the Russians in disarray. American-made armored vehicles were also filmed being blown up in a Russian counterattack.\n\nThe goal was to shift the fighting -- and Russian soldiers and weaponry -- onto Russian territory and ease the pressure of Moscow's offensive in eastern Ukraine, a senior Ukrainian official said. He asked not to be cited by name, as Ukraine has not acknowledged its soldiers are fighting in Russia.\n\n\"We are at war,\" he said of striking inside enemy territory. \"Why Russia can and we cannot?\"\n\nSo far the assault has played out \"much more successfully\" than previous cross-border raids, the senior Ukrainian official said.\n\nOperating surreptitiously to evade Russian reconnaissance and spies, Ukraine gathered a force that Russia's top general has estimated at 1,000 soldiers for a mechanized assault on Russia's border, an audacious move after repeated setbacks over the past year and a half.\n\nSome analysts estimate that Ukraine has sent hundreds of troops into Russia, a major commitment as its forces are under pressure in the east. Gerasimov said in televised remarks that Ukraine deployed 1,000 soldiers.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, Russia's Ministry of Defense said it was destroying Ukrainian formations and repelling the attack.\n\nBut a prominent Russian military blogger who writes under the name of Rybar said Thursday that Ukrainian forces had Sudzha, the main town in the area, \"practically under full control.\" Videos from Sudzha, verified by The New York Times, show cars trying to leave amid sounds of gunshots and roads littered with burned vehicles and what appeared to be mines.\n\nJohn Kirby, the White House's national security spokesman, declined to comment on the operation and said the Biden administration has reached out to the Ukrainians to better understand the situation.\n\nA State Department spokesperson, Matthew Miller, said Wednesday that the use of U.S.-supplied weapons and munitions in the attack by Ukraine did not violate U.S. policy.\n\n\"Nothing about our policy has changed, and with the actions that they are taking today, they're not in violation of our policy,\" Miller said.\n\nThe cross-border foray would be among Ukraine's largest since Russia launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.\n\nSTRATEGIC DECISIONS\n\nKyiv's aim could be to draw Russian reserves to the area, potentially weakening Moscow's offensive operations in several parts of Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region, where Russian forces have increased attacks and are advancing gradually toward operationally significant gains.\n\nBut it could risk stretching outmanned Ukrainian troops farther along the front line, which is more than 620 miles long.\n\nEven if Russia were to commit reserves to stabilize the new front, given its vast manpower and the relatively small number of Ukrainian forces engaged in the operation, it would likely have little long-term impact. Pulling units from the front line to stabilize the Kursk region would also be time consuming.\n\nHowever, the operation could boost Ukrainian morale at a time when Kyiv's forces are facing relentless Russian attacks, with more expected in the coming weeks.\n\nMyhailo Podolyak, a top adviser to Zelenskyy, said Thursday that border region attacks will cause Russia to \"start to realize that the war is slowly creeping inside of Russian territory.\" He also suggested such an operation would improve Kyiv's hand in the event of negotiations with Moscow.\n\n\"When will it be possible to conduct a negotiation process in the way that we can push them or get something from them? Only when the war is not going on according to their scenarios,\" he said.\n\nAndriy Zagorodnyuk, a former Ukrainian defense minister who still advises the government, said the goal was not to hold the territory long-term, but rather to challenge the Russians, to \"divert their forces, attention and resources,\" and \"show they have no reserves and no resilience capacity.\"\n\nKonrad Muzyka, a military analyst for Rochan Consulting in Poland, writing in Ukraine Conflict Monitor, said Ukraine could benefit if the attack reduced Russian attacks in the Donetsk region of Ukraine and allowed Ukraine to maintain a presence in the Kursk area, and thus improve its negotiating position. But Ukraine would be the loser if its troops were pushed back with high losses, he said.\n\n\"There is no middle ground here,\" Muzyka wrote. \"The operation is daring. Let's see what the next few days bring.\"\n\nMilitary analysts say they are skeptical that Russia, which has a vastly larger army and arsenal of weapons than Ukraine, would be forced to divert forces from the fighting inside Ukraine to defend its border. Russia has reserves of conscript soldiers it is prohibited by its policies from deploying into Ukraine, but could on Russian soil.\n\nSeveral Ukrainian brigades stationed along the border region would not comment, along with Ukraine's Defense Ministry and General Staff.\n\nZelenskyy's administration offered its first commentary on the incursion Thursday in a statement by a senior adviser that did not acknowledge any Ukrainian role but portrayed Russians as collectively backing Putin's invasion, signaling the intention was not to affect morale inside Russia.\n\nThe adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, said Russians were not going to \"come out with flowers to greet the anti-Putin tanks,\" and noted that a million Russians had volunteered to serve in the country's military.\n\nThe Ukrainian push involves regular army units, analysts have noted, in a change from the previous incursions, which were carried out by armed groups of Russian exiles backed by Ukraine's army. That tactic offered Ukraine a veneer of noninvolvement.\n\nEuropean Union spokesperson Peter Stano told the Ukrainian news outlet Suspilne that Ukraine \"has the legal right to defend itself, including by striking at the aggressor on its territory.\"\n\nRussian forces have swiftly repelled previous cross-border incursions, but not before they caused damage and embarrassed authorities.\n\nResponsibility for previous incursions into Russia's Belgorod and Bryansk regions has been claimed by two murky groups: the Russian Volunteer Corps and the Freedom of Russia Legion, made up of Russian citizens who have fought alongside Ukrainian forces.\n\nThe Kursk region's border with Ukraine is 150 miles long, making it possible for saboteur groups to launch swift incursions and capture some ground before Russia deploys reinforcements.\n\nInformation for this article was contributed by staff writers of The Associated Press and by Andrew E.

presses on with offensive, hits Russian airbase", "body": "Map showing the border region between Russia and Ukraine where Ukrainian troops launched an attack on August 6 into Russian territory\n\nUkraine pressed on with a major cross-border incursion into Russia on Friday, also launching a significant air attack on a Russian airfield hundreds of kilometres behind the front lines.\n\nThe Ukrainian offensive into Russia's western Kursk region, launched Tuesday, appears to be the most significant attack on Russian soil since Moscow invaded in February 2022.\n\nRussia says around 1,000 Ukrainian troops and more than two dozen armoured vehicles and tanks were involved in the initial attack, though it has since claimed to have destroyed many more pieces of hardware.\n\nKyiv has not officially taken responsibility for the operation, but Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address on Thursday that Russia needed to \"feel\" the consequences of its invasion.\n\nUkraine said Friday it had carried out a massive air strike on a Russian military base in the Lipetsk region, around 280 kilometres (175 miles) from the Russia-Ukraine border.\n\nThe local Russian governor Igor Artamonov reported a \"massive\" drone attack overnight and Russian state news agencies said the airfield was on fire.\n\n\"Last night, the Ukrainian Defence Forces attacked the Lipetsk airfield,\" Ukraine's General Staff said in a post on Telegram.\n\nIt said it had struck \"warehouses containing guided aerial bombs and a number of other facilities\" and that a \"massive fire broke out\" with \"multiple detonations.\"\n\nArtamonov cancelled several public events in the region and issued evacuation orders for districts close to the air base.\n\n- 'Russia brought the war' -\n\nRussia's defence ministry said it destroyed 75 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 19 over the Lipetsk region and seven over Kursk, where Ukraine's four-day incursion has focused.\n\nSeveral nautical drones headed for the annexed peninsula of Crimea were also destroyed, it said.\n\nUkraine's surprise offensive into the Kursk region has appeared to catch Russia off guard, and triggered harsh criticism of the defence ministry by influential military bloggers.\n\nSenior Kyiv officials have stayed tight-lipped over the incursion, though some, including Zelensky have appeared to justify the attack.\n\n\"Russia brought the war to our land and should feel what it has done,\" Zelensky said on Thursday, without directly referring to the offensive.\n\n\"Everyone can see that the Ukraine army knows how to surprise, and knows how to achieve results,\" he said in another apparent reference to the incursion without explicitly mentioning it.\n\nMoscow has also not presented detailed information on the extent of the Ukrainian incursion.\n\nBut the independent US-based Institute for the Study of War said Ukraine had made significant territorial advances.\n\n\"Geolocated footage and Russian claims indicate that Ukrainian forces continued rapid advances further into Kursk Oblast on August 8 (Thursday), and Ukrainian forces are reportedly present in areas as far as 35 kilometers from the international border with Sumy Oblast\" in Ukraine, the institute said in its daily campaign assessment.\n\nIt cautioned, however, that Ukrainian forces \"most certainly do not control\" all of that territory.\n\nRussia's defence ministry said Thursday that its troops were \"continuing to destroy\" armed Ukrainian units and were using air strikes, rocket and artillery fire to try to push them back.\n\nIt said it had rushed in reserves and was \"thwarting attempts to break through\" deeper into the Kursk region.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has called the incursion a \"large-scale provocation\" by Kyiv, and Russia's top general vowed to crush it.\n\nIn a meeting with the local governor on Thursday, Putin said he needed to show \"courage\" and that Moscow was marshalling all state resources to deal with the situation.\n\nThe health ministry said 66 civilians were wounded, including nine children, in the first three days of the Ukrainian incursion.\n\nOn the first day of the assault, Kursk regional governor Alexei Smirnov said five civilians were killed.\n\nThousands have been evacuated from the region, with Russia putting on an extra train from the regional capital of Kursk to Moscow for those looking to leave.\n\nUkraine has also evacuated several thousand from the Sumy region, which sits across the border from Kursk.\n\nTwo people were killed there over the last 24 hours, Ukraine's interior ministry said Friday.\n\nThe US State Department and European Union have expressed support for Kyiv's right to defend itself from Russian aggression, without directly commenting on the operation.\n\nbur-jc/ach", "source": {"uri": "wfxg.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WFXG FOX54"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The data that has not been officially confirmed.\n\nKyiv has not commented on the incursion. In a video address to the nation late on Thursday, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky did not mention the fighting in the Kursk region but emphasised that \"Russia brought the war to our land, and it should feel what it has done.\"\n\n\"Ukrainians know how to achieve their goals,\" Mr Zelensky said, adding that he received three \"productive reports, exactly the kind our country needs now\" on Thursday from the commander of Ukraine's armed forces, Oleksandr Syrskyi.\n\nUkraine's audacious attack on Russia has forced Moscow to call in reserves, and is one of the biggest Ukrainian attacks on Russia of the two-year-old war.\n\nAround 1,000 Ukrainian troops rammed through the Russian border in the early hours of Tuesday (August 6) with tanks and armoured vehicles, covered in the air by drones and artillery, according to Russian officials.\n\nHeavy fighting was reported near the town of Sudzha, where Russian natural gas flows into Ukraine, raising concerns about a possible sudden stop to transit flows to Europe.\n\nThe incursion has come as a shock to Russia, nearly two-and-a-half years since President Vladimir Putin sent his army into Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nPutin has cast the Ukrainian offensive as a \"major provocation\". Sergei Mironov, leader of a Kremlin-loyal political party, called it a \"terrorist attack\" and \"the invasion of an internationally recognised foreign territory\".\n\nKursk's regional acting governor, Alexei Smirnov, said that thousands of residents had been evacuated.\n\nThe White House said the United States - Ukraine's biggest backer - had no prior knowledge of the attack. Washington has asked Ukraine for details on their military objectives, said a U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, on Thursday.\n\n\"They are operating within the area north of the border where we have told them they can use US-provided weapons to defend themselves against Russian attacks,\" the official noted.\n\nRussia's defence ministry said on Thursday that the army and the Federal Security Service (FSB) had halted the Ukrainian advance and were battling Ukrainian units in the Kursk region.\n\n\"Units of the Northern group of forces, together with the FSB of Russia, continue to destroy armed formations of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Sudzhensky and Korenevsky districts of the Kursk region, directly adjacent to the Russian-Ukrainian border,\" the ministry said.\n\nSome Russian bloggers said Ukraine's forces were pushing towards the Kursk nuclear power station, which lies about 60 km (37 miles) northeast of Sudzha.\n\nYuri Podolyaka, a popular Ukrainian-born, pro-Russian military blogger, said that there were intense battles about 30 km (20 miles) from the Soviet-era nuclear plant, which supplies a large swathe of southern Russia with

Though he hasn't overtly claimed the maneuver, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky explained his country's most deliberate attempt to bring the war to Russia as a way to make Russia \"feel what it has done\" to Ukraine by initiating the war.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Thursday that Russia needed to \"feel\" the consequences of its war as a major Ukrainian incursion across the Russian border stretched into a third day.\n\nPro-Kyiv forces stormed into Russia's southwestern Kursk region on Tuesday morning, deploying around 1,000 troops and more than two dozen armoured vehicles and tanks, according to the Russian army.\n\nIt appears to be the most significant Ukrainian attack into Russia since the war began, with independent analysts suggesting Kyiv's troops had advanced up to 10 kilometres into Russia.\n\n\"Russia brought the war to our land and should feel what it has done,\" Zelensky said in his evening address, without directly referring to the offensive.\n\n\"Ukrainians know how to achieve their goals. And we did not choose to achieve our goals in the war,\" he added.\n\nRussia's defence ministry said Thursday its troops were \"continuing to destroy\" armed Ukrainian units and were using air strikes, rocket and artillery fire to try to push them back.\n\nIt said it had rushed in reserves and was \"thwarting attempts to break through\" deeper into the Kursk region.\n\nThe independent US-based Institute for the Study of War said Ukraine had made significant territorial gains in the first two days of the incursion.\n\n\"Ukrainian forces have made confirmed advances up to 10 kilometres (six miles) into Russia's Kursk Oblast amid continued mechanised offensive operations on Russian territory,\" it said in its latest update.\n\n\"The current confirmed extent and location of Ukrainian advances in Kursk Oblast indicate that Ukrainian forces have penetrated at least two Russian defensive lines and a stronghold,\" it added.\n\n'Entrenching'\n\nKyiv has not officially taken responsibility for the operation, but an aide to Zelensky said Moscow was to blame for the incursion.\n\n\"The root cause of any escalation, shelling, military actions, forced evacuations and destruction of normal life forms -- including within the Russian Federation's own territories like Kursk and Belgorod regions -- is solely Russia's unequivocal aggression,\" presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak said Thursday on social media.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has called it a \"large-scale provocation\" by Kyiv and Russia's top general vowed on Wednesday to crush the incursion.\n\nThe US State Department expressed support for Kyiv without directly commenting on the operation.\n\nThe surprise attack appeared to catch Russia's army off guard, triggering criticism of its top brass by the country's influential military bloggers.\n\nThe Ukrainian advance has centred on the logistical hub of Sudzha, a town of around 5,000 inhabitants located eight kilometres from the Ukrainian border.\n\nRussian military bloggers, who have links to the army, also reported Thursday that Kyiv had made significant advances.\n\n\"The situation is complicated and continues to worsen,\" blogger Yury Podolyaka said in a post on Telegram.\n\n\"Sudzha has been completely lost,\" he said.\n\nResidents evacuated from Sudzha also reported a difficult situation, according to images shared by Russia's LDPR party.\n\n\"The situation is bad. There's no communication\" with those who stayed behind, said Alexei, an ambulance worker waiting to receive humanitarian aid.\n\nAnother man also called Alexei, a volunteer, said the evacuees \"feel abandoned\".\n\nThe Dva Mayora Telegram channel said Ukraine was \"entrenching, indicating that the fighting is likely to be long-term\".\n\nThousands evacuated\n\nMany reported Ukrainian troops had advanced towards the town of Korenevo, more than 25 kilometres from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAFP could not verify those reports.\n\nRussian energy giant Gazprom said on Thursday it would continue shipping gas through the Sudzha metering station, the last transit point for Russian gas heading to Europe via Ukraine.\n\nMoscow also said its forces had destroyed a US-made Bradley Fighting Vehicle that Ukraine was using in the incursion.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry had initially blamed a pro-Ukrainian \"sabotage group\" for the raid, but it has since said Ukraine's army is carrying it out.\n\nPro-Kyiv militia, including those made up of Russian citizens fighting against Moscow, have previously staged several cross-border raids.\n\nBut the latest incursion into the Kursk region appears to be the most successful and organised attempt by Ukraine to penetrate Russian territory.\n\nKyiv's objectives remain unclear, with some analysts suggesting it is an attempt to stretch Russia's army, forcing them to move units away from the eastern Donetsk region where they have been advancing.\n\nThe governor of Kursk declared a state of emergency in the region on Wednesday evening, a move that gives authorities the power to restrict movement in a bid to bring the situation under control.\n\nSeveral thousand people have been evacuated on both sides of the border.",

Sergei Mironov, the leader of a Kremlin-loyal political party, called it a \"terrorist attack\" and \"the invasion of an internationally recognised foreign territory\".\n\nKursk's regional acting governor, Alexei Smirnov, said thousands of residents had been evacuated.\n\nThe White House said the United States - Ukraine's biggest backer - had no prior knowledge of the attack.\n\nPentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said Ukraine's move on the Kursk region was consistent with US policy.\n\n\"They are taking actions to protect themselves from attacks that are coming from a region that are within the US policy of where they can operate, our weapons, our systems, our capabilities,\" Singh told reporters.\n\nShe said Ukraine's move was not escalatory because \"Ukraine is doing what it needs to do to be successful on the battlefield.\"\n\nRussia's defence ministry said on Thursday that the army and the Federal Security Service (FSB) had halted Ukraine's advance and were battling Kyiv's units in the Kursk region.\n\n\"Units of the Northern group of forces, together with the FSB of Russia, continue to destroy armed formations of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Sudzhensky and Korenevsky districts of the Kursk region, directly adjacent to the Russian-Ukrainian border,\" the ministry said.\n\nThe Ukrainian military has remained silent on the Kursk offensive, though President Volodymyr Zelenskyy praised the Ukrainian army on Thursday for its ability \"to surprise\" and achieve results. He did not explicitly reference Kursk.\n\nSome Russian bloggers said Ukraine's forces were pushing towards the Kursk nuclear power station, which lies about 60 km northeast of Sudzha.\n\nYuri Podolyaka, a popular Ukrainian-born, pro-Russian military blogger, said that there were intense battles about 30 km from the Soviet-era nuclear plant, which supplies a large swathe of southern Russia with power.\n\nUkraine's energy minister said gas transit via Sudzha was functioning, despite reports of hostilities there. Most EU nations have reduced dependence on Russian gas, but Austria still receives most of its gas via Ukraine.\n\nThe Center for Information Resilience (CIR), a non-profit open-source analysis organisation, said it was unable to visually confirm any damage to the gas metering station as a result of the incursion, but had verified significant damage to the border checkpoint about 500 metres to the south.\n\n\"This, combined with footage verified by CIR of several Russian soldiers surrendering to Ukrainian soldiers near the entrance of the gas metering plant, makes it likely that the plant has been affected by the Ukrainian incursion, however, the level of damage cannot be verified at this time,\" it said.\n\nThe battles come at a crucial juncture in the conflict, the biggest land war in Europe since World War Two. Kyiv is concerned that US support could weaken if Republican Donald Trump wins the November presidential election.\n\nTrump has said he would end the war, and both Russia and Ukraine are keen to gain the strongest possible bargaining position on the battlefield.\n\nUkraine wants to pin down Russian forces, which control 18% of its territory, though the strategic significance of the border offensive was not immediately clear.\n\nFormer Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said the Ukrainian attack was an attempt to force Moscow to divert resources from the front and to show the West that Ukraine could still fight.\n\nAs a result of the Kursk attack, Medvedev said, Russia should expand its war aims to include taking all of Ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "euractiv.com", "dataType":

And we did not choose to achieve our goals in the war,\" he added.\n\nRussia's defence ministry said Thursday its troops were \"continuing to destroy\" armed Ukrainian units and were using air strikes, rocket and artillery fire to try to push them back.\n\nIt said it had rushed in reserves and was \"thwarting attempts to break through\" deeper into the Kursk region.\n\nThe independent US-based Institute for the Study of War said Ukraine had made significant territorial gains in the first two days of the incursion.\n\n\"Ukrainian forces have made confirmed advances up to 10 kilometres (six miles) into Russia's Kursk Oblast amid continued mechanised offensive operations on Russian territory,\" it said in its latest update.\n\n\"The current confirmed extent and location of Ukrainian advances in Kursk Oblast indicate that Ukrainian forces have penetrated at least two Russian defensive lines and a stronghold,\" it added.\n\n- 'Entrenching' -\n\nKyiv has not officially taken responsibility for the operation, but an aide to Zelensky said Moscow was to blame for the incursion.\n\n\"The root cause of any escalation, shelling, military actions, forced evacuations and destruction of normal life forms -- including within the Russian Federation's own territories like Kursk and Belgorod regions -- is solely Russia's unequivocal aggression,\" presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak said Thursday on social media.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has called it a \"large-scale provocation\" by Kyiv and Russia's top general vowed on Wednesday to crush the incursion.\n\nThe US State Department expressed support for Kyiv without directly commenting on the operation.\n\nThe surprise attack appeared to catch Russia's army off guard, triggering criticism of its top brass by the country's influential military bloggers.\n\nThe Ukrainian advance has centred on the logistical hub of Sudzha, a town of around 5,000 inhabitants located eight kilometres from the Ukrainian border.\n\nRussian military bloggers, who have links to the army, also reported Thursday that Kyiv had made significant advances.\n\n\"The situation is complicated and continues to worsen,\" blogger Yury Podolyaka said in a post on Telegram.\n\n\"Sudzha has been completely lost,\" he said.\n\nResidents evacuated from Sudzha also reported a difficult situation, according to images shared by Russia's LDPR party.\n\n\"The situation is bad. There's no communication\" with those who stayed behind, said Alexei, an ambulance worker waiting to receive humanitarian aid.\n\nAnother man also called Alexei, a volunteer, said the evacuees \"feel abandoned\".\n\nThe Dva Mayora Telegram channel said Ukraine was \"entrenching, indicating that the fighting is likely to be long-term\".\n\n- Thousands evacuated -\n\nMany reported Ukrainian troops had advanced towards the town of Korenevo, more than 25 kilometres from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAFP could not verify those reports.\n\nRussian energy giant Gazprom said on Thursday it would continue shipping gas through the Sudzha metering station, the last transit point for Russian gas heading to Europe via Ukraine.\n\nMoscow also said its forces had destroyed a US-made Bradley Fighting Vehicle that Ukraine was using in the incursion.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry had initially blamed a pro-Ukrainian \"sabotage group\" for the raid, but it has since said Ukraine's army is carrying it out.\n\nPro-Kyiv militia, including those made up of Russian citizens fighting against Moscow, have previously staged several cross-border raids.\n\nBut the latest incursion into the Kursk region appears to be the most successful and organised attempt by Ukraine to penetrate Russian territory.\n\nKyiv's objectives remain unclear, with some analysts suggesting it is an attempt to stretch Russia's army, forcing them to move units away from the eastern Donetsk region where they have been advancing.\n\nThe governor of Kursk declared a state of emergency in the region on Wednesday evening, a move that gives authorities the power to restrict movement in a bid to bring the situation under control.\n\nSeveral thousand people have been evacuated on both sides of the border.",

The incursion has come as a shock to Russia, nearly 2-1/2 years after President Vladimir Putin sent his army into Ukraine.\n\nPutin has cast the Ukrainian offensive as a \"major provocation\". Sergei Mironov, the leader of a Kremlin-loyal political party, called it a \"terrorist attack\" and \"the invasion of an internationally recognised foreign territory\".\n\nKursk's regional acting governor, Alexei Smirnov, said thousands of residents had been evacuated. The White House said the United States - Ukraine's biggest backer - had no prior knowledge of the attack.\n\nPentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said Ukraine's move on the Kursk region was consistent with U.S. policy.\n\n\"They are taking actions to protect themselves from attacks that are coming from a region that are within the U.S. policy of where they can operate, our weapons, our systems, our capabilities,\" Singh told reporters.\n\nShe said Ukraine's move was not escalatory because \"Ukraine is doing what it needs to do to be successful on the battlefield.\"\n\nRussia's defence ministry said on Thursday that the army and the Federal Security Service (FSB) had halted Ukraine's advance and were battling Kyiv's units in the Kursk region.\n\n\"Units of the Northern group of forces, together with the FSB of Russia, continue to destroy armed formations of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Sudzhensky and Korenevsky districts of the Kursk region, directly adjacent to the Russian-Ukrainian border,\" the ministry said.\n\nThe Ukrainian military has remained silent on the Kursk offensive, though President Volodymyr Zelenskiy praised the Ukrainian army on Thursday for its ability \"to surprise\" and achieve results. He did not explicitly reference Kursk.\n\nSome Russian bloggers said Ukraine's forces were pushing towards the Kursk nuclear power station, which lies about 60 km (37 miles) northeast of Sudzha. Yuri Podolyaka, a popular Ukrainian-born, pro-Russian military blogger, said that there were intense battles about 30 km from the Soviet-era nuclear plant, which supplies a large swathe of southern Russia with power.\n\nUkraine's energy minister said gas transit via Sudzha was functioning, despite reports of hostilities there. Most EU nations have reduced dependence on Russian gas, but Austria still receives most of its gas via Ukraine.\n\nThe Center for Information Resilience (CIR), a non-profit open-source analysis organisation, said it was unable to visually confirm any damage to the gas metering station as a result of the incursion, but had verified significant damage to the border checkpoint about 500 metres (550 yards) to the south.\n\n\"This, combined with footage verified by CIR of several Russian soldiers surrendering to Ukrainian soldiers near the entrance of the gas metering plant, makes it likely that the plant has been affected by the Ukrainian incursion, however, the level of damage cannot be verified at this time,\" it said.\n\nThe battles come at a crucial juncture in the conflict, the biggest land war in Europe since World War Two. Kyiv is concerned that U.S. support could weaken if Republican Donald Trump wins the November presidential election.\n\nTrump has said he would end the war, and both Russia and Ukraine are keen to gain the strongest possible bargaining position on the battlefield.\n\nUkraine wants to pin down Russian forces, which control 18% of its territory, though the strategic significance of the border offensive was not immediately clear.\n\nFormer Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said the Ukrainian attack was an attempt to force Moscow to divert resources from the front and to show the West that Ukraine could still fight.\n\nAs a result of the Kursk attack, Medvedev said, Russia should expand its war aims to include taking all of Ukraine.\n\nHe said Moscow's \"Special Military Operation\" should acquire an \"openly extraterritorial character\", with Russian troops moving on Odesa, Kharkiv, Dnipro, Mykolayiv, Kyiv \"and beyond\".", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news",

And we did not choose to achieve our goals in the war,\" he added.\n\nRussia says at least 1,000 Ukrainian troops, supported by tanks and armoured vehicles, entered its territory on Tuesday morning - in what appears to be one of the largest assaults on Russian soil since the war began.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin earlier accused Ukraine of a \"major provocation\".\n\nUkrainian officials have been largely silent on the offensive. The exact situation on the ground is hard to determine, with few specific details released by either side.\n\n\"Everyone can see that the Ukrainian army knows how to surprise [and] achieve results,\" the Ukrainian president said earlier on Thursday, without directly referencing the assault.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said it was monitoring Kursk's nuclear plant, according to state-owned Russian news agency RIA-Novosti.\n\nRussia's defence ministry said on Thursday that its troops were \"continuing to destroy\" armed Ukrainian units with air strikes, rockets and artillery fire.\n\nThe ministry said Russian reserves had been rushed to the region.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War, a well-respected think tank, said geo-located footage showed Ukrainian armoured vehicles had advanced to positions 10km (6.2 miles) into the Kursk region in the first two days of the incursion.\n\nRussia's military leadership is under severe scrutiny domestically, as some popular and generally well-informed pro-war Telegram channels have said the situation on the ground is not as stable as the Kremlin has suggested.\n\nThe influential pro-war Rybar Telegram channel strongly criticised the highest ranks of the Russian military on Wednesday, saying that \"for two months the full information was sent to the useless headquarters\", adding that there was enough time \"to make an appropriate decision\".\n\nIn a publicised video call with Mr Putin on Thursday, Kursk regional governor Alexei Smirnov said buses and trains were being used to evacuate people to other Russian regions that had offered to accommodate them.\n\nThe efforts were being hampered by Ukrainian shelling, he added.\n\nPosts from his Telegram account continued to warn Kursk residents of missile strikes throughout the night and into Friday morning.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry said in a statement on Telegram on Friday morning that it had intercepted and destroyed 75 UAV missiles, which had flown over regions including Kursk.\n\nRussian state news agencies reported early on Friday that a fire had broken out at a military airfield in the neighbouring Lipetsk region. It was not clear what caused the fire or whether it was related to the fighting in Kursk.\n\nA red threat level alert had been issued in Lipetsk, but was later lifted on Friday morning. The regional governor Igor Artamonov earlier said an energy infrastructure facility had been damaged and power supply disruptions reported.\n\nLocal leaders in regions adjacent to Kursk, in both Russia and Ukraine, also told residents to leave for their safety.\n\nOn Wednesday, the head of the Ukrainian region of Sumy, Volodymyr Artyukh, ordered the evacuation of areas bordering Kursk.\n\nIn the Russian region of Belgorod, governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Thursday that settlements across his province had been attacked by Ukrainian forces over the past 24 hours.\n\nUkraine's key allies seemed surprised by the offensive - with White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre saying the US was reaching out to Ukraine to better understand what it hoped to achieve.\n\nThis is not the first incursion into Russia by fighters based in Ukraine. Some groups of anti-Kremlin Russians launched raids last year, which were repelled.\n\nThe forces crossed into the Belgorod and Kursk regions again in March, where they engaged in clashes with Russian security forces.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Ukrainian MP Oleksiy Honcharenko said the Ukrainian army had established control over the Sudzha gas hub, a major facility involved in the transit of natural gas from Russia to the EU via Ukraine, which has continued despite the war.\n\nIt is the only point of entry for Russian gas into the EU.\n\nAs of Thursday, gas was reportedly still flowing from Sudzha.\n\nRussia's National Guard said it had reinforced security around Kursk's nuclear power station, which lies some 70km north-east of Sudzha.\n\nFor the past few months Russia has made incremental gains in eastern Ukraine, as many of Kyiv's ground forces have faced relentless attacks in the eastern Donbas region.\n\nIn a recent interview, Ukraine's head of defence intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov, said the main offensive by Russian forces \"is expected to be over in a month and a half to two months\".", "source": {"uri": "the-star.co.ke", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

"body": "Ukraine pressed on with a major cross-border incursion into Russia on Friday, also launching a significant air attack on a Russian airfield hundreds of kilometres behind the front lines.\n\nThe Ukrainian offensive into Russia's western Kursk region, launched Tuesday, appears to be the most significant attack on Russian soil since Moscow invaded in February 2022.\n\nRussia says around 1,000 Ukrainian troops and more than two dozen armoured vehicles and tanks were involved in the initial attack, though it has since claimed to have destroyed many more pieces of hardware.\n\nKyiv has not officially taken responsibility for the operation, but Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address on Thursday that Russia needed to \"feel\" the consequences of its invasion.\n\nUkraine said Friday it had carried out a massive air strike on a Russian military base in the Lipetsk region, around 280 kilometres (175 miles) from the Russia-Ukraine border.\n\nThe local Russian governor Igor Artamonov reported a \"massive\" drone attack overnight and Russian state news agencies said the airfield was on fire.\n\n\"Last night, the Ukrainian Defence Forces attacked the Lipetsk airfield,\" Ukraine's General Staff said in a post on Telegram.\n\nIt said it had struck \"warehouses containing guided aerial bombs and a number of other facilities\" and that a \"massive fire broke out\" with \"multiple detonations.\"\n\nArtamonov cancelled several public events in the region and issued evacuation orders for districts close to the air base.\n\nRussia's defence ministry said it destroyed 75 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 19 over the Lipetsk region and seven over Kursk, where Ukraine's four-day incursion has focused.\n\nSeveral nautical drones headed for the annexed peninsula of Crimea were also destroyed, it said.\n\nUkraine's surprise offensive into the Kursk region has appeared to catch Russia off guard, and triggered harsh criticism of the defence ministry by influential military bloggers.\n\nSenior Kyiv officials have stayed tight-lipped over the incursion, though some, including Zelensky have appeared to justify the attack.\n\n\"Russia brought the war to our land and should feel what it has done,\" Zelensky said on Thursday, without directly referring to the offensive.\n\n\"Everyone can see that the Ukraine army knows how to surprise, and knows how to achieve results,\" he said in another apparent reference to the incursion without explicitly mentioning it.\n\nMoscow has also not presented detailed information on the extent of the Ukrainian incursion.\n\nBut the independent US-based Institute for the Study of War said Ukraine had made significant territorial advances.\n\n\"Geolocated footage and Russian claims indicate that Ukrainian forces continued rapid advances further into Kursk Oblast on August 8 (Thursday), and Ukrainian forces are reportedly present in areas as far as 35 kilometers from the international border with Sumy Oblast\" in Ukraine, the institute said in its daily campaign assessment.\n\nIt cautioned, however, that Ukrainian forces \"most certainly do not control\" all of that territory.\n\nRussia's defence ministry said Thursday that its troops were \"continuing to destroy\" armed Ukrainian units and were using air strikes, rocket and artillery fire to try to push them back.\n\nIt said it had rushed in reserves and was \"thwarting attempts to break through\" deeper into the Kursk region.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has called the incursion a \"large-scale provocation\" by Kyiv, and Russia's top general vowed to crush it.\n\nIn a meeting with the local governor on Thursday, Putin said he needed to show \"courage\" and that Moscow was marshalling all state resources to deal with the situation.\n\nThe health ministry said 66 civilians were wounded, including nine children, in the first three days of the Ukrainian incursion.\n\nOn the first day of the assault, Kursk regional governor Alexei Smirnov said five civilians were killed.\n\nThousands have been evacuated from the region, with Russia putting on an extra train from the regional capital of Kursk to Moscow for those looking to leave.\n\nUkraine has also evacuated several thousand from the Sumy region, which sits across the border from Kursk.\n\nTwo people were killed there over the last 24 hours, Ukraine's interior ministry said Friday.\n\nThe US State Department and European Union have expressed support for Kyiv's right to defend itself from Russian aggression, without directly commenting on the operation.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times AU"}, "authors":

Sergei Mironov, leader of a Kremlin-loyal political party, called it a \"terrorist attack\" and \"the invasion of an internationally recognized foreign territory\".\n\nKursk's regional acting governor, Alexei Smirnov, said that thousands of residents had been evacuated.\n\nThe White House said the United States - Ukraine's biggest backer - had no prior knowledge of the attack. Washington has asked Ukraine for details on their military objectives, said a U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, on Thursday.\n\n\"They are operating within the area north of the border where we have told them they can use U.S.-provided weapons to defend themselves against Russian attacks,\" the official noted.\n\nRussia's defense ministry said on Thursday that the army and the Federal Security Service (FSB) had halted the Ukrainian advance and were battling Ukrainian units in the Kursk region.\n\n\"Units of the Northern group of forces, together with the FSB of Russia, continue to destroy armed formations of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Sudzhensky and Korenevsky districts of the Kursk region, directly adjacent to the Russian-Ukrainian border,\" the ministry said.\n\nThe Ukrainian military has remained silent on the Kursk offensive, though President Volodymyr Zelenskiy praised the Ukrainian army on Thursday for its ability \"to surprise\" and achieve results. He did not explicitly reference Kursk.\n\nSome Russian bloggers said Ukraine's forces were pushing towards the Kursk nuclear power station, which lies about 60 km northeast of Sudzha.\n\nYuri Podolyaka, a popular Ukrainian-born, pro-Russian military blogger, said that there were intense battles about 30 km from the Soviet-era nuclear plant, which supplies a large swathe of southern Russia with power.\n\nCRITICAL JUNCTURE\n\nUkraine's energy minister said gas transit via Sudzha was still functioning, despite reports of hostilities there. Most EU nations have reduced their dependence on Russian gas, but Austria is one country that still receives most of its gas via Ukraine.\n\nThe Center for Information Resilience, a non-profit open-source analysis organization, said it was unable to visually confirm any damage to the gas metering station as a result of the incursion, but had verified significant damage to the border checkpoint about 500 metres (550 yards) to the south.\n\n\"This, combined with footage verified by CIR of several Russian soldiers surrendering to Ukrainian soldiers near the entrance of the gas metering plant, makes it likely that the plant has been affected by the Ukrainian incursion, however, the level of damage cannot be verified at this time,\" it said.\n\nThe battles come at a crucial juncture in the conflict, the biggest land war in Europe since World War Two. Kyiv is concerned that U.S. support could weaken if Republican Donald Trump wins the November presidential election.\n\nTrump has said he would end the war, and both Russia and Ukraine are keen to gain the strongest possible bargaining position on the battlefield.\n\nUkraine wants to pin down Russian forces, which control 18% of its territory, though the strategic significance of the border offensive was not immediately clear.\n\nFormer Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said the Ukrainian attack was an attempt to force Russia to divert resources from the front and to show the West that Ukraine could still fight.\n\nAs a result of the Kursk attack, Medvedev said, Russia should expand its war aims to include taking all of Ukraine.\n\n\"From this moment on, the SVO (Special Military Operation) should acquire an openly extraterritorial character,\" Medvedev said, adding that Russian forces should go to Odesa, Kharkiv, Dnipro, Mykolayiv, Kyiv \"and beyond\".\n\n\"We will stop only when we consider it acceptable and profitable for ourselves.\"\n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2024.", "source": {"uri": "japantoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Japan Today"}, "authors": [],

Around 1,000 Ukrainian troops supported by tanks and armoured combat vehicles crossed into Russia on August 6 through the border, taking Russia by surprise.\n\nAs per an official statement from Russia, its military and border guards have blocked Ukrainian forces from pushing deeper into the region in the southwestern part of the country and the Army is attacking Ukrainian fighters trying to advance into the area from Ukraine's Sumy region. \"Attempts by individual units to break through deep into the territory in the Kursk direction are being suppressed,\" the ministry said.\n\nThe attack has not been acknowledged by Ukraine but it would be among its largest assault since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, and unprecedented for its deployment of Ukrainian military units on the front lines in the country's east. Kyiv's aim could be to draw Russian reserves to the area, potentially weakening Moscow's offensive operations in several parts of Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region where Russian forces have increased attacks and are advancing gradually toward operationally significant gains.\n\n100 Ukrainian soldiers killed, Putin decries 'provocation'\n\nRussia says the military has stemmed Ukrainian advances in the border area about 500 kilometres (about 320 miles) southwest of Moscow, but military bloggers and open-source data indicate Ukrainian troops have made gains in several areas in Kursk. The Kursk region's acting governor, Alexei Smirnov, briefed Russian President Vladimir Putin on conditions there by video link on Thursday.\n\nStudy of War, a Washington-based think tank, said Ukrainian troops had advanced as much as 15 kilometres (9 miles) into Russian territory, but the data is yet to be confirmed. In a video address to the nation late Thursday, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy did not mention the fighting in the Kursk region, but said \"Russia brought the war to our land, and it should feel what it has done.\"\n\nGeneral Valery Gerasimov, the chief of the Russian military's General Staff, told Putin via video link that about 100 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed in the battle and more than 200 others were wounded. at least five civilians, including two ambulance workers, have also been killed in the attack, as per regional authorities.\n\nPutin, who described the incursion as a \"large-scale provocation\" that involved \"indiscriminate shelling of civilian buildings, residential houses and ambulances\" was briefed on the situation by his top military and security officials on Wednesday. He instructed the Cabinet to coordinate assistance to the Kursk region.\n\nUkraine launches 'massive' drone attack\n\nMeanwhile, Russia began evacuating people from parts of its western region of Lipetsk after a massive attack\" by Ukrainian drones caused explosions, disrupted power supply, and wounded six people, regional governor Igor Artamonov said. Four villages were being evacuated after a state of emergency was declared in the Lipetsk municipal district, according to Artamonov.\n\nA fire had broken out at the air base outside the city of Lipetsk, the Interfax news agency reported local emergency officials as saying. Calls on social media to evacuate the entire city were part of a campaign of psychological warfare by Ukraine, accused the regional governor. Ukrainian authorities have not reported any strikes on the Lipetsk region.\n\nRisks for Ukrainian soldiers\n\nThe operation could boost Ukrainian morale at a time when Kyiv's forces are facing relentless Russian attacks and are expected to face more in the coming weeks. However, it could risk stretching outmanned Ukrainian troops further along the front line, which is more than 1,000 kilometres (620 miles) long. Even if Russia were to commit reserves to stabilise the new front, given its vast manpower and the relatively small number of Ukrainian forces engaged in the operation, it would likely have little long-term impact.\n\nRussian forces have swiftly repelled previous cross-border incursions, but not before they caused damage and embarrassed authorities. Smirnov said the region plans to equip gas stations with electronic warfare units and to provide them with unspecified armoured defence.\n\nMeanwhile, the US Defence Department, or Pentagon, said Ukraine's move on the Kursk region was consistent with US policy. \"They are taking actions to protect themselves from attacks that are coming from a region that are within the US policy of where they can operate, our weapons, our systems, our capabilities,\" Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters.\n\n(with inputs from agencies)", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType":

Sergei Mironov, the leader of a Kremlin-loyal political party, called it a \"terrorist attack\" and \"the invasion of an internationally recognised foreign territory\".\n\nKursk's regional acting governor, Alexei Smirnov, said thousands of residents had been evacuated.\n\nThe White House said the United States - Ukraine's biggest backer - had no prior knowledge of the attack.\n\nPentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said Ukraine's move on the Kursk region was consistent with U.S. policy.\n\n\"They are taking actions to protect themselves from attacks that are coming from a region that are within the U.S. policy of where they can operate, our weapons, our systems, our capabilities,\" Singh told reporters.\n\nShe said Ukraine's move was not escalatory because \"Ukraine is doing what it needs to do to be successful on the battlefield.\"\n\nRussia's defence ministry said on Thursday that the army and the Federal Security Service (FSB) had halted Ukraine's advance and were battling Kyiv's units in the Kursk region.\n\n\"Units of the Northern group of forces, together with the FSB of Russia, continue to destroy armed formations of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Sudzhensky and Korenevsky districts of the Kursk region, directly adjacent to the Russian-Ukrainian border,\" the ministry said.\n\nThe Ukrainian military has remained silent on the Kursk offensive, though President Volodymyr Zelenskiy praised the Ukrainian army on Thursday for its ability \"to surprise\" and achieve results. He did not explicitly reference Kursk.\n\nSome Russian bloggers said Ukraine's forces were pushing towards the Kursk nuclear power station, which lies about 60 km (37 miles) northeast of Sudzha.\n\nYuri Podolyaka, a popular Ukrainian-born, pro-Russian military blogger, said that there were intense battles about 30 km from the Soviet-era nuclear plant, which supplies a large swathe of southern Russia with power.\n\nCRITICAL JUNCTURE\n\nUkraine's energy minister said gas transit via Sudzha was functioning, despite reports of hostilities there. Most EU nations have reduced dependence on Russian gas, but Austria still receives most of its gas via Ukraine.\n\nThe Center for Information Resilience (CIR), a non-profit open-source analysis organisation, said it was unable to visually confirm any damage to the gas metering station as a result of the incursion, but had verified significant damage to the border checkpoint about 500 metres (550 yards) to the south.\n\n\"This, combined with footage verified by CIR of several Russian soldiers surrendering to Ukrainian soldiers near the entrance of the gas metering plant, makes it likely that the plant has been affected by the Ukrainian incursion, however, the level of damage cannot be verified at this time,\" it said.\n\nThe battles come at a crucial juncture in the conflict, the biggest land war in Europe since World War Two. Kyiv is concerned that U.S. support could weaken if Republican Donald Trump wins the November presidential election.\n\nTrump has said he would end the war, and both Russia and Ukraine are keen to gain the strongest possible bargaining position on the battlefield.\n\nUkraine wants to pin down Russian forces, which control 18% of its territory, though the strategic significance of the border offensive was not immediately clear.\n\nFormer Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said the Ukrainian attack was an attempt to force Moscow to divert resources from the front and to show the West that Ukraine could still fight.\n\nAs a result of the Kursk attack, Medvedev said, Russia should expand its war aims to include taking all of Ukraine.\n\nHe said Moscow's \"Special Military Operation\" should acquire an \"openly extraterritorial character\", with Russian troops moving on Odesa, Kharkiv, Dnipro, Mykolayiv, Kyiv \"and beyond\".", "source": {"uri": "cyprus-mail.com", "dataType":

And it was not our choice to achieve war goals,\" he added.\n\nUkrainian officials have remained largely silent on the offensive. The exact situation on the ground is difficult to determine, as both sides have not provided concrete information.\n\n\"Everyone can see that the Ukrainian army knows how to surprise [and] achieve results,\" the Ukrainian president said earlier on Thursday, without directly referring to the offensive.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry said on Thursday that its troops \"continue to destroy\" armed Ukrainian units with air strikes, missiles and artillery fire, while sending Russian reserve forces to the region.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War has stated that Ukrainian armoured vehicles have advanced in the Kursk region during the first two days of the incursion, taking up positions at a 10km depth.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian military actions are being analysed in the country, with prominent pro-Kremlin Telegram channels such as Rybar criticising top brass for ignoring warnings, saying that \"for two months all information was sent to the useless headquarters\", adding that there was enough time to \"make an appropriate decision\".\n\nKursk Governor Alexei Smirnov said in a video call with President Putin on Thursday that evacuations to other regions of Russia were continuing, although hampered by Ukrainian shelling.\n\nLocal leaders in both Russia and Ukraine have called on people in nearby regions to evacuate for their own safety.\n\nThroughout the night on Friday and into Friday morning, posts on Smirnov's Telegram account\n\nwarned Kursk residents of missile strikes, while the Russian defence ministry claimed on Friday morning that 75 missiles had been intercepted.\n\nRussian state news agencies reported early on Friday morning that a fire had broken out at a military airfield in the neighbouring town of Lipetsk, although the cause was unclear. A red alert was briefly issued in Lipetsk, with the region's governor, Igor Artamonov, saying that an energy facility had been damaged, causing power outages.\n\nThe White House said it had no prior knowledge of a Ukrainian attack on Russia's Kursk region, while Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh confirmed that the move was in line with US policy.\n\nSingh explained that Ukraine was \"acting to protect itself\" and stressed that the operation was not escalatory because \"Ukraine is doing what it needs to do to succeed on the battlefield\".\n\nAlso read: State of emergency declared in Kursk

And we did not choose to achieve our goals in the war,\" he added.\n\nRussia's defence ministry said Thursday its troops were \"continuing to destroy\" armed Ukrainian units and were using air strikes, rocket and artillery fire to try to push them back.\n\nIt said it had rushed in reserves and was \"thwarting attempts to break through\" deeper into the Kursk region.\n\nThe independent US-based Institute for the Study of War said Ukraine had made significant territorial gains in the first two days of the incursion.\n\n\"Ukrainian forces have made confirmed advances up to 10 kilometres (six miles) into Russia's Kursk Oblast amid continued mechanised offensive operations on Russian territory,\" it said in its latest update.\n\n\"The current confirmed extent and location of Ukrainian advances in Kursk Oblast indicate that Ukrainian forces have penetrated at least two Russian defensive lines and a stronghold,\" it added.\n\nKyiv has not officially taken responsibility for the operation, but an aide to Zelensky said Moscow was to blame for the incursion.\n\n\"The root cause of any escalation, shelling, military actions, forced evacuations and destruction of normal life forms -- including within the Russian Federation's own territories like Kursk and Belgorod regions -- is solely Russia's unequivocal aggression,\" presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak said Thursday on social media.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has called it a \"large-scale provocation\" by Kyiv and Russia's top general vowed on Wednesday to crush the incursion.\n\nThe US State Department expressed support for Kyiv without directly commenting on the operation.\n\nThe surprise attack appeared to catch Russia's army off guard, triggering criticism of its top brass by the country's influential military bloggers.\n\nThe Ukrainian advance has centred on the logistical hub of Sudzha, a town of around 5,000 inhabitants located eight kilometres from the Ukrainian border.\n\nRussian military bloggers, who have links to the army, also reported Thursday that Kyiv had made significant advances.\n\n\"The situation is complicated and continues to worsen,\" blogger Yury Podolyaka said in a post on Telegram.\n\n\"Sudzha has been completely lost,\" he said.\n\nResidents evacuated from Sudzha also reported a difficult situation, according to images shared by Russia's LDPR party.\n\n\"The situation is bad. There's no communication\" with those who stayed behind, said Alexei, an ambulance worker waiting to receive humanitarian aid.\n\nAnother man also called Alexei, a volunteer, said the evacuees \"feel abandoned\".\n\nThe Dva Mayora Telegram channel said Ukraine was \"entrenching, indicating that the fighting is likely to be long-term\".\n\nMany reported Ukrainian troops had advanced towards the town of Korenevo, more than 25 kilometres from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAFP could not verify those reports.\n\nRussian energy giant Gazprom said on Thursday it would continue shipping gas through the Sudzha metering station, the last transit point for Russian gas heading to Europe via Ukraine.\n\nMoscow also said its forces had destroyed a US-made Bradley Fighting Vehicle that Ukraine was using in the incursion.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry had initially blamed a pro-Ukrainian \"sabotage group\" for the raid, but it has since said Ukraine's army is carrying it out.\n\nPro-Kyiv militia, including those made up of Russian citizens fighting against Moscow, have previously staged several cross-border raids.\n\nBut the latest incursion into the Kursk region appears to be the most successful and organised attempt by Ukraine to penetrate Russian territory.\n\nKyiv's objectives remain unclear, with some analysts suggesting it is an attempt to stretch Russia's army, forcing them to move units away from the eastern Donetsk region where they have been advancing.\n\nThe governor of Kursk declared a state of emergency in the region on Wednesday evening, a move that gives authorities the power to restrict movement in a bid to bring the situation under control.\n\nSeveral thousand people have been evacuated on both sides of the border.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com",

The intention, say US and Ukrainian officials, is multifaceted, in part to disrupt and demoralize Russian forces and in part to divert Russian forces away from other parts of the eastern front. US officials do not believe Ukraine intends to hold Russian territory for the long-term. This comes after Russia claimed on Thursday to have halted a Ukrainian incursion into its territory, although latest evidence from the ground suggests fighting continues in the Kursk region.\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense said units of the \"North\" group of its forces, together with the Russian Federal Security Service, the FSB, \"continue to destroy Ukrainian armed forces formations in the Sudzhensky and Korenevsky districts of the Kursk region, which are directly adjacent to the Russian-Ukrainian border.\"\n\nUkraine has not officially confirmed its forces conducted a ground operation inside Russia. Neither the Ukrainian military nor the government in Kyiv has publicly commented on the operation. Russia accused Ukrainian troops of crossing the border into its Kursk region on Tuesday, claiming that Ukrainian forces launched a \"massive attack\" and attempted to break through the Russian defenses. The extent of the attack, including whether Ukrainian troops took over any settlements or caused damage to any strategic targets, remains unclear.\n\nThe Russian state news agency TASS on Thursday quoted the Russian Health Ministry as saying 34 people were injured in the shelling of the Kursk region were \"undergoing inpatient treatment,\" with nine evacuated to Moscow for treatment. Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on Thursday that residents of the region who have been forced to leave their homes would be given a one-time payment of 10,000 rubles ($115). CNN has geolocated video footage from inside a car that is being driven quickly through the deserted and damaged streets of the town of Sudzha, 6 miles (10 kilometers) from the border. Some wrecked vehicles are also seen in the video as the car moves north out of the town. It's unclear whether the video was shot Wednesday or Thursday. The Russian Defense Ministry said \"attempts by individual [Ukrainian] units to break through deep into the territory in the Kursk direction are being thwarted.\" It claimed that the Ukrainians had \"lost up to 400 servicemen and 32 armoured vehicles, including a tank, four armoured personnel carriers, three infantry fighting vehicles and 24 Kozak armoured fighting vehicles.\" The ministry's claims cannot be verified.\n\nRussian military bloggers have described the situation as difficult, with communications jammed. One prominent blogger was seriously injured Wednesday when his vehicle was struck.\n\nMick Ryan, author of the Futura Doctrina blog and an analyst of the war in Ukraine, said Thursday that the Ukrainian military had deployed \"quality formations. It appears that unlike in the 2023 southern counteroffensive where fresh brigades were employed, the Ukrainians have allocated experienced formations to this attack. This already appears to be paying dividends with the depth of the Ukrainian penetration so far.\"\n\nThe US-based conflict monitoring group the Institute for the Study of War said in its assessment on Thursday that \"Ukrainian forces have made confirmed advances up to 10 kilometers\" into the Kursk region on Wednesday.\n\nKyiv remains silent on incursion claims\n\nUkraine's allies have not commented on the situation beyond saying the country has the right to defend itself. The EU's foreign affairs and security policy spokesperson Peter Stano told the Ukrainian public broadcaster Suspilne News that according to the international law, Kyiv \"has the legal right to defend itself, including striking an aggressor on its territory.\"\n\nThe White House was taken by surprise by the developments on Wednesday, with Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre telling reporters that it was not told ahead of time, adding that the Biden administration was \"going to reach out to the Ukrainian military to learn more about their objectives.\"\n\nJean-Pierre said the US was \"supportive of Ukraine as they are defending themselves against Russia's aggression.\"\n\n\"And so, we're going to continue to do that. And they are going to take actions ... to certainly to protect themselves from these attacks,\" she added.\n\nBut as for the specific operation, we're going to reach out to them to see what their objective is and continue to stay focused. We are going to continue to stay focused on making sure they have what they need to defend themselves against Russia's aggression.\n\nUkrainian troops have found themselves under increased pressure along the 600-mile frontline as Moscow continues its slow, grinding offensive.\n\nRussian troops have recently made incremental advances towards the strategically important city of Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine, threatening a vital Ukrainian supply line. At the same time, Russian forces claim to have seized the village of Niu York and are getting closer to Toretsk.\n\nKyiv has started receiving new tranches of the long-delayed US military assistance in May, but is still facing troop shortages because many of its newly recruited soldiers are still in training.\n\nThe Ukraine Military Intelligence said on Thursday that its forces raided the Russian-occupied Tendra Spit on Tuesday, destroying Russian armoured vehicles, an electronic warfare system, and fortifications. The narrow island in the northern part of the Black Sea is about 40 miles long and about 1 mile wide.\n\nUkrainian special forces destroyed Russian \"equipment, personnel, and fortifications\" during the raid, HUR said, adding that among the destroyed were armored vehicles, in particular MT-LB amphibious personnel carriers, electronic warfare complex and fortifications.\n\nHUR claimed Russian forces suffered losses among the personnel, without providing any further details. There were no losses among the Ukrainian forces, it said.\n\nAn incursion into Russia could be an attempt by Kyiv to divert Russian resources elsewhere. Given the spate of more negative developments from the frontline, the news of a successful incursion help Kyiv boost the morale of its troops and civilian population.\n\nIt could also be a message to Russia's civilian population - a demonstration that Moscow's war on Ukraine makes Russia vulnerable to attacks.\n\nA Russian military blogger Rybar reported on Wednesday that the Ukrainian military had established control over a gas transit station near the border. The blogger said the station is the only one through which gas from Russia flows to Ukraine and then to Europe. CNN cannot confirm that reporting.\n\nThe European Union has imposed wide-ranging economic sanctions on Russia - with the exception of key natural gas imports. The EU was dependent on Russian gas and while it has slashed imports from Russia from 45% of all gas imports in 2021, to 15% of EU gas imports in 2023, some Russian gas still continues to flow to Europe through Ukraine, despite the war.", "source": {"uri": "nation.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Nation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

information on the extent of the Ukrainian incursion.\n\nBut the independent US-based Institute for the Study of War said Ukraine had made significant territorial advances.\n\n\"Geolocated footage and Russian claims indicate that Ukrainian forces continued rapid advances further into Kursk Oblast on August 8 (Thursday), and Ukrainian forces are reportedly present in areas as far as 35 kilometers from the international border with Sumy Oblast\" in Ukraine, the institute said in its daily campaign assessment.\n\nIt cautioned, however, that Ukrainian forces \"most certainly do not control\" all of that territory.\n\nRussia's defence ministry said Thursday that its troops were \"continuing to destroy\" armed Ukrainian units and were using air strikes, rocket and artillery fire to try to push them back.\n\nIt said it had rushed in reserves and was \"thwarting attempts to break through\" deeper into the Kursk region.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has called the incursion a \"large-scale provocation\" by Kyiv, and Russia's top general vowed to crush it.\n\nIn a meeting with the local governor on Thursday, Putin said he needed to show \"courage\" and that Moscow was marshalling all state resources to deal with the situation.\n\nThe health ministry said 66 civilians were wounded, including nine children, in the first three days of the Ukrainian incursion.\n\nOn the first day of the assault, Kursk regional governor Alexei Smirnov said five civilians were killed.\n\nThousands have been evacuated from the region, with Russia putting on an extra train from the regional capital of Kursk to Moscow for those looking to leave.\n\nUkraine has also evacuated several thousand from the Sumy region, which sits across the border from Kursk.\n\nTwo people were killed there over the last 24 hours, Ukraine's interior ministry said Friday.\n\nThe US State Department and European Union have expressed support for Kyiv's right to defend itself from Russian aggression, without directly commenting on the operation.\n\nbur-jc/ach", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The conflict has intensified around the town of Sudzha, with both sides aiming to secure strategic advantages as the war continues.\n\nRussia reported intense combat on Wednesday as Ukrainian forces penetrated its southern border near a major natural gas hub, marking one of the most significant incursions into Russian territory since the war's onset. Kursk Region's acting governor, Alexey Smirnov, declared a state of emergency, restricting access to designated areas, while regional officials indicated civilian injuries and fatalities.\n\nThe Russian health ministry confirmed that 31 civilians, including six children, were wounded, and five people had died. Russia's National Guard increased security around the nearby Kursk nuclear power station. Despite Ukraine's 2023 counteroffensive failing to secure major gains, Russia has claimed 420 square km of Ukrainian land since mid-June.\n\nUkraine counterattacked on Tuesday, intensifying battles into Wednesday near Sudzha, 530 km southwest of Moscow, as per the Russian defense ministry. President Vladimir Putin labeled the assault a significant provocation.

Ukraine's Defense Ministry and General Staff also said they would not comment.\n\n'No violation of policy'\n\nIn Washington, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said the United States was in contact with Ukrainian authorities about their actions in Kursk.\n\nMiller said US rules on Ukrainian use of US weapons -- authorized in areas over the Russian border -- remained in effect, but that Ukraine's actions were \"not a violation of our policy\".\n\nThere was fighting around Sudzha, the last transit point for Russian gas heading to Europe via Ukraine. The Urengoy-Pomary-Uzhhorod pipeline carried about 14.65 billion cubic meters of gas last year, about half of Russia's gas exports to Europe.\n\nA Russian TV station broadcast images from the city center showing destroyed buildings, debris strewn across the street and large craters in the ground from artillery hits.\n\nRussian energy giant Gazprom said on Thursday it would continue shipping gas through the Sudzha metering station.\n\nUkraine's gas transmission operator said Russian natural gas was transiting to European consumers normally.

The last Russian figure for evacuations in Kursk was 3,000.\n\nLittle reliable information about the surprise Ukrainian operation has emerged, and its strategic aims are unclear.\n\nUkrainian officials have refused to comment specifically about the incursion, which is taking place about 320 miles south-west of Moscow.\n\nBut a top adviser to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Thursday that border region attacks will cause Russia to \"start to realise that the war is slowly creeping inside of Russian territory\".\n\nMyhailo Podolyak also suggested that the operation would improve Kyiv's hand in the event of negotiations with Moscow.\n\nThe assault came as the Ukrainian army toils to hold at bay an intense Russian push at places on the front line in eastern Ukraine, especially in the Donetsk region.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has made clear he wants to capture the parts of Donetsk that the Kremlin's forces do not already occupy.\n\nRussia declares federal level emergencies when there are more than 500 victims or damage exceeds 500 million roubles (about \u00a34.7 million).\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, says Ukrainian forces have pressed on with their \"rapid advances\" deeper into the Kursk region, reportedly going up to 20 miles beyond the border.\n\n\"The lack of a coherent Russian response to the Ukrainian incursion into Kursk ... and the reported rate of Ukrainian advance indicates that Ukrainian forces were able to achieve operational surprise,\" the Washington-based ISW said late Thursday.\n\nA Russian defence ministry said only that the military \"continues to repel the attempted invasion\" and is responding with air strikes, artillery and troops on the ground.\n\nUkraine has also kept up its strategy of hitting rear areas with long-range drones, targeting military sites, oil refineries and other infrastructure.\n\nUkrainian drones attacked Russia's Lipetsk region, which is about 180 miles from the Ukraine border, during Thursday night, authorities said.\n\nThe regional emergencies ministry in Lipetsk said there was a fire at a military airfield where fighter planes including MiG-29s and Su-34s reportedly are based.\n\nLipetsk governor Igor Artamonov said that unspecified electrical infrastructure was damaged and nine people were wounded in the attack.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry said that 75 Ukrainian drones were shot down during the night, 19 of them over Lipetsk.", "source": {"uri": "breakingnews.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breaking

This is one of the largest incursions into Russia since the war began in February 2022.\n\nFollowing the failure of Ukraine's 2023 counteroffensive to make significant gains, Russia has advanced and claimed 420 sq km (162 sq miles) of territory. The Ukrainian forces struck back on Tuesday, with battles continuing through the night into Wednesday. These clashes have erupted northwest of the border town of Sudzha, located 530 km (330 miles) southwest of Moscow, according to Russia's defence ministry.\n\nThe Kurks battles come at a pivotal moment in the conflict, which is the largest land war in Europe since World War Two.

Exactly what our country needs now.\"\n\nRussia claimed earlier that Kyiv's forces fired rockets at civilian and residential targets in the Kursk region amid reports by Russian pro-war bloggers that a number of villages have been captured by Ukrainian forces as they advance into Russian territory.\n\nThe acting governor of Kursk, Aleksei Smirnov, declared a state of emergency on August 7 after Russian President Vladimir Putin called the military operation \"another large-scale provocation.\"\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry in a statement on August 8 said Russia's Battlegroup North and border guard units had thwarted Ukrainian forces' attempts to break through the districts of Sudzha and Korenevo.\n\nEarlier, the ministry claimed to have downed six drones and five missiles over the Kursk region and 14 drones in the Belgorod region.\n\nBelgorod regional Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov claimed that a man died and one person was injured in Ukrainian shelling of Shebekino.\n\nMeanwhile, in Ukraine's eastern region of Donetsk, two civilians were killed on August 8 by Russian shelling of Kostyantynivka, regional Governor Vadym Filashkin said on Telegram.\n\nRussian air strikes in the Sumy region killed two people, including a child, and two more were wounded, said the governor of Sumy, Volodymyr Artyukh.\n\nRussia also said Ukrainian forces penetrated its border near the major natural gas transmission hub at Sudzha. The Sudzha gas transfer and measuring stations in the Kursk region are the only entry point for Russian natural gas into the Ukrainian gas transmission system for onward transport to Europe.\n\nUkrainian Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said on August 8 that Ukraine had not been contacted by Russia about the situation with gas transit, but the transit route for Russian gas deliveries to Europe via Ukraine is still functioning.\n\nIn addition, the International Atomic Energy Agency said on August 8 that it is aware of developments around Russia's Kursk nuclear plant and is monitoring the situation, according to Russian news agency RIA Novosti.\n\nDmitry Medvedev, the former president who is now deputy chief of Russia's Security Council, has called for Russian troops to press deeper into Ukraine as Moscow claims to have intercepted Ukrainian drones and missiles targeting the Kursk region.\n\nCommenting on the Ukrainian incursion in the Kursk region, Medvedev said Moscow should aim beyond securing the territories that Russia considers its own and urged further advance into Ukraine's Odesa, Kharkiv, Dnipro, Mykolayiv, and Kyiv regions.\n\nEU spokesman Peter Stano told RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service that while the bloc does not comment on battlefield operations, it believes \"Ukraine has a legal right to defend itself, including striking an aggressor on its territory.\"\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby on August 7 said the White House had reached out to Ukraine to \"get a little better understanding\" of the situation in the Kursk region.\n\nState Department spokesman Matthew Miller confirmed on August 7 that Washington's policy on the use of U.S. weapons by Ukraine across the border or against Russian military facilities had not changed.\n\nThe actions taking place \"are not a violation of our policy,\" Miller added.\n\nSource: https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-ukraine- kursk-incursion-invasion/33070123.html\n\nCopyright (c) 2024.

The last Russian figure for evacuations in Kursk was 3,000.\n\nLittle reliable information about the surprise Ukrainian operation has emerged, and its strategic aims are unclear.\n\nUkrainian officials have refused to comment specifically about the incursion, which is taking place about 320 miles south-west of Moscow.\n\nBut a top adviser to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Thursday that border region attacks will cause Russia to \"start to realise that the war is slowly creeping inside of Russian territory\".\n\nMyhailo Podolyak also suggested that the operation would improve Kyiv's hand in the event of negotiations with Moscow.\n\nThe assault came as the Ukrainian army toils to hold at bay an intense Russian push at places on the front line in eastern Ukraine, especially in the Donetsk region.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has made clear he wants to capture the parts of Donetsk that the Kremlin's forces do not already occupy.\n\nRussia declares federal level emergencies when there are more than 500 victims or damage exceeds 500 million roubles (about \u00a34.7 million).\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, says Ukrainian forces have pressed on with their \"rapid advances\" deeper into the Kursk region, reportedly going up to 20 miles beyond the border.\n\n\"The lack of a coherent Russian response to the Ukrainian incursion into Kursk ... and the reported rate of Ukrainian advance indicates that Ukrainian forces were able to achieve operational surprise,\" the Washington-based ISW said late Thursday.\n\nA Russian defence ministry said only that the military \"continues to repel the attempted invasion\" and is responding with air strikes, artillery and troops on the ground.\n\nUkraine has also kept up its strategy of hitting rear areas with long-range drones, targeting military sites, oil refineries and other infrastructure.\n\nUkrainian drones attacked Russia's Lipetsk region, which is about 180 miles from the Ukraine border, during Thursday night, authorities said.\n\nThe regional emergencies ministry in Lipetsk said there was a fire at a military airfield where fighter planes including MiG-29s and Su-34s reportedly are based.\n\nLipetsk governor Igor Artamonov said that unspecified electrical infrastructure was damaged and nine people were wounded in the attack.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry said that 75 Ukrainian drones were shot down during the night, 19 of them over Lipetsk.", "source": {"uri": "expressandstar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Express &

Ukraine's decision to invade Russia is looking like a high-risk gamble but so far it appears to be paying off.\n\nAfter months of losing ground to Russia in brutal, grinding battles in Ukraine, Kyiv shifted tactics with a surprise attack into Russian territory this week that caught Moscow off guard and opened a new front in the 30-month war.\n\nUkrainian forces have punched through Russian border defenses and seized several settlements in fighting that was still raging on Thursday, according to Russian officials, a Ukrainian soldier and analysts. The attack triggered a state of emergency in one region in the west of Russia. Ukrainian armored columns were filmed moving along roads as far as six miles inside Russia...\n\nThe goal was to shift the fighting -- and Russian soldiers and weaponry -- onto Russian territory and ease the pressure of Moscow's offensive in eastern Ukraine, a senior Ukrainian official said. He asked not to be cited by name, as Ukraine has not acknowledged its soldiers are fighting in Russia...\n\n\"They were not expecting us, and they fled wherever they could,\" said a Ukrainian soldier who fought in the assault and who asked to be identified by only his first name, Oleksandr, in keeping with Ukrainian military protocol. His unit took prisoners and captured a tank, he said in a telephone interview.\n\nAnother possible goal here is to give the Ukrainians something to negotiate with. As it stands now, Russia has seized large areas of Ukrainian territory and any negotiation would probably begin with Putin's demand that those areas remain permanently under Russian control. However, if Ukraine managed to seize some towns inside Russia they would then have something to offer in a swap deal.\n\nThe Kursk offensive has put new pressure on Putin as Russian civilians have had to be evacuated under the same type of bombardment Ukrainians have endured for more than two years...\n\n\"This will give them the leverage they need for negotiations with Russia -- this is what it's all about,\" the Zelensky adviser said.\n\nRussia's top military commander claimed yesterday that Russian forces had halted the invasion but locals say that's not true.\n\nKursk residents, who live in the Sudzhansky District, recorded a video address to Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday asking for his help, saying he has been misinformed about the situation on the ground and the Russian Defense Ministry's statements about things being under control are untrue.\n\nThe address was published on a local Telegram channel that is dedicated to covering the latest news out of the town of Sudzha in Kursk region, which has been under Ukrainian attack for several days.\n\n\"These lies enable the local residents to die. The Chief of the General staff recently told you that the situation is under control, but today huge furious battles are underway in the Sudzhansky and Korenevsky districts,\" one of the residents said.\n\n\"Sudzha was attacked, turned into ruins in a matter of hours. Local administration wasn't working,\" another resident said.\n\nRussian military bloggers also say the attack is worse than is being admitted thus far.\n\na prominent Russian military blogger who writes under the name of Rybar said Thursday that Ukrainian forces had Sudzha, the main town in the area, \"practically under full control.\" Videos from Sudzha, verified by The New York Times, show cars trying to leave amid sounds of gunshots and roads littered with burned vehicles and what appeared to be mines.\n\nIt remains to be seen how long this attack can continue but already Ukraine is said to have seized more than 100 kilometers of territory inside Russia, making it the biggest advance in more than a year. It has also produced video which appears to show Russian soldiers surrendering to Ukrainian forces.\n\nThe latest attack is said to have taken place 27 km from the Ukraine border.\n\nAgain, it may be days before we know whether this gamble paid off but as of now Ukraine has certainly surprised the Russians.", "source": {"uri": "hotair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotAir"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_sexton@hotair.com", "name": "John Sexton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_Ground_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ukrainian Ground Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Armed Forces of Ukraine"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kursk"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kursk"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia\u2013Ukraine_border", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia\u2013Ukraine border"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State of emergency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukrainians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudzhansky_District", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sudzhansky District"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sudzhansky District"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Telephone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudzha,_Kursk_Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sudzha, Kursk Oblast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sudzha, Kursk Oblast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegram_(messaging_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Telegram (messaging service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Raion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk_Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kursk Oblast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kursk Oblast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2018/235/25488344-48ed-4b8f-9021-d71f8ad386c2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799944", "eventUri": "eng-9799944", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4666666666666667, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

And we did not choose to achieve our goals in the war,\" he added.\n\nRussia's defence ministry said Thursday its troops were \"continuing to destroy\" armed Ukrainian units and were using air strikes, rocket and artillery fire to try to push them back.\n\nIt said it had rushed in reserves and was \"thwarting attempts to break through\" deeper into the Kursk region.\n\nThe independent US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said Ukraine had made significant territorial gains in the first two days of the incursion.\n\n\"Ukrainian forces have made confirmed advances up to 10 kilometres (six miles) into Russia's Kursk Oblast amid continued mechanised offensive operations on Russian territory,\" it said in its latest update.\n\n\"The current confirmed extent and location of Ukrainian advances in Kursk Oblast indicate that Ukrainian forces have penetrated at least two Russian defensive lines and a stronghold,\" it added.\n\nKyiv has not officially taken responsibility for the operation, but an aide to Zelensky said Moscow was to blame for the incursion.\n\n\"The root cause of any escalation, shelling, military actions, forced evacuations and destruction of normal life forms -- including within the Russian Federation's own territories like Kursk and Belgorod regions -- is solely Russia's unequivocal aggression,\" presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak said Thursday on social media.\n\nWithout mentioning the Kursk attacks, Zelensky said Wednesday: \"The more pressure we put on Russia, the closer we will get to peace. A just peace through just force.\"\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has called it a \"large-scale provocation\" by Kyiv and Russia's top general vowed on Wednesday to crush the incursion.\n\nThe United States State Department expressed support for Kyiv without directly commenting on the operation.\n\n\"We strongly support Ukraine's effort to defend against Russia's aggression,\" spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters.\n\n- 'Entrenching' -\n\nThe surprise attack appeared to catch Russia's army off guard, triggering criticism of its top brass by the country's influential military bloggers.\n\nThe Ukrainian advance has centred on the logistical hub of Sudzha, a town of around 5,000 inhabitants located eight kilometres (five miles) from the Ukrainian border.\n\nRussian military bloggers, who have links to the army, also reported Thursday that Kyiv had made significant advances.\n\n\"The situation is complicated and continues to worsen,\" blogger Yury Podolyaka said in a post on Telegram.\n\n\"Sudzha has been completely lost,\" he said.\n\nThe Dva Mayora Telegram channel said Ukraine was \"entrenching, indicating that the fighting is likely to be long-term\".\n\nMany reported Ukrainian troops had advanced towards the town of Korenevo, more than 25 kilometres from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAFP could not verify those reports.\n\nRussian energy giant Gazprom said on Thursday it would continue shipping gas through the Sudzha metering station, the last transit point for Russian gas heading to Europe via Ukraine.\n\nMoscow also said its forces had destroyed a US-made Bradley Fighting Vehicle that Ukraine was using in the incursion.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry had initially blamed a pro-Ukrainian \"sabotage group\" for carrying out the raid, but it has since said Ukraine's army is carrying out the raid.\n\nPro-Kyiv militia, including those made up of Russian citizens fighting against Moscow, have previously staged several cross-border raids.\n\nBut the latest incursion into the Kursk region appears to be the most successful and organised attempt by Ukraine to penetrate Russian territory.\n\nKyiv's objectives remain unclear, with some analysts suggesting it is an attempt to stretch Russia's army, forcing them to move units away from the eastern Donetsk region where they have been advancing.\n\nThe governor of the Kursk region declared a state of emergency in the region on Wednesday evening, a move that gives authorities the power to restrict movement in a bid to bring the situation under control.\n\nSeveral thousand people have been evacuated on both sides of the border.\n\nbur/gv", "source": {"uri": "wfxg.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WFXG FOX54"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@wfxg.com", "name": "Agence

Sergei Mironov, leader of a Kremlin-loyal political party, called it a \"terrorist attack\" and \"the invasion of an internationally recognised foreign territory\".\n\nKursk's regional acting governor, Alexei Smirnov, said thousands of residents had been evacuated.\n\nThe White House said the United States - Ukraine's biggest backer - had no prior knowledge of the attack. Washington has asked Ukraine for details on their military objectives, said a US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, on Thursday.\n\n\"They are operating within the area north of the border where we have told them they can use US-provided weapons to defend themselves against Russian attacks,\" the official noted.\n\nRussia's defence ministry on Thursday said the army and the Federal Security Service (FSB) had halted the Ukrainian advance and were battling Ukrainian units in the Kursk region.\n\n\"Units of the Northern group of forces, together with the FSB of Russia, continue to destroy armed formations of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Sudzhensky and Korenevsky districts of the Kursk region, directly adjacent to the Russian-Ukrainian border,\" the ministry said.\n\nThe Ukrainian military has remained silent on the Kursk offensive, though President Volodymyr Zelenskiy praised the Ukrainian army on Thursday for its ability \"to surprise\" and achieve results. He did not explicitly reference Kursk.\n\nSome Russian bloggers said Ukraine's forces were pushing towards the Kursk nuclear power station, which lies about 60km northeast of Sudzha.", "source": {"uri": "perthnow.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Perth Now"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia\u2013Ukraine_border", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia\u2013Ukraine border"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas_in_Russia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Natural gas in Russia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armoured_fighting_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Armoured fighting vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk_Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kursk Oblast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kursk Oblast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Mironov", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sergey Mironov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudzha,_Kursk_Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sudzha, Kursk Oblast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sudzha, Kursk Oblast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Raion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kursk"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kursk"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Security_Service", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Security Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Armed Forces of Ukraine"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_plant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear power plant"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-15642315/9d4e7a4f5c5b871614267e5c2e8a11f19a10faa9-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg?imwidth=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799944", "eventUri": "eng-9799944", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

It added that the army is attacking Ukrainian fighters trying to advance into the area from Ukraine's Sumy region.\n\n\"Attempts by individual units to break through deep into the territory in the Kursk direction are being suppressed,\" the ministry said.\n\nHeavy fighting was reported near the town of Sudzha, where Russian natural gas flows into Ukraine, raising concerns about a possible sudden stop to transit flows to Europe.\n\nOleksiy Goncharkeno, a Ukrainian lawmaker, said in a series of posts on Facebook and Telegram that Ukrainian forces had taken control of the gas hub in Sudzha.\n\n\"Our men have heroically captured Putin's number one gas valve in Sudzha,\" Goncharenko said.\n\nHowever, Kyiv has not officially commented on the apparent incursion in Kursk.\n\nIn a video address to the nation late Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy did not mention the fighting in the Kursk region but emphasized that \"Russia brought the war to our land, and it should feel what it has done.\"\n\n\"Ukrainians know how to achieve their goals,\" Zelenskyy said, adding that he received three \"productive reports, exactly the kind our country needs now\" on Thursday from the commander of Ukraine's armed forces, Oleksandr Syrskyi.\n\nRussia says its military has stemmed Ukrainian advances in the border area about 500 kilometres southwest of Moscow, but military bloggers and open source data indicate Ukrainian troops have made gains in several areas in Kursk.\n\nThe Kursk region's acting governor, Alexei Smirnov, briefed Russian President Vladimir Putin on conditions there by video link Thursday. Smirnov said the region plans to equip gas stations with electronic warfare units and to provide them with unspecified armoured defence.\n\nWilliam Taylor, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, saw several reasons why Kyiv might want to undertake a military action of the kind that Russia says is occurring in Kursk.\n\n\"They want ... to show that the Ukrainians can indeed push the Russians back,\" he told CBC's Power & Politics on Thursday.\n\n\"It's not just the one time that they did that at the beginning of the war.

The last Russian figure for evacuations in Kursk was 3,000.\n\nLittle reliable information about the surprise Ukrainian operation has emerged, and its strategic aims are unclear. Ukrainian officials have refused to comment specifically about the incursion, which is taking place about 500 kilometers (320 miles) southwest of Moscow.\n\nBut a top adviser to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Thursday that border region attacks will cause Russia to \"start to realize that the war is slowly creeping inside of Russian territory.\" Myhailo Podolyak also suggested that the operation would improve Kyiv's hand in the event of negotiations with Moscow.\n\nThe assault came as the Ukrainian army toils to hold at bay an intense Russian push at places on the front line in eastern Ukraine, especially in the Donetsk region. Russian President Vladimir Putin has made clear he wants to capture the parts of Donetsk that the Kremlin's forces don't already occupy.\n\nRussia declares federal level emergencies when there are more than 500 victims or damage exceeds 500 million rubles (about $6 million).\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, says Ukrainian forces have pressed on with their \"rapid advances\" deeper into the Kursk region, reportedly going up to 35 kilometers (20 miles) beyond the border.\n\n\"The lack of a coherent Russian response to the Ukrainian incursion into Kursk ... and the reported rate of Ukrainian advance indicates that Ukrainian forces were able to achieve operational surprise,\" the Washington-based ISW said late Thursday.\n\nA Russian Defense Ministry statement Friday said only that the military \"continues to repel the attempted invasion\" and is responding with airstrikes, artillery and troops on the ground.\n\nUkraine has also kept up its strategy of hitting rear areas with long-range drones, targeting military sites, oil refineries and other infrastructure.\n\nUkrainian drones attacked Russia's Lipetsk region, which is about 300 kilometers (180 miles) from the Ukraine border, during Thursday night, authorities said.\n\nThe regional emergencies ministry in Lipetsk said there was a fire at a military airfield where fighter planes including MiG-29s and Su-34s reportedly are based.\n\nLipetsk governor Igor Artamonov said that unspecified electrical infrastructure was damaged and nine people were wounded in the attack.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said that 75 Ukrainian drones were shot down during the night, 19 of them over Lipetsk.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine at

Although this is the third Ukrainian offensive inside Russia since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, it is the first using regular Ukrainian army troops and is by far the largest to date.\n\nOn Thursday, US officials publicly backed the Ukrainian attack on Kursk, which contradicted previous US claims not to support attacks on Russian territory.\n\nUkraine's attack is \"consistent with our policy,\" said US Defense Department Deputy Press Secretary Sabrina Singh at a briefing Thursday.\n\nSingh claimed that Kursk was being used to launch attacks on Ukraine, claiming that the US has \"supported Ukraine from the beginning to defend themselves against attacks that are coming across the border.\"\n\nThe assault on Russia was being carried out by Ukraine \"to protect themselves from attacks,\" adding that Kiev is operating \"within the US policy of where they can operate our weapons, our systems, our capabilities,\" she said.\n\nState Department spokesman Matthew Miller likewise defended the offensive, saying, \"yes, in the area where they are currently operating across the Russian border, we have seen attacks come from there.\"\n\nThese statements were mirrored by a spokesman for Germany's defense ministry, which told the FT that the \"German government's declared objective to support Ukraine in its fight against the Russian aggressor.\"\n\nThe European Commission, for its part, said Thursday that Ukraine had a \"right to defend itself\" and that this \"includes hitting the enemy on its territory.\"\n\nUkrainian forces were seen operating as far as 18.5 miles behind the Russian border Thursday. The attack triggered a state of emergency and widespread evacuations.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, Russia's Ministry of Defense claimed to have repelled the attack. It announced that approximately 1,000 soldiers were involved in the attack and that the Ukrainian military had lost 600 soldiers and 82 vehicles. \"Air strikes are being carried out on advancing reserves of the armed forces of Ukraine on the territory of the Sumy region,\" the Ministry of Defense said.\n\nBut battles continued to rage throughout the day, with footage showing low overflights by fighter aircraft and widespread damage throughout the region.\n\nAccording to a report by the Institute for the Study of War Wednesday, Ukrainian forces had captured 11 settlements.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky made a veiled reference to the attacks Thursday, saying \"the more pressure is exerted on Russia -- on the aggressor that brought the war to Ukraine, the closer peace will be. Just peace through just force.\"\n\nAn op-ed in the Telegraph gloated that \"Ukraine's offensive operations in Kursk show no sign of slowing down. Overnight, Ukrainian forces reportedly seized control of Sudzhna, reached the outskirts of Korenevo, and advanced northward to Malaya Loknya. In less than forty-eight hours, Ukraine has captured more territory than during the entire ill-fated summer 2023 counter-offensive.\"\n\nThe op-ed added, \"With F-16 jets also arriving on the frontlines, Putin has plenty of reasons to worry.\"\n\nThis was a reference to the official introduction of US-made F-16 fighter jets into the battlefield, which this week began flying combat missions.\n\nThe Washington Post, for its part, reported that \"Ukrainian officials have asked Washington to let them use long-range US ATACMS missiles to hit airfields that Russia is using to retaliate against the incursion -- a decision that, if approved, could allow Kyiv to hold a portion of Kursk for some time.\"\n\nThe offensive follows the NATO summit in Washington, which concluded with a plan to transfer the coordination of international military hardware and logistics under the direct control of NATO.\n\nIn April, the Biden administration began supplying Ukraine with long-range ATACMS missiles, which have a 300-kilometer (186-mile) range, while claiming they would not be used for strikes inside Russia itself.\n\nIn May, US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan asserted that the US is allowing Ukraine to use US-provided weapons to strike \"anywhere\" inside Russian territory.\n\nDespite the significant offensive in Kursk, the Ukrainian front line in Donetsk, the main battlefield of the war, is on the brink of collapse, amid growing popular opposition to the war inside Ukraine and a major shortage of manpower. Under these conditions, the US and NATO are removing remaining restrictions on their direct role in the war.\n\nWhatever the broader military significance of the Kursk offensive, it is now the case that German and American armored vehicles, piloted by Ukrainians, are being driven over the Russian border and being used to launch attacks on Russia, in a significant and dangerous escalation of NATO's involvement in the conflict.\n\nRead moreNATO war summit prepares direct entry into Ukraine war10 July 2024Report from a young Ukrainian in Germany: \"The working class in Ukraine does not want

The Kursk region, sharing its borders with Ukraine, was rocked by an incursion on Tuesday.\n\nGovernor Alexei Smirnov took to Telegram to condemn what he called \"attempted border breakthroughs\" in two districts. He later alleged that Ukrainian forces had launched attacks on Russian border units stationed in the settlements of Nikolayevo-Daryino and Oleshnya.\n\nA video that emerged on social media on Tuesday also showed troops involved in the incursion capturing Russian soldiers amid the conflict. Other videos from Russian bloggers showed lines of vehicles destroyed by Ukrainian forces. Though there has been no official confirmation of the military operation, President Zelensky alluded to the incursion in a Thursday address, saying: \"Russia brought the war to our land and should feel what it has done.\"\n\nREAD MORE: ISIS 'in communication with UK-based terrorists' over planned 'big attack'\n\nBy Wednesday, as Russia's Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov reported an assault by approximately 1,000 Ukrainian troops on the town of Sudzha, Mr Smirnov announced a state of emergency, reports the Express.\n\nHis statement was clear: \"To eliminate the consequences of enemy forces coming into the region, I took the decision to introduce a state of emergency in the Kursk region from August 7.\" Russian President Vladimir Putin labelled the incursion a \"major provocation\".\n\nThis assault on the Sudzha area poses a significant threat to the Kremlin, given that the town is not only a gas hub but also the final major transit point for Russian pipelines entering Europe.\n\nUkraine has not formally accepted responsibility for an intrusion, although some officials have hinted involvement.\n\nPresident of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, without directly referencing the Kursk events, remarked on Wednesday: \"The more pressure we put on Russia... the closer we will get to peace. A just peace through just force.\"\n\nUkrainian MP Oleksiy Goncharenko gave an almost confirmation of Ukraine's role in a Telegram post late August 7, claiming Ukrainian forces had taken control over the Sudzha gas hub.\n\nThen, in the wee hours of August 8, he continued with a bold statement: \"Kursk region. Day three. Everything is according to plan. For the first time since World War II, a foreign army is conducting a combined arms operation on the territory of Russia and taking control of settlements.\"\n\nDespite Mr. Smirnov declaring a state of emergency, it seems the efforts haven't halted the incursion - which Mr. Gerasimov insisted was already \"stopped\" as of Wednesday.\n\nAlthough Sudzha town lies about eight kilometres inside the

The Chief of the General staff recently told you that the situation is under control,\" one of the residents said in the video, according to a translation from CNN.\n\n\"But today, huge furious battles are underway in the Sudzhansky and Korenevsky districts,\" she said.\n\nThe clip was disseminated on the Russian Telegram channel Native Sudzha, which covers news in the region.\n\nThe residents said they've been rendered homeless by Ukraine's attack and said they had to rely on news from Telegram channels instead of local officials.\n\nMany said they were unable to bring their travel or identification documents with them because of how quickly they had to evacuate, and said authorities should have known Ukraine was building its forces on the border.\n\n\"We are left alone with children without a place to go, without compensation, without any money. We escaped with only clothes on our backs,\" said one woman, according to CNN's translation.\n\nOne man addressed Putin directly, claiming that people from Guevo, a town in Sudzha, had not been evacuated by officials and were left stranded amid the fighting.\n\nGuevo is reported by open-source intelligence to be one of over a dozen Russian villages now under Ukrainian control.\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry and the press team for Putin's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment sent outside regular business hours by Business Insider.\n\nKyiv's forces launched an incursion into Kursk on Wednesday, with some Ukrainian armored vehicles spotted fighting up to nine miles deep into Russian territory.\n\nRussia has said Ukraine launched the attack with some 1,000 troops and about 40 armored vehicles, including tanks. The Kremlin called the assault a \"large-scale provocation.\"\n\nAbout 80 miles to the southeast, Russia opened a similar operation in May by moving its troops into the Ukrainian region of Kharkiv, opening a new war front.\n\nUkraine has said little about its attack on Russia, though an advisor to the president's office, Mykhailo Podolyak, acknowledged the Ukrainian push in social media statements on Thursday.\n\n\"Now, a significant part of the global community considers Rf a legitimate target for any operations and types of weapons,\" Podolyak wrote on X, referring to the Russian armed forces.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his Thursday address that Russia \"should feel what it has done\" to Ukraine, but did not mention the incursion directly.\n\nIn a Wednesday meeting convened by Putin, Russian military chief Valery Gerasimov reported that the Ukrainian advance had been brought to a halt, claiming that Kyiv's forces had taken heavy casualties.\n\nThe situation is \"under control,\" Kursk's acting governor, Alexey Smirnov, said in a statement on Telegram. He urged residents not to panic.\n\nBut Russian sources and footage of skirmishes in Kursk show the fighting is still fierce.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, geolocated Ukrainian units having broken past Russian defensive lines in at least two areas.\n\n\"The sky is completely dominated by Ukrainian drones,\" wrote military blogger VChK-OPGU, who is known to have ties to Russia's military forces, on Thursday.\n\nMeanwhile, Putin has announced a one-time payment of 10,000 rubles, or $115, in relief for Kursk residents affected by the attack, according to state media.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 5,

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nUkraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky has praised his army's ability \"to surprise\" and \"achieve results\" as it battles Russian forces during an audacious cross-border attack into Russian territory.\n\nAround 1,000 Ukrainian troops in tanks and armoured vehicles successfully broke through the Russian border and into the Kursk region in the early hours of Tuesday with air support from swarms of drones and pounding artillery, according to Russian officials.\n\nRussia has since declared a state of emergency in the region and local officials said on Thursday that thousands of people had been evacuated following the attack that an angry Vladimir Putin has labelled a \"major provocation\".\n\nWhile Ukrainian officials haven't spoken directly about the attack, including Mr Zelensky, Mykhailo Podolyak, a senior aide to the president said that \"the root cause of any escalation\", including into Kursk, was \"unequivocal aggression\" on the part of Russia in believing it could invade Ukraine without consequences.\n\nHe also suggested on the country's national television news broadcast that the military actions could strengthen Ukraine's position during any future negotiations with Russia to end the war.\n\nMr Zelensky said at an event to unveil a new digital app to cut paperwork for the military: \"Everyone can see that the Ukrainian army knows how to surprise. And knows how to achieve results.\n\n\"This is demonstrated by the battlefield, where our soldiers not only withstood the overwhelming force of the occupiers, but also are destroying it in the way necessary to protect Ukraine - our state and independence.\"\n\nUkrainian soldiers have now penetrated more than six miles (10km) across the border, breaking through two Russian defensive lines and a stronghold, the Institute for the Study of War said. Some reports suggest that Kyiv's forces are advancing towards a village 13 miles into Russian territory.\n\nHeavy fighting has been reported near the town of Sudzha and some Russian bloggers, currently one of the most accurate sources of information, said Ukraine's forces were pushing towards the Kursk nuclear power station, under 40 miles northeast of Sudzha.\n\nYuri Podolyaka, a popular Ukrainian-born, pro-Russian military blogger, said that there were intense battles about 30km from the Soviet-era nuclear plant, which supplies a large swathe of southern Russia with power.\n\nUkraine's energy minister said gas transit via Sudzha was still functioning, despite reports of hostilities there. Most EU nations have reduced their dependence on Russian gas, but Austria is one country that still receives most of its gas via Ukraine.\n\nThe Center for Information Resilience, a non-profit open-source analysis organisation, said it was unable to visually confirm any damage to the gas metering station as a result of the incursion, but had verified significant damage to the border checkpoint about 500 metres to the south.\n\n\"This, combined with footage verified by CIR of several Russian soldiers surrendering to Ukrainian soldiers near the entrance of the gas metering plant, makes it likely that the plant has been affected by the Ukrainian incursion, however, the level of damage cannot be verified at this time,\" it said.\n\nKursk's regional acting governor, Alexei Smirnov, said that thousands of residents had been evacuated. The White House said the United States - Ukraine's biggest backer - had no prior knowledge of the attack and would seek more details from Kyiv.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian shelling reportedly killed at least two individuals - a paramedic and an ambulance driver - and injured 24 others, Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said. Neither of these Russian claims could be independently verified.\n\nRussia's defence ministry claimed on Thursday that the army and the Federal Security Service had halted the Ukrainian advance, but it has made such claims every day since the attack began, despite heavy fighting continuing.\n\nThe battles come at a crucial juncture in the conflict, the biggest land war in Europe since the Second World War. Kyiv is concerned that US support could weaken if Republican Donald Trump wins the November presidential election.\n\nTrump has said he would seek to end the war, and both Russia and Ukraine are keen to gain the strongest possible bargaining position on the battlefield.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [{"uri":

But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Wednesday night it was important to keep the pressure on Russia, while his adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, said in a cryptic post on the social platform X that the \"mythical Russian brutality and boundlessness has turned against Russia itself.\"\n\nA United Nations spokesperson said Thursday the Kursk attack was a \"real concern\" and called for the protection of civilians.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, who called it a \"major provocation,\" met with key government officials Wednesday and ordered his troops to counter the Ukrainian advance.\n\nPutin has repeatedly threatened to escalate the war in response to Ukrainian attacks inside of Russia, and has used nuclear weapons as part of those threats.\n\nBut Singh said Ukraine is \"going to do everything it can to continue to take back its sovereign territory.\"\n\n\"We don't feel like this is escalatory,\" she said. \"Ukraine is doing what it needs to do to be successful on the battlefield.\"\n\nShe added that Ukraine has been able to push Russian forces further back into Russia but that it was vital for Kyiv to defend against border attacks.\n\n\"As they see attacks

Lipetsk's emergency ministry also reported a fire at a military airfield in the region.\n\n\"The enemy is hitting civilians in Kursk and Belgorod,\" Artamonov wrote on Telegram. \"Today [it] massively attacked our region with drones. We will not be frightened, we will not give in, but we are not going to risk the lives of our people either.\"\n\nRussia's defense ministry said Friday it intercepted and destroyed 75 \"aircraft-type\" drones, including 19 over Lipetsk, 26 over Belgorod, seven over Kursk, and several others over the regions of Bryansk, Voronezh, and Orel. It said it also destroyed five over Crimea and eight over the waters of the Black Sea.\n\nThe reports show that Ukraine's assault on Russia is not letting up. Although pro-Ukrainian groups of Russian nationals have mounted fleeting cross-border assaults on Russia, and Ukraine has repeatedly targeted the border region of Belgorod with airstrikes, this week's incursion marks the first time that regular Ukrainian and special operations units have strode into Russian territory.\n\nThe intention, according to US and Ukrainian officials, is partly to divert Russian forces away from other parts of the eastern front - from which they have been able to bombard Ukraine's Kharkiv region - and partly to disrupt and demoralize Russian forces. US officials do not believe Ukraine intends to hold Russian territory for the long term.\n\nOn Thursday, Kursk residents wrote on Telegram that \"huge, furious battles are underway,\" and recorded a video address to Russian President Vladimir Putin asking for his help.\n\nRussia 'a legitimate target' for Ukraine\n\nMykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelensky, praised the Western response to the Ukrainian assault, saying \"most quietly approve\" of it. Previous Ukrainian attacks on Russia have made some Western officials jittery, with some arguing that Kyiv should fight only a defensive war to avoid provoking a potential Russian escalation.\n\nPodolyak said Thursday that the West's response had been \"absolutely calm, balanced, objective, and based on an understanding of the spirit of international law and the principles of defensive warfare.\" Unlike Zelensky, Podolyak directly referenced \"events in the Kursk region.\"\n\n\"Now, a significant part of the global community considers [Russia] a legitimate target for any operations and types of weapons,\" he added.\n\nThe European Union foreign affairs spokesperson Peter Stanno said Wednesday that Ukraine \"has the legal right to defend itself, including striking an aggressor on its territory.\" US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller was slightly more tight-lipped, saying Ukraine has to decide its own tactics.\n\nCNN's Mariya Knight contributed

Ukraine's Response? Invade Russia.", "body": "Ukraine has repeatedly crossed the border into Russia since the start of Moscow's all-out invasion: intelligence operatives doing clandestine operations; drones targeting airfields hundreds of kilometers away; ragtag, unofficial militia groups raiding border villages.\n\nThis time, it's different.\n\nHundreds of uniformed Ukrainian troops, backed by armored vehicles and other heavy equipment, this week punched into Russia's Kursk region north of the Ukrainian city of Sumy. As of August 9, the troops have seized control of about 600 square kilometers of territory, and more than two dozen settlements, according to local officials, pro-war bloggers, and open-source intelligence reports.\n\nThe head-snapping incursion -- the largest by Ukrainian forces since Russia launched the invasion in February 2022 -- comes as Ukrainian troops struggle to hold back Russian advances in at least three locations across the 1,100-kilometer front line further to the south. Russian troops are nearing a major Donbas highway whose capture would threaten Ukrainian supply lines along the entire front.\n\n\"The situation in general is not good for Ukrainian forces,\" said Ivan Stupak, a Ukrainian military expert and former intelligence officer. For Russia, \"the main idea is to split the Ukrainian armed forces into two pieces; split the enemy and to try and destroy them part by part, step by step. It's much easier to destroy that way.\"\n\nConfused? Here's what the battlefield looks like nearly 900 days into the biggest land war in Europe since World War II.\n\nTo the southeast of the logistical hub of Pokrovsk, the situation is \"much more dangerous\" and \"critical,\" according to military experts and open-source analysts. Momentum there turned toward Russia in April, when its forces took the village of Ocheretyne amid a Ukrainian troop rotation that some reports say was botched, and they have steadily moved west and north since then.\n\nAs of August 6, Russian forces were reported on the eastern outskirts of Vozdvyzhenka, a village located about 5 kilometers from the T-0504 highway.\n\n\"The situation in the Pokrovsk direction is extremely difficult,\" said the Center for Defense Strategies, a Kyiv think tank headed by a former Ukrainian defense minister.\n\nRunning out of Pokrovsk is a highway, known variously as the N23 or the T-0504, that heads east and then northeast toward Kostyantynivka, a railway junction city that has served a critical supply line for Ukrainian troops.\n\nRussia wants the highway badly.\n\nTaking the road, which is used to shuttle ammunition and supplies, as well as transport of wounded soldiers, would be a major rupture of Ukrainian supply lines.\n\nThe road is not the only route in this section of the battlefield, Stupak said. But it's the best one: Other routes might be more circuitous and unpaved, meaning slower driving speeds -- and when the weather turns and autumn rains begin, Ukraine's legendary mud will make them nearly impassable.\n\n\"If you cut the road, [Ukrainian] forces will start suffering,\" he said. \"It's not the end of the war, but it's also not good.\"\n\nIf nothing dramatic changes in the coming days and weeks, Russia will get the highway, putting Ukraine's fraying defenses in an even more tenuous position.\n\nWhich may be why Ukraine decided to invade Russia.\n\n\"To say that this incursion into the Kursk Oblast caught many, including the Russian command, by surprise is an understatement,\" said one Ukrainian military observer who writes under the name Tatarigami.\n\nFor three days after the initial reports of the raid, Ukrainian officials said nothing, aside from suggestions that official Russian reports were grossly understating its scale. On August 8, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy also offered a hint.\n\n\"Everyone can see that the Ukrainian army knows how to surprise. And knows how to achieve results,\" he said at an event.\n\nMykhaylo Podolyak, a top Zelenskiy adviser, made a less veiled confirmation.\n\n\"War is war, with its own rules, where the aggressor inevitably reaps corresponding outcomes,\" Podolyak said in a post to Telegram.\n\nBut Russian authorities, military bloggers, and local officials and residents point to an unusually large invading force, with armored vehicles and even tanks, that has moved quickly, overcoming light Russian defenses and undermanned border guard units. Analysts said the vehicles involved, including U.S.-supplied Stryker armored vehicles, pointed to the 22 Mechanized Brigade - one of Ukraine's more battle-hardened units - as leading the charge.\n\nSatellite imagery and reports by Deep State, an open-source organization with ties to the Ukrainian Army, suggested troops had advanced as far as 90 kilometers from the border in some places. Russian military bloggers point to similar advances. Estimates from both Russian and Ukrainian analysts as to the amount of territory captured ranged from 500 to 600 square kilometers as of August 9.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin called a session of his Security Council on August 7, and he opened the meeting with televised remarks calling the offensive a \"large-scale provocation.\" Russia's top military commander, General Valery Gerasimov, said the force might be the size of an entire battalion: as many as 1,000 men.\n\nResidents of a Kursk region border town, Sudzha, posted an angry video to Telegram on August 8, saying Putin was being misled by his commanders as to the scale of the invasion.\n\n\"These lies are making the residents die,\" one woman said. Military commanders \"told you the situation is under control, but today huge battles are under way\" in the district.\n\nThe goal of the operation is unclear, and analysts say chances of a major tactical success are slim. Diverting an experienced battalion-sized unit from the front line to stage an uncertain incursion is problematic: Ukrainian commanders do not have deep reserves of men or equipment at their disposal, which is why units across the Donbas front have been unable to check Russian advances.\n\nUkraine also did not notify its biggest supplier of weaponry, the United States, before conducting the incursion.\n\nIn June, as Russian forces pressed a localized cross-border offensive northeast of Kharkiv, the U.S. administration softened a standing policy and gave the green light for Ukraine to use U.S. weaponry to hit Russian targets inside Russia.\n\nDespite not getting advance notice, the administration did not consider the incursion a violation of the wider U.S. prohibition, U.S. officials said.\n\n\"It is consistent with our policy and we have supported Ukraine from the very beginning to defend themselves against attacks that are coming across the border,\" Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said August 8.\n\nAbout 55 kilometers northeast of Pokrovsk, at the other end of the T-0504 highway, is Kostyantynivka, with a railway spur that runs northwest to Slavyansk and Kramatorsk -- bigger, heavily fortified cities where Ukrainian forces have hospitals, forward command posts, and other critical infrastructure.\n\nRussia wants Kostyantynivka, but in order to occupy it, Moscow's forces need to take Chasiv Yar, a height-of-land city with a manmade waterway, the Siverskiy Donets-Donbas Canal, that splits the town's main district from the eastern Kanal district.\n\nRussian troops occupied all of the Kanal district sometime in June, and have pushed forward to the canal itself, which is a natural defense that the Ukrainians have relied heavily on. Over the past months, small groups of Russian soldiers have tried to cross the canal and establish positions on its west side. Other Russian units have also tried to flank the canal from the north and south.\n\n\"The Russians attack in small groups. They drive all the way to a hideout in light vehicles, gather a few people, and then this small group starts to storm and reach the positions of our guys without being noticed,\" Andriy Polukhin, a spokesman for the 24th King Danylo Mechanized Brigade, told RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service. \"But at the moment, it is not true; [Russian troops] crossing the canal and positioning on the other side. This has not happened.\"\n\nSerhiy Hrabskiy, a retired Ukrainian Army colonel, said the attacking Russian units are still dismounted infantry -- units that do not have cover from tanks or artillery.\n\nFor Ukraine, \"the tactic is exhausting, but the Russians are still able to advance with...numerical superiority. The question is how long they can continue in such a manner,\" he said.\n\nTo east of Pokrovsk, Russian units have successfully pushed a bulge, a salient, in Ukrainian lines, toward Nyu-York, which is frequently spelled New York. On August 7, Russian military bloggers reported that Russian troops had entered one of the town's districts.\n\nThe Russian bulge at Nyu-York puts more pressure on Ukrainian defenses just to the north, at the city of Toretsk, where Russian troops have also gradually crept forward.\n\nCapturing Toretsk would give Russia control of a wider, sprawling urban region that includes the main regional city, Donetsk, and places like Horlivka, Makiyivka, and other industrial locations, Hrabskiy said. Capturing Toretsk will also threaten Kostyantynivka, 22 kilometers to the northwest.\n\n\"Will it cause a total break in Ukrainian positions? No, because the Ukrainians have been able to build other defensive lines,\" he said.\n\nManpower has been one of the biggest problems Ukrainian commanders have grappled with. While Russia has been able to replenish its units by enticing volunteers with extraordinarily high wages and benefits, Ukraine was slow in passing legislation to codify mobilization rules.\n\nWith passage of the law in May, Ukrainian recruiters were able to start getting men into the pipeline for training and equipping. Some frontline units have already reported the arrival of new recruits, and Hrabskiy said the bulk of the newest soldiers should appear by mid-September.\n\n\"To be honest, I'm surprised how our guys are able to hold their lines. They're completed exhausted, not enough men, not enough ammunition,\" he said.\n\nThat should stabilize the front lines, Hrabskiy predicted, but mounting another counteroffensive -- like two successful drives in 2022 or the one that fizzled last year -- is likely impossible for now.\n\n\"I'm doubtful that Ukrainian forces will be able to do anything before the middle of 2025,\" he said.",

Whatever the next step by Ukrainian forces, the attack appeared to push the limits on attacking inside Russia with American-provided equipment and put the Russians in disarray. American-made armored vehicles were also filmed being blown up in a Russian counterattack.\n\nThe goal was to shift the fighting -- and Russian soldiers and weaponry -- onto Russian territory and ease the pressure of Moscow's offensive in eastern Ukraine, a senior Ukrainian official said. He asked not to be cited by name, as Ukraine has not acknowledged its soldiers are fighting in Russia.\n\n\"We are at war,\" he said of striking inside enemy territory. \"Why Russia can and we cannot?\"\n\nSo far the assault has played out \"much more successfully\" than previous cross-border raids, the senior Ukrainian official said.\n\nOperating surreptitiously to evade Russian reconnaissance and spies, Ukraine gathered a force that Russia's top general has estimated at 1,000 soldiers for a mechanized assault on Russia's border, an audacious move after repeated setbacks over the past year and a half.\n\nIn Washington, a State Department spokesperson, Matthew Miller, said Wednesday that the use of US-supplied weapons and munitions in the attack by Ukraine did not violate US policy.\n\n\"Nothing about our policy has changed, and with the actions that they are taking today, they're not in violation of our policy,\" Miller said.\n\nAndriy Zagorodnyuk, a former Ukrainian defense minister who still advises the government, said the goal was not to hold the territory long-term, but rather to challenge the Russians, to \"divert their forces, attention and resources.\" And \"show they have no reserves and no resilience capacity.\"\n\nKonrad Muzyka, a military analyst for Rochan Consulting in Poland, writing in Ukraine Conflict Monitor, said Ukraine could benefit if the attack reduced Russian attacks in the Donetsk region of Ukraine and allowed Ukraine to maintain a presence in the Kursk area, and thus improve its negotiating position. But Ukraine would be the loser if its troops were pushed back with high losses, he said.\n\n\"There is no middle ground here,\" Muzyka wrote. \"The operation is daring. Let's see what the next few days bring.\"\n\nMilitary analysts say they are skeptical that Russia, which has a vastly larger army and arsenal of weapons than Ukraine, would be forced to divert forces from the fighting inside Ukraine to defend its border. Russia has reserves of conscript soldiers it is prohibited by its policies from deploying into Ukraine, but could on Russian soil.\n\nUkraine has remained mostly silent about the attack, which began Tuesday. President Volodymyr Zelensky seemed to hint at an aim of raising the cost of the war for Russians without directly acknowledging the Ukrainian incursion in a speech Wednesday. \"The more pressure is exerted on Russia -- the aggressor that brought war to Ukraine -- the closer peace will be,\" he said.\n\nZelensky, in his nightly address Thursday, again spoke only indirectly of the Ukrainian attack, saying, \"Russia brought war to our land and should feel what it has done.\"\n\nSurprise played the pivotal role, Roman Kostenko, the secretary of the defense and intelligence committee in Ukraine's parliament, said in an interview. \"It was obvious Russia was not prepared and it was a total surprise,\" he said. \"This is rare in modern war.\"\n\nUkraine, he said, should fight wherever conditions are favorable, whether in Russia or along the front line inside the country. \"Our readiness to strike in this way, here or somewhere else, will force Russia to deploy troops to respond.\"\n\n\"They were not expecting us, and they fled wherever they could,\" said a Ukrainian soldier who fought in the assault and who asked to be identified by only his first name, Oleksandr, in keeping with Ukrainian military protocol. His unit took prisoners and captured a tank, he said in a telephone interview.\n\nThe Ukrainians, he said, were motivated to take the fight into Russia. \"To be honest, we all have joy in our hearts,\" Oleksandr said, though he acknowledged there were still risks.\n\nSome analysts estimate that Ukraine has sent hundreds of troops into Russia, a major commitment as its forces are under pressure in the east. Russia's chief of the general staff, Valery Gerasimov, said in televised remarks that Ukraine deployed 1,000 soldiers.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, Russia's Ministry of Defense said it was destroying Ukrainian formations and repelling the attack.\n\nBut a prominent Russian military blogger who writes under the name of Rybar said Thursday that Ukrainian forces had Sudzha, the main town in the area, \"practically under full control.\" Videos from Sudzha, verified by The New York Times, show cars trying to leave amid sounds of gunshots and roads littered with burned vehicles and what appeared to be mines.\n\nZelensky's administration offered its first commentary on the incursion Thursday in a statement by a senior adviser that did not acknowledge any Ukrainian role but portrayed Russians as collectively backing President Vladimir Putin's invasion, signaling the intention was not to affect morale inside Russia.\n\nThe adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, said Russians were not going to \"come out with flowers to greet the anti-Putin tanks,\" and noted that a million Russians had volunteered to serve in the country's military.\n\nThe Ukrainian push involves regular army units, analysts have noted, in a change from the previous incursions, which were carried out by armed groups of Russian exiles backed by Ukraine's army. That tactic offered Ukraine a veneer of noninvolvement.\n\nEuropean Union spokesperson Peter Stano told the Ukrainian news outlet Suspilne that Ukraine \"has the legal right to defend itself, including by striking at the aggressor on its territory.\"\n\nPhotographs and videos posted online and verified by independent military analysts suggested that Ukrainian forces had overrun a Russian metering station for a pipeline exporting natural gas to Europe across Ukraine, which had remained active despite the war. Gazprom, the Russian gas company, told Russian news media that the flows declined slightly. In Europe, natural gas prices rose.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine",

This operation, which began on Tuesday, has seen Ukrainian troops occupy several villages and parts of the town of Sudzha, just 330 miles south of Moscow.\n\nThe operation, supported by Western military equipment, including US-provided armoured vehicles, has sent shockwaves through Moscow, drawing both condemnation and concern.\n\nThe invasion appears to be part of a broader strategy by Kyiv to bring the war directly to Russian soil, potentially diverting Russian forces from other critical fronts, and possibly gaining leverage in any future negotiations.\n\nWatch:\n\nAs Ukrainian troops battle for control, the significance of this offensive extends beyond the immediate military engagement, with potential implications for energy security in Europe.\n\nWhat did Ukraine's military strategy involve?\n\nThis incursion represents a significant escalation in the conflict, with Ukrainian forces reportedly advancing more than six miles into Russian territory.\n\nThe offensive has involved elite Ukrainian assault brigades equipped with US and German vehicles, marking a stark contrast from previous raids conducted by volunteer groups opposed to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nRussian military bloggers have suggested that nearly 1,000 Ukrainian soldiers are involved in the operation, a figure that exceeds initial estimates.\n\nHow have stakeholders responded?\n\nThe Biden administration, while surprised by the scale of the operation, has deemed it an acceptable use of US weapons, aligning with a policy change from May that permits Ukrainian forces to strike within Russian territory if it prevents or responds to attacks on Ukraine.\n\n\"As they see attacks coming across the border, they have to be able to have the capabilities to respond,\" Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh told reporters during a briefing. Similarly, German officials have voiced their support for Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right to self-defence under international law.\n\nDespite the significant use of Western military aid, the Ukrainian government has maintained a strict silence on the operation, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian General Staff refraining from public acknowledgment of the offensive.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Everyone can see that the Ukrainian army knows how to surprise [and] achieve results,\" Zelenskyy said on Thursday, without referencing to the assault. \"Russia brought the war to our land and should feel what it has done,\u00e2\u20ac Zelenskyy said in his evening address.\n\nWhat was the impact on Russia and how did it respond?\n\nThe Ukrainian advance into Kursk has not been without cost. According to Alexey Smirnov, the acting governor of Kursk, the ongoing battles have resulted in the deaths of at least five civilians, with 31 others wounded, including six children.\n\nThe Ukrainian forces have also reportedly seized a gas-metering station used by Russia for energy transactions with Hungary and Slovakia, heightening fears of disruptions to European energy supplies. The station, located about five miles inside Russia, remains under Ukrainian control, although gas continues to flow through the pipeline.\n\nThe Kursk nuclear power station, situated approximately 40 miles northeast of Sudzha, has also come under increased scrutiny, with Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s National Guard enhancing security measures around the facility. The proximity of the fighting to such critical infrastructure raises concerns about the broader implications of the Ukrainian offensive, particularly if the conflict escalates further.\n\nIn response to the incursion, Russian forces have deployed airstrikes, missile, and artillery fire in an attempt to halt the Ukrainian advance. Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most senior military commander, Valery Gerasimov, has informed Putin that the Ukrainian offensive has been halted, though reports from military bloggers suggest that the situation on the ground remains fluid, with some areas still under Ukrainian control.\n\nCan this strategic move by Kyiv change the war's trajectory?\n\nThe invasion of Kursk by Ukrainian forces comes at a crucial juncture in the broader conflict, with significant potential implications for the future of the war and the geopolitical landscape.\n\nOne of the most pressing concerns is the impact on European energy security, particularly with the risk of disruptions to the Urengoy\u00e2\u20ac\"Pomary\u00e2\u20ac\"Uzhhorod pipeline, which transported approximately 14.65 billion cubic metres of gas to Europe in 2023.\n\nAnalysts have suggested that the attack on the gas metering station in Sudzha could be part of a broader strategy by Kyiv to destabilise Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s energy system, much like how Moscow has targeted Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s energy infrastructure.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The main thing [about the attack] is energy supplies. The more destabilised they are, the more destabilised the Russian economy is,\u00e2\u20ac Al Jazeera quoted Kyiv-based analyst Taras Zahorodniy.\n\nThe Ukrainian government has also hinted at the possibility of using the captured gas station as leverage in future negotiations, though it has downplayed its immediate significance, given that Kyiv could have disrupted gas flows at any point along the pipeline.\n\nWhy now?\n\nUkrainian officials have expressed urgency in strengthening their military position ahead of the US presidential elections in November, with concerns that a potential shift in US political leadership could alter the trajectory of Western support.\n\nZelenskyy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s adviser stated the strategic importance of the timing of the offensive, telling the Washington Post, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This will give them the leverage they need for negotiations with Russia \u00e2\u20ac\" this is what it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all about.\u00e2\u20ac\n\nAlso Watch:\n\nThe situation remains highly volatile, with potential repercussions for European energy security and the stability of Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategic assets.", "source": {"uri":

Thousands of Ukrainian soldiers charged across the Russian border this week for the first time since the conflict began. Since then, these troops have reinforced their positions, suggesting Ukraine intends to hold the territory it has seized.\n\nThe move - described last night by a former UK intelligence officer as a 'masterstroke' - could prove a game-changer in future peace talks. On state television Putin described the Ukrainian incursion into Russian territory, some 320 miles from Moscow, as a 'large scale provocation'.\n\nIn an apparent bid to deflect blame, a senior Russian politician last night accused Britain of instigating and taking part in the operation. Adalbi Shkhagoshev, a member of the State Duma Committee told Russian media outlets: 'Britain participated in all such sorties. English was heard.'\n\nThe Kursk region, where the incursion took place, is critical for Russian gas supplies - so Moscow's highly lucrative exports of natural resources could be compromised. If Ukraine can hold the ground, it could be used as a bargaining chip to get back Russian-occupied areas of eastern Ukraine.\n\nLast night, Putin faced a dilemma - accept such a strategically damaging and embarrassing loss of territory, or pull together a force capable of dislodging the Ukrainian forces. The second option would require thousands of Russian soldiers to be withdrawn from the 700-mile frontline in eastern Ukraine, which would inevitably weaken these positions.\n\nLast night, former British military intelligence officer Philip Ingram said: 'The mini-invasion targeted an area where Russian defences are weak. Ukraine has embarrassed Putin and the Russian military. They've brought the war to ordinary Russians and set the conditions for negotiations. It is too early to tell Ukraine's ultimate objectives, but on the surface it could be a masterstroke if they can continue the advance and hold off Russian counterattacks.'\n\nKremlin chiefs were last night holding crisis meetings with officials in Kursk about how to respond. Unverified images on social media suggested Russian conscripts surrendered near the town of Sudzha. Meanwhile, thousands of civilians have also been evacuated.\n\nThe advance began on Tuesday and late yesterday, reports suggested Ukrainian forces were up to 12 miles inside Russia. Heavy fighting was continuing.\n\nA senior adviser to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, Mykhailo Podolyak, said: 'Russia has consistently believed legal norms do not apply to it, thus it can attack neighbouring countries with impunity. 'But war is war, with its own rules, where the aggressor inevitably reaps corresponding outcomes. 'The root cause of any escalation, including with Russia's own territory, like Kursk, is solely Russia's unequivocal aggression.'\n\nPrevious Ukrainian incursions into Russian territory have been 'hit and run' missions, but this operation involves regular troops with support from artillery, engineers and drones.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

are still advancing.\n\nOur live coverage remains paused again today, but here are the key developments that took place over the last 24 hours.\n\nKursk incursion continues\n\nRussia is still fighting intense battles against Ukrainian forces that penetrated its southern border into Kursk near a major natural gas transmission hub.\n\nIt's not yet clear how far Ukrainian troops have penetrated inside Russian territory, but some military bloggers have suggested that Kyiv could have control of Sudzha - which is the last operational trans-shipping point for Russian natural gas to Europe via Ukraine.\n\nThe acting governor of Kursk region, Alexey Smirnov, said he had introduced a state of emergency in the border region.\n\nVarious Russian sources have suggested forces have halted Ukrainian progress, while others indicate Kyiv's troops are still advancing.\n\nUkraine is still yet to comment officially on the incursion.\n\nRussian-American set for jail time\n\nRussian prosecutors have asked a court to sentence Russian-American dual citizen Ksenia Karelina, accused of treason for making a donation to a charity supporting Ukraine, to 15 years in jail, Russian news agencies have reported.\n\nThis comes just days after a massive prisoner swap between the West and Russia.\n\nRussia must take 'all of Ukraine'\n\nAs a result of the Kursk attack, Russia should expand its war aims to include taking all of Ukraine, according to Putin ally and Kremlin hawk Dmitry Medvedev.\n\n\"From this moment on, the SVO (Special Military Operation) should acquire an openly extraterritorial character,\" the former president said, adding that Russian forces should go to Odesa, Kharkiv, Dnipro, Mykolaiv, Kyiv \"and beyond\".\n\nNorth Korea delegation expected in Russia\n\nA North Korean military delegation will attend a military-technical forum in the Moscow region on 12-14 August, reported Russian state-run news agency RIA Novosti.\n\nThe two countries have

Lipetsk's emergency ministry also reported a fire at a military airfield in the region.\n\n\"The enemy is hitting civilians in Kursk and Belgorod,\" Artamonov wrote on Telegram. \"Today [it] massively attacked our region with drones. We will not be frightened, we will not give in, but we are not going to risk the lives of our people either.\"\n\nRussia's defense ministry said Friday it intercepted and destroyed 75 \"aircraft-type\" drones, including 19 over Lipetsk, 26 over Belgorod, seven over Kursk, and several others over the regions of Bryansk, Voronezh, and Orel. It said it also destroyed five over Crimea and eight over the waters of the Black Sea.\n\nThe reports show that Ukraine's assault on Russia is not letting up. Although pro-Ukrainian groups of Russian nationals have mounted fleeting cross-border assaults on Russia, and Ukraine has repeatedly targeted the border region of Belgorod with airstrikes, this week's incursion marks the first time that regular Ukrainian and special operations units have strode into Russian territory.\n\nThe intention, according to US and Ukrainian officials, is partly to divert Russian forces away from other parts of the eastern front - from which they have been able to bombard Ukraine's Kharkiv region - and partly to disrupt and demoralize Russian forces. US officials do not believe Ukraine intends to hold Russian territory for the long term.\n\nOn Thursday, Kursk residents wrote on Telegram that \"huge, furious battles are underway,\" and recorded a video address to Russian President Vladimir Putin asking for his help.\n\nMykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelensky, praised the Western response to the Ukrainian assault, saying \"most quietly approve\" of it. Previous Ukrainian attacks on Russia have made some Western officials jittery, with some arguing that Kyiv should fight only a defensive war to avoid provoking a potential Russian escalation.\n\nPodolyak said Thursday that the West's response had been \"absolutely calm, balanced, objective, and based on an understanding of the spirit of international law and the principles of defensive warfare.\" Unlike Zelensky, Podolyak directly referenced \"events in the Kursk region.\"\n\n\"Now, a significant part of the global community considers [Russia] a legitimate target for any operations and types of weapons,\" he added.\n\nThe European Union foreign affairs spokesperson Peter Stanno said Wednesday that Ukraine \"has the legal right to defend itself, including striking an aggressor on its territory.\" US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller was slightly more tight-lipped, saying Ukraine has to decide its own tactics.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Ukrainians know how to achieve their goals,\" he added.\n\nOn the night of Aug. 5-6, Ukraine intensified its shelling of the Kursk region. The artillery attack was followed by the incursion of Ukraine's infantry, supported by tanks and armored vehicles, near the city of Sudzha.\n\nInitially, the Russian Defense Ministry reported Tuesday that 300 Ukrainian troops, 11 tanks and 20 armored vehicles crossed the Russian border. But on Wednesday, the chief of the Russian General Staff, Valery Gerasimov, claimed that a group of around 1,000 servicemen was taking part in the battle from Ukraine's side.\n\nExperts said the possible goals of the assault include the destruction of the Sudzha gas station through which Russia pumps gas to Europe, an attempt to divert the attention of the Russian command from Donbass, the destruction of the railway through which Russia supplies its forces in Ukraine's Kharkiv region and strengthening the moral of the Ukrainian army.\n\nRussian authorities also fear for the fate of the Kursk nuclear power plant, located in the vicinity of the fighting, and its security was strengthened, according to the Russian Guard Corps.\n\nKursk regional authorities said five civilians were killed in Ukraine's attack, including a paramedic, an ambulance driver and a 24-year-old pregnant woman, and 66 were injured, including six children. They called for a major evacuation from the area of combat activities.\n\nRussian war correspondent Evgeny Poddubny was initially announced as killed while covering the fighting, but later reports revealed he was alive although severely injured.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin called Ukraine's actions a \"major provocation\" and an \"indiscriminate attack with a variety of weapons, including missiles, against civilian facilities, residential buildings and ambulance vehicles.\"\n\nUkraine has not claimed responsibility. However, several high-ranking officials indirectly confirmed Kyiv's involvement.", "source": {"uri": "aa.com.tr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anadolu Ajans\u0131"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk_Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kursk Oblast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kursk Oblast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegram_(messaging_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Telegram (messaging service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukrainians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudzha,_Kursk_Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sudzha, Kursk Oblast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sudzha, Kursk Oblast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donbas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donbas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Staff_of_the_Armed_Forces_of_the_Russian_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valery_Gerasimov", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valery Gerasimov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kursk"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kursk"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia\u2013Ukraine_border", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russia\u2013Ukraine border"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infantry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infantry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_(Russia)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defence (Russia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiscriminate_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiscriminate attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_Ground_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukrainian Ground Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Guards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian Guards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_correspondent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "War correspondent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_plant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear power plant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv_Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv Oblast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv Oblast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://cdnuploads.aa.com.tr/uploads/Contents/2024/08/09/thumbs_b_c_d6c8d3c52e8af42b5ee48fb47f163b11.jpg?v=070816", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799944", "eventUri": "eng-9799944", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "dateEnd": "2024-08-06", "textStart": 506, "textEnd": 514}], "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

The attacking force seems to consist of about two brigades of tanks and infantry fighting vehicles, totaling about 1500 to 2000 troops. The attack swiftly overran Russian positions, seized over 200 square miles of Russian territory, seized the gas pumping station that controls all Russian gas flows to Europe, and appears to have controlled the main Russian railway supply route for Russian forces in Ukraine.\n\nU.S., Ukrainian and Russian officials all acknowledged the ongoing attack, which stunned Moscow and appeared to involve the use of armored fighting vehicles donated to Kyiv by the United States and its European partners -- a development that drew no immediate objection from the Biden administration despite its past restrictions on such use of American weaponry.\n\nBiden's national security apparatus was caught flat-footed; perhaps that was why the Ukrainians achieved tactical and operational surprise. Putin was not happy.\n\nKirby states the US officials will be \"reaching out to our Ukrainian counterparts to get a little better understanding\" of the situation in Kursk Oblast, Russia.\n\nHe added that the US has not changed its policy of authorising Ukraine to use American-supplied weapons \"to target imminent threats just across the border\".\n\nOn Tuesday, 6 August, the Russians reported about Ukraine's attempts to infiltrate into the territory of Kursk Oblast.\n\nRussian propagandists and milbloggers are claiming that Ukrainian forces are in a border area. Russian ruler Vladimir Putin called the situation a \"provocation\".\n\nNaturally, the situation is more than a little unclear. Neither the Russians nor Ukrainians have offered much,\n\nWhere Did The Ukrainians Get the Troops?\n\nThe bulk of the troops seem to have come from the Belarus-Ukraine border. Lukashenko withdrew his troops from the Ukrainian border on July 13. We're seeing Stryker Armored Fighting Vehicles and a mix of tanks on the Ukrainian side, indicating the presence of one of the mechanized brigades formed during the Spring of 2023. A safe guess is that Ukraine has allocated a reinforced brigade to the attack.\n\nHow Did It Happen?\n\nYou don't give the Tsar unpleasant information. The invasion of Ukraine unfolded the way it did because the FSB directorate responsible for intelligence in Ukraine gave optimistic reports about the desire of Ukraine for an Anschluss and said the Ukrainian Army would not fight. According to Bloomberg, something similar happened this time.\n\nGerasimov and top officials \"seemingly dismissed intelligence warnings that Ukrainian soldiers were gathering near the border with Russia's western Kursk region as much as two weeks before they began the assault,\" Bloomberg said.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin was also not briefed on the troop buildup, the unnamed source reportedly told Bloomberg.\n\nTrue or not true? It's hard to tell. There were no missile strikes or air strikes in the Ukrainian assembly areas, something you'd think the Russians would've attempted had they known an attack was being staged. On the other hand, the Ukrainians have enough air defense assets that they could've made those areas a tough target. My guess would be that if Ukrainian troops were spotted, they were assumed to be reinforcements for Ukrainian units fighting on the Russian border in Kharkiv Oblast. As I've noted in my updates, the Ukrainians made a lot of fuss about putting troops in this area after Kadyrov's Chechens briefly invaded Sumy Oblast; see Putin's War, Week 120. Zelensky Gets Security Agreement With the US and the Repo Man Comes for Russia - RedState. With a lot of other plausible excuses, you can bet no one wanted to be the guy to tell Putin, \"Boss, I think we're about to be invaded.\"\n\nTelegram channels insist that the massing of Ukrainian troops was known and reported.\n\nThese are some great shots of a grim Putin sitting at his von Stauffenberg table.\n\nThis offensive has limited objectives. It is an embarrassment to the Russian government; this is the first time Russia has been invaded since Operation Barbarossa. Given Russia's recent history of invading its neighbors, it was time for Karma to make a house call. While the offensive has operational objectives like the primary rail line supplying Russian troops in Kharkiv and northern Luhansk, it will also force Russia to move troops from other sectors to try to stop the advance.\n\nThis thread gives a good rundown of the tactical options available.\n\nThe operation also seemed to be designed to bring Russia to the bargaining table with a reasonable set of expectations.\n\nUkraine probably has a week where it can run wild before Russia can mass sufficient forces, in quantity and quality, to stop them. Then Ukraine will have to make a decision to either dig in and hold the gains and use that as a bargaining chip to get a Russian withdrawal or pull back.\n\nRussia's Army is totally committed in Ukraine, and any major shift of forces will create a weakness somewhere. The current situation maps, if accurate, indicate that the Russian forces that attacked Kharkiv in March can no longer be supplied because the railway lines in Kursk Oblast are cut.\n\nUkraine's challenge is to convert a tactical and operational victory into something that has strategic impact.\n\nRussia has been knocked back on its heels, and Putin has been made to look rather ridiculous. He's not going to take that lying down because if the Tsar is not omnipotent, well, he's not the Tsar. It is hard to see how Gerasimov and most of the Russian General Staff survive this fiasco.\n\nThe episode has also demonstrated a degree of operational brilliance that no one expected. So far, the Ukrainians have seemed as mired in Soviet-era tactics as the Russians. Last summer's offensive failed because high-value equipment was spread among the good old boy network instead of consolidated. The tactical flexibility we've seen over the last three days has starkly contrasted with what we've grown accustomed to. If this doesn't result in a fiasco, and war is nothing if not unpredictable, the Ukrainians have shown their tutors in NATO that they've learned their lessons well.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com",

Videos published on social media and geolocated by the Financial Times showed massive explosions reaching into the night sky.\n\nThe Ukrainian official claimed that up to 700 glide bombs stored in the warehouses were damaged or destroyed. Several dozen fighter jets, including Su-34, Su-35 and MiG-31 aircraft, along with military helicopters that have been used in Russia's attacks inside Ukraine, were also located at the air base, said the general staff of Ukraine's army.\n\n\"Most of the planes stationed at the military airfield\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009did not have time to take off,\" the Ukrainian official claimed.\n\nThe FT could not immediately verify whether the bombs and aircraft had been damaged or destroyed. Russian military bloggers reported that no aircraft were damaged.\n\nLipetsk authorities imposed a state of emergency and ordered the evacuation of residents in nearby towns following the attack. Videos shared on Russian Telegram channels showed lines of civilian vehicles stretching several kilometres fleeing east from the area.\n\nThe Ukrainian official said the Lipetsk attack was a follow-up to an assault on the Morozovsk military base in Russia's Rostov region on Monday that had destroyed anti-aircraft missiles and jet fighters.\n\nUkraine's general staff said its forces had attacked anti-aircraft missile divisions of Russia in the occupied territory of the eastern Donetsk region.\n\nThose attacks came as Ukrainian forces pressed forward with their assault in the neighbouring Kursk region, where the Kremlin has lost control of roughly 350 sq km of territory, according to calculations by the FT and military analysts.\n\nAlexei Smirnov, the Kursk region's acting governor, said on Friday that the situation remained \"difficult\". He said his government had declared a state of emergency, was still working to evacuate residents and was providing assistance to those displaced by the fighting.\n\nVideo and photo evidence suggests that Ukraine's army has moved as deep as 35km into Russia from the international border, down a highway heading north-west.\n\nA video circulating on social media that the FT geolocated to a highway in Rylsk showed a destroyed column of several Russian military vehicles transporting soldiers that stretched for hundreds of meters. The bodies of several troops are seen in the gruesome video.\n\nA person with knowledge of the operation shared a video with the FT that purported to show a first-person-view (FPV) camera-equipped drone armed with an explosive as it crashed into the tail rotor of a Russian military helicopter.\n\nThe person said the SBU was behind the strike, the second Ukrainian FPV drone attack on a Russian helicopter this week. The person said both helicopters crashed as a result of the strikes, but the FT was unable to independently corroborate the claims.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy has still not explicitly commented on the incursion, adhering to his office's policy of operational silence during large-scale counteroffensives, but he thanked Ukrainian troops on Friday morning for \"destroying the Russian occupiers, holding the frontline, and ensuring that Ukraine remains on the world map\".\n\n\"We are doing our best to provide our warriors with as many opportunities as possible to end this war as soon as possible with a just and lasting peace,\" he said.\n\nElements of at least four Ukrainian mechanised and airborne brigades have taken part in the operation so far.\n\nAndriy Zagorodnyuk, a former Ukrainian defence minister who still advises the government, told the FT that Kyiv had planned the operation long in advance.\n\nIts aims include diverting Russian troops fighting in other regions of Ukraine, as well as bringing the war home to Russians and discouraging them from supporting the war effort.\n\nIt also aims to expose Russia's weaknesses, including that it is incapable of protecting its own border, and to try to seize the initiative on the battlefield a year after an unsuccessful counteroffensive, and following months of Russian gains.\n\n\u2060Zagorodnyuk said the Ukrainian military was proving its ability to conduct \"new tactics of combined arms operation\" that had been taught by western military trainers.\n\nHe said the aim was not to capture and hold on to Russian territory \"for long\". \"We don't need Russian land,\" he said. \"We want them to fail on ours.\"\n\nKonrad Muzyka, a military analyst at Rochan Consulting, a Poland-based security group, said the Ukrainian operation could help its position in the war if it forces Russia to divert resources from the eastern Donetsk region and allows Kyiv to maintain a presence in the Kursk region.\n\nThat presence may offer a better negotiating position in the future, he said.\n\n\"If Ukrainian troops, however, are pushed back from the Russian territory without any tangible results with high losses and if Russians continue moving towards Pokrovsk,\" he said, then Ukraine and its top military leadership will be seen as having made a massive gamble and lost.\n\n\"There is no middle ground here. The operation is daring.\"", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc",

Exactly what our country needs now.\"\n\nRussia claimed earlier that Kyiv's forces fired rockets at civilian and residential targets in the Kursk region amid reports by Russian pro-war bloggers that a number of villages have been captured by Ukrainian forces as they advance into Russian territory.\n\nThe acting governor of Kursk, Aleksei Smirnov, declared a state of emergency on August 7 after Russian President Vladimir Putin called the military operation \"another large-scale provocation.\"\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry in a statement on August 8 said Russia's Battlegroup North and border guard units had thwarted Ukrainian forces' attempts to break through the districts of Sudzha and Korenevo.\n\nEarlier, the ministry claimed to have downed six drones and five missiles over the Kursk region and 14 drones in the Belgorod region.\n\nBelgorod regional Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov claimed that a man died and one person was injured in Ukrainian shelling of Shebekino.\n\nMeanwhile, in Ukraine's eastern region of Donetsk, two civilians were killed on August 8 by Russian shelling of Kostyantynivka, regional Governor Vadym Filashkin said on Telegram.\n\nRussian air strikes in the Sumy region killed two people, including a child, and two more were wounded, said the governor of Sumy, Volodymyr Artyukh.\n\nRussia also said Ukrainian forces penetrated its border near the major natural gas transmission hub at Sudzha. The Sudzha gas transfer and measuring stations in the Kursk region are the only entry point for Russian natural gas into the Ukrainian gas transmission system for onward transport to Europe.\n\nUkrainian Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said on August 8 that Ukraine had not been contacted by Russia about the situation with gas transit, but the transit route for Russian gas deliveries to Europe via Ukraine is still functioning.\n\nIn addition, the International Atomic Energy Agency said on August 8 that it is aware of developments around Russia's Kursk nuclear plant and is monitoring the situation, according to Russian news agency RIA Novosti.\n\nDmitry Medvedev, the former president who is now deputy chief of Russia's Security Council, has called for Russian troops to press deeper into Ukraine as Moscow claims to have intercepted Ukrainian drones and missiles targeting the Kursk region.\n\nCommenting on the Ukrainian incursion in the Kursk region, Medvedev said Moscow should aim beyond securing the territories that Russia considers its own and urged further advance into Ukraine's Odesa, Kharkiv, Dnipro, Mykolayiv, and Kyiv regions.\n\nEU spokesman Peter Stano told RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service that while the bloc does not comment on battlefield operations, it believes \"Ukraine has a legal right to defend itself, including striking an aggressor on its territory.\"\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby on August 7 said the White House had reached out to Ukraine to \"get a little better understanding\" of the situation in the Kursk region.\n\nState Department spokesman Matthew Miller confirmed on August 7 that Washington's policy on the use of U.S. weapons by Ukraine across the border or against Russian military facilities had not changed.\n\nThe actions taking place \"are not a violation of our policy,\" Miller added.", "source": {"uri": "rferl.org", "dataType": "news", "title":

A state of emergency was declared in one of the districts in the area.\n\nKyiv's surprise offensive into Russia, which began on Tuesday, has temporarily shifted the focus of the war, opening a new front inside Russia and prompting Moscow to scramble to halt the Ukrainian advance.\n\nAt the same, the operation has raised questions about whether it is worth the risk, given that Ukrainian forces are already stretched. It is also not clear whether the mission will help Ukraine improve its position on the rest of the battlefield, where it has been steadily losing ground for many months.\n\nThe Ukrainian military has enforced a policy of silence about the operation, and has not publicly acknowledged launching a cross-border attack.\n\nSeveral military analysts said the assault appeared to be the largest on Russian soil since the war began two and a half years ago. They said the attack had involved elements of at least four brigades in a rare example of successful maneuver operations involving support from artillery, air defenses and electronic warfare, resulting in quick advances on the ground.\n\n\"It seems to be a fairly well-coordinated an planned combined armed operation,\" said Franz-Stefan Gady, a Vienna-based military analyst. \"You have electronic warfare assets that were deployed to jam Russian command and control. You have air defenses that were moved in to create air defense bubbles around the Ukrainian advance. And then you have fairly effective mechanized formations moving forward at a fairly steady pace.\"\n\nMr. Gady and other experts said the main question now was whether Ukraine can maintain the momentum and turn the success on Russian territory into useful gains. The Ukrainian Army has few reserves it can pour into the fight, and it continues to suffer from shortages of weapons and ammunition, analysts say.\n\nIt also remains unclear what Ukraine ultimately hopes to accomplish. A senior Ukrainian official who spoke the on condition of anonymity to discuss the operation said the goal was to draw Russian troops away from other parts of the front line where Ukrainian units are struggling. But military experts said that Russia would likely be able to respond with reserves who were not fighting in Ukraine.\n\n\"Does it really solve any of the larger military strategic problems that the other parts of the front line are suffering from?\" Mr. Gady asked.\n\nA map of the battlefield by the Black Bird Group, a Finland-based organization that analyzes images from the battlefield, shows that Ukrainian troops have gained about 100 square miles of Russian territory since the beginning of the attack, although it remains unclear whether they have secured control of all of it. They have advanced past two lines of Russian defenses.\n\nIn particular, the Ukrainian army has closed in on Sudzha, a small town of about 6,000 people six miles from the Ukrainian-Russian border.\n\nEmil Kastehelmi, an analyst from the Black Bird Group, wrote on the social platform X that some Ukrainian units appeared to be conducting probing raids further north in the direction Lgov, a town about 50 miles from the border, in what appears to be a test of Russian defenses.\n\nA video posted on social media on Friday morning and verified by The New York Times showed a column of destroyed military vehicles just east of Rylsk, a town west of the border area captured by Ukraine. It was not immediately clear whether the vehicles were Russian or Ukrainian.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Ukraine will try to push further into Russian territory to solidify control over the area it has captured, or retreat after a few days, as has happened in previous, smaller-scale cross-border raids.\n\nMr. Kastehelmi said Ukraine could not continue further north without widening its flanks and exposing itself to Russian counterattacks. \"Time is also running against Ukrainians,\" he wrote. \"Russians won't be disorganized forever.\"", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news",

The American Institute for the Study of War (ISW) reports that Ukrainian troops have advanced at least 10 kilometers into the Kursk Oblast.\n\nAmidst the official silence, Mykhailo Podoliak, an advisor to the Ukrainian President's Office, offered the sole commentary from the Ukrainian side. He suggested that operations like this could positively influence future negotiations with Russia.\n\n\"Russia will only negotiate seriously when they realize the war isn't going according to their plan,\" Podoliak stated on Ukrainian television.\n\nEuromaidan Press sought expert opinions on whether the Ukrainian operation in Russia's Kursk Oblast is strategically linked to future peace negotiations.\n\nWhat is going on in Russia's Kursk Oblast?\n\nOn Monday night, Russia's Kursk Oblast was attacked by drones, with local authorities reporting that they shot down 26 fixed-wing drones over the area. That same night, the district center of Sudzha, located just 10 kilometers from the Russian-Ukrainian border, came under fire.\n\nBy the following morning, reports began to emerge about armed groups breaking through at several points along the border and engaging in battles in the border zone. These events bore similarities to incursions carried out in 2023 and 2024 by volunteer battalions comprising Russians fighting for Ukraine, such as the Russian Volunteer Corps and the Freedom of Russia Legion.\n\nHowever, the current incursion appeared to be on a larger scale, with the presence of armored vehicles and clear coordination between the advancing units along different routes. This suggested a more organized and substantial operation compared to previous cross-border raids.\n\nRussian official sources provided conflicting accounts of the situation. Some claimed the Ukrainian raid had been suppressed, while others insisted that the fighting continued.\n\nOn the morning of 7 August, it became clear that battles were indeed ongoing, with influential bloggers reporting that the Ukrainian Armed Forces had captured 11 settlements. The city of Sudzha was either surrounded or already under Ukrainian control.\n\nAs of 8 August, the situation in the Kursk Oblast remained unclear. Ukrainian authorities and military officials maintained their silence, while Russian Telegram channels reported that fighting was taking place 26 kilometers from the border, with the town of Sudzha reportedly under Ukrainian control.\n\nUnconfirmed reports also suggested that remnants of the Wagner group fighters, who had been in Africa, were being urgently deployed to the Kursk Oblast.\n\nSudzha is key to Europe's energy chessboard\n\nFrom a military perspective, Sudzha is a crucial logistical point, as it's located near a railway that Russians use to supply their front in northern Kharkiv Oblast. However, its significance extends beyond this.\n\nUnconfirmed reports suggest that Ukrainian forces have seized control of the Sudzha gas metering station, a critical component of the last remaining pipeline transporting Russian gas to Europe via Ukraine. The station's capture could have far-reaching consequences for European energy markets.\n\nOn 8 August, the Ukrainian Gas Transmission System Operator reported a decrease in Russian gas transit through Ukraine to 37.25 million cubic meters, down from the usual 42-42.4 million. This reduction coincided with reports of Ukrainian troops seizing the Sudzha gas intake point.\n\nThe news had an immediate impact on European gas prices. Bloomberg reported that benchmark futures rose 4.8% to \u20ac38.45 per megawatt-hour, the highest since December.\n\n\"While Europe has made efforts to wean itself off piped Russian gas since the war, a potential cut to supplies would still be a shock, pushing up prices for consumers and industry,\" Bloomberg wrote.\n\nThe Ukrainian advance also puts them halfway to the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant in nearby Kurchatov. This proximity has sparked speculation about a potential Ukrainian plan to capture the Kursk NPP, possibly to negotiate an exchange for the Zaporizhzhia NPP, Europe's largest power plant occupied by Russia in 2022.\n\n\"Reclaiming the Zaporizhzhia NPP would be a game-changer, restoring 30% of our pre-war electricity. It's an ideal but unlikely scenario,\" Ukrainian analyst Viktor Andrusiv stated on Telegram.\n\nDefense expert Mykhailo Samus echoes this sentiment, dismissing such speculations.\n\n\"All of this is still at the level of fantasy with varying degrees of creativity,\" he told Euromaidan Press.\n\nIs this really about potential talks?\n\nMykhailo Samus believes it's too early to evaluate the goals of the Ukrainian offensive in Kursk.\n\nHowever, he suggests \"this is an attempt to turn the tide of the war and seize the strategic initiative. Logically, there should be other actions on other fronts as well.\"\n\nRegarding the potential for improving Ukraine's position before hypothetical negotiations, Samus believes the time for that has not yet come.\n\n\"It's too early to talk about negotiations, except perhaps negotiations between Zelenskyy and the new US president about a further strategy to destroy Russia,\" he says.\n\nIn contrast, Dmytro Shulha of the Renaissance Foundation supports improving Ukraine's position before negotiations. Paraphrasing Clausewitz, Shulha wrote that \"war is the continuation of negotiations by other means.\"\n\n\"Suddenly, Russians are concerned about nuclear plant safety and civilian shelling. Watch as they soon worry about energy security from refinery strikes, and maritime security from port attacks. At this rate, they might even consider the 1991 borders [of Ukraine] as part of a 'just peace' formula,\" he wrote on Facebook.\n\nSecurity analyst Jimmy Rushton argues a successful Ukrainian operation in Kursk Oblast would make it harder for Russia to freeze the conflict.\n\n\"If Ukraine is occupying Russian territory, it makes any attempt by Moscow to \"freeze the conflict along the current lines of control\" - something they've been back-channeling they would accept for a while - far more complicated,\" he wrote on X/Twitter.\n\nUkrainian aerial reconnaissance specialist Oleksandr Karpiuk believes the Kursk operation disrupted the Russian offensive in Ukrainian Sumy Oblast.\n\n\"Ukrainian forces entered Kursk Oblast to create a buffer zone, preempting attacks on Sumy. This distracts the enemy, buying Ukraine time while Russia focuses air power on its own territory,\" he wrote on Facebook.\n\nFormer Ukrainian Defense Ministry advisor Oleksiy Kopytko sees the Kursk operation as part of defending Kharkiv.\n\n\"The operation is limited so far, but it'll weaken Russian forces near Kharkiv. Their reserves intended for Kupiansk and the Kharkiv-Sumy gap will be depleted on the 'Kursk front' instead,\" the expert wrote on Facebook.\n\nGreen light from the West\n\nWestern allies have rallied behind Ukraine's recent military action, showcasing a united front. The US, while not informed beforehand of the Kursk operation, seeks details and supports Ukraine's \"common sense\" defensive measures.\n\nUS State Department spokesman Matthew Miller dismissed Moscow's condemnations of the Ukrainian attack.\n\n\"I have seen the statements from the Russian government. It is a little bit rich, them calling it a provocation, given Russia violated Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty,\" he told a briefing.\n\nEuropean support echoes this sentiment.\n\nThe European Commission's Peter Stano reaffirmed Ukraine's right to self-defense, asserting: \"Ukraine has the legitimate right to defend itself, including striking the aggressor on its territory.\"\n\nGermany took a significant step by allowing German-supplied weapons to be used within Russian borders.\n\n\"Due to Russia's attack on Ukraine, the territory of both states is a combat zone. The use of weapons falls under the provisions of international law,\" Bundestag defense committee chair Markus Faber explained.\n\nThis applies to \"all armaments,\" including the advanced Leopard 2 tanks.\n\nUkrainian Kursk incursion reveals Russia's systemic weaknesses\n\nUkrainian incursion into the Kursk Oblast caught many, including the Russian command, by surprise, according to Ukrainian OSINT-analyst Tatarigami.\n\n\"The operation's skillful planning is evident. Russia failed to assemble an adequate rapid response force and misread Ukraine's intentions, despite extensive ISR capabilities over the frontlines and even deep into Ukrainian territory,\" Tatarigami told Euromaidan Press.\n\nThis bold move challenges concerns over escalation that previously limited Ukraine's use of ATACMS and similar systems in Russian territory. Despite the direct threat to Russia's territorial integrity, no nuclear retaliation has occurred.\n\nThe operation also exposes Russia's persistent inability to respond swiftly to battlefield developments, a weakness first seen during the 2022 Kharkiv counter-offensive. This stems from over-centralized control and concentrated decision-making, hampering quick responses.\n\n\"This incursion has rekindled hope and optimism in Ukraine and the West, countering the perception of a static battlefield where Ukraine was slowly losing ground,\" Tatarigami added, highlighting the operation's impact on morale and strategic perceptions.\n\nRead more:", "source":

English was heard.\"\n\nRussia accused Ukraine of launching a \"major provocation\" and \"firing indiscriminately\" at civilian buildings and residences.\n\nRussia's Chief of General Staff Valery Gerasimov said the \"advance\" into the Kursk region had been stopped, with Russian forces \"continuing to destroy the adversary in areas directly adjacent to the Russian-Ukrainian border\".\n\nGerasimov said Ukrainian forces aimed to take over the area around the town of Sudzha, and that Russia had already killed 100 men and injured another 215.\n\nIt also may be intended to divert Russian troops from other locations along the front, where Ukraine's military has steadily lost ground in recent months. Analysts suggested Kyiv could be trying to gain leverage for any future negotiations with the Kremlin.\n\nThe recent offensive into Russian territory seems to be carried out by a substantial force of several thousand Ukrainian soldiers, including members of elite assault units. These troops are equipped with vehicles and tanks provided by the United States and Germany. According to Russian officials and pro-war military bloggers, the Ukrainian forces entered Russia on Tuesday from the Sumy region in northeastern Ukraine, reported Washington Post.\n\nOn Thursday, the Biden administration expressed its approval of the Ukrainian operation, stating that it aligns with the policy change announced in May, which permits Ukrainian commanders to target Russian forces inside Russia if they are preparing to attack Ukraine. \"As they see attacks coming across the border, they have to be able to have the capabilities to respond,\" Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said during a press briefing.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

They disarmed and captured a sizeable Russian unit at the border crossing, probably of FSB border guards, then quickly captured territory several kilometers in depth against light resistance, and had reconnaissance units fan out several more, so that Ukrainian presence was observed in over ten Russian settlements on just the first day of the invasion, and ultimately rising to twenty. By best estimates after three days 350 km2 of Russia lies under Ukrainian army control.\n\nIt is very clear that the Russian side was taken by surprise. Probably, as often happens, the Ukrainian build-up was to some extent observed and reported up the chain, but since it was deduced by the brass that a Ukrainian offensive here \"wouldn't make sense\" nothing was done. Reserves were not allocated and brought in in advance, and at least some units were not tactically and psychologically ready to face a large incursion (rather than special forces raids of 5-8 men which are common on both sides).\n\nNonetheless, it should be noted that the advent of the small drone era has changed how Ukrainians and Russians conceive of defense, especially in inactive theaters. Rather than presenting a heavily manned line of contact that would present numerous targets for drones and drone-guided artillery, the advanced positions are lightly manned, with the main fortification line running some 10 kilometers behind them. (This was the Russian approach in 2023, and the Ukrainian approach in Vochansk earlier this year.) Thus some degree of Ukrainian penetration was always to be expected, even if the Russians had prepared perfectly.\n\nThat said, nothing should be taken away from the Ukrainian preparations which were meticulous and skillful. Communication towers in the area had been hit one by one in the weeks preceding, and a heavy concentration of air defenses, electronic warfare systems, and drones were assembled in support.\n\nMoreover where the Russians in the May 2024 Kharkov offensive \"solved\" the problem of how to conduct rapid offense in the drone age, by falling back on infantry marches on foot through forests and swamps using infiltration tactics, the Ukrainians in Kursk have been able to showcase a combined-arms operation with a strong tank and mechanized component.\n\nIt should also be pointed out that the Ukrainian incursion takes place a wider context of Ukrainian manpower disadvantage and setbacks in Donetsk. Outnumbered, the Ukrainians have been steadily falling back in a number of important sectors in the south, especially on the Avdiivka-Pokrovsk axis, allowing Russian gains of up to 10 km2 per day, albeit in return for well over 100 dead on each side daily.\n\nIt is for this reason that as the news of the Ukrainian foray into Kursk hit, many Ukrainian commentators were initially critical and confused. With the Ukrainian forces in the south already on the back foot due to a manpower shortage, what sense did it make to divert some of the last reserves to open a new front? Especially since Russia does not use conscripts serving out their mandatory, universal national service in Ukraine, but it does use them on Russian borders. So in theory the Russians could fight this new Ukrainian offensive with just Rosgvardia, FSB border troops, and especially conscripts, without even having to divert any of the enlisted units from Ukraine.\n\nBut regardless of these risks, the operation presents several big upsides for Ukraine:\n\n1. Moscow has been often repeating that Russia is open to peace but that any peace will have to be \"based on realities as they exist on the ground\". But with Ukraine in control of 300 square kilometers of Russia, it makes Putin's insistence on the \"facts on the ground\" formula quite comical.\n\n2. In May Putin ordered an offensive to carve out what he deemed a \"sanitary zone\" on the Russian-Ukrainian border opposite the Russian city of Belgorod. Not only did that effort flounder within days, but humiliatingly for Putin, Zelensky has now matched Russian gains in Kharkov, with Ukrainian gains in Kursk, while playing a weaker hand.\n\n3. In theory Russia can attempt to contain and roll back the Ukrainian offensive with conscript units, without transferring over units made up of enlisted men from Ukraine and weakening its offensive there, but these units are untested. And while all else being equal, 19-year old conscripts make for more dynamic troops than the 40-year-olds who make up the enlisted volunteer units, the all-conscript units on the border lack combat experience, equipment, and most of all leadership, with the bulk of best officers deployed to Ukraine. Thus it is not immediately clear that conscripts will be up to the task. Until they prove their mettle relying on them presents a risk for the Russian side, and forces a serious strategic dilemma on the Russian leadership.\n\nKeep in mind that in the pre-war 2022 Russian army all-conscript units did not exist at all and were not foreseen. Conscripts were supposed to fill up positions in mixed units which would have placed them alongside numerous experienced professional soldiers (\"kontraktniki\"), and with an emphasis on filling supporting roles (loaders, drivers...).\n\n4. The question of whether to pursue a defense and counter-offensive with conscripts also presents a serious political dilemma that has been foisted on Putin. Legally there are no obstacles to doing so. However ever since Moscow declared its annexation of four Ukrainian provinces in the south in September 2022, there have also been no legal obstacles to using conscripts serving out their mandatory national service in Ukraine, and yet this has never been done. Is Putin willing to send 19-year-olds into heavy combat and will he pay a political price on the home front if he does so? We don't know, but we know that so far he has gone to great lengths to avoid doing so. (Where Ukrainians are concerned men under 25 are exempt from mobilization wholesale and serve only if they volunteer.)\n\nAn additional political challenge for Putin lies in the fact that even should Russia recapture the lost settlements these are likely going to be leveled in the process with artillery and glide bombs.\n\n5. There are many episodes of this war that Ukraine can and will remember with fondness. Episodes that served to lift its spirit, link its people in a shared experience, and even help to complete its national formation. Highlights such as the sinking of the Moskva cruiser, the lightning Kupyansk-Liman offensive of September 2022, the forcing of the Russian evacuation of Snake Island and of Kherson, and several others. However, overwhelmingly these feel-good moments happened in the first year of the war, and have been wholly absent in 2024. A nation at war does not live by bread alone -- and the Ukrainian drive into Kursk province will at least for a short time remind Ukrainians of 2022 victories and link them in hope, anticipation, and pride. This is important and invaluable. Especially in a context where all other news is of a bleak meatgrinder and very small but unending retreats.\n\nIt remains to be seen if this strike will prove a good use of war potential for Ukraine in a purely material sense (and the answer is more likely to be no than yes), but in the non-material dimension of war it is likely to be a resounding and much needed success for Ukraine, even if it is eventually forced to retreat. (The caveat being that the big danger for the Ukrainians is if they try to hold onto for too long once they become enveloped as they did in Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Krynky, as commanded by Zelensky out of non-military calculations.)\n\nAll this said, the glacial, but relentless Russian advance in the south continues, especially in the Pokrovsk direction, chipping away 5-10 km2 every day. It is this main theater of the war that will have a greater influence on its outcome than any secondary actions in the north.\n\nOne interpretation of Ukrainian gains so far. The road to west in purple has been mined by Ukraine:\n\nThe Ukrainian push renders the railway line running through Sudzha unusable, cutting down the number of available railway lines from Kursk to Belgorod from two to one, slightly complicating Russian logistics:", "source": {"uri": "therussophile.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheRussophiles"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Kyiv's forces launched its cross-border armored assault on Tuesday, swiftly seizing a large number of settlements and capturing scores of Russian personnel.\n\nUkraine has so far gained control of at least 166 square miles of Russian territory -- equivalent to the size of New Orleans -- investigative Russian outlet Agentstvo reported on Thursday. Newsweek could not independently verify this.\n\nThe Russian military column is reported to have been attacked in the village of Oktyabrskoye, located about 5 miles from Rylsk. Some reports have suggested that Ukraine intends to take control of Rylsk, located west of Kurchatov, where the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant is located.\n\nSeveral Russian Telegram channels said Ukraine's military used HIMARS in the attack. \"A column of Russian equipment was destroyed by a HIMARS strike in the Kursk region,' the Truexa News channel said.\n\nVideos showed the charred remains of what appears to be Russian vehicles on the side of a road.\n\nNewsweek couldn't independently verify the use of HIMARS in Kursk, and has contacted Russia's Defense Ministry for comment by email.\n\nThe U.S.-supplied HIMARS have allowed Ukraine to destroy Russia's most-advanced anti-aircraft missile systems in the war.\n\nOn Thursday, the Biden administration said that Ukraine was allowed to use U.S.-supplied weapons as part of its incursion into Kursk.\n\nThe armored assault into Kursk is \"consistent with our policy,\" U.S. Defense Department Deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters.\n\n\"We have supported Ukraine from the very beginning to defend themselves against attacks that are coming across the border and for the need for crossfires,\" said Singh. \"So they are taking actions to protect themselves from attacks that are coming from a region that are within the U.S. policy of where they can operate, you know, our weapons, our systems, our capabilities.\"\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a U.S.-based think tank, said in its latest analysis of the conflict in Ukraine on Thursday that the Kremlin will \"almost certainly endeavor to retake Russian territory in Kursk Oblast that Ukrainian forces have seized and stop Ukrainian activity further into Russia.\"\n\nThis is because \"substantial Ukrainian advances within Russia would be a strategic blow to Russian President Vladimir Putin's decades-long effort to cement a legacy of Russian stability, security, and geopolitical resurgence,\" the ISW said.\n\nAccording to Agentstvo, in roughly 24 hours, Ukraine's forces overwhelmed two major lines of fortifications in the Kursk region that took Russia over two-and-a-half years and more than $170 million to build.\n\nThe defense lines were jointly built by Russia's Defense Ministry and Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) after Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022.", "source":

And it will happen.\"\n\nRussian officials denounced the raid as a \"terrorist attack by Ukrainian militants ... carried out with weapons supplied by the West.\" Yet Western officials brushed off the protest as hypocritical -- \"A little bit rich,\" as State Department spokesman Matthew Miller put it Wednesday -- while Ukrainian officials and their advocates within the NATO alliance hailed the dramatic operation as a precedent that should weaken Western resistance to Ukraine's requests for permission to use advanced long-range missiles to strike Russian targets inside Russia.\n\n\"Will the events in this or that Russian border region have a psychological impact on (Russian) society? They will, without a doubt,\" Mikhail Podolyak, one of Zelensky's senior advisers, said Thursday, according to a Kyiv Independent translation. \"Our partners finally realize that everything connected to Ukraine's military actions is our sovereign right and a step toward de-escalation and the final end of the war.\"\n\nThe emotional impact of the dramatic attack received implicit acknowledgment in a public encounter between Russian President Vladimir Putin and acting Kursk Gov. Alexei Smirnov.\n\n\"Life is posing unexpected and complicated tasks for you to render assistance to the people in distress,\" Putin told Smirnov. \"Today's situation also requires courage and composure in solving these complex, difficult, extraordinary tasks that are now facing all branches and all levels of authority, including the governor and your team.\"\n\nThe details and objectives of the operation remain unclear, not least because Ukrainian leaders have instructed government sources not to comment on the attack. It is not only the Russians on whom the Ukrainian operation could have a psychological impact, as Western anxiety about the risk of a Russian nuclear attack has spurred the United States and key European governments to place significant restrictions on the aid they provide to Ukrainian forces.\n\n\"It takes the counterarguments off the table or eliminates the counterarguments -- quite efficiently, actually, to show that, 'Hey, see, we did it. Well, life goes on,'\" a senior European official told the Washington Examiner. \"If someone really doesn't want to give something, now, they need to invent new counterarguments.\"\n\nPutin's associates likewise have argued that the Kursk attack should lead Moscow to \"remove all taboos\" in the discussion of their war aims.\n\n\"From this moment on, the special military operation must become explicitly extraterritorial,\" Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev, a former prime minister under Putin, wrote on social media, per a state media translation. \"This is no longer an operation to regain our lands and punish Nazis. We can and should move deeper into the yet existing Ukraine, towards Odessa, Kharkov, Dnepropetrovsk, Nikolayev. Towards Kiev and beyond.\"\n\nThe foray into Kursk is the first time that Ukrainian regular forces have conducted an overt attack into Russia's sovereign territory. \"We cannot win the war if we remain constrained by fighting in our territory,\" a Ukrainian government source told the Washington Examiner this week. \"You need to wage the war in the territory of the aggressor. Otherwise, you cannot win.\"\n\nLast year, President Joe Biden's administration responded to raids reportedly conducted by units of pro-Ukrainian Russian volunteers by saying that \"we do not support attacks inside Russia.\" The foray into Kursk, which began on Tuesday, drew a different response from the State Department.\n\n\"Nothing about our policy has changed, and with the actions that they are taking today, they're not in violation of our policy,\" State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Wednesday.\n\nBiden eased his restriction on the use of American weapons against military targets inside Russia in May to stop Russian forces from enjoying a safe haven on their side of the border during a sustained attack on a major Ukrainian city. European governments have been divided about such operations, with several of Ukraine's closest neighbors arguing for a removal of all restrictions, while Germany has refused to transfer long-range missiles to Ukraine, even if Ukrainian officials promise not to use them against targets in Russia.\n\nThe European Union, nonetheless, sent a supportive message Wednesday.\n\n\"The Euro continues to fully support Ukraine's legitimate right to defend itself from Russian aggression and its efforts to restore sovereignty and territorial integrity,\" European Commission spokesman Peter Stano said this week, noting that Ukraine \"has the legal right to defend itself, in particular by striking at the aggressor on its territory.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nZelensky, for his part, implied that the Kursk attack is a model for ending the war.\n\n\"It is important to continue destroying our enemy,\" he said Wednesday, without mentioning Kursk explicitly. \"And the more pressure is exerted on Russia, on the aggressor that brought the war to Ukraine, the closer peace will be. Just peace through just force.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joel_gehrke@washingtonexaminer.com", "name":

The administration claims it won't support \"long-range\" strikes into Russian territory, but it's not clear what the limit is.\n\n\"I'm not going to put a specific range on it,\" Singh said when pressed about the possibility of the US supporting an attack on Moscow. She added that the purpose of allowing Ukraine to use US weapons in Russia was for \"cross-fire\" purposes.\n\nAccording to the Russian Defense Ministry, Ukrainian forces have used US-provided Bradley Fighting Vehicles in the incursion into Kursk. The sanctioned use of US armored vehicles in a ground operation into Russian territory marks a significant escalation in the proxy war and risks a major Russian response.\n\nLast year, pro-Kyiv militias, including the neo-Nazi Russian Volunteer Corps, used US armored vehicles in raids into Russia's Belgorod Oblast. At the time, the US said it was opposed to its equipment being used for such an attack.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said Wednesday that 1,000 Ukrainian fighters with dozens of armored vehicles entered Kursk. The ministry said it thwarted any breakthrough, but heavy fighting continued on Thursday.\n\nUkrainian officials haven't directly acknowledged the assault, but President Volodymyr Zelensky said Thursday that Russia needed to \"feel\" the consequences of its war. \"Russia brought the war to our land and should feel what it has done,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "news.antiwar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News From Antiwar.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kursk"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kursk"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk_Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kursk Oblast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kursk Oblast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armoured_fighting_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Armoured fighting vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_(Russia)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defence (Russia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Armed Forces of Ukraine"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Volunteer_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian Volunteer Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_Fighting_Vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bradley Fighting Vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Proxy war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgorod_Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belgorod Oblast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belgorod Oblast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://news.antiwar.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/awc_logo_for-circle-profile_600sq-01.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799944", "eventUri": "eng-9799944", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4588235294117647, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

President Vladimir Putin described the move as \"a large-scale provocation,\" and convened his security council to address the problem. In three days, Ukraine has occupied 11 villages or settlements and 17 square miles of land, taken at least 40 prisoners of war, leaving five dead and 31 wounded, according to data from the Russian Defense Ministry. In response, Russia declared a state of emergency in the region and, according to the Kremlin, ordered the evacuation of \"several thousand people.\"\n\nThree days after the opening of this breach in the Ukrainian-Russian border, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy posted a message that suggested that Ukraine was responsible for the operation: \"Russia brought the war to our land, and it should feel what it has done. We strive to achieve our goals as soon as possible in peacetime - under just peace conditions. And it will happen.\"\n\nMykhailo Podolyak, the advisor to the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, shared a similar message on X. \"The root cause of any escalation, shelling, military actions, forced evacuations, and destruction of normal life forms, including within Rf's own territories like Kursk and Belgorod regions, is solely Russia's unequivocal aggression,\" he wrote.\n\nIn a later television appearance, Podolyak added: \"It is the army's business to say what is going on there. As of today, we have a war that is gradually advancing into the interior of the Russian Federation. Will it scare them? Yes. Will they react with anything other than fear? No.\"\n\nThe military operation initially raised questions about whether it was really the Ukrainian army -- and not the paramilitary groups of Kremlin opponents, who have carried out such actions in border areas during the war -- that was staging the largest incursion into Russian territory since the invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022. There were also doubts about the intended goal of the operation, and why it had been launched now.\n\nAnalysts and military experts who spoke to EL PA\u00cdS trust in the information provided by the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a reputable U.S. think tank, which on Thursday confirmed the Ukrainian movements in its daily report, based on geolocated images and internal Russian sources.\n\nRenowned military analyst Mikhail Samus argues that Ukraine's goal is to pressure Russian commanders so that they have to decide where to send their military assets, since many of them are in the Donbas region, partially controlled since 2014 by Moscow through pro-Russian separatists. \"Putin has been trying to occupy Donetsk and Lugansk for 10 years; he wants to finish it before the U.S. elections in November, and he is going to invest all possible resources to achieve it,\" says Samus.\n\nIndeed, this summer Russian troops have stepped on its efforts in Donetsk province, with important strategic victories in several directions thanks to the mass shipment of infantry, ammunition and weapons. These movements are taking place amid certain urgency, since former U.S. president Donald Trump has warned that if he wins the November 4 election, he intends to end the war in Ukraine. And Putin wants to have control of Donetsk coming in to possible negotiations.\n\nWith the operation in Kursk, Ukraine has put the Russian army in a dilemma, says Samus. \"They can stop the offensive in Donbas to defend Kursk or they can allocate fewer resources and risk losing some territory.\"\n\nZelenskiy is also under pressure, as resisting Russia -- and the money and weapons needed to do so -- depends greatly on who wins the U.S. election, since Trump is against the U.S. continuing to finance the war.\n\nIt is therefore in Kyiv's interest to gain ground in the face of future peace negotiations. According to Oleksiy Melnyk from the Razumkov Centre in Kyiv: \"If Ukraine occupies a part of Russian territory, it can propose an exchange. It is very ambitious, but it is a clear political objective.\"\n\nMelnyk highlight the great strategic value of Kursk Oblast: the region has a functioning nuclear power plant, and is home to the town of Sudzha, the last operational distribution station for Russian natural gas headed for Europe via Ukraine. The Urengoy-Pomary-Uzhhorod pipeline will carry about 14.65 billion cubic meters of gas in 2023, roughly half of Russia's gas exports to Europe, according to Reuters.\n\nFor now, Ukraine's gas transmission operator has reported that fuel is moving normally to European consumers, but there is concern in the European market, with prices rising 4.5% on Wednesday, the highest level since December, according to Bloomberg. As for the nuclear power plant -- located just 37 miles from where the offensive is taking place -- the Russian National Guard reported that security around the facility has been reinforced.\n\nActions like the offensive Kursk are known in military jargon as asymmetric engagement, where a smaller force carries out effective operations against a larger enemy. Samus predicts that Ukraine will launch another: \"Ukrainian forces may start new operations in the direction of Crimea with the new air weapons they have obtained, because there Ukraine has information from NATO, as well as aviation, and can destroy Russian bases,\" he says.\n\nUkraine recently received the first F-16 fighters promised by its Western partners, as well as financial aid from the United States ($2.3 billion in air defense and anti-tank weapons) and the European Union, which announced at the end of July that it would transfer \u20ac1.5 billion ($1.64 billion) of proceeds from frozen Russian assets.\n\nAccording to Samus, Ukraine may consider destroying the land corridor linking Russia to the occupied Crimean Peninsula and blocking access and the entry of supplies. \"It doesn't have to be a large-scale ground operation, just blocking the corridor. This would have a big impact because it would send the message that Russia cannot control Ukraine, and Ukraine would be in a stronger position for future negotiations,\" he says.\n\nIn Ukraine, the authorities have been keeping quiet about the events of the past few days in Kursk. Zelenskiy did not mention them in his daily address to the nation, beyond encouraging soldiers to \"pressure and weaken the enemy side.\" The daily update from the Ukrainian General Staff on the situation at the front only stated that fighting has intensified in the Ukrainian region of Sumi, bordering Russia's Kursk, where 6,000 people have been ordered to evacuate. It added that the enemy was using planes, helicopters and artillery, but had not made any progress and had suffered \"significant losses.\"\n\nThe ISW backs Ukrainian military observer Konstantin Mashovets' claim that the Ukrainian Armed Forces have penetrated into Russian territory. According to Mahosvets, an unspecified unit of the Chechen-based 71st Motorized Rifle Regiment was deployed directly to the Russian Sudzhensky district. This information is \"generally consistent with some reports from Ukrainian and Russian sources that social media footage shows Chechen 'Akhmat' units in the Sudzha area since over a week ago,\" said the ISW report.\n\nThe United States says it had no advance notice of Kyiv's alleged cross-border plans. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday that Washington wanted to know more about \"objectives\" of the incursion, and that it supported Ukraine's \"common-sense\" actions to stop Russia's attacks. \"We're going to reach out to the Ukrainian military to learn more about their objectives,\" she said.\n\nAs for Russia, ISW said in its August 7 update that the Kremlin's response has so far been \"contradictory, as Russian officials are attempting to balance presenting the effort as a notable Ukrainian escalation with avoiding overstating its potential implications and risking domestic discontent.\" On Wednesday, several prominent pro-Russian bloggers even criticized the country's military leaders for failing to thwart the incursion.", "source": {"uri":

tanks being used to much effect.\n\n\"A lot of mechanized maneuver warfare on some level rests upon surprise on being able to rapidly advance and catch your enemy off guard,\" he said.\n\n\"By all

Residents from nearby villages have begun evacuation procedures as a precautionary measure.\n\nContext of Ongoing Military Operations\n\nThis airstrike is part of a broader offensive by Ukraine's military, which is actively engaged in operations within Russia's Kursk region. Reports indicate that Ukrainian forces have penetrated approximately 10 kilometers into Russian territory, marking the most substantial cross-border military maneuver since the initiation of the full-scale invasion by Russia in February 2022.\n\nRussian military sources have claimed that as many as 1,000 Ukrainian troops, equipped with tanks and armored vehicles, crossed into the Kursk area. They also assert that more than 300 of these troops have sustained injuries or death, although these figures remain unverified by independent sources.\n\nStatements from Ukrainian Leadership\n\nIn a recent video address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke generally about the need for Russia to feel the repercussions of its actions in Ukraine. He stated, \"Russia brought the war to our land and should feel what it has done.\" His remarks, while not directly addressing the recent incursion, underscored Ukraine's resolve in the ongoing conflict.\n\nZelensky added, \"Ukrainians know how to achieve their goals. And we did not choose to achieve our goals in the war,\" reflecting the determination of Ukraine in its military engagements.", "source": {"uri": "theglobalherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Global Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipetsk", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lipetsk"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lipetsk"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nagorno-Karabakh conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia\u2013Ukraine_border", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia\u2013Ukraine border"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Armed Forces of Ukraine"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State of emergency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk_Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kursk Oblast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kursk Oblast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kursk"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kursk"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukrainians"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Military", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Military", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Defense", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Military", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Military", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Military", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799944", "eventUri": "eng-9799944", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

Air defense is in operation. Do not approach the windows. Take cover in a safe place,\" the town's governor posted onto his Telegram channel.\n\nNo deaths have been reported by local media outlets but emergency services and air defences have been deployed. According to the governor, six people have been injured, but most explosive objects detonated in areas far away from civilian locations.\n\nKyiv has not officially taken responsibility for the operation, but Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address yesterday that Russia needed to \"feel\" the consequences of its invasion.\n\n\"Russia brought the war to our land and should feel what it has done,\" Zelensky said, without directly referring to the offensive.\n\nCitizens in Lipetsk have been urged by local government not to post any images or footage of the attack. According to authorities, a energy facility was targeted and damaged during the attack.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLipetsk city is about 330 kilometres from the Ukrainian border with Russia's Kursk region, where pro-Kyiv forces for days have been waging an offensive on Russian territory.\n\nUkraine has made significant territorial gains within its borders and along its eastern border with Russia in recent days, according to independent US-based Institute for the Study of War.\n\nGeolocated footage and claims by local governments in Russia, analysed by the research institute, found that Ukrainian forces are as far as 35 kilometers from the international border.\n\nIt cautioned, however, that Ukrainian forces \"most certainly do not control\" all of that territory and the Russian defence ministry yesterday said that its troops were continuing to fight and \"destroy\" armed Ukrainian units, with air strikes, to push them back.\n\nIt said it had rushed in reserves and was \"thwarting attempts to break through\" deeper into Kursk. Russian President Vladimir Putin has called the incursion a \"large-scale provocation\" by Kyiv, and Russia's top general vowed on Wednesday to crush it.\n\nThe US State Department has expressed support for Kyiv without directly commenting on the operation.\n\nYesterday, the Ukrainian President met with a cross-party delegation from the U.S. House of Representatives to discuss the ongoing defence of his country and how to push forward to peace.\n\n\"We are doing everything to achieve a just peace as soon as possible,\" he said. \"I am grateful for the support of everyone in America who values freedom and independence as much as we do in Ukraine.\"\n\n- With reporting by \u00a9 AFP 2023\n\nReaders like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

But Ukraine launched a shock incursion into Russia this week, appearing to catch it off guard. Analysts said Russia's response shows surprise is still possible, albeit difficult.\n\nUkraine's new incursion into Russia shows that surprise is still possible despite ubiquitous surveillance, analysts said.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War said in its update on Thursday that the \"lack of a coherent Russian response\" to Ukraine's advance into the southwestern Kursk region points to it catching Russia off guard.\n\nThat, and the significant progress Ukraine appears to have made in three days, \"indicates that Ukrainian forces were able to achieve operational surprise along the border with Russia,\" the update said.\n\nThe element of surprise has been a rare thing during Russia's invasion of Ukraine, it noted.\n\nAnalysts have long observed that the proliferation of drones across the battlefield makes it hard for either side to move unseen.\n\n\"Both Russian and Ukrainian forces have struggled to achieve operational surprise in the past year and a half of fighting due to the partially transparent battlefield in Ukraine,\" the ISW said.\n\nBut partial transparency still leaves room for a sneak attack.\n\nUkrainian forces advanced into Kursk on Tuesday, with an audacity that contrasts with its prior strikes on targets inside Russia.\n\nThose previous hits have relied on drones and missiles rather than ground forces.\n\nThe ISW said on Thursday that geolocated footage and accounts from inside Russia shows Ukraine was able to make \"rapid advances.\"\n\nIt pointed to some Russian military bloggers -- prominent sources of war updates in the absence of free Russian media -- who said Ukrainian troops advanced up to 21 miles into Russian territory.\n\nLittle verified information about the advance is available, and Ukraine has not officially acknowledged it. But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy alluded to it in his nightly address on Thursday, saying \"Russia brought the war to our land, and it should feel what it has done.\"\n\nRussia seemed unprepared for such an attack, with officials offering conflicting information.\n\nDrone dominance\n\nUkraine was able to catch Russia off guard despite being constantly watched.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has seen more extensive drone use than any prior conflict.\n\nThe extensive video surveillance of the battlefield has helped make the war a slow, grinding affair.\n\nBeing able to see the enemy preparing means neither side has made extensive use of surprise attacks that could make big gains.\n\nInstead, fighting has been attritional, with each side trying to grind each other down with artillery strikes and ground advances.\n\nRiley Bailey, a Russia analyst at the ISW, told Business Insider earlier this year that Ukraine's flat landscape and the proliferation of drones were stopping heavy weaponry like tanks being used to much effect.\n\n\"A lot of mechanized maneuver warfare on some level rests upon surprise on being able to rapidly advance and catch your enemy off guard,\" he said.\n\n\"By all indications, along the current front line, that's not really possible.\"\n\nExpensive Russian surveillance drones are also allowing Russia to monitor and attack any build-up of Ukrainian troops and equipment.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider Nederland"}, "authors":

assault on the Russian border region of Kursk entered a third day, residents in the capital Kyiv praised the offensive as \"bringing victory closer\".\n\nThe cross-border incursion appears to be Ukraine's most serious since Russia's invasion began in February 2022, and may involve up to 1,000 troops, according to Moscow's estimates.\n\n\"To be honest, I feel proud of our guys and happy,\" said Tetiana Krapyvka, a financier in the Ukrainian capital.\n\n\"I believe that it was a prepared operation and maybe personnel reserves were used, but it was prepared well,\" she added.\n\nUkraine has not officially taken responsibility for the operation, which began on Tuesday morning, but officials have blamed Moscow for inciting the attack.\n\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said that \"Russia brought the war to our land and should feel what it has done\".\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has called it a \"large-scale provocation\" by Kyiv and Russia's top general vowed on Wednesday to crush the incursion.\n\n\"With these actions, Ukraine is strengthening its defence capabilities and its ability to defend itself,\" said Anastasia Volkova, a cultural manager in the Ukrainian capital\n\n\"This is a success of our military, including in the most difficult areas of the front line.\"\n\nThe independent US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said Ukraine had made significant territorial gains in the first two days of the incursion.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry said its troops were \"continuing to destroy\" armed Ukrainian units and were using air strikes, rocket and artillery fire to try to push them back.\n\n- Show them 'what war is' -\n\nMany residents praised the attack as payback for Russia's invasion, now in its third year.\n\nA local resident in Kyiv, Rita Simon, told AFP that the Kursk region operation was \"necessary\" to show Russia the consequences of war.\n\n\"They came to our land, and now let them feel what our mothers, our boys who are fighting now, feel,\" she said.\n\n\"Let them feel what it's like to live and lose their children, and let their children feel what we feel.\"\n\nVolodymyr Borodyansky, a worker in the tourism sector, had the same sentiment.\n\n\"Let those in Moscow also know what war is,\" he said.\n\nAnother resident, 27-year-old Volodymyr Pyatov, said the operation would give Ukraine the upper hand in the war.\n\n\"It seems to me that the military leadership knows better what is best for bringing victory closer,\" he said.\n\n\"I hope that this will somehow help to withdraw enemy forces from other fronts and make it easier for the Ukrainian military on the eastern and southern fronts,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "kyivpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KyivPost"}, "authors":

Russia's War On Ukraine: News And Information From Ukraine", "body": "In a surprise and daring counteroffensive, Ukrainian forces have crossed into western Russia and captured some 350 square km of enemy territory, several Russian Telegram channels reported. The incursion, which began Aug. 6, saw some one thousand, reportedly, Ukrainian troops cross the border into the Russian oblast, or region, of Kursk, where they have captured as many as ten Russian settlements and are reportedly shelling the town of Sudzha, a strategic transit point for natural gas from Russia into Europe. Kursk nuclear power station also stands nearby. The offensive is seen as an attempt by Kyiv to make Moscow divert its forces from frontline hotspots, especially in the Donetsk region, as well as to bring the fight home to the aggressor state. \"Russia brought the war to our land, and it should feel what it has done,\" said Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskyy in his evening address on Aug. 8, without directly addressing the fighting in Kursk.\n\nRussia launched some 30 attack drones at Ukrainian cities overnight into Aug. 7, Ukraine's air force command reported. Air defenses shot them all down, air force chief Mykola Oleshchuk confirmed. The Iranian-made Shahed drones were intercepted over several regions of the country, he continued, from central Kyiv and Cherkasy oblasts, to Mykolaiv and Kherson regions in the South.\n\nTwo people were killed in Russian artillery shelling of the industrial city of Kostiantynivka in eastern Ukraine, regional governor Vadym Filashkin said on Aug. 8. Located in the frontline region of Donetsk, the city is under frequent attack by Moscow. This time, morning shelling hit a one-story private house, claiming the lives of two of its residents. A few hours later, the Russian army dropped a glide bomb on the town of Selydove, also in Donetsk oblast, killing two and injuring seven civilians. Several multi-story buildings and an administration facility were reported damaged. \"Stay safe and evacuate,\" Filashkin urged.\n\nDowntown Kharkiv, in Ukraine's Northeast, was hit by a Russian ballistic missile on Aug. 6, killing one person and injuring at least twelve others, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said. According to authorities, the Russians targeted the densely populated, residential Shevchenkivskyi district of the country's second-largest city with an Iksander hypersonic missile, damaging apartment buildings and a medical center. An infant was among the injured. Footage from the scene shows debris and glass scattered all around the medical center, and civilian cars destroyed by the blast.\n\nUkrainian troops deployed more combat drones than Russian forces during July clashes on the frontlines, President Zelenskyy announced on Aug. 6 following a regular session with military command. \"This should be a steady trend at the front. Drones are influencing the war in Ukraine's favor,\" he said. Kyiv has contracted one million drones from domestic producers for this year to boost the country's military self-sufficiency. Just recently, Ukrainian firm Ukroboronprom was listed 49th in the 2024 ranking of \"Top 100 Defense Companies\" compiled by respected industry journal \"Defense News.\" The Ukrainian company was singled out as a leader in revenue growth: in 2023 alone, its revenue exceeded $2.2 billion, a result 72% higher than in 2022.\n\nUkraine will be receiving approximately 4.2 billion euros ($4.6 billion) in funding from the European Union, the Council of the EU announced on Aug. 6. The EU agreed to disburse this first tranche of funding under its 50-billion-euro ($55 billion) Ukraine Facility after Kyiv met institutional reform goals set up in the Ukraine Plan, a comprehensive roadmap towards governance, economic and judicial transformation. The funds will support Ukraine's macro financial stability and the functioning of its public services. The Ukraine Facility provides for up to $55 billion in financing to Ukraine, in the form of grants and loans, to bolster its post-war recovery, reconstruction, and modernization for the period 2024 to 2027. \"Together we are rebuilding and strengthening Ukraine!\" Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said in response to the news.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"},

Officials said about 3,000 people were evacuated from the area, which is under a local state of emergency. Russia's Ministry of Defence said its troops were \"continuing to destroy\" armed Ukrainian units and were using air strikes, rockets and artillery fire to try to push them back. It said it had rushed in reserves and was \"thwarting attempts to break through\" deeper into the Kursk region. Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said Russia's \"unequivocal aggression\" was the reason for any \"escalation, shelling, military actions, forced evacuations, and destruction of normal life forms, including within [Russia's] own territories like Kursk and Belgorod regions\". \"Russia brought the war to our land and should feel what it has done,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his evening address to the nation, without referring directly to the offensive. He also praised the Ukrainian army for its ability \"to surprise\" and achieve results, but again did not explicitly reference the situation in Kursk. A young man and his six-year-old brother were killed when a Russian guided bomb hit a schoolyard in the village of Mohrytsia in Ukraine's Sumy region, just across the border from Kursk, Volodymyr Artiukh, head of the Sumy region's military administration, told national TV. \"Sumy region has never known such a large number per day,\" he said of the 56 guided bombs dropped over the previous 24 hours. At least four people were killed and 11 injured in Russian attacks on Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region, according to local governor Vadym Filashkin. Two people were killed when a residential district of Kostiantynivka, west of Bakhmut, was hit by shelling. Two more were killed and 11 injured in an attack on Selydove, a town to the southwest. The attack also damaged multiple apartment blocks and administrative buildings. A 12-year-old boy was injured and two homes damaged in Russian attacks on the central Dnipropetrovsk region, Governor Serhiy Lysak said. One man was killed and another injured in Ukrainian shelling of Shebekino in Russia's Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, the regional governor, wrote on his Telegram channel.\n\nPolitics and diplomacy\n\nAndriy Yermak, Zelenskyy's chief of staff, said that while Moscow might attend the next Kyiv-led peace summit, it should not be treated as the start of negotiations with Russia. Ukraine's Foreign Ministry said Niger's decision to follow Mali and cut ties with Kyiv was \"regrettable\". A court in southern Russia sentenced Ukrainian Tetiana Klyuchko to 12 years in a penal colony after she was found guilty of participating in a \"terrorist\" group and attempting to commit an \"act of terror\" in a part of Ukraine's Zaporizhia region occupied by Russia. A Moscow-controlled court in Ukraine's eastern Luhansk region, which is almost entirely occupied by Russia, jailed Ukrainian Yuriy Galetsky for 13 years after finding him guilty of espionage for sharing information on troop movements.\n\nWeapons\n\nUkraine gave a demonstration of a new robot dog \"BAD One\" that it might soon use for more dangerous missions on the front line.", "source":

According to Russian officials and analysts, the Ukrainian forces breached Russian border defenses, seizing several settlements as fighting continued on Thursday, reported NYT.\n\nThe attack prompted a state of emergency in one western Russian region, with Ukrainian armored columns moving up to 6 miles inside Russia.Videos show American-made armored vehicles being destroyed in Russian counterattacks.\n\nA senior Ukrainian official, quoted by NYT, indicated that the assault aimed to shift the conflict onto Russian soil and relieve pressure on Ukrainian forces in the east. \"We are at war,\" he said. \"Why can Russia attack and we cannot?\"\n\nThis move, reportedly involving around 1,000 Ukrainian soldiers, was described as a response to previous setbacks and an effort to stretch Russian resources. \"We want to challenge the Russians, divert their forces, and show that they have no reserves,\" said Andriy Zagorodnyuk, a former Ukrainian defense minister.\n\nUS State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller confirmed that the use of American weapons in the attack does not breach US policy. Meanwhile, analysts like Konrad Muzyka suggest that the attack could benefit Ukraine if it reduces Russian offensives in the Donetsk region and enhances its negotiating position, reported NYT.\n\nIn a televised address, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy indirectly referred to the assault, emphasizing the need to increase pressure on Russia. \"The more pressure is exerted on Russia -- the aggressor that brought war to Ukraine -- the closer peace will be,\" he said.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Kursk Enters 3rd Day; Locals Evacuated, Russia Says", "body": "Residents have been evacuated from parts of Russia's western Kursk region amid an ongoing Ukrainian cross-border assault that entered its third day on Aug. 8.\n\nAccording to Belostotsky, some 3,000 residents were evacuated from areas near the border, half of whom are now in temporary shelters.\n\nIn the early hours of Aug. 6, hundreds of Ukrainian troops -- backed by tanks and armored vehicles -- entered Russia's western Kursk region, said Russia's defense ministry.\n\nRoughly 18,500 square miles in size, the region shares an approximately 150-mile-long border with northeastern Ukraine.\n\nOn Aug. 7, Russia's defense ministry said its forces had stopped a Ukrainian bid to seize the border town of Sudzha, a key transit hub for Russian natural gas.\n\nIn a statement, the ministry said that combined Russian forces were \"destroying Ukrainian armed formations in the Sudzha and Korenevo districts ... directly adjacent to the Russia-Ukraine border.\"\n\n\"Active operations\" involving airstrikes, missile attacks, and artillery fire \"have prevented the enemy's advance,\" the ministry added.\n\nNevertheless, Russia's National Guard has since stepped up security at Kursk's nuclear power plant, which sits roughly 35 miles northeast of Sudzha.\n\nOn the evening of Aug. 7, Alexey Smirnov, Kursk's acting governor, declared a region-wide state of emergency in the face of continued \"infiltration\" by \"enemy forces.\"\n\nThe following day, Russia's defense ministry claimed that Ukraine had lost 660 troops, along with 82 armored vehicles, since the raid first began.\n\nThe ministry, however, went on to concede that Ukrainian forces were still in the region.\n\n\"The operation to destroy Ukrainian armed formations continues,\" it said in a statement.\n\nThe Epoch Times could not independently verify the ministry's assertions.\n\nKyiv, for its part, has largely refrained from commenting on the cross-border assault.\n\nBut on Aug. 8, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy -- in an oblique reference to the ongoing raid -- praised the Ukrainian military's ability \"to surprise.\"\n\n\"This is demonstrated by the battlefield, where our soldiers not only withstood the overwhelming force of the occupiers but are also destroying it in the way necessary to protect Ukraine,\" Zelenskyy added.\n\nIt isn't the first time that Kyiv has invaded Russian territory.\n\nIn 2023, Russian forces repelled several large-scale assaults -- into both Kursk and neighboring Belgorod -- by what Moscow described as \"Ukrainian saboteurs.\"\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has described the latest cross-border assault as \"another large-scale provocation\" by Kyiv.\n\nWhen asked about the Ukrainian military's reported use of U.S.-supplied weapons in Kursk, Miller said: \"Nothing about our policy has changed.\"\n\n\"With the actions that they [the Ukrainians] are taking today, they're not in violation of our policy,\" the spokesman added.\n\nIn June, the Pentagon permitted Kyiv to use U.S.-supplied weapons in response to limited cross-border attacks from inside Russia.\n\nKyiv, however, remains prohibited from using U.S.-supplied long-range munitions to strike targets deep inside Russian territory.\n\n\"Nothing with respect to the policy that we announced several months ago ... allowing equipment that we provide to be used in strikes across the border ... nothing about that policy has changed,\" Miller said on Aug. 7.\n\n\"We are going to continue to stay focused on making sure they have what they need to defend themselves against Russia's aggression,\" she added.\n\nWhen asked if the United States had been told in advance about Kyiv's intention to stage a cross-border assault, Jean-Pierre replied with one word: \"No.\"", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Russian officials are scrambling for a response: all the troops are busy invading Ukraine. Meanwhile, critics are asking what is the point of this surprise counter-incursion if Ukraine is in dire straits in Donbas, where its troops have been slowly retreating under grinding Russian gains. Military analyst Tatarigami weighs the pros and cons of Ukraine's daring assault.\n\nTo say that this incursion into the Kursk Oblast caught many, including the Russian command, by surprise is an understatement. We can confidently assert that the operational planning was executed skillfully, as the enemy not only failed to assemble a properly sized rapid response force but also misread the intent of the Ukrainian maneuver despite having extensive ISR capabilities over the frontlines and even deep into Ukrainian territory.\n\nThis bold incursion into Kursk Oblast highlights the inconsistency of concerns over escalation. Ukraine has been repeatedly prohibited from using ATACMS and similar systems deep within Russian territory due to fears of escalation. Yet now, with Russia's territorial integrity under direct threat, we do not see nuclear missiles flying toward Berlin, Brussels, Washington, or any other Western city.\n\nThe operation also underscores Russia's continued inability to swiftly respond to battlefield developments -- a weakness evident during the Kharkiv counter-offensive in 2022, when Russia struggled to respond coherently to emerging challenges. This failure is unsurprising, as it stems from the over-centralization of control and the concentration of decision-making power in a few nodes, making any quick response nearly impossible.\n\nWithout a doubt, this incursion has sparked hope and optimism, not only within Ukraine but also in the West, which had begun to accept the idea of Ukraine slowly losing territory and war altogether.\n\nIt remains an indisputable fact that the capture of a significant number of prisoners of war, some of whom appear to be conscripted soldiers, is a major humanitarian victory for Ukraine. Countless Ukrainian families have been waiting for their loved ones to return from captivity since 2022.\n\nIn this context, conscript soldiers hold particular value, as Russian society is generally more sensitive to the plight of conscripts than to that of contract soldiers. This sensitivity is underscored by Putin's promise in the spring of 2022 to address the issue of conscripts being used in combat situations.\n\nThat being said, amid the optimism and positivity, it's important to remain critical and assess the situation soberly. As the summer 2023 offensive demonstrated, euphoria can quickly turn into a hangover.\n\nWhile Ukrainian forces are encountering seemingly weak resistance as they advance, their logistical lines are inevitably lengthening. To address this, Ukraine will need to widen the incursion, which could slow the pace of its advance due to limited resources and available brigades.\n\nOverextension poses risks beyond logistics - it also complicates the ability to provide adequate air defense coverage for advancing troops.\n\nAs Russia eventually assembles a large enough force to counter Ukrainian advances, the Ukrainian command will face a tough dilemma: to halt and dig in or to retreat back to Ukraine.\n\nIn the first scenario, it's unclear how extended frontlines and unprepared positions with stretched logistics would be more favorable than the more established positions in Donbas. If Ukrainian troops choose to withdraw, it raises the question of whether the operation was worth the effort, especially given the need to redeploy elements from several brigades in Donbas for this incursion.\n\nMeanwhile, in Donbas, Russian forces continue to advance toward Pokrovsk and have made progress in the Toretsk area over the past week.\n\nAs Ukrainian forces slowly retreat in the Pokrovsk direction, there are no stabilization reserves currently available on site.\n\nSo far, there is no evidence that Russia is moving its main units from Donetsk Oblast to Kursk, casting doubt on the theory that this incursion could relieve pressure on Donetsk. That being said, it may be too early to draw conclusions, as such movements could occur in the future.\n\nHowever, as of today, there is no public information or indication that Russia has shifted its main forces or decreased pressure in the Pokrovsk direction.", "source": {"uri": "euromaidanpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Euromaidan Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk_Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kursk Oblast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kursk Oblast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donbas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donbas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia\u2013Ukraine_border", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia\u2013Ukraine border"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner_of_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prisoner of war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokrovsk,_Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pokrovsk, Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pokrovsk, Ukraine"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kursk"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kursk"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-aircraft warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brigade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Armed Forces of Ukraine"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donetsk", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donetsk"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Donetsk"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donetsk_Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donetsk Oblast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Donetsk Oblast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toretsk", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toretsk"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://euromaidanpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-08-06-13.13.30.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799944", "eventUri": "eng-9799944", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 3, "textEnd": 11}], "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

And we did not choose to achieve our goals in the war,\" Zelensky added.\n\n\"We want to achieve our goals as soon as possible in peace time -- in a just peace. And it will happen.\"\n\nZelensky has called for Russia to be present at a second peace summit on ending the war in Ukraine.\n\nSome have suggested the incursion could be aimed at holding territory and improving Ukraine\u00b4s negotiating position in any future talks.As Ukraine\u00b4s major assault on the Russian border region of Kursk entered a third day, residents in the capital Kyiv praised the offensive as \"bringing victory closer\".\n\nThe cross-border incursion appears to be Ukraine\u00b4s most serious since Russia\u00b4s invasion began in February 2022, and may involve up to 1,000 troops, according to Moscow\u00b4s estimates.\n\n\"To be honest, I feel proud of our guys and happy,\" said Tetiana Krapyvka, a financier in the Ukrainian capital.\n\n\"I believe that it was a prepared operation and maybe personnel reserves were used, but it was prepared well,\" she added.\n\nUkraine has not officially taken responsibility for the operation, which began on Tuesday morning, but officials have blamed Moscow for inciting the attack.\n\nThe independent US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said Ukraine had made significant territorial gains in the first two days of the incursion.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry said its troops were \"continuing to destroy\" armed Ukrainian units and were using air strikes, rocket and artillery fire to try to push them back.Many residents praised the attack as payback for Russia\u00b4s invasion, now in its third year.A local resident in Kyiv, Rita Simon, told AFP that the Kursk region operation was \"necessary\" to show Russia the consequences of war.\n\n\"They came to our land, and now let them feel what our mothers, our boys who are fighting now, feel,\" she said.\n\n\"Let them feel what it\u00b4s like to live and lose their children, and let their children feel what we feel.\"\n\nVolodymyr Borodyansky, a worker in the tourism sector, had the same sentiment.", "source": {"uri": "thenews.com.pk", "dataType":

Russia's statistics body said that, as of 2022, the average monthly salary before tax was just over 71,000 rubles, or about $800.\n\nAs of last fall, almost half of Russians said their monthly pay was not covering basics; and under a feverish wartime economy, the country's annual inflation rate hovers above 9%.\n\nDespite earlier assurances from Smirnov that the situation was under control, reports from pro-Kremlin military bloggers suggest that some people experienced disorderly evacuations, the Institute for the Study of War said.\n\nOne civilian in Sudzha, a town considered to be a focus of the Ukrainian attack, told the independent Russian outlet Meduza that she fled before any evacuation was organized.\n\n\"Judging by the news reports, our town no longer exists,\" she said.\n\nImages shared by Russian authorities purporting to be from the region show destroyed houses.\n\nStrict instructions were given to state-controlled media to tamp down reporting on the attack, Meduza reported, citing industry insiders.\n\nKursk's acting governor, Alexey Smirnov, posted images of damaged homes, purportedly from the region Ukraine is attacking.

Western nations, including the U.S., were awed at Ukraine's battalions' rapid advances and the stealth and deception that were integral to the counter-invasion's success.\n\n\"Geolocated footage and Russian claims indicate that Ukrainian forces continued rapid advances further into Kursk Oblast on August 8, and Ukrainian forces are reportedly present in areas as far as 35 kilometers (21 miles) from the international border with Sumy Oblast,\" the Institute for the Study of War assessed in its latest update on the war. They also noted that it's harder to know exactly how much territory is actually under the control of Ukrainian forces now that they are operating within the border of Russia.\n\nSocial media is full of postings from Kursk, showing residents evacuating, Russian troops surrendering, and, in one case, what appears to be a convoy of trucks carrying Russian reinforcements destroyed, with burned-out wreckage and dead soldiers visible along a stretch of road near Rylsk. Reports suggested as many as 500 to 1,000 Russian troops may have been killed.\n\nUKRAINE THINKS KURSK OFFENSIVE SHOWCASES 'RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENSE' AGAINST RUSSIA\n\nPENTAGON GREEN LIGHTS US WEAPONS: The Pentagon is signaling that Ukraine is free to use U.S.-supplied weapons, such as HIMARS and ATACMS rocket systems, as its troops battle Russian forces on their home turf.\n\n\"The dynamics have shifted on the battlefield,\" said Sabrina Singh, the Pentagon's deputy press secretary, at yesterday's regular briefing. \"As they see attacks coming across the border, they have to be able to have the capabilities to respond. And so you're seeing some of these cross-border counterfire measures that they're being able to take that are near the border of Ukraine.\"\n\n\"It is consistent with our policy and we have supported Ukraine from the very beginning to defend themselves against attacks that are coming across the border and for the need for crossfires,\" Singh said. \"So they are taking actions to protect themselves from attacks that are coming from a region that are within the U.S. policy of where they can operate.\"\n\n\"We don't support long-range attacks into (Russia). We've said that from the very beginning,\" Singh said. \"I'm not going to draw, you know, a circular map here for you of where they can and can't strike, but we've been very clear with the Ukrainians.\"\n\nTHE BIG QUESTION: Ukraine has remained tight-lipped about its force disposition inside Russia, and the ISW said it will not \"make forecasts about what Ukrainian forces might or might not do or where or when they might do it\" or \"offer assessments about the intent of this Ukrainian operation in order to avoid compromising Ukrainian operational security.\"\n\nThe big question now: what is the ultimate objective? Does Ukraine plan to try to hold land to trade in future peace negotiations? Or is the aim to shift the narrative and embarrass Russian President Vladimir Putin?\n\nIn his nightly video address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky made a cryptic statement which appeared to be in reference to the Kursk campaign. \"Ukrainians know how to achieve their goals. And achieving the goals at war was not our choice,\" He said. \"Russia brought the war to our land, and it should feel what it has done.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in Moscow, a stone-faced Putin was briefed on the frantic evacuation of civilians from villages by the region's acting governor, Alexei Smirnov. \"This was quite a difficult job because the Ukrainian sabotage and reconnaissance groups are firing at civilians and ambulances that are evacuating the population,\" Smirnov told Putin, according to a Kremlin transcript. \"People were transported to a safe distance first, from where we organized their further transportation by large-capacity buses. This work was carried out around the clock, and it continues at the moment.\"\n\nPutin indicated his concern for the \"victims\" by announcing he's authorizing a payment of 10,000 rubles ($114) to people displaced by the Ukrainian incursion.\n\nBRITISH ARMY CHIEF OUTLINES NEW STRATEGY TO DEFEAT RUSSIA\n\nGood Friday morning and welcome to Jamie McIntyre's Daily on Defense, written and compiled by Washington Examiner National Security Senior Writer Jamie McIntyre (@jamiejmcintyre) and edited by Christopher Tremoglie.

Israeli warplanes struck 30 Hamas targets in the city, including fighters and weapons storage sites, according to the Associated Press, which quoted the Israeli military as saying its troops \"were searching for Hamas tunnels and other infrastructure while engaging in combat \"above and below ground.\"\n\nTIME TO END THE SUFFERING: In the latest effort to secure the cease-fire deal first proposed by President Joe Biden, the U.S., Egypt, and Qatar have issued a joint statement calling for Israel and Hamas to resume talks next week in either Doha or Cairo.\n\n\"It is time to bring immediate relief both to the long-suffering people of Gaza as well as the long-suffering hostages and their families. The time has come to conclude the ceasefire and hostages and detainees release deal,\" the statement said. \"There is no further time to waste nor excuses from any party for further delay. It is time to release the hostages, begin the ceasefire, and implement this agreement.\"\n\nThe renewed effort to seal the deal comes after Biden spoke Tuesday with President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi and with the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim.\n\n\"Out of those calls came that very constructive proposal to issue a joint statement from the leaders. And both Qatar and Egypt believed this would be very useful, as they're working on the Hamas side, and the Israelis were also very receptive to this,\" a senior administration official told reporters in a conference call yesterday.\n\n\"These three leaders have been involved in this hostage negotiation, ceasefire agreement negotiation, now for some months. And as the statement says, there's a framework agreement that is on the table with, really, the details of implementation that are left to conclude.\"\n\nCEASEFIRE MEDIATORS URGE ISRAEL AND HAMAS TO RESUME NEGOTIATIONS NEXT WEEK\n\nNETANYAHU'S IN: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office released a statement indicating that Israel would participate in those discussions.\n\n\"Pursuant to the proposal by the U.S. and the mediators, Israel will - on 15 August - send the negotiations team to a place to be determined in order to finalize the details of the implementation of the framework agreement,\" the statement said.\n\nIf ceasefire talks occur as requested, CIA Director William Burns is expected to represent the U.S. at the table.\n\nWith the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, representation of Hamas would fall to the newly named leader of Hamas's political wing, Yahya Sinwar, who is believed to be hiding in Gaza's underground tunnels.\n\nNETANYAHU WON'T END THE WAR WITH HAMAS FOR 'ALL THE HOSTAGES'\n\nBIDEN REVIEWS ISRAEL DEFENSE PLANS: The U.S. is still positioning its forces to help defend Israel in the event of a major attack from Iran, which Tehran has threatened in response to the killing of Haniyeh on their soil.\n\nOn Monday, Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris had what was described as a \"very in-depth discussion\" with his national security team to \"review the military deployments to the region in preparation for the potential defense of Israel given a potential attack from Iran or Hezbollah or anyone else,\" according to the senior official who briefed reporters.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin and U.S. Central Commander Gen. Michael Kurilla, who is in the region, participated by phone.\n\n\"Last week Secretary Austin bolstered our force posture in the region to improve U.S. force protection, increase support for the defense of Israel, and to ensure the United States is prepared to respond to a various number of contingencies,\" spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said at the Pentagon. \"The secretary and the department remain intently focused on de-escalating tensions in the region and pushing for a ceasefire as part of the hostage deal to end the war in Gaza.\"\n\nWashington Examiner: Ukraine thinks Kursk offensive showcases 'right to self-defense' against Russia\n\nWashington Examiner: Ceasefire mediators urge Israel and Hamas to resume negotiations next week\n\nWashington Examiner: Harris doesn't support arms embargo on Israel\n\nWashington Examiner: Netanyahu won't end the war with Hamas for 'all the hostages'\n\nWashington Examiner: British Army chief outlines new strategy to defeat Russia\n\nWashington Post: Israel Repelled Iran's First Direct Attack.

A state of emergency has been \u00addeclared in the Kursk province and Russian fighter jets are now patrolling the border region.\n\nThat is indeed the justifiable rationale for the bold Ukrainian incursion. Kyiv has no intention of occupying or annexing Russian territory, but it desperately needs to reduce the Russian pressure on Kharkiv and frontline towns in the Donetsk province. Ukraine lacks the manpower, weapons and supplies to hold off a concerted Russian thrust towards Pokrovsk and other key towns. The \u00adincursion has forced Moscow to redeploy many of its aircraft. The number of glide bombs dropped in the Donetsk area has fallen sharply. The new strategy is the clear response of Ukraine's new \u00addefence minister, and is a test of his leadership at a time of simmering tensions within the Ukrainian government. It is also a challenge to Andrei \u00adBelousov, freshly appointed as Russia's defence minister and the replacement for his long-serving and much criticised predecessor, Sergei Shoigu.\n\nKyiv is being coy about how much of the \u00adunexpected thrust into Russia was known to Washington or authorised by the Biden \u00adadministration. To many in the West, the optics are not good. It seems to equate Ukraine with the brutal tactics Moscow is using in its war of \u00adaggression, especially the deaths of civilians. And to western strategists, it might seem like the kind of provocation, a direct attack on Russian \u00adterritory, which Moscow hawks say would justify a Russian nuclear response.\n\nThankfully, that seems unlikely. One complication bedevilling strategy on both sides is Ukraine's capture of the Sudzha gas hub, a major facility \u00adinvolved in the transit of gas from Russia to western Europe. Astonishingly, this has continued to operate despite the war. Nato countries are attempting to cut sharply their dependence on Russian gas and the profits this is generating for Moscow. But Ukraine still needs access to this gas. Sabotaging the Sudzha hub would serve no good war aim.\n\nUkraine is now in a desperate race to deploy new western missiles and fighter jets before Russia can overwhelm its defences along the eastern front. It needs to show its European and US backers that Russia is still vulnerable. Mr Belousov and Mr Putin will deploy overwhelming force as soon as possible to drive out Ukrainian troops. But the damage has been done. Moscow has been humiliated and Kyiv received a much needed boost in morale.", "source": {"uri": "thetimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "thetimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donetsk", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donetsk"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Donetsk"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oblast"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State of emergency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighter_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fighter aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk_Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kursk Oblast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kursk Oblast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Shoigu", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sergei Shoigu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Ukraine", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia_in_the_European_energy_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia in the European energy sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Front_(World_War_II)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Front (World War II)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_aggression", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "War of aggression"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Europe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western Europe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudzha,_Kursk_Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sudzha, Kursk Oblast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sudzha, Kursk Oblast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fmethode%2Ftimes%2Fprod%2Fweb%2Fbin%2Fd4b181dd-971f-4e96-b0e9-bb0622fbf9d8.jpg?crop=1280%2C720%2C0%2C120&resize=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799944", "eventUri": "eng-9799944", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

In the direction of Pokrovsk, the Russian offensive has intensified, and Ukraine's lines of defense may break if Moscow sustains its highly attritional operational tempo. In Kharkiv, the Russian military has been sending in reinforcements, tilting the balance of power toward the Kremlin. According to recent reports from United Kingdom Defence Intelligence, July saw a decrease over the two prior months in the number of Russian servicemen killed in action. This downward trend might indicate that Russia has been consolidating its positions to increase pressure on the front lines.\n\nMoscow continued its push on multiple other fronts as well. Vovchansk and Tykhe were critical hotspots for Russia's ongoing offensive on Kharkiv. In the direction of Kupiansk, Russian forces pushed for Stelmakhivka, though they made no confirmed territorial gains. Elsewhere, the Kremlin's heavy pressure yielded marginal gains on some fronts, including near Siversk, Vesele, and Chasiv Yar.\n\nNotably, combat formations from pro-Russian, separatist regions of the Ukrainian oblast of Luhansk participated in offensive action near Siversk, while in southern Ukraine, Russian forces maintained pressure on multiple targets, including Robotyne. Ukraine's position near Pokrovsk also continued to deteriorate, with some reports indicating that Russia's rapid advance there has led to a partial collapse in Ukraine's lines of defense.\n\nEvidence suggests that Moscow is considering deploying additional troops to the Pokrovsk region by transferring all available reserves in occupied areas. The Kremlin also reportedly has devoted some of its best troops, including units from the Russian Airborne Forces (VDV), to breaking bottlenecks on critical fronts.\n\nOpen-source evidence suggests that Russia is considering deployingadditional forces in several places, most notably on the Kharkiv front. Assessments indicate that Moscow continues to complement its ground offensive with aerial strikes.\n\nLast week, Kyiv continued long-range strikes on critical Russian airfields, oil infrastructure, and other military and strategic facilities. Attempting to curtail Russia's aerial attacks, Ukraine reportedly struck an aviation ammunition depot and a base of the Main Missile and Artillery Directorate of the Russian Ministry of Defense in Kursk. In another incident, Ukrainian forces conducted a kamikaze drone attack that caused multiple fires on the Morozovsk air base, an airfield that hosts Su-34 fighter-bombers and Su-30 and Su-35 fighter jets, platforms that play an active role in Russia's offensive in Ukraine. An assessment of open-source imagery confirms that Ukrainian forces damaged the facility.\n\nMoreover, Ukraine hit and reportedly sank a Russian Improved Kilo-class submarine, the Rostov-on-Don, in the port of Sevastopol in occupied Crimea. The Ukrainian military had previously used Storm Shadow missiles to hit the Kalibr-capable attack submarine, from which Moscow has launched cruise missile attacks on Ukraine.\n\nA Forbes analysis also revealed that Ukraine launched almost 100 more attack drones in July than Russia, deploying 520 drones to Moscow's 426. This helps illustrate why the West should lift restrictions on the long-range weapons it has been transferring to Kyiv, as the Russian rear remains vulnerable to the Ukrainian military's deep strikes.\n\nFinally, the first deliveries of F-16 combat aircraft to the Ukrainian Air Force are promising news for Kyiv. Official sources suggest that the first batch of the long-awaited F-16s are finally flying in Ukrainian skies. With timely military assistance and operational support, the aircraft will provide a needed boost to Kyiv.\n\nNonetheless, the F-16, a textbook fourth-generation tactical military aviation platform, has a limited ceiling. It does not possess stealth features or fifth-generation sensor fusion, which makes it vulnerable to Russian surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems and fighter aircraft. Thus, while the F-16s herald Ukraine's transition to North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) aviation systems, they do not solve all of Kyiv's problems.\n\nRussia and North Korea's recent signing of a defense pact and subsequent staging of high-level bilateral meetings are starting to bear fruit for Moscow, as open-source intelligence suggests that Pyongyang recently sent Bulsae-4 anti-tank missile vehicles to bolster Russia's war effort.\n\nVisual evidence from the battlefield indicates that the North Korean tank destroyer was first spotted in Russia across the border from the Ukrainian city of Vovchansk, but has not yet been combat deployed in Ukraine. The Bulsae-4 is a non-line-of-sight (NLOS) missile vehicle, a platform that can strike targets without a direct line of sight. The vehicle features eight rotating missile containers mounted on the chassis of the North Korean M-2010 wheeled armored personnel carrier, which is derived from the Soviet BTR-80.\n\nBecause of scant evidence, Ukrainian officials have remained cautious about declaring whether the vehicle is yet in the Kremlin's possession. If confirmed, the transfer would suggest that Russian combat formations may possess other heavy armor from Pyongyang. Thus far, North Korea has provided Russia with 152mm-class artillery shells and 122mm-class rockets, along with tactical ballistic missiles similar to the Russian SS-26 Iskander. At a time of high-tempo combat operations, North Korea remains a crucial supplier of Russia's armed forces.\n\nFor many months, Russian electronic warfare activity, including extensive jamming and suppression of the Global Positioning System (GPS), has vexed Ukraine and troubled commercial air operations along NATO's eastern edge. Now, Kyiv is responding by amping up its cyber and electronic warfare efforts. In July, the Ukrainian Main Directorate of Intelligence (GUR) reportedly conducted a large-scale, nationwide cyberattack against Russia's financial institutions and critical national infrastructure.\n\nOn the Russian side, new Kremlin Defense Minister Andrey Belousov's technology-focused approach has pushed Russian arms manufacturers to scale up their robotic warfare and drone production efforts. Recent reporting in the Russian state-owned news agency RIA claimed that Moscow can produce around 4,000 first-person-view (FPV) drones per day. This would provide Russia with approximately 1.4 million drones per year, around half of Ukraine's reported production of around 3 million FPV drones, although Kyiv's numbers depend on Western support.\n\nMore worrisome than the volume of Russia's drone production is the quality of its munitions. The Kremlin's defense technological and industrial base is now devising dangerous solutions explicitly for anti-drone warfare, many of which are targeted at Ukraine's Baba Yaga night-bomber hexacopter drones. Russia's achievements in drone-on-drone warfare threaten not only Ukraine but could, in a broader future conflict, pose problems for NATO.", "source": {"uri": "eurasiareview.com", "dataType": "news",

Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in.\n\nAround 3,000 people have been evacuated from Kursk, the western Russian border region attacked by Ukrainian forces this week, officials have said.\n\nSpeaking to Putin, Smirnov said that extra trains were scheduled to take people to temporary housing and that he had set up a telephone helpline. Public sector employees would still get their salary, he added.\n\nTo be clear -- $115 does not get you far in Russia, even accounting for lower prices there. Russia's statistics body said that, as of 2022, the average monthly salary before tax was just over 71,000 rubles, or about $800.\n\nAs of last fall, almost half of Russians said their monthly pay was not covering basics; and under a feverish wartime economy, the country's annual inflation rate hovers above 9%.\n\nDespite earlier assurances from Smirnov that the situation was under control, reports from pro-Kremlin military bloggers suggest that some people experienced disorderly evacuations, the Institute for the Study of War said.\n\nOne civilian in Sudzha, a town considered to be a focus of the Ukrainian attack, told the independent Russian outlet Meduza that she fled before any evacuation was organized.\n\n\"Judging by the news reports, our town no longer exists,\" she said.\n\nImages shared by Russian authorities purporting to be from the region show destroyed houses.\n\nStrict instructions were given to state-controlled media to tamp down reporting on the attack, Meduza reported, citing industry insiders.\n\nThe full contours of Ukraine's surprise incursion into Kursk remain unclear -- but both Western and Russian commentators have said that Russia appears to have been caught on the back foot.\n\nRussia said on Wednesday that Ukraine had committed up to 1,000 troops to the fight, backed by tanks, armored vehicles, and air defenses.\n\nAs of Thursday, the ISW assessed that Ukrainian troops had pushed as far as 21 miles into Russian territory, noting that they were unlikely to be controlling territory that far out.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mia_jankowicz@businessinsider.com", "name": "Mia Jankowicz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kursk"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kursk"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia\u2013Ukraine_border", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia\u2013Ukraine border"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Telephone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Armed Forces of Ukraine"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meduza", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meduza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_ruble", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian ruble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World War I"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudzha,_Kursk_Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sudzha, Kursk Oblast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sudzha, Kursk Oblast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media_in_Russia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mass media in Russia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_armour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vehicle armour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_the_Study_of_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Institute for the Study of War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-aircraft warfare"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/66b5e5835da406397bf4698b?width=1200&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799944", "eventUri": "eng-9799944", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

made a video appeal to Putin angrily attacking his military chief of staff Valery Gerasimov for 'lying' in claiming that the Ukrainian advance had been halted.\n\n'Foreign troops with NATO equipment entered our land,' they complained, upset that they are facing the same foreign occupation that Putin has inflicted on large regions of Ukraine.\n\nMORE : Chess player 'poisoned rival by smearing

Russian officials said the incursion resulted in five civilian deaths and 31 injuries, six of whom were children.\n\nThere were up to 1,000 Ukrainian troops, as well as 11 tanks and more than 20 armored combat vehicles entering Russia near the town of Sudzha on Tuesday morning, BBC reported citing Moscow sources.\n\n\"The choice of timing for this attack has mainly taken into consideration the opportunity presented by the change in the Russian military leadership and the rotation of frontline Russian troops,\" Cui Heng, a scholar from the Shanghai-based China National Institute for SCO International Exchange and Judicial Cooperation, told the Global Times.\n\n\"With Western voices now calling for negotiations with Russia, Ukraine wants to demonstrate its combat capabilities and determination at this juncture to avoid being quickly abandoned,\" Cui said.\n\nUS National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the White House will be reaching out to Kiev \"to get a little better understanding\" of the situation in Kursk, adding that the US \"has not changed its policy of authorizing Ukraine to use American-supplied weapons to target imminent threats just across the border,\" Ukrainska Pravda reported.\n\nThe US has exposed its hypocritical duplicity as it claims to \"restrain\" the use of American-made weapons on the one hand while in reality, indulging Kiev with financial and military support. To some extent, the attack on Russian targets is a result of the US' fueling the fire, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday confirmed that his country has received and is already using its first batch of American-made F-16 fighter jets.\n\nThe US' actions have not been downplayed despite international efforts for dialogue;

The media outlet pointed to footage published by the Russian Defense Ministry, which shows IFVs being hit with Russian kamikaze drones.\n\nThursday morning, the ministry published a clip showing the destruction of at least three Marder vehicles by Russian Lancet drones, among other strikes on Ukrainian military equipment. The armor pieces were hit while moving along dirt roads and through a wooded area.\n\nPosting on X (formerly, Twitter), Bild journalist Julian Ropcke said all three Marders \"fell victim\" to Russian strikes just a few kilometers from the border - as the Ukrainian forces had sent them into battle \"without adequate air defense.\"\n\nThe news of German-made weapons being used in an attack on Russia's internationally recognized Russian territory has prompted a mixed reaction in Germany. The head of the German parliament's Defense Committee, Markus Faber, stated he had no issues with the development. Any weapons handed over to Kiev cease to be German and become Ukrainian ones, he told the Funke Media Group. He also described the territory of both Ukraine and Russia as a \"war zone.\"\n\n\"This is a highly dangerous development,\" said Sahra Wagenknecht, the head of the newly formed BSW Party and a former Left Party leader. Chancellor Olaf Scholz should call the Ukrainian leadership and \"demand that no German weapons be used in [attacks] on the Russian territory,\" she added. Back in 1943, Soviet troops clashed with the Nazi forces on the fields of the Kursk Region in what has since become known as the Battle of Kursk. It was one of the deadliest episodes of World War II and one of the largest tank battles in history.\n\nNazi Germany sought to achieve victory at the time by fielding its then brand-new armor pieces, including Panther and Tiger tanks as well as Ferdinand tank destroyers. The battle involved thousands of tanks on both sides, ended with the Soviet forces inflicting a defeat on the Nazi troops.\n\nUp to 1,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been involved in the incursion into Kursk Region this week, supported by armor that included several US-made Stryker armored fighting vehicles, as well as artillery and drones, the Russian Defense Ministry has said.\n\nKiev's forces have lost some 660 soldiers and 82 armor pieces, including eight tanks, 12 armored personnel carriers and six infantry fighting vehicles since the start of their operation, according to estimates provided by the ministry on Thursday. Moscow's forces have stalled the Ukrainian troops' offensive and prevented them from getting deeper into the region, the Russian authorities said.", "source": {"uri": "rt.com", "dataType": "news",

Twenty multi-storey apartment blocks and six administrative buildings were damaged.\n\nUkrainian-held parts of the Donetsk region regularly come under Russian shelling and air strikes. Russian forces control a large part of the region, which Moscow claims along with four other Ukrainian regions as its own territory.\n\nDonetsk also remains one of the hottest areas of fighting as Russia targets areas in the direction of the strategic eastern logistics hub of Pokrovsk.\n\nAt least four people were killed in Russian shelling in Donetsk on Wednesday.\n\nThursday's shelling came as Russian forces battled Ukrainian troops in Russia's Kursk region. The Ukrainian forces smashed through the border three days ago, in what Moscow said was an attempt to force Russia to divert resources from the battle front in Ukraine.\n\n(Reporting by Yuliia DysaEditing by Gareth Jones, Ron Popeski and Sandra Maler)", "source": {"uri": "swissinfo.ch", "dataType": "news", "title": "SWI swissinfo.ch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "swi_swissinfo_ch@swissinfo.ch", "name": "Swi Swissinfo.Ch", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kharkiv_(2022)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Battle of Kharkiv (2022)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donetsk_Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donetsk Oblast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Donetsk Oblast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donetsk", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donetsk"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Donetsk"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kostiantynivka", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kostiantynivka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kostiantynivka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakhmut", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bakhmut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bakhmut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selydove", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Selydove"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Selydove"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokrovsk,_Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pokrovsk, Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pokrovsk, Ukraine"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblasts_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oblasts of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Armed Forces of Ukraine"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk_Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kursk Oblast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kursk Oblast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/wp-content/uploads/swissinfo-theme/swi-fallback-featured-image.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799944", "eventUri": "eng-9799944", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.5137254901960784, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

Ukraine has embarrassed Putin and the Russian military.\n\n\"They've brought the war to ordinary Russians and set the conditions for negotiations.\n\n\"It is too early to tell Ukraine's ultimate objectives, but on the surface it could be a masterstroke if they can continue the advance and hold off Russian counterattacks.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Ukraine bizarrely dropped leaflets inside Russia with naked women on in a bid to get Putin's troops to surrender - or risk death.\n\nSocial media users were left dumbfounded after pics of \"motivational leaflets\" scattered over Kursk emerged featuring a soldier and a naked woman.\n\nThe message on the bizarre nude leaflets reportedly translate to: \"The wife of your brigade commander is waiting for you in the banya.\"\n\nBanya is a traditional Russian steam sauna.\n\nThe odd message could be implying that as ordinary soldiers are dying for Putin, commanders and their families are enjoying themselves away from the frontline.\n\nThe other with the dead soldier on apparently says: \"Soldier of the 25th brigade.\n\n\"Choose life. Surrender.\"\n\nThe leaflets also give instructions on \"how to surrender\" as well as contact details in an attempt to make further advances into the region.", "source": {"uri": "the-sun.com",

While GlobalSecurity.org takes utmost care to accurately report this news story, we cannot independently verify the authenticity of all statements, photos and videos.\n\nOn 24 February 2022, Ukraine was suddenly and deliberately attacked by land, naval and air forces of Russia, igniting the largest European war since the Great Patriotic War. Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a \"special military operation\" (SVO - spetsialnaya voennaya operatsiya) in Ukraine in response to the appeal of the leaders of the \"Donbass republics\" for help. That attack is a blatant violation of the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine. Putin stressed that Moscow's goal is the demilitarization and denazification of the country. The military buildup in preceeding months makes it obvious that the unprovoked and dastardly Russian attack was deliberately planned long in advance. During the intervening time, the Russian government had deliberately sought to deceive the world by false statements and expressions of hope for continued peace.\n\n\"To initiate a war of aggression... is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole.\" [Judgment of the International Military Tribunal]\n\nThe General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported that since the beginning of the day, there have been 78 combat clashes, Russian forces launched 47 air strikes using 56 KABs, 493 kamikaze drones strikes and carried out almost 3391 shelling positions of Ukrainian troops and settlements using different types of weapons.\n\nIn the Kharkiv direction, Russian forces throughout the day carried out six attacks near vov\u010dans \u0437ka.

Yes, our people died, that's a fact. The enemy has entered several settlements,\" said Alaudinov, a close ally of Chechen dictator Ramzan Kadyrov and an official at the Russian Defense Ministry, in a video published by the Russian independent outlet Agentstvo.\n\nAlaudinov became the first Russian commander to acknowledge losses since Ukraine launched a cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast on Aug. 6. Despite Moscow claiming repeatedly that the Ukrainian advance has been halted, the fighting continues.\n\nA shorter version of the video was shared on Alaudinov's personal Telegram channel, where the comment about losses was cut.\n\nThe Chechen commander said that Ukrainian forces \"advanced well into our territory, about 10 kilometers.\" The U.S.-based think tank Institute for the Study of War (ISW) gave a similar estimate on Aug. 7 based on geolocated footage.\n\nKyiv has largely refused to comment on the operations in the region.\n\nKursk Oblast lies on the border with Ukraine's Sumy Oblast, which has been experiencing daily attacks since Russian troops were pushed out of the oblast and back across the border in April 2022.\n\nThe appearance of Chechen special forces in Kursk Oblast was reported as early as April, and their presence was later confirmed by Kadyrov himself, Agentstvo wrote.\n\nAlaudinov claimed that his forces were unable to stop the Ukrainian advance because Kyiv's troops bypassed key strongholds. In turn, Russian \"milblogger\" Yuri Kotenok claimed that Chechen forces were deployed in the area of hostilities but fled soon after the Ukrainian attack.\n\nThe Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims.\n\nRussia said that as of Aug. 8, battles are ongoing in the Sudzhansky (Sudzha) and Korenevsky (Korenevo) border districts of Kursk Oblast.

Russians Retreating: Full Defense Mode Activated! - Reporting from Ukraine", "body": "Today, there are a lot of updates from the Kharkiv direction.\n\nHere, intense combat continues in Vovchansk, with Ukrainian forces making slow but steady advances while Russian forces have officially announced a shift to a defensive posture in anticipation of a potential Ukrainian attempt to collapse Russian positions across the northern part of the city.\n\nAlthough various map update sources show slight discrepancies, most information sources agree that Russian forces have completely withdrawn from their attempt to establish a stronghold in the wooded area south of the river, directly opposite the aggregate plant.\n\nRecently published geolocated images show a group of Ukrainian soldiers walking along the road of the bridge just west of the wooded area. The Ukrainians move without apparent concern, indicating the complete absence of Russian forces in the vicinity.\n\nRegarding the Aggregate Plant itself, Vitalii Sarantsev, a spokesman for the Ukrainian \"Kharkiv\" Group of Forces, confirmed in recent statements to the media that a small group of Russian soldiers remained blocked on the plant's territory. The spokesman stated that the number of Russian troops still trapped at the aggregate plant constantly decreases, with an estimated 40 soldiers remaining. Although they can still receive small amounts of food and ammunition delivered by unmanned aerial vehicles, they are completely blocked and unable to leave. Sarantsev noted that these soldiers' position is isolated from the main Russian force positions, as the Ukrainian army controls all approach paths to the plant.\n\nIn recent days, there has been an intensification of FPV drone attack operations on the aggregate plant. Geolocated footage shows numerous attempts by FPV drones to enter the plant's standing buildings, trying to detonate explosives from the inside. While images show success in some cases, in others, the drones were shot down by Russian soldiers just before reaching their targets. This sudden increase in Ukrainian activity at the plant, including both drone operations and the innovative ground drone attack described a few days ago, suggests, according to various analysts, that the start of a Ukrainian clearing operation throughout the aggregate plant area is approaching. The original, uncensored footage of these drone attacks can be found on our Telegram channel through the link in the description.\n\nRegarding the Citadel area, while there have been reports of Russian attempts to take positions in some of the high-rise buildings on the northern and eastern perimeters, Ukrainian advances have been confirmed around the adjacent streets to the south and southeast. This expands the Ukrainian control zone in the area and further compromises any Russian attempt to connect with the aggregate plant, suggesting that the Russians may have definitively given up on the aggregate plant and their next best option is to establish a stronghold in one of the citadel positions in an attempt to prevent the complete collapse of their defense in northern Vovchansk.\n\nHowever, the most significant development has come from official Russian army communications. Official statements from the Russian Northern Group of Forces began in early August to describe their efforts in Vovchansk as \"defensive\" against what they termed a numerically superior Ukrainian force. Some analysts perceive this change in the narrative as preparation for a significant Ukrainian counterattack movement or even the possibility of withdrawal from substantial areas of Vovchansk. It's worth noting that Russian sources themselves had confirmed on various occasions that they have evidence of the continuous accumulation of Ukrainian forces on the Kharkiv front.\n\nConfirming all of the above, recent publications by military analysts, using open-source databases on geolocations over a one-month time window, confirm the slow but progressive Ukrainian advance in northern Vovchansk. They conclude that the situation is likely irreversible for Russian forces, which will soon only be able to aspire to maintain positions in the northern part of the city, above the citadel line.\n\nDespite the continuous Russian artillery, thermobaric ammunition, and glide bomb attacks in their attempt to undermine the Ukrainian logistics in their efforts to supply the forces in Vovchansk, the better knowledge of the Ukrainian terrain, as well as...", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russian language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vovchansk", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vovchansk"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vovchansk"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drone_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drone warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Armed Forces of Ukraine"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukrainians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosive", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Explosive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegram_(messaging_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Telegram (messaging service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_Ground_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ukrainian Ground Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_ground_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned ground vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citadel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Citadel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammunition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ammunition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Group_of_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northern Group of Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glide_bomb", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glide bomb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermobaric_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thermobaric weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Ground_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian Ground Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Logistics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 62}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799944", "eventUri": "eng-9799944", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nKyiv's audacious cross-border assault into Russia's Kursk region has certainly ruffled feathers in Moscow. Vladimir Putin denounced it as a \"large-scale provocation\" while his officials have lined up to tell him the situation is under control - despite fighting continuing into a third day on Thursday and thousands of people having to evacuate the area.\n\nUkraine has an issue with the number of soldiers it can put on the battlefield and has been trying to up recruitment, so some may ask why it would commit resources to an incursion into Russia, especially when Moscow's forces are putting Kyiv's troops under pressure on other points of the 600-mile frontline, including around the key eastern town of Pokrovsk, several hundred miles away in the region of Donetsk.\n\nHowever, while the operation into Kursk is unlikely to create a long-term strategic opportunity for Kyiv, given that troops will be unable to hold any gained land for long, there are plenty of more symbolic reasons for bursting through the border. The two major reasons are to boost morale and make both Moscow and Western allies think.\n\nTaking the latter of those first, breaking through two sets of Russian defensive lines and making it between six and 10 miles into Russia will force Moscow's military into restocking their lines, likely pulling troops from an offensive in Ukraine's Kharkiv region, just across the border, which is where it had been making gains against Kyiv's soldiers. That will both alleviate some of the pressure on Ukraine's own defensive lines - even if only for a short period - and should also make Moscow more wary of overcommitting around the Kharkiv region and leaving themselves open like this again.\n\nIt also shows Kyiv's allies in the West that its army is still capable of battlefield surprises even when it is under pressure, and can keep operations secret from their enemy. Kyiv will hope that such an ability to manoeuvre will remind its backers that sending more long-range weapons, shells and jets will not be wasted and that it can act nimbly and swiftly even when outnumbered and outgunned. While senior Ukrainian officials have not referred directly to the raid, president Volodymyr Zelensky praised his army's ability to \"surprise\" and \"get results\" during a public appearance on Thursday.\n\nUkraine will also never miss an opportunity to embarrass Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin, and this is an embarrassment. Whether it was hundreds of troops or 1,000, the attack shows the Russian people that Moscow can make mistakes and reminds them that this invasion can come home to roost. While in the public statements about the cross-border assault Russian officials say it is under control, those claims are made a mockery of by the three days of fighting (and potentially more).\n\nOn the other side of the coin, the attack is a big morale boost for both troops on the front and the Ukrainian people across the country who have faced repeated and increasing drone and missile attacks on their cities in recent months. The incursion has been tracked and celebrated, while the pronouncements of the Ukrainian advance Russian military bloggers that tend to give a more accurate - if not entirely accurate - picture of the battlefield than the Kremlin have been eagerly devoured.\n\nThe attack into Kursk will not fundamentally alter the trajectory of this war - but its symbolic importance should not be underestimated.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_stevenson@independent.co.uk", "name": "Chris Stevenson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kursk"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kursk"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv_Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv Oblast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv Oblast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk_Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kursk Oblast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kursk Oblast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokrovsk,_Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pokrovsk, Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pokrovsk, Ukraine"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donetsk", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donetsk"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Donetsk"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(projectile)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shell (projectile)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moscow Kremlin"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukrainians"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/08/18/newFile.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799944", "eventUri": "eng-9799944", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

The instructions emphasise comparing the events to the historical Battle of Kursk from World War II and reassuring the public that President Putin and the government will not abandon those in need.\n\nRussian media have been advised to avoid alarming narratives about a \"new front\" and instead draw parallels with the Battle of Kursk, one of the largest tank battles in history, which was a significant Soviet victory. This comparison is intended to frame the current situation in a context of historical resilience and military triumph.\n\nAdditionally, media outlets have been instructed to avoid discussing the proximity of Ukrainian forces to the city of Kurchatov, home to the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant. The aim is to prevent the public from developing fears of a nuclear threat.\n\nThe Department of Analysis from the media suggests that it is highly unlikely for Ukrainian forces to reach the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant, located about 50 kilometres from their current positions.\n\nInstead of focusing on military movements or potential threats, Russian media have been directed to highlight the \"successes of the Russian army\" in preventing further Ukrainian advances into the Kursk region.\n\nThere is also a push to report on Ukrainian attacks on civilian targets, particularly stressing the impact on children, with nine reported injuries among minors.\n\nCoverage should also showcase stories of community solidarity, such as blood donation drives and locals housing evacuees from the Sudzhan district. These narratives are encouraged to be presented as detailed stories rather than straightforward news items.\n\nMedia have been advised to assure the public that there are adequate facilities for those displaced by the conflict. Reports should cover visits by Acting Governor Alexei Smirnov to temporary accommodation centres, hospitals, and clinics treating the injured. The official death toll currently stands at five civilians, with 21 reported injuries.\n\nA significant portion of the media coverage is to be dedicated to the efforts of federal authorities, particularly President Vladimir Putin and the government, emphasising that they are actively addressing the crisis and supporting affected residents. This directive appears to be aimed at reinforcing public trust in the government's handling of the situation.\n\nAccording to Meduza's sources within the Kremlin-loyal media, these recommendations were only received on the afternoon of 8 August, despite the Ukrainian offensive beginning two days earlier on 6 August. This delay suggests that the political bloc of the Presidential Administration initially struggled to grasp the situation's scope, delaying the creation and dissemination of the media guidelines.", "source": {"uri": "eutoday.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "eutoday.net"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eutoday_correspondents@eutoday.net", "name": "EUToday Correspondents", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Armed Forces of Ukraine"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media_in_Russia", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mass media in Russia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kursk", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Battle of Kursk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk_Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kursk Oblast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kursk Oblast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meduza", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meduza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk_Nuclear_Power_Plant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kursk Nuclear Power Plant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_Administration_of_Russia", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidential Administration of Russia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soviet Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Ground_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian Ground Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurchatov,_Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kurchatov, Russia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kurchatov, Russia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_displacement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forced displacement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://eutoday.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/06.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799944", "eventUri": "eng-9799944", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 2697, "textEnd": 2705}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-06", "textStart": 2769, "textEnd": 2777}], "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

From the biblical battle between David and Goliath and the American War of Independence against the Great British Empire, to the fall of the Soviet Empire. The victory of the \"weak Davids\" has always seemed unexpected, and the fall of the \"strong Goliaths\" has always been deafening.\n\nWe are on the threshold of similar events, and the Kursk operation in Russia is their manifestation. In fact, it takes into account the experience of Prigozhin's march on Moscow in 2023, which showed Russia's internal weakness and fragility. At that time, 5,000 fighters were able to capture Rostov-on-Don with a population of more than 1.1 million people and march without resistance almost all the way to Moscow.\n\nThis showed Moscow's inability to fight a global war on its own territory. From that moment on, it was only a matter of time before operations like the current Kursk incursion were carried out. Moreover, Ukraine's survival demanded it. After all, in the theater of war in which there is a relatively static, entrenched front line, similar to World War I, Russia has a strategic advantage over Ukraine. So, it was simply vital for Ukraine to transfer the battle to Russian territories - to transfer the course of military operations into a state of mobile warfare - despite the objections of its Western partners and allies. Which, by the way, had themselves lost such wars against more mobile opponents.\n\nThe Kursk operation required only one thing - the courage to \"turn the table.\" As they say: Fortis fortuna adiuvat - fortune favors the brave.\n\nAnd just when all the circumstances were favorable for such an operation, Ukraine was able to accumulate the necessary troops and means in the Sumy-Kharkiv region under the guise of protecting it from a potential Russian invasion. To accumulate without suspicion on the part of Moscow. At the same time, Russia has thrown all its resources into conducting offensive operations in the Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia sectors. On top of that, a successful information campaign was conducted in the Ukrainian information space about a possible Russian offensive in the north of Ukraine, which further put the enemy's vigilance to sleep. The operation itself had been in preparation for several months.\n\nAlready on the first days of the operation, we can say that everything was planned correctly.\n\nThe Ukrainian troops were facing an almost empty Russian rear, which Moscow was simply unable to defend. That is why the members of the Russian Security Council on Aug. 7 had such bewildered faces. There was nothing to oppose them. And all Putin's statements about the provocative nature of the operation are empty talk.\n\nThe Kursk operation should expand in the next few days with raids on the rear and in depth, including the \"Prigozhinskaya\" highway M-4 and in the Chernihiv direction, with strikes on logistics and communications of the Donetsk front of Russia. After all, fate helps the brave.\n\nThe result of this operation, and subsequent raids, will be a complete change in the nature of the war towards mobility, where Ukraine has the advantage. Russia is incapable of this kind of action and does not have sufficient resources to defend its entire vast territory. Like all empires before it, Russia is a colossus on clay feet whose destiny is to fall. Moreover, all fears of a potential unpredictable retaliatory attack by Russia against Ukraine's just and proactive defense have consistently proven to be empty and unjustified.\n\nYet another important result of the Kursk operation is the absolute impossibility of truce negotiations.\n\nNow only one question remains: are you with us or not?", "source": {"uri": "kyivpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KyivPost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kursk"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kursk"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goliath", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goliath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British Empire"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Revolutionary War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bible"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soviet Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rostov-on-Don", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rostov-on-Don"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rostov-on-Don"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maneuver_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maneuver warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_line", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Front line"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theater_(warfare)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Theater (warfare)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World War I"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donetsk", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donetsk"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Donetsk"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaporizhzhia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zaporizhzhia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Council_of_Russia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Security Council of Russia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernihiv", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chernihiv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chernihiv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Operating_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Operating Systems", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives", "label": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Retail_Trade", "label": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Retail Trade", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://static.kyivpost.com/storage/2024/08/09/10cecef8ffff017f71f89f4035b5063a.jpg?w=630&q=90&f=jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799944", "eventUri": "eng-9799944", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 2610, "textEnd": 2616}], "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

An excerpt of the broadcast was shared on X, formerly Twitter, late on Thursday by Julia Davis, the founder of the Russia Media Monitor watchdog group.\n\nKyiv's forces launched its cross-border armored assault on Tuesday, and swiftly seized a large number of settlements. They captured scores of Russian personnel, and overwhelmed two major lines of fortifications in the Kursk region that took Russia over two-and-a-half years and more than $170 million to build.\n\nNewsweek has contacted Russia's Defense Ministry for comment by email.\n\nUkraine has so far gained control of at least 166 square miles of Russian territory -- equivalent to the size of New Orleans -- investigative Russian outlet Agentstvo reported on Thursday. Newsweek could not independently verify this.\n\n\"According to the scarce, unverified comments that I would doubt 10 times over, all of this resembles chaos -- a word that members of the military don't like,\" said Mardan, criticizing the lack of information on the situation from the Kremlin.\n\n\"Ukrainians are in the Kursk region; part of Sudzha is under Ukrainian control. It's a regional center. Yes, it's true. There is no official confirmation, but it's true. There are tanks, there are armored personnel carriers, there is a colossal number of drones...,\" said Mardan.\n\nMardan commented on reports that emerged on Thursday that Kyiv's forces were reported to be nearly in full control of the city Sudzha, where a gas-measuring facility that facilitates the flow of Russian gas to Europe is located.\n\n\"By the end of the day yesterday, parts of Sudzha were under the control of Ukrainians. They have entered it. According to what I have read and have heard, Russian Army reserves are being pulled into the Kursk region,\" the state TV host said. \"There is still no military information, basically none. I don't know whether it's good or bad. I think this isn't so good.\"\n\nGeorgy Mamsurov, a correspondent for Solovyov Live, was invited to speak on-air, and said that his sources say Ukraine \"managed to grab a hold of the northern parts\" of Sudzha, but was stopped near the town of Korenevo.\n\n\"In my opinion, it's difficult to even call it a raid; this is a full-fledged combined arms operation that Ukraine's Armed Forces have initiated on the territory of our country,\" the journalist added.\n\nMikhail Khodaryonok, a military expert, told Mardan that Ukraine has made \"significant advancement\" into the Kursk region. He added that he believes Russian citizens will soon be demanding answers from the Kremlin.\n\n\"Suddenly, the Ukrainian side has demonstrated its ability to attack and to conduct successful action,\" said Khodaryonok.\n\n\"We don't have the precise data as to which areas are controlled by which side. One way or another, citizens will be asking questions. There are questions to our intelligence agencies -- how could this happen? How? Where is the engineering equipment that should be on the border of our nation? Where are the troops that were supposed to provide cover and repel any attacks? Where are the necessary reserves?\" he said.\n\nPutin on Wednesday called Ukraine's cross-border armored assaults a \"large-scale provocation.\"\n\n\"We have to start with the events in the Kursk region,\" the Russian leader said at an emergency meeting of his Security Council. \"As you know, the Kyiv regime has carried out another large-scale provocation, firing indiscriminately with various types of weapons, including missiles, at civilian buildings, residential buildings, and ambulances.\"\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry has, meanwhile, downplayed the scale of Ukrainian advances in the

The last Russian figure for evacuations in Kursk was 3,000.\n\nLittle reliable information about the surprise Ukrainian operation has emerged, and its strategic aims are unclear. Ukrainian officials have refused to comment specifically about the incursion, which is taking place about 500 kilometers (320 miles) southwest of Moscow.\n\nBut a top adviser to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Thursday that border region attacks will cause Russia to \"start to realize that the war is slowly creeping inside of Russian territory.\" Myhailo Podolyak also suggested that the operation would improve Kyiv's hand in the event of negotiations with Moscow.\n\nThe assault came as the Ukrainian army toils to hold at bay an intense Russian push at places on the front line in eastern Ukraine, especially in the Donetsk region. Russian President Vladimir Putin has made clear he wants to capture the parts of Donetsk that the Kremlin's forces don't already occupy.\n\nRussia declares federal level emergencies when there are more than 500 victims or damage exceeds 500 million rubles (about $6 million).\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, says Ukrainian forces have pressed on with their \"rapid advances\" deeper into the Kursk region, reportedly going up to 35 kilometers (20 miles) beyond the border.\n\n\"The lack of a coherent Russian response to the Ukrainian incursion into Kursk ... and the reported rate of Ukrainian advance indicates that Ukrainian forces were able to achieve operational surprise,\" the Washington-based ISW said late Thursday.\n\nA Russian Defense Ministry statement Friday said only that the military \"continues to repel the attempted invasion\" and is responding with airstrikes, artillery and troops on the ground.\n\nUkraine has also kept up its strategy of hitting rear areas with long-range drones, targeting military sites, oil refineries and other infrastructure.\n\nUkrainian drones attacked Russia's Lipetsk region, which is about 300 kilometers (180 miles) from the Ukraine border, during Thursday night, authorities said.\n\nDrones operated by Ukraine's Security Service hit a military airfield there, a security official told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nThe airfield was a base for fighter jets and helicopters and more than 700 powerful glide bombs in storage,\" the source said.\n\nUkraine's Army General Staff also confirmed the strike on Lipetsk-2 airfield Friday morning, saying it was used as a base for multiple Su-34, Su-35 and MiG-31 jets.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said that 75 Ukrainian drones were shot down during the night, 19 of them over Lipetsk.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine at

Nominations [of 37252586.87 m\u00b3] have been confirmed and the physical flow of gas is maintained.\"\n\nThe Sudzha station is \"the only operational route for Russian pipeline gas flowing into Europe,\" according to Sergey Vakulenko, Russian oil and gas analyst and senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center.\n\nEuropean benchmark gas prices jumped as much as 5.7% to \u20ac38.78 ($42.35) per megawatt-hour on Wednesday (7 August), surpassing the previous intraday high recorded in June.\n\nDespite Europe's push to punish Russia for the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, reliance on Russian energy lingers.\n\nMore than 40% of Europe's imported natural gas came from Russia, pre-invasion, delivered via four main pipelines.\n\nFollowing the Nord Stream and Yamal-Europe pipelines' closures, the Ukrainian transit route has become all the more crucial, as it \"transports roughly one-third of all remaining Russian gas exports to Europe\", according to Paul Hasselbrinck, senior energy analyst at GlobalData.\n\n\"The only two other available routes are the TurkStream going through Turkey,\" Hasselbrinck tells Power Technology.\n\nThe Kursk incursion demonstrates Kyiv's objective to continue targeting Russian energy infrastructure, as a significant portion of the Kremlin's long-term financing comes from natural gas exports.\n\nWhile \"damaging energy infrastructure is a worthwhile investment, Ukraine must exercise caution with using up the limited manpower and equipment resources they have with acts like this\", says James Marques, defence analyst at GlobalData.\n\n\"As with previous border incursions it would be unwise, and I don't expect, for Ukraine to attempt to dig in and hold this ground long-term,\" Marques tells Power Technology.\n\nMoscow has been alarmist in its response.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin accused Ukraine of a \"major provocation\", while acting regional governor of Kursk declared a state of emergency necessary to \"eliminate the consequences of enemy forces coming into the region\".\n\nUp to 1,000 Ukrainian troops, 11 tanks and more than 20 armoured combat vehicles entered Russia near Sudzha, killing at least five civilians and wounding 31 others, six of them children, according to Russian officials.\n\nThe military strategy behind Ukraine's counter-offensive remains unclear.\n\nIt also marks the first time since the Second World War that foreign armed forces have invaded Russian territory - a \"small propaganda victory\" if little else, in Marques' words.\n\n\"[The incursion] is perhaps a demonstration that Ukraine can still introduce dilemmas for Russia's dispositions in Ukraine, in the hope it lessens the number of Russian reinforcements heading for the push on Ukrainian lines in the east,\" says Marques tells Power Technology.\n\n\"However, Ukraine understands that damaging infrastructure, straining resources and bleeding time and attention are the only real benefits border raids can bring, and in that UKR should be careful with how it expends limited resources. Holding the line in the east is still extremely difficult and complicated at the moment.\"\n\nAll eyes now turn to an expectedly ferocious Russian retaliation on both Ukrainian forces in the Kursk

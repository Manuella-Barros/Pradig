In a video from the concert, Swift could be seen on stage performing the track \u201cCardigan\u201d off her 2020 album, Folklore. The \u201cShake It Off\u201d singer then appeared to smile as she spotted one couple share a special moment in the crowd at Murrayfield Stadium. \u201cI love performing this entire show in the sunlight, because I\u2019m pretty sure I just, like, saw somebody getting engaged over here,\u201d Swift said during the concert, according to a viral TikTok video shared by a fan. As the audience cheered, the 34-year-old pop star pointed to the couple and asked, \u201cDid it happen?\u201d The newly engaged couple seemingly confirmed the proposal, prompting Swift to raise her arms in the air and shout, \u201cYes!\u201d \u201cYou have no idea, I never get to see that, right? Because it\u2019s, like, dark usually at night,\u201d she explained to her fans. \u201cBut it\u2019s not right now so congratulations. Wow, I just saw that whole thing!\u201d Swift continued: \u201cThat\u2019s amazing. Thanks for doing that at my concert, that\u2019s a big moment \u2013 huge!\u201d The \u201cAnti-Hero\u201d singer performed her first of three shows in Scotland on Friday, where she also kept an eye out for fans who might have become dehydrated during the show. \u201cI\u2019m just gonna keep doing this until [security] know where I\u2019m looking at,\u201d she said, aiming her guitar to a spot in the crowd. Moments later, her hand froze during a rendition of \u201cWould\u2019ve, Could\u2019ve, Should\u2019ve\u201d and Swift had to wrestle with her cramp. \u201cThis is so embarrassing,\u201d she told fans. \u201cI must have done this a million times and my hand has never formed a claw before.\u201d Most recently, Swift shared a message of support for Lady Gaga after the fellow singer hit back at speculation that she was pregnant. In a video posted to TikTok, the \u201cPoker Face\u201d singer denied the pregnancy rumors while referring to a lyric from Swift\u2019s song, \u201cDown Bad\u201d. The text over the video read: \u201cNot pregnant \u2013 just down bad cryin\u2019 at the gym.\u201d The \u201cBad Romance\u201d singer then used the opportunity to encourage her US-based fans to register to vote in the forthcoming presidential election, taking place on November 4. \u201cRegister to vote or check if you\u2019re registered EASILY at www.headcount.org,\u201d she wrote in the caption. In response, Swift took to the comments of Gaga\u2019s TikTok video to also hit back at public scrutiny that women have faced. \u201cCan we all agree that it\u2019s invasive and irresponsible to comment on a woman\u2019s body,\u201d the \u201cCruel Summer\u201d singer wrote. \u201cGaga doesn\u2019t owe anyone an explanation and neither does any woman.\u201d", "summary": "<p>Taylor Swift was the first to congratulate a couple who got engaged at her Eras Tour concert in Edinburgh, Scotland.</p>", "url": "https://www.independent.ie/style/celebrity/celebrity-news/taylor-swift-congratulates-couple-who-got-engaged-at-edinburgh-concert/a1334207218.html", "image": "https://focus.independent.ie/thumbor/sEkkcZOJIqo0U4hf0drd-Wx5Y9A=/0x61:3053x2096/550x550/prod-mh-ireland/725e7fec-5248-44a6-9ec6-28d336baa923/5e79ef02-172b-4dea-a24e-ec67b9153aa7/725e7fec-5248-44a6-9ec6-28d336baa923.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 16:28:09", "author": "Meredith Clark", "authors": ["Meredith Clark"], "language": "en", "catgory": "entertainment", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": 0.002}

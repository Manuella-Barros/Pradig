The sale-of-a-business exception would permit non-compete clauses to ensure that the integrity and value of the acquired business would remain unaffected.

If and when the rule becomes effective, it will ban non-competes going forward. It will also prevent businesses from enforcing existing non-competes, with some limited exceptions for a narrowly defined class of senior executives with existing agreements. The rule also adopts an exception for the sale of businesses. Because the FTC rule will apply nationwide, it will preempt conflicting state laws. However, businesses must still comply with any applicable state statutes and common law limitations that may apply restrictions in addition to those provided by the FTC rule. For these reasons, businesses using restrictive covenants to protect their trade secrets or confidential information should prepare for a sea change.\n\nWhat Does the FTC Non-Compete Rule Prohibit?\n\nFirst, going forward, businesses will be prohibited from entering into, or attempting to enter into, a non-compete clause. Second, non-competes already in place will not be enforceable with two exceptions discussed below. Third, businesses will be prohibited from attempting to enforce a non-compete. Fourth, businesses cannot make representations that a worker is subject to a non-compete clause. The non-compete does not need to be found in a formal contract. Handbook policies and oral statements that impose these restrictions are also prohibited.\n\nThe rule prohibits traditional non-competes -- those that prevent workers from going to work for a competitor -- but it goes much further by adopting a functional test. The rule defines a \"non-compete clause\" as a term or condition of employment that prohibits a worker from, penalizes a worker for, or functions to prevent a worker from:\n\nThe FTC's final rule defines non-compete clauses to capture many other types of commonly used restrictive covenants such as:\n\nDoes the FTC Non-Compete Rule Contain Any Exceptions?\n\nThe rule contains four exceptions:\n\nNon-competes with \"Senior Executives\" that were entered into prior to the rule's effective date will remain unaffected. Non-competes will be banned going forward with these Senior Executives.\n\nFor the purposes of existing non-competes, \"Senior Executive\" is narrowly defined. First, the worker must have earned annual compensation in the preceding year exceeding $151,164. Second, the worker must hold a policy-making position with final authority to make policy decisions that control significant aspects of the business. Simply having the power to advise or exert influence over such policy decisions will not meet the definition. This means that the Senior Executive definition will only capture the President, CEO, and other corporate officers with equivalent policy-making authority over the business.\n\nThe FTC Rule does not apply to non-competes entered into by a person pursuant to a bona fide sale of a business entity, of the person's ownership interest in a business entity, or of all or substantially all of a business entity's operating assets. The FTC's prior proposal requiring that the ownership interest amount to at least 25 percent was not adopted in the final rule.\n\nNon-compete-related causes of action that accrued prior to the rule's effective date are not limited.\n\nThe FTC rule also states that it is not an unfair method of compensation to enforce or attempt to enforce a non-compete clause, or to make representations about a non-compete clause where a person has a good-faith basis to believe the FTC's rule does not apply.\n\nWhen Does the FTC Rule Become Effective?\n\nThe FTC rule was adopted on April 23, and will become effective 120 days after it is published in the Federal Register. But numerous federal lawsuits have already been filed seeking judicial review of the FTC's authority to promulgate the rule, and challenging the rule on other grounds. Some of these lawsuits ask the courts to prevent the FTC rule from becoming effective while the courts resolve the merits. It is difficult to predict how long the judicial process will take to decide the cases on their merits and resolve any appeals that may follow. We will continue to monitor these developments.\n\nWhat Is the Notice Required?\n\nThe FTC rule requires businesses to provide clear and conspicuous notice to workers with prohibited non-competes. The notice must be provided on or before the rule's effective date. Businesses will need to deliver the notice by hand, by mail, by e-mail, or by text message. The FTC has provided a sample notice that will provide a safe harbor to businesses that use it, but no specific language is required.\n\nWhat Are the Next Steps for Employers?\n\nBusinesses that have historically used non-compete agreements or other similar policies or restrictions should consider taking the following steps:", "source": {"uri": "mondaq.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mondaq Business Briefing"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-compete_clause", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Non-compete clause"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Trade Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covenant_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Covenant (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Legal person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_preemption", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal preemption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_secret", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trade secret"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Common law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidentiality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Confidentiality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cause_of_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cause of action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Register", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Register"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_review", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Judicial review"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_faith", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Good faith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Card_Games/Combining", "label": "dmoz/Games/Card Games/Combining", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Yahtzee", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Yahtzee", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Kites/Rules", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Kites/Rules", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Card_Games/Shedding_and_Accumulating", "label": "dmoz/Games/Card Games/Shedding and Accumulating", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Bluff", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Bluff", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://www.mondaq.com/images/Mondaq_Share.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549027", "eventUri": "eng-9549027", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-23", "textStart": 3701, "textEnd": 3709}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

On the over 26,000 comments FTC has received, it was detected that the vast majority supported the banning of non-compete agreements. After these influencing comments, on the 23 of April 2024, the FTC published its final order banning non-compete agreements for good.\n\nIn the final rule, the Commission deemed it unfair and a violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act for employers to establish or enforce certain non-compete agreements on their employees. FTC found that these agreements;\n\nThe FTC also discovered that employers have effective alternatives to non-compete agreements for protecting their investments, such as non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) to protect sensitive information, and over 95% of workers are already covered by NDAs.\n\nThe final rule bans all non-compete agreements from being done, for all workers, including senior executives after the effective date. For existing agreements, on the other hand, the FTC adopts a different approach for senior executives than for other workers. Accordingly, the FTC determined that existing non-competes can remain in force for senior executives (defined as workers who earn more than $151,164 annually and who are in a \"policy-making position.\") since they represent less than 0.75% of the market. Employers will also be required to provide notice to workers other than senior executives who are bound by an existing agreement that they will not be enforcing any agreements in the future. The FTC estimates that this ban will result in, reduced healthcare costs, new business formations, a rise in innovation, and higher worker earnings.\n\n(FTC decision, 23.04.2023)", "source": {"uri": "mondaq.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mondaq Business Briefing"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-compete_clause", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Non-compete clause"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Trade Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Non-disclosure agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Occupational_Health_and_Safety/Government_Agencies", "label": "dmoz/Health/Occupational Health and Safety/Government Agencies", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor-Management_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor-Management Relations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://www.mondaq.com/images/Mondaq_Share.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549027", "eventUri": "eng-9549027", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

If and when the rule becomes effective, it will ban non-competes going forward. It will also prevent businesses from enforcing existing non-competes, with some limited exceptions for a narrowly defined class of senior executives with existing agreements. The rule also adopts an exception for the sale of businesses. Because the FTC rule will apply nationwide, it will preempt conflicting state laws. However, businesses must still comply with any applicable state statutes and common law limitations that may apply restrictions in addition to those provided by the FTC rule. For these reasons, businesses using restrictive covenants to protect their trade secrets or confidential information should prepare for a sea change.\n\nFirst, going forward, businesses will be prohibited from entering into, or attempting to enter into, a non-compete clause. Second, non-competes already in place will not be enforceable with two exceptions discussed below. Third, businesses will be prohibited from attempting to enforce a non-compete. Fourth, businesses cannot make representations that a worker is subject to a non-compete clause. The non-compete does not need to be found in a formal contract. Handbook policies and oral statements that impose these restrictions are also prohibited.\n\nThe rule prohibits traditional non-competes -- those that prevent workers from going to work for a competitor -- but it goes much further by adopting a functional test. The rule defines a \"non-compete clause\" as a term or condition of employment that prohibits a worker from, penalizes a worker for, or functions to prevent a worker from:\n\nThe FTC's final rule defines non-compete clauses to capture many other types of commonly used restrictive covenants such as:\n\nThe rule contains four exceptions:\n\nNon-competes with \"Senior Executives\" that were entered into prior to the rule's effective date will remain unaffected. Non-competes will be banned going forward with these Senior Executives.\n\nFor the purposes of existing non-competes, \"Senior Executive\" is narrowly defined. First, the worker must have earned annual compensation in the preceding year exceeding $151,164. Second, the worker must hold a policy-making position with final authority to make policy decisions that control significant aspects of the business. Simply having the power to advise or exert influence over such policy decisions will not meet the definition. This means that the Senior Executive definition will only capture the President, CEO, and other corporate officers with equivalent policy-making authority over the business.\n\nThe FTC Rule does not apply to non-competes entered into by a person pursuant to a bona fide sale of a business entity, of the person's ownership interest in a business entity, or of all or substantially all of a business entity's operating assets. The FTC's prior proposal requiring that the ownership interest amount to at least 25 percent was not adopted in the final rule.\n\nNon-compete-related causes of action that accrued prior to the rule's effective date are not limited.\n\nThe FTC rule also states that it is not an unfair method of compensation to enforce or attempt to enforce a non-compete clause, or to make representations about a non-compete clause where a person has a good-faith basis to believe the FTC's rule does not apply.\n\nThe FTC rule was adopted on April 23, and will become effective 120 days after it is published in the Federal Register. But numerous federal lawsuits have already been filed seeking judicial review of the FTC's authority to promulgate the rule, and challenging the rule on other grounds. Some of these lawsuits ask the courts to prevent the FTC rule from becoming effective while the courts resolve the merits. It is difficult to predict how long the judicial process will take to decide the cases on their merits and resolve any appeals that may follow. We will continue to monitor these developments.\n\nThe FTC rule requires businesses to provide clear and conspicuous notice to workers with prohibited non-competes. The notice must be provided on or before the rule's effective date. Businesses will need to deliver the notice by hand, by mail, by e-mail, or by text message. The FTC has provided a sample notice that will provide a safe harbor to businesses that use it, but no specific language is required.\n\nBusinesses that have historically used non-compete agreements or other similar policies or restrictions should consider taking the following steps:", "source": {"uri": "mondaq.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mondaq Business Briefing"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-compete_clause", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Non-compete clause"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Trade Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covenant_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Covenant (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Legal person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_preemption", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal preemption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_secret", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trade secret"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Common law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidentiality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Confidentiality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cause_of_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cause of action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Register", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Register"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_review", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Judicial review"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_faith", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Good faith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property_Rights", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property Rights", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://www.mondaq.com/images/Mondaq_Share.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549027", "eventUri": "eng-9549027", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-23", "textStart": 3558, "textEnd": 3566}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

So what does this rule do, how does it affect the government services business and will the rule survive legal challenges?\n\nThe rule is fairly straightforward in that it imposes a national ban against all non-compete agreements with workers (employees, consultants, even interns) regardless of the worker's position, title or status and regardless of who hired the worker. The final rule takes effect 120 days from April 23 (around Aug. 25). FTC estimates the rule covers at least 101 million workers having some sort of non-compete agreement or similar provision in other agreements. (How FTC found this number since these agreements go largely unpublished is a mystery).\n\nIn short, the ban would retroactively invalidate tens of millions of existing non-compete agreements.\n\nThere are two limited exceptions to the new ban. The first is for \"senior executives\" defined as workers \"in a policy-making position\" earning at least $151,164 annually. The rule defines policy making as covering the president, CEO or another officer (such as VPs, CFOs, etc.) or anyone having \"policy making authority\" meaning final authority to make policy decisions beyond providing advice or even influencing those decisions. Think C Suite and 1-2 levels below. The term \"policy\" is not defined directly but it seems to cover almost any material decision made in the organization that affects its workers.\n\nFor senior executives meeting this standard, existing non-competes remain in force, but existing non-competes with other workers are not enforceable.\n\nThe second exception covers non-compete agreements executed as part of a transaction involving the sale of a business. The sale must be bona fide -- in plain English this means an actual sale involving independent parties. So forget about anything that might look like a sham deal just to evade the ban.\n\nTo avoid having to formally rescind existing non-compete agreements, the rule has a safe harbor provision allowing employers to only provide a \"clear and conspicuous\" notice to workers that such agreements are not valid. The rule even provides \"model language\" for this purpose.\n\nBut here's the problem (among others): the rule broadly defines a non-compete clause as one that \"penalizes\" a departing worker for or \"prevents\" the worker from \"seeking or accepting\" employment elsewhere or operating a business in the U.S. Potentially, that's virtually boundless coverage. In the government services business, I've seen just about every variety of non-competes, from the most stringent one preventing the departing worker from working anywhere else (what I call the \"off-the-street\" clause) to a middle ground approach that restricts working on the same government programs or tasks or with the same government customers in competition or conflict with the former employer (some of which may be reasonable), to a much lighter version preventing the worker only from disclosing confidential information to new employer in order to compete with the former employer (what I call the \"NDA-plus\" clause), and a few in between.\n\nCan all of these restrictions fall under the new FTC ban?\n\nI would say arguably yes and even if arguably not with the less stringent restrictions, workers may still use the ban's broad language to argue against clauses that don't at all prevent other employment opportunities but do serve a company's legitimate interests such as protecting the misappropriation of bid and proposal data, customer domain knowledge or other know-how to benefit another competitor looking to beat the incumbent on the follow-on contract.\n\nBesides, these clauses are already subject to scrutiny under state laws which mostly require a case-by-case review of the restriction's reasonableness. Conversely, the FTC rule is a straight ban.\n\nFor example, the off-the-street clause would very likely be invalid under the FTC ban but the same would apply under most state laws including the DC area (DC, VA, MD), and would certainly be invalid under the laws of California, North Dakota, Oklahoma and Minnesota which totally ban these clauses.\n\nThe FTC ban may very well cover the middle ground restriction if the worker shows or even argues persuasively that it prevents finding another job, especially with a worker's limited experience with one or a few agency customers. But the enforceability of that type or any type of non-compete clause under state laws not imposing a total ban may depend on a variety of factors. Even the NDA-plus restriction may be subject to the FTC ban because, after all the worker may argue, the NDA covers so much information that it may be impossible not to use some of it in a later job situation.\n\nAs stated, up to now these matters were decided at the state level, where courts have considered various circumstances to determine the enforceability of non-competes. In Virginia, for example, non-competes with employees are enforceable if an employer can show that the restriction (1) is narrowly tailored to protect the employer's legitimate business interest; (2) is not excessively severe or oppressive in restricting the employee's ability to find another job or make an income; and (3) doesn't violate a Virginia public policy.\n\nIn some cases, Virginia courts have validated non-competes meeting this test where the clause was narrow in scope and overall reasonable; in some cases not. Other states not imposing total or near-total bans have similar standards. Federal antitrust law also takes a similar approach used by, you guessed it, FTC in previously invalidating some non-competes.\n\nFurther, some states avoid outright bans but still restrict the scope of non-competes. For example, since July 2020, Virginia outlawed non-competes with \"low wage employees\" -- currently about $73,000 annually or about $1,400 per week. In any event, a determination of enforceability of these clauses, like with any contract, is -- as it should be -- on a case-by-case basis depending on the contractual terms and competing interests of the parties. But that matters not here since FTC is imposing a near total ban on non-competes regardless of the employer's legitimate business interest. And this ban would effectively supersede any inconsistent state law.\n\nAlso, the new rule is noticeable for what it doesn't include as an exception. For example, in this and many other types of businesses, non-senior executives routinely have non-compete agreements as part of a severance package where the employee leaves the organization with a boat-load of money in exchange for not competing with the former employer for a time period usually commensurate with or even more than the pay that time covers. Sometimes, it's entirely reasonable to use this method as part of a golden parachute arrangement. But not under the new FTC ban.\n\nOf course, the rule may be subject to additional White House scrutiny (fat chance since the president provoked this action in the first place by issuing an executive order) and GAO will set its hooks into it at some point, but that doesn't matter because as of this writing at least three federal lawsuits have been filed challenging the ban, two in Texas (what a surprise) and one in Pennsylvania.\n\nMore are likely to follow. Basically, the actions are looking to invalidate the rule because FTC doesn't have the statutory authority to pass this type of ban and invalidate thousands of private non-compete agreements (which as I said in many cases may be invalid anyway under various state laws), with one of the plaintiffs likening FTC's overreaching action as pulling \"an elephant out of a mousehole.\" The lawsuits also challenge the constitutionality of the ban.\n\nI'm not always a fan of non-competes, especially the off-the-street kind, but some may indeed be warranted under the circumstances and critical to a company's legitimate business interests (e.g., a really big severance payout or sale of a business interest). And in any event I'm attracted to the legal theories in these lawsuits. First, the principal basis used by FTC in addressing private non-compete clauses is its statutory authority to regulate and restrict \"unfair methods of competition\" and that non-compete clauses are competitively unfair basically because they are coercive-type agreements that burden interstate commerce and negatively affect competitive conditions in labor markets.\n\nBut do they?\n\nFTC claims these clauses demonstrably affect the opportunities of all workers and will materially reduce wages but provides no real support for this claim. In fact, in considering the rule, FTC admitted that the \"effect of an individual worker's non-compete clause on competition in a particular labor market may be marginal or may be impossible to discern statistically.\" So just out of the gate, it seems FTC doesn't even have its facts straight.\n\nSecond, Congress, in passing the Federal Trade Commission Act, and specifically Section 5 cited by FTC, allows FTC to regulate and enforce actions that constitute \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce,\" but I seriously doubt that even comes close to covering the ability of FTC to ban all non-compete arrangements between private parties. Federal agency actions are limited by what statutes issued by Congress actually authorize. I'd say the authority here seems slim at best. That poor elephant!\n\nWhatever the outcome, the new ban, if it sticks, will cause unwanted litigation and, at the very least, unnecessary legal squabbles requiring even more lawyers than you already need in this heavily regulated business.\n\nStay safe.", "source": {"uri": "washingtontechnology.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Technology"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Opinions expressed are those of the author.\n\nJason Leverant serves as the President and Chief Operating Officer of the AtWork Group, an award-winning national staffing firm.\n\nA new rule by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has the potential to streamline hiring for business services franchises and prompt employers to continue to focus on employee engagement.\n\nDuring my tenure in the staffing industry, I have had to navigate countless employment contracts. Overall, I find that non-compete agreements can pigeonhole employees and potentially make it difficult for individuals to progress on their career paths.\n\nBelow, I'd like to discuss the implications of this recent ruling and offer practical tips for businesses to navigate these changes.\n\nThe FTC recently made a final ruling to ban employers from using non-compete clauses as part of their worker's contracts. The FTC claims using non-compete clauses is an \"exploitative practice that suppresses wages, hampers innovation, and blocks entrepreneurs from starting new businesses.\"\n\nThe FTC believes the new rule could help bolster wages by up to $300 billion per year and expand career opportunities for 30 million workers. Businesses often rely on non-compete agreements to protect trade secrets, limit employee turnover and stay ahead of the competition. A non-compete clause in an employment contract prevents a worker from competing with their employer after they leave the company for a specified period of time.\n\nSome non-compete agreements may have geographic restrictions that prevent former employees from working in certain locations. About 18% of workers had non-compete agreements, according to a study conducted by the U.S. Government Accountability Office. Although the new rule only applies to \"workers,\" the International Franchise Association encouraged the FTC to reject any future bans on non-compete clauses in franchising agreements.\n\nThe FTC's new rule is not the only effort to improve workers' rights. States such as California, Colorado, Minnesota, North Dakota and Oklahoma all have laws banning non-competes. And other states have restrictions on non-competes based on annual salary. Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut introduced the Workforce Mobility Act in 2023 prohibiting commercial businesses from relying on non-competes under certain circumstances.\n\nWhile non-competes remain an important component of my company's franchise agreements, we moved from requiring non-competes to non-solicitation and confidentiality agreements for employees. A non-solicitation agreement protects its clients and customers but does not prevent an employee from finding a new role in the staffing industry. It allows workers to spread their wings without hampering your business model.\n\nI've found that eliminating non-compete agreements can enable your business to secure highly skilled employees. Having employees with experience in an industry enables owners to focus on scaling their business while employees manage day-to-day operations.\n\nFor example, one of the franchise owners within my group has locations in California, Missouri and Florida. Hiring managers with staffing experience enables each of the franchisee's locations to achieve its targets.\n\nIn the wake of the FTC's ruling and the move by many states to ban non-competes, businesses need to proactively take steps to comply with evolving guidelines. Staying at the forefront of employee contract changes will help improve both talent acquisition and employee retention and protect your business. Here are some of my tips.\n\n1. Modify employment contracts. The first step businesses can take is to drop non-compete clauses from their employment contracts. Employees will welcome the increase in flexibility and admire your proactive initiative.\n\n2. Focus on employee retention. Gallup reports one in two employees say they are open to leaving their current job. Ramping up employee engagement can stem attrition from modified employment contracts. Ensuring you offer competitive salaries, comprehensive benefits packages and workplace flexibility can help improve employee engagement.\n\n3. Create a positive workplace culture. Adults spend one-third of their lives at work. Having a positive culture gives employees a sense of belonging and can facilitate long-term job satisfaction.\n\n4. Enforce your agreements. Allowing your workers to leave and explore new opportunities as they see fit is important, but do not hesitate to enforce your non-solicitation and confidentiality agreements when they are violated. Building relationships with your customers and clients takes time, and your intellectual property is valuable. Enforcing employment contracts protects your existing employees and your business.\n\nYoung Baby Boomers held an average of 12.7 jobs between the ages of 18 and 56. Staying at a single company for an entire career is no longer the norm, for today's employees are always open to exploring new opportunities. Adapting to give workers flexibility can help improve employee retention and ensure your business continues to flourish.\n\nForbes Business Council is the foremost growth and networking organization for business owners and leaders.

The rule would render unenforceable a broad array of employment-based non-competition agreements. It would also require that employers provide notice to workers that certain non-competition agreements already entered into will not be and cannot be enforced. Not surprisingly, before the weekend, at least three different lawsuits had been initiated challenging the validity of the FTC's final rule as adopted. For firms engaged in M&A activity, investors and their advisors, they should carefully track whether the rule is struck down as it may impact standard buyer protection strategies with key employees of the target.\n\nWhat the Rule Says\n\nThe core of the rule is found in 16 CFR 910.2(a), which states that it is an unfair method of competition under the Federal Trade Commission Act for an employer to enter into, attempt to enter into, enforce or attempt to enforce a non-compete clause against a worker. The term \"worker\" is defined as a natural person who works for the employer and the term expressly includes independent contractors. The term \"non-compete clause\" is defined very broadly as a term or condition of employment that prohibits a worker from, penalizes a worker for, or functions to prevent a worker from, seeking or accepting employment after conclusion of employment or from operating a business in the United States after conclusion of employment. Workers defined as \"senior executives\" are treated differently: while it is still an unfair method of competition to enter into a non-competition agreement with a senior executive after the effective date of the rule, employers are permitted to enforce non-compete clauses entered into with a senior executive before the effective date of the rule.\n\nLimited Impact in M&A\n\nAs a general matter, the FTC's final rule does not apply to non-compete arrangements entered into by a person pursuant to a bona fide sale of a business entity, sale of the person's ownership interest in the business entity or sale of all or substantially all the assets of a business entity's operating assets. 16 C.F.R. \u00a7 910.3(a). The language of the rule is unclear whether \"sale of a business entity\" requires sale of 100% of the interests in the business entity or whether a smaller stake, perhaps a mere majority interest, is sufficient to qualify as a \"sale of a business entity\". Despite this ambiguity, firms engaged in M&A activity can expect that non-compete clauses will continue to be enforceable against sellers of business entities, at least, in the regular course, which among other things allows for allocation of purchase price to the non-compete for tax purposes. Seasoned corporate practitioners may raise an eyebrow to the use of the term \"bona fide\" in describing the exemption from the rule. Ostensibly the FTC seeks to limit employers from engaging in a \"sham transaction\" of a business interest to secure the benefit of the exemption in the proposed rule Buyers of businesses will need to undertake due diligence around the enforceability of non-compete clauses purporting to bind key employees of the target company; some of those non-compete clauses may have been rendered unenforceable and constitute violations of the new rule. .\n\nMajor Impact in Capital Markets\n\nWhile the FTC's final rule may be of modest impact to those engaged in M&A work, those engaged in deploying growth capital will have a more complicated road ahead in connection with the FTC's new rule. There is no exemption for non-compete clauses entered into as a condition for investing capital into early stage and growth companies. While sales of businesses are priced on established multiples or other well-understood pricing mechanisms, venture capital investors, private equity investors deploying growth equity, and other capital providers often find themselves betting on a prospective portfolio company's management team to execute on business plans and pro forma projections. Accordingly, the human capital risk is heightened, and in the absence of a secondary liquidation of equity interests of the management team, investors who usually condition their capital on the management team members entering into non-compete arrangements will find that this tool is no longer available to them when it comes time to protect their investment\n\nA Reprieve for Non-Competes with Senior Executives\n\nIn a change from the FTC's initial proposed rule, the final rule does not impact existing non-compete arrangements with \"senior executives\" who meet certain duty and remuneration thresholds, but this is not a solution for prospective non-compete arrangements with senior executives after the effective date. 16 C.F.R. \u00a7 910.1.\n\nNear Term Mitigations\n\nWhile venture capital and private equity investors will invariably be waiting to see how the litigation filed immediately on the heels of the FTC's announcement shakes out, it is perhaps more important than ever to begin considering whether transaction terms protect capital providers.\n\nA Need for Vigilance and New Thinking\n\nBroader in title than it is in fact, the FTC's final rule on non-competes certainly gives rise to concern for those engaged in corporate transactional matters and more for those involved in emerging growth and middle-market capital formation. For capital providers the specter of allocating capital to an issuer or borrower who subsequently loses some or all its differentiating operating team is real.\n\nPerhaps more than ever before, financial incentives for retention, perfection of intellectual property rights, and culture must be revisited and enhanced.", "source": {"uri": "mondaq.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mondaq Business Briefing"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Legal person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-compete_clause", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Non-compete clause"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mergers_and_acquisitions", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mergers and acquisitions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Trade Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission_Act_of_1914", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_Federal_Regulations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Code of Federal Regulations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_governance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corporate governance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injunction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Injunction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Venture capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Natural person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_faith", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Good faith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_equity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Private equity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Employment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Growth capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remuneration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Remuneration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liquidation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intellectual property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debtor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Debtor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_forma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro forma"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Venture_Capital", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Venture Capital", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Card_Games/Combining", "label": "dmoz/Games/Card Games/Combining", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Yahtzee", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Yahtzee", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Kites/Rules", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Kites/Rules", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Bluff", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Bluff", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.mondaq.com/images/Mondaq_Share.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549027", "eventUri": "eng-9549027", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

(April 29, 2024) - On April 23, 2024, the Federal Trade Commission decided by a 3 to 2 vote to approve regulations that would ban most non-compete clauses for employees. This regulation may affect more than 30 million contracts. Specifically, the Commission determined it is an unfair method of competition, and therefore a violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act, for employers to enter into non-compete agreements with workers and to enforce those agreements. If implemented as passed by the FTC, this regulation would not only nullify most existing non-compete agreements, but also expose employers who seek to enforce such agreements to significant penalties.\n\nThe final rule is scheduled to become effective 120 days after publication in the Federal Register. However, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and others have already sued, arguing the FTC lacks authority to issue such a rule. It is possible one or more courts could issue preliminary injunctions staying implementation of the Rule.\n\nIf the Rule takes effect, it will apply only to for-profit businesses, which will be prohibited from enforcing existing non-compete agreements against their employees other than senior executives. A senior executive is defined as a person earning more than $151,164 annually who has policymaking responsibilities. The Rule also bans employers from imposing new non-compete contracts on senior executives in the future. The rule requires employers to notify current and past employees that existing non-compete provisions will not be enforced.\n\nAdditionally, the FTC Rule would ban all employment contract provisions that create \"functional\" non-compete clauses; i.e. any contractual clause that may have the \"effect\" of prohibiting workers from seeking or accepting other employment. The Rule purports to supersede all contrary state laws governing non-compete agreements applicable to employees.\n\nNotwithstanding the Rule's extremely broad reach, there are some exceptions. For example, employers may continue to prohibit employees from competing during their employment. Additionally, the Rule does not appear to extend to non-solicitation provisions. Importantly, certain industries have been exempted from the Rule, including non-profit healthcare employees, air carriers, and banks and credit unions. The Rule permits limited use of non-compete agreements between franchisees and franchisors.\n\nFinally, the Rule does not apply to contractual provisions that restrict the sellers of a business from competing with their former businesses. Nevertheless, the Rule will apply to, and therefore ban, non-compete agreements that employees - as opposed to business owners - may have been required to execute as part of a merger or acquisition.\n\nIt is anticipated that, to ensure compliance with the Rule if it goes into effect, employers will look to the provisions of employment agreements already in use in states such as California, where non-competes have long been unenforceable. As an alternative to non-compete provisions, employers may have to look to trade secret laws - including the federal Defend Trade Secrets Act - as well as confidentiality and return of property provisions to protect proprietary and other sensitive information and preserve good will.\n\nIf the FTC Rule becomes effective in its current form, it will constitute a substantial change in the ability of employers to use contracts to protect their confidential business information and goodwill. However, it is far from clear when or if the Rule will ever be implemented.

Within hours, a Texas firm sued to block the rule, and the following day, the US Chamber of Commerce, a business lobby, sued as well.\n\nBut the FTC's rule is based on a mountain of empirical evidence showing that non-compete clauses harm workers, consumers, innovation, and employee mobility. Moreover, they are already regulated in most states, and banned in a few - including California, home of Silicon Valley, the single most innovative place in the world.\n\nBusinesses argue that they need non-compete clauses to prevent employees from stealing proprietary information. Suppose a distributor has compiled a list of customers after years of outreach. An employee may be tempted to take the list to another firm and, for a higher wage, use it to poach customers from their previous employer. Businesses also argue that non-compete clauses protect investments in training. Suppose a firm teaches new employees how to use accounting software. If the employees can immediately move to another firm, they can obtain a higher wage because they require no training at the firm that hires them.\n\nBut neither theory actually justifies enforcement of non-competes. Strict laws protect firms' trade secrets without preventing people from switching jobs when they need to. An Uber executive who had worked at Google was sent to jail for using Google trade secrets to benefit his new employer. And natural labor-market frictions prevent employers from losing investments in training. It is costly and inconvenient for most employees to switch jobs, and firms can require employees to agree to pay back the cost of training if they leave the job before the firm has recovered its investment.\n\nEven if non-competes can be justified in rare cases involving special circumstances, they cause significant hardship for workers. Suppose a New York City doctor with a non-compete wants to switch to another employer, because working conditions have been degraded, wages have stagnated, he was passed over for promotion, or the hospital chose to emphasise medical services that he believes are immoral or unwise. If subject to a non-compete clause, he must either take a vacation or work as a barista for a year or two while waiting for the restriction to expire; or he must uproot his family and move to a city or state that is beyond the geographic boundaries of the non-compete. Most people are unable to do these things.\n\nA common response is that the doctor freely agreed to the non-compete, may have been paid a higher wage because of it, and thus should not complain now that things worked out badly. But many employees do not even know that they are subject to a non-compete; and among those who \"voluntarily\" agree to it as a condition of being hired, few may understand what it means, or realise that it may be illegal.\n\nAfter all, non-compete clauses are often boilerplate in long employment contracts, or they are presented to employees only after they join a firm and have lost their power to negotiate. Many non-competes are written vaguely and broadly, with some prohibiting not only post-employment competition but even the act of looking for a job with a competitor during that period.\n\nMoreover, non-competes interfere with labor markets. Job mobility is essential to the economy's health. Workers need to be able to move to wherever they are most productive, and to be able to change jobs in response to changing economic conditions. When a worker is bound by a non-compete clause, even if she is well paid for agreeing to it, she will be unable to work for a competing employer who values her work more. Many new firms will not be able to enter the market because they cannot find employees who are free to move to a new job. The forgone labor productivity results in higher prices, harming consumers.\n\nNeither of these problems would loom large if non-competes were used responsibly. But they are not. Because firms, under existing law, pay no penalty for using overly broad non-competes, they have imposed them on employees with alacrity. One survey of workers in 2017 found that 18% - implying tens of millions of people across the US economy - were bound by these provisions. Another estimated that the figure could be as high as 46.5%. Millions of low-wage workers performing low-skill tasks are subject to the same restrictions.\n\nAnd those restrictions harm workers by reducing not only their employment opportunities, but also their wages. One study, for example, shows that when Hawaii banned non-competes for tech workers in 2015, their wages increased relative to those of other workers in Hawaii and to tech workers in other states. Moreover, the ban also promoted business formation.\n\nAnother study of all US private-sector workers shows that wages are higher in states that ban or strictly limit non-compete clauses than in those that impose weaker limits on them. A study of a ban on non-compete clauses for low-wage workers in Oregon showed that it increased both wages and mobility.\n\nSome studies come to more mixed conclusions. For example, a 2020 study finds that non-compete provisions are associated with higher earnings for physicians; but the provisions are also known to cause higher prices for medical services. Another study shows that non-competes increase wages for highly compensated executives, but cause broader social harm by preventing more productive firms from hiring them away.\n\nThe FTC's 570-page commentary on its ban discusses these and other studies with great care, far exceeding the evidentiary threshold that courts require for approving new regulations. Business interests thus have argued that the FTC lacks the statutory authority to issue such a rule, regardless of its benefits. While that contention has been rejected by courts in the past, the ban's challengers brought their case in the notoriously conservative Fifth Circuit, and the conservative majority on the Supreme Court has already signaled its own distrust of broad agency regulations.\n\nStill, there is reason for optimism. With growing awareness of abuse in labor markets, and given the FTC's careful marshaling of the evidence, the courts may well wave this one through.\n\nEric Posner, a professor at the University of

The day after the FTC's announcement, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other business groups filed suit in federal court in Tyler, Texas, to block the rule, saying the FTC lacks proper authority and that the rule is overly broad. Non-competes are essential to protecting company intellectual property, the groups say, but that is something the FTC believes could be just as effectively addressed by non-disclosure agreements and by relying on trade secret laws.\n\nThe impact of the ban would affect millions of workers and their employers. In 2019, the Economic Policy Institute estimated that between 28% and 47% of private-sector workers were subject to non-competes, meaning that between 36 million and 60 million - out of approximately 129 million workers - were subject to non-compete agreements. According to the Chamber of Commerce, \"tens of millions\" of employment agreements would be affected by the rule. The FTC predicts several positive outcomes from the ban:\n\nBusiness Groups Question FTC Authority, Fairness\n\nIn their April 24 complaint, the Chamber of Commerce and other groups argue that the rule is unlawful (Chamber of Commerce, et al. v. FTC, et al., E.D. Texas, Tyler Div., No. 6:24-cv-00148). They say:\n\nFurther, the business groups note how much companies invest in training and developing employees. Non-compete agreements protect those investments. They reiterate the need to guard proprietary information and how states already limit the extent to which employers can restrict their employees.\n\nThis isn't the first time federal competition law enforcers have targeted a merger for its potential adverse impact on a labor market, but the first time wasn't long ago. Former FTC official John Newman told Axios that the proposed merger of publishing goliaths Penguin Random House and Simon & Schuster concerned the Department of Antitrust Division for its impact on authors. Fewer publishers bidding on books would have meant less money for authors, the government argued. The DOJ prevailed in court in 2021 and the deal was called off. \"It was the first-ever merger challenge that defined a market focused on labor, instead of a product market for consumers,\" Newman told Axios. More recently, he noted the FTC's February lawsuit to block supermarket giant Kroger's $24.6 billion acquisition of Albertsons because it would diminish competition for unionized grocery workers.\n\nNot a radical concept\n\nRestricting the use of non-compete clauses is not as extreme as it may seem. In California, for example, non-compete clauses are virtually unenforceable. Aligning the states on this issue would benefit workers, who are increasingly mobile, and businesses, who would only need to comply with a single federal policy rather than navigating a patchwork of state laws.\n\nThe negative impact of non-compete clauses is clear; they harm workers and competition in the labor market. In regions where there are only a few employers, for example, workers have less opportunity to bargain for higher wages and better workplaces.\n\nFurther, industry consolidation is believed to be a strong wage suppressant. This is most plain in the healthcare sector, which employs 22 million people. Two-thirds of hospitals are part of larger systems, and 80% of hospital markets are considered highly consolidated.\n\nDarbin Wofford, Senior Health Policy Advisor at the Third Way think tank, writes, \"A consolidated health care market leaves those workers with fewer employers to choose from in their geographic area. This lack of competition allows for greater control of wages by the hospital system.\"\n\nConsolidation and undue restrictions hit employees with a one-two punch.\n\nCertainly, as businesses say, protecting confidential information and trade secrets is important and necessary to encourage innovation. But as California employers already know, there are alternatives to businesses who are no longer able to enforce broad non-competes, such as relying on trade secret laws and non-disclosure agreements.\n\nWhile businesses have complained that banning non-competes will increase poaching and wages, suppressing worker mobility and worker income are not good outcomes for anyone. In a competitive labor market where workers are mobile, employers must pay competitive wages, provide good benefits, and ensure job satisfaction. Non-compete clauses undermine those important benefits, especially in consolidated markets.", "source": {"uri": "mondaq.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mondaq Business Briefing"}, "authors": [],

On April 23, 2024, the FTC issued a long-awaited final rule aimed at banning nearly all non-compete agreements across the country. The sweeping rule caused a tremendous stir in the business and legal communities and received coverage by many major news outlets including NPR, the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. The buzz surrounding the rule is hardly surprising; when it takes effect, the rule will cause a massive shift in how businesses can structure their relationships with their employees and other businesses. This shift will be particularly acute in states that generally permit reasonable non-competes, like Utah. Any companies and employers who currently rely on non-competes in their business relationships should keenly watch any developments affecting the FTC's final rule, including those discussed below.\n\nStates have used various definitions to delineate what constitutes a non-compete, but at their most basic, a non-compete is a contract provision that restricts a person's ability to work. While many states currently allow non-competes, most states require that a non-compete be tailored to protect an employer's legitimate business interest; it cannot be solely aimed at prohibiting competition between businesses. For example, many states consider protection of trade secrets a legitimate business interest that can support a non-compete. In addition to a legitimate business interest, many states have requirements for the types of restrictions a non-compete may impose on a person. For instance, in Utah, a non-compete may not restrict an employee from working for a new employer for a period of more than one year. Though states differ in how they define and enforce non-competes, as more fully explained below, the FTC's final rule's definition of a non-compete clause is extremely broad and likely captures the non-compete agreements some states currently allow.\n\nThe FTC's final rule has several key provisions that businesses should be aware of:\n\nDefinition of a \"Non-Compete Clause\"\n\nFirst, the FTC's final rule defines a \"non-compete clause\" as:\n\nA term or condition of employment that prohibits a worker from, penalizes a worker for, or functions to prevent a worker from:\n\nImportantly, the final rule's definition of a non-compete does not explicitly encompass other types of restrictive covenants, like non-disclosure agreements or non-solicitation agreements. Though it would depend on their specific terms, these other types of restrictive covenants may not be encompassed by the FTC's final rule.\n\nUnfair Methods of Competition\n\nSecond, the FTC's final rule states that it is an unfair method of competition for a person:\n\nThis provision of the final rule not only prohibits employers from entering into new non-competes but also prohibits them from enforcing existing non-competes. This provision has a small carve-out for \"senior executives,\" or employees who are in a \"policy-making position\" and earn at least $151,164 in annual compensation. While employers will not be able to enter into new non-competes with these senior executives, their existing non-competes will remain enforceable, even after the final rule goes into effect.\n\nExceptions to the Final Rule\n\nFinally, the FTC's final rule contains a few limited exceptions under which it does not void non-competes. For example, the final rule does not apply to non-competes that are entered into in association with the sale of a business entity or a person's ownership interest in a business entity. The final rule also does not apply to legal claims based on non-competes that accrue before the final rule goes into effect.\n\nThe final rule will not go into effect until 120 days after it is published in the Federal Register, which is scheduled to take place on May 7, 2024. However, there have been several developments that may delay the date on which the final rule is published or given effect. For example, on April 24, 2024, the United States Chamber of Commerce and others sued the FTC in a Texas federal court, asking that the final rule be held unlawful and set aside. On the same day the Chamber of Commerce filed its lawsuit, it filed a \"Motion for Stay of Effective Date and Preliminary Injunction\" asking the Texas court to suspend the effective date of the final rule and/or stop enforcement of the rule. As of the date of this article, the Texas court has not issued an order on the Chamber of Commerce's Motion, but if the Court grants the motion, it may forestall the date on which the final rule goes into effect.\n\nThe FTC's final rule presents a substantial change in how businesses may configure their business relationships.

The FTC freed an estimated 30 million employees who are now bound to their current employers through non-compete clauses. On a 3-2 vote, the commission found that the clauses are an unfair method of competition and therefore a violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act which prohibits \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.\"\n\nThere's an exemption for senior executives in policymaking positions earning more than $151,164 a year, but those represent fewer than 1% of all workers now bound by a non-compete clause, and will phase out once current employees leave their jobs.\n\nIn a press release announcing the rule change, the FTC notes that employees with inside knowledge of company secrets are already bound by trade secret laws and non-disclosure agreements. And, they represent a small fraction of all workers now under non-compete clauses.\n\nThe FTC argues the non-compete clauses are not only bad for workers, who are forced to stay in jobs they don't want or risk costly litigation, they also stifle competition and inhibit the creation of new businesses, leading to increased market concentration and, ultimately, higher prices for consumers.\n\n\"The FTC's final rule that bans non-competes will ensure Americans have the freedom to pursue a new job, start a new business or bring a new idea to market,\" FTC Chair Lina M. Khan said in a prepared statement.\n\nAccording to a 2019 report by the Economic Policy Institute, a national survey of private-sector businesses showed that 49.4% had at least some employees who were subject to non-compete clauses and 31.8% said all employees were required to enter into the agreement.\n\nThat number had grown significantly since their previous survey in 2014.

Announced on April 23, 2024, following a 3-2 vote by the FTC Commissioners, the rule represents a significant policy shift aimed at increasing market competition and employee mobility. Scheduled to take effect on August 21, 2024, the rule prohibits the use of non-compete clauses in employment contracts, marking a fundamental shift in how companies could protect their competitive interests. The rule applies nationwide and preempts conflicting state laws. Importantly, the FTC indicates other common covenants such as non-disclosure obligations, non-solicitation obligations, and/or clawback provisions (e.g., training repayment agreement provisions (TRAPs)) may still be permissible. This regulatory update is poised to reshape strategies concerning intellectual property (IP) and trade secret management, as well as employee development & retention, compelling businesses to adapt to a landscape where traditional restrictive covenants are no longer enforceable.\n\nAvailable Strategic IP Alternatives in the Wake of the Rule\n\nNon-disclosure obligations, non-solicitation clauses, and clawback provisions have traditionally been used in conjunction with non-compete clauses. Now such provisions may have added importance to protecting proprietary information or function as quasi-alternatives to non-competes. In the wake of the FTC's ban, businesses must explore alternative approaches to protect their investments while aligning with evolving regulatory standards and fostering a conducive work environment.\n\nThe FTC's ruling could have profound implications for how companies manage their intellectual property and trade secrets. Historically, non-compete agreements have been pivotal in helping employers safeguard their business interests, including sensitive information, key developmental areas, and trade secrets, by restricting employees' activities after their employment ends. The primary aim has been to prevent employees from potentially transferring critical information to direct competitors or becoming a competitor themselves. However, with the new FTC rule coming into force, companies may need to increasingly rely on alternative legal mechanisms, such as patents and trade secrets, and do so in timely fashion, to maintain their competitive edge.\n\nIncreasing Reliance on Patent Protection:\n\nTraditionally, non-compete agreements were utilized by businesses to complement their patent portfolios, serving as an additional layer of protection against competitors seeking to exploit similar technologies or innovations. With the new rule, companies may want to consider the strategic use of patents, and the timing advantages afforded by patent strategies, in order to safeguard their intellectual property assets. Patents provide a robust, legally enforceable right to exclude others from exploiting an invention, offering a layer of protection that does not rely on an employee's adherence to contractual post-employment restrictions. This protection can last up to 20 years -- far outliving the historically acceptable time periods for non-compete agreements. Filing decision and timing may be a critical update to many corporation's filing strategies.\n\nConfirming Assignment & Non-Disclosure Obligations:\n\nTypically, employment agreements require employees to assign their inventive endeavors to the corporation. Thus, taking advantage of patent filings during the employee's tenure may result in a shift in timing, and an increase in overall patent filings as businesses strive to secure extensive protections for their innovations. Further, employment agreements can include provisions that require the employee assist the prior employer with procuring patents, or other intellectual property rights. Research supports this notion, suggesting that decreasing the enforceability of non-competes significantly boosts the number of patents filed, with the value of patents relative to firm assets increasing by about 31% when non-compete enforceability decreases (Zhaozhao He, 2023).\n\nNon-disclosure obligations are also a very common clause of many employment agreements and protect proprietary information and provide a measure of recourse for misuse. These obligations remain a vital tool for safeguarding proprietary information and trade secrets. They serve as a crucial barrier against intellectual property theft and competitive disadvantage by requiring employees, contractors, and business partners to adhere to confidentiality obligations. In the absence of non-compete agreements, these obligations take on added significance, providing businesses with a means to maintain a competitive edge while fostering innovation and trust within their workforce.\n\nBusinesses may want to revisit current non-disclosure and assignment clauses given their greater importance moving forward to ensure they are effective, appropriately tailored, and resistant to legal attacks.\n\nEnhancing Trade Secrets Protocols:\n\nIn view of the rule, corporations also may turn to more aggressively identifying and safeguarding trade secrets, as the rule may fundamentally alter the landscape of legal disputes surrounding proprietary information. Traditionally, non-compete agreements have been a cornerstone of trade secret protection strategies, providing employers with a legal mechanism to prevent former employees from joining competitors and misusing the trade secrets.\n\nCompanies might enhance their focus on internal security measures and robust confidentiality and other restrictive covenants to properly safeguard trade secrets. Ensuring that trade secrets and proprietary knowledge remain protected under the Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA) and state laws will require more stringent access controls, employee training, and potentially, more aggressive legal actions against breaches. The new landscape may necessitate bolstering permitted restrictive covenants that do not overreach in scope and duration yet provide effective protection for sensitive business information. As part of this, employers are cautioned to be more diligent in identifying trade secrets early in the process, so they can be properly protected as such in the event a key employee leaves the company.\n\nUtilizing Non-Solicitation Clauses:\n\nNon-solicitation covenants also remain a valuable means of safeguarding proprietary information and preserving business relationships. Non-solicitation agreements, which prohibit employees from soliciting clients, customers, or other employees of their former employer for a specified period after leaving the company, play a crucial role in preventing unfair competition and preserving client goodwill. By preventing departing employees from poaching valuable clients or skilled colleagues, non-solicitation agreements help businesses maintain continuity in their operations and protect the investments made in building customer relationships and nurturing talent. In the absence of non-compete agreements, non-solicitation agreements become even more critical for businesses seeking to protect their proprietary information and preserve their competitive advantage in the marketplace. Non-disclosure and non-solicitation covenants may often be used in together for greater protection.\n\nCompanies may want to revisit non-solicitation clauses to ensure they are not overly broad such that they function to prevent workers from seeking or accepting work, or operating a business to bolster their enforceability after the FTC ban takes effect.\n\nPotential Challenges and Strategic Considerations\n\nThe shift away from the enforceability of non-compete agreements also raises questions about the balance between promoting competition and fostering innovation and protecting proprietary information. While increased employee mobility can indeed lead to a more dynamic exchange of ideas and innovation, it also poses risks of inadvertent or intentional disclosure of proprietary information. Companies will need to navigate these waters carefully with the tools available.\n\nMoreover, the enforcement of IP rights and confidentiality agreements will likely become more contentious, as companies adjust to the new norm and test the boundaries of legal protections in place of non-competes. This may lead to an increase in litigation as businesses more vigorously defend their IP assets and trade secrets, as well as NDA's and confidentiality agreements, in the absence of non-compete clauses.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe FTC's ban on non-compete agreements is set to reshape the competitive landscape, prompting companies to reassess and strengthen their IP and trade secret strategies when it comes to employees. While this change is poised to boost innovation and worker mobility, it also compels businesses to enhance their reliance on timely patent strategies and meticulous management of trade secrets, ensuring they remain competitive within an increasingly open market.", "source": {"uri": "mondaq.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mondaq Business Briefing"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covenant_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Covenant (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_secret", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trade secret"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Employment contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-compete_clause", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Non-compete clause"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Trade Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Intellectual property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_preemption", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal preemption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Competition (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procurement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Procurement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidentiality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Confidentiality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_norm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social norm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defend_Trade_Secrets_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defend Trade Secrets Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketplace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marketplace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Non-disclosure agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-competitive_practices", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-competitive practices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Competitive advantage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business intelligence"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Services", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Employee_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Employee Relations", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Associations", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.mondaq.com/images/Mondaq_Share.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549027", "eventUri": "eng-9549027", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

On Tuesday, April 23, 2024, however, the Federal Trade Commission publicly announced a long-anticipated rule banning non-compete agreements, claiming that such agreements restrict worker freedoms, suppress worker wages, and harm competition. The rule will ban all future non-compete agreements as an unfair method of competition. Existing non-competes would be deemed not enforceable, except for those impacting \"senior executives,\" defined as workers earning more than $151,164 who are in a \"policy-making position.\"\n\nThe rule is scheduled to take effect as early as late August. Extensive litigation is expected around this rule, and at least one challenge was filed in federal court the same day that the rule was announced. Although it is possible the FTC's rule will be struck down someday, businesses currently relying on non-compete agreements to protect their trade secret and confidential information face the risk that this rule will take effect. Barring court action striking down the rule, the FTC's recent action will require many businesses to reassess their protection strategies for company trade secret and confidential information.\n\nThe FTC's comments regarding its new rule acknowledge concerns that the elimination of non compete agreements could impact the protection of confidential information. In some (but not all) states, a business could rely on a non-compete agreement with an employee to act as a blanket protection from the unauthorized use of trade secret or confidential information if the employee would leave the company. The reasoning is that such information is effectively protected because the employee cannot move to other employment in which the information may be used to the detriment of the past employer.\n\nThe articulated concern underlying the FTC's rule is that non-competition agreements unnecessarily restrict more activity than necessary to achieve the protection of confidential or trade secret information. The FTC has also estimated that banning non-competes will have substantial positive effects for \"workers, businesses, and the economy,\" including an estimated 17,000-29,000 more patents each year, increased start-ups, reduced healthcare costs, and higher wages for certain employees. In justifying the proposed rule, the FTC has asserted that employers have alternative strategies to protect confidential or trade secret information, namely trade secret and contract law involving non-disclosure agreements. In view of this expectation underpinning the FTC rule, employers should consider reassessing their protection efforts and focus to prevent unauthorized movement of information rather than the movement of employees who may have access to such information.\n\nLegal strategies employing trade secret law (via the federal Defend Trade Secrets Act or state implementations of the Uniform Trade Secrets Act) to protect proprietary information are largely unaffected by the FTC rule. In view of the FTC's attempt to ban non-compete agreements, companies should assess whether their remaining efforts to protect information are sufficient to meet or exceed the \"reasonable measures under the circumstances\" that those statutes require. Failing to do so could result in a finding, when asserting the alleged trade secrets, that the unimplemented measures demonstrate the company did not take \"reasonable measures\" to protect its trade secrets. Such a finding could result in a misappropriating employee -- and their new employer -- escaping with no liability at all.\n\nSuccessfully assessing and systematizing trade secret protection is more easily achievable with a plan. While not required as part of reasonable measures to protect a trade secret, planning may be useful to inform present employees of the protected confidential information and steps taken to protect that information, as well as to provide future employees historical context of the information's protection. Additional steps for protecting confidential information may be tailored to the specific nature of a company's trade secrets and to the geographic areas in which the company does business. Planning could address information categorically or with greater specificity. The measures to be taken may address the industry and business risks specific to the business, while avoiding implementation based on overly-generalized assumptions of business risk.\n\nFor many businesses, a protection plan may consider (1) restricting access of sensitive information to only those with a need relating to their employment roles; (2) employing physical, digital, and geographic limitations on access; (3) complementing physical protections with contractual limitations on information use; and (4) implementing an employee education cycle from hiring to termination that reinforces the value and company protection of trade secret and confidential information. Generally, action is better than no action, particularly if after assessment a company determines that additional protective measures should be implemented, and a lack of action or planning may be used by an employee as an indication that information used during work is not company confidential or trade secret information. Small steps taken now may translate to potentially eliminating a larger loss later, when loss recovery is much more costly and less certain.\n\nThe FTC rule will not reach regulation of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) per se. In general, an NDA creates an enforceable contractual obligation on the part of an employee to protect and prevent the disclosure or misuse of company confidential information inconsistent with the employee's role. Companies should beware, however, that certain NDA provisions may be found unenforceable under the FTC's proposed rule.\n\nFirst, an agreement may bundle several rights and obligations together, such as a non-disclosure provision, a non-solicitation provision, and a non-compete provision. Absent a severability clause in the agreement, a bundled agreement may be found wholly unenforceable if the non-compete provision is eliminated. Second, the FTC has commented that \"NDAs that are unusually broad in scope may function as de facto non-compete clauses, hence falling within the scope of the proposed rule.\" The FTC has compared such NDAs to more favorable NDAs that \"may prevent workers from disclosing or using certain information, but they generally do not prevent workers from working for a competitor or starting their own business altogether.\" Thus, an NDA's overly broad protectionary language may result in a finding that the non-disclosure provision really falls into the non-compete category, making it unenforceable.\n\nIn view of the FTC's recently issued rule, companies should consider a review of existing agreements to eliminate potentially unenforceable provisions. Problematic existing contractual provisions may be mitigated by entering into new agreements with key company employees.\n\nThe FTC's ban on non-compete agreements may affect some companies' efforts to protect confidential or trade secret information. Anticipating implementation of the FTC's announced rule, companies may consider focusing on trade secret and confidential information protection efforts directed to the information itself and not on the individuals that use the information. Such an approach may mitigate future risk if existing information protection measures focused on the restriction of employee movement are found to be unenforceable.\n\nThis article is an update from its original version, published February 22, 2023 in The National Law Journal\u00a9 202X ALM Global Properties, LLC.", "source": {"uri": "mondaq.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mondaq Business Briefing"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_secret", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trade secret"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-compete_clause", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Non-compete clause"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Trade Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Non-disclosure agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal judiciary of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defend_Trade_Secrets_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defend Trade Secrets Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Trade_Secrets_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uniform Trade Secrets Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Severability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "De facto"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Insurance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Insurance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://www.mondaq.com/images/Mondaq_Share.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549027", "eventUri": "eng-9549027", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

The effective date of the Final Rule is 120 days after its publication in the Federal Register. Legal challenges related to the Final Rule are already underway and could delay the effective date or enjoin the enforcement of the Final Rule.\n\nOn April 23, 2024, the FTC voted 3-2 along party lines to approve the issuance of the Final Rule that prohibits most non-compete clauses between workers and employers. This action follows the FTC's proposal in January 2023 to ban non-competes nationwide (the \"Proposed Rule\"). The Proposed Rule garnered significant attention and criticism from business and industry groups and resulted in over 26,000 comments. The Final Rule maintains the broad sweep of the Proposed Rule and incorporates only very narrow exceptions for existing non-compete agreements with \"senior executives\" and non-compete agreements connected to the sale of a business.\n\nUnder the Final Rule, \"non-compete clauses\" are generally determined to be \"an unfair method of competition\" resulting in a violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The Final Rule adopts a comprehensive ban on new non-compete agreements with all workers and invalidates any existing non-compete agreements with workers (other than a very narrow exception for non-competes with \"senior executives\" that exist before the effective date of the Final Rule).\n\nSpecifically, the Final Rule prohibits:\n\n\"Workers\" broadly defined. The ban broadly covers \"non-compete clauses\" with \"workers.\" The Final Rule defines a \"worker\" as a natural person who works or who previously worked, whether paid or unpaid, without regard to the worker's title or the worker's status under any other State or Federal laws. A worker includes an employee, independent contractor, extern, intern, volunteer, apprentice, or a sole proprietor who provides a service. A worker also includes a natural person who works for a franchisee or franchisor but does not include a franchisee in the context of a franchisee-franchisor relationship.\n\n\"Non-Compete Clause\" broadly defined. Under the Final Rule, a \"non-compete clause\" is broadly defined as an employment \"term or condition\" that \"prohibits a worker from, penalizes a worker for, or functions to prevent a worker from\" (1) seeking or accepting work in the United States with a different employer or (2) operating a business in the United States, in each case, after the conclusion of the worker's employment. Prohibited terms or conditions include workplace policies, as well as contractual terms, whether written or oral.\n\nThere is an exception for the continued enforceability of non-compete clauses that were entered into with \"senior executives\" before the effective date of the Final Rule. However, no new non-competes can be entered into with any workers, including \"senior executives,\" after the effective date of the Final Rule.\n\nA \"senior executive\" is defined as a worker who (1) is in a \"policy-making position\" and (2) earned at least $151,164 in annual compensation in the preceding year.\n\nNotably, the policy-making position requirement to be a \"senior executive\" significantly narrows its scope. Under the Final Rule, \"policy-making authority\" means final authority to make policy decisions that control significant aspects of a business entity or common enterprise and does not include authority limited to advising or exerting influence over such policy decisions or having final authority to make policy decisions for only a subsidiary of or affiliate of a common enterprise. This definition excludes a person who has policy-making authority over a subsidiary or an affiliate of a business entity that is part of the common enterprise, if that person does not have policy-making authority over a common enterprise.\n\nIn the preamble to the Final Rule, the FTC identifies forfeiture-for-competition clauses as an example of a term that \"penalizes\" a worker because the term \"imposes adverse financial consequences on a former employee as a result of the termination of an employment relationship, expressly conditioned on the employee seeking or accepting other work or starting a business after their employment ends.\" The FTC also cites severance arrangements in which the worker is paid only if they refrain from competing as an example of a term that \"penalizes\" a worker.\n\nHowever, the FTC notes that \"garden leave\" arrangements, such as severance agreements without restrictions on post-employment work, or arrangements where the worker remains employed and receives the same compensation and benefits, but with a reduced workload or job responsibilities are not non-compete clauses because they are not post-employment restrictions.\n\nWhile the Final Rule does \"not categorically prohibit\" other types of restrictive agreements, like non-disclosure agreements, training-repayment agreements or non-solicitation agreements, employers should be aware that provisions that \"function\" to prevent competition are prohibited. The FTC notes that if the term or condition is \"so broad and onerous that it has the same functional effect as a term or condition prohibiting or penalizing a worker from seeking or accepting other work or starting a business after their employment ends,\" such a restrictive agreement would be subject to the prohibition on non-competes.\n\nFor example, the FTC indicates that non-disclosure agreements may be non-competes where they \"span such a large scope of information that they function to prevent workers from seeking or accepting other work or starting a business after they leave their job.\" Similarly, non-solicitation agreements can satisfy the definition of non-compete clauses \"where they function to prevent a worker from seeking or accepting other work or starting a business after their employment ends.\"\n\nIn addition to the exception for pre-existing non-compete agreements with \"senior executives,\" the following exceptions apply:\n\nFinally, the non-compete ban does not apply to entities outside of the FTC's jurisdiction, such as non-profit entities, certain common carriers, certain domestic and foreign air carriers, and businesses subject to the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921. While certain banks and savings and loan institutions, federal credit unions, FDIC insured state chartered banks and other commercial lenders are outside of the FTC's jurisdiction, the FTC did not exclude bank holding companies, subsidiaries, or other affiliates of federally regulated banks from the Final Rule; as a result, employees of different affiliates within the same organization, like a bank holding company, will be subject to the FTC rules while others may be exempt. The Final Rule does not apply to non-compete clauses if they restrict only work or the operation of a business outside the United States.\n\nBy the effective date of the Final Rule, employers are required to provide \"clear and conspicuous notice\" to workers subject to an invalidated non-compete clause that the non-compete \"will not be, and cannot legally be, enforced against the worker.\" The notice must specify who entered into the non-compete clause with the worker, and the notice must be provided by hand-delivery, mail to the worker's last known personal address, email or text message. The Final Rule provides safe harbor model language to satisfy the notice requirement.\n\nShortly after the issuance of the Final Rule, two different lawsuits in Texas federal courts seeking to invalidate the rule were filed. We expect other legal challenges to be presented in the coming weeks.\n\nSince the issuance of the Proposed Rule, a number of commenters have questioned the FTC's authority to issue the non-compete ban. The FTC includes a discussion of its authority in this area in the preamble, and the Final Rule includes a severability clause that would sever any part of the Final Rule that is held to be invalid or unenforceable, while construing to the maximum effect permitted by law any surviving portions of the rule.\n\nGiven the current and anticipated litigation related to the Final Rule, employers should carefully monitor whether the Final Rule is enjoined or the deadline for compliance remains. We believe it is likely that a Federal court hearing a challenge will enjoin the Final Rule's implementation pending judicial review and that implementation may be delayed.\n\nNotwithstanding these legal challenges, the 120-day countdown to implementation will continue to run unless a Federal court moves to enjoin the implementation of the rule pending judicial review. In light of the potentially tight timeframes, employers may want to consider taking the following steps in preparation for any effective date of Final Rule:\n\nWe will continue to monitor the litigation concerning the Final Rule and will provide updates as they become available.\n\nPlease reach out to our Executive Compensation and Employee Benefits team if you have any questions or would like to speak with us about the Final Rule.", "source": {"uri": "mondaq.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mondaq Business Briefing"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-compete_clause", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Non-compete clause"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franchising", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Franchising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Trade Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Natural person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Legal person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission_Act_of_1914", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sole_proprietorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sole proprietorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Register", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Register"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Employment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidiary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subsidiary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Non-disclosure agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injunction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Injunction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee_benefits", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Employee benefits"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packers_and_Stockyards_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Packers and Stockyards Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Severability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_and_loan_association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Savings and loan association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_harbor_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Safe harbor (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_compensation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Executive compensation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Deposit_Insurance_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property_Rights", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property Rights", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Grievances", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Grievances", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.mondaq.com/images/Mondaq_Share.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549027", "eventUri": "eng-9549027", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

Within hours, a Texas firm sued to block the rule, and the following day, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a business lobby, sued as well.\n\nBut the FTC's rule is based on a mountain of empirical evidence showing that non-compete clauses harm workers, consumers, innovation, and employee mobility. Moreover, they are already regulated in most states, and banned in a few -- including California, home of Silicon Valley, the single most innovative place in the world.\n\nBusinesses argue that they need non-compete clauses to prevent employees from stealing proprietary information. Suppose a distributor has compiled a list of customers after years of outreach. An employee may be tempted to take the list to another firm and, for a higher wage, use it to poach customers from their previous employer. Businesses also argue that non-compete clauses protect investments in training. Suppose a firm teaches new employees how to use accounting software. If the employees can immediately move to another firm, they can obtain a higher wage because they require no training at the firm that hires them.\n\nBut neither theory actually justifies enforcement of non-competes. Strict laws protect firms' trade secrets without preventing people from switching jobs when they need to. An Uber executive who had worked at Google was sent to jail for using Google trade secrets to benefit his new employer. And natural labor-market frictions prevent employers from losing investments in training. It is costly and inconvenient for most employees to switch jobs, and firms can require employees to agree to pay back the cost of training if they leave the job before the firm has recovered its investment.\n\nEven if non-competes can be justified in rare cases involving special circumstances, they cause significant hardship for workers. Suppose a New York City doctor with a non-compete wants to switch to another employer, because working conditions have been degraded, wages have stagnated, he was passed over for promotion, or the hospital chose to emphasize medical services that he believes are immoral or unwise. If subject to a non-compete clause, he must either take a vacation or work as a barista for a year or two while waiting for the restriction to expire; or he must uproot his family and move to a city or state that is beyond the geographic boundaries of the non-compete. Most people are unable to do these things.\n\nA common response is that the doctor freely agreed to the non-compete, may have been paid a higher wage because of it, and thus should not complain now that things worked out badly. But many employees do not even know that they are subject to a non-compete; and among those who \"voluntarily\" agree to it as a condition of being hired, few may understand what it means, or realize that it may be illegal.\n\nAfter all, non-compete clauses are often boilerplate in long employment contracts, or they are presented to employees only after they join a firm and have lost their power to negotiate. Many non-competes are written vaguely and broadly, with some prohibiting not only post-employment competition but even the act of looking for a job with a competitor during that period.\n\nMoreover, non-competes interfere with labor markets. Job mobility is essential to the economy's health. Workers need to be able to move to wherever they are most productive, and to be able to change jobs in response to changing economic conditions. When a worker is bound by a non-compete clause, even if she is well paid for agreeing to it, she will be unable to work for a competing employer who values her work more. Many new firms will not be able to enter the market because they cannot find employees who are free to move to a new job. The forgone labor productivity results in higher prices, harming consumers.\n\nNeither of these problems would loom large if non-competes were used responsibly. But they are not. Because firms, under existing law, pay no penalty for using overly broad non-competes, they have imposed them on employees with alacrity. One survey of workers in 2017 found that 18% -- implying tens of millions of people across the U.S. economy -- were bound by these provisions. Another estimated that the figure could be as high as 46.5%. Millions of low-wage workers performing low-skill tasks are subject to the same restrictions.\n\nAnd those restrictions harm workers by reducing not only their employment opportunities, but also their wages. One study, for example, shows that when Hawaii banned non-competes for tech workers in 2015, their wages increased relative to those of other workers in Hawaii and to tech workers in other states. Moreover, the ban also promoted business formation.\n\nAnother study of all U.S. private-sector workers shows that wages are higher in states that ban or strictly limit non-compete clauses than in those that impose weaker limits on them. A study of a ban on non-compete clauses for low-wage workers in Oregon showed that it increased both wages and mobility.\n\nSome studies come to more mixed conclusions. For example, a 2020 study finds that non-compete provisions are associated with higher earnings for physicians; but the provisions are also known to cause higher prices for medical services. Another study shows that non-competes increase wages for highly compensated executives, but cause broader social harm by preventing more productive firms from hiring them away.\n\nThe FTC's 570-page commentary on its ban discusses these and other studies with great care, far exceeding the evidentiary threshold that courts require for approving new regulations. Business interests thus have argued that the FTC lacks the statutory authority to issue such a rule, regardless of its benefits. While that contention has been rejected by courts in the past, the ban's challengers brought their case in the notoriously conservative Fifth Circuit, and the conservative majority on the Supreme Court has already signaled its own distrust of broad agency regulations.\n\nStill, there is reason for optimism. With growing awareness of abuse in labor markets, and given the FTC's careful marshaling of the evidence, the courts may well wave this one through.", "source": {"uri": "fa-mag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FA Magazine"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_secret", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trade secret"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-compete_clause", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Non-compete clause"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Employment contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Accounting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Trade Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Chamber_of_Commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Chamber of Commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silicon Valley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Private sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Fifth_Circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Physician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Employee_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Employee Relations", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Government_Agencies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Government Agencies", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor-Management_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor-Management Relations", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://www.fa-mag.com/images/logo_opengraph.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549027", "eventUri": "eng-9549027", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2784313725490196, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Extensive litigation is expected around this rule, and at least one challenge was filed in federal court the same day that the rule was announced. Although it is possible the FTC's rule will be struck down someday, businesses currently relying on non-compete agreements to protect their trade secret and confidential information face the risk that this rule will take effect. Barring court action striking down the rule, the FTC's recent action will require many businesses to reassess their protection strategies for company trade secret and confidential information.\n\nThe FTC's comments regarding its new rule acknowledge concerns that the elimination of non compete agreements could impact the protection of confidential information. In some (but not all) states, a business could rely on a non-compete agreement with an employee to act as a blanket protection from the unauthorized use of trade secret or confidential information if the employee would leave the company. The reasoning is that such information is effectively protected because the employee cannot move to other employment in which the information may be used to the detriment of the past employer.\n\nThe articulated concern underlying the FTC's rule is that non-competition agreements unnecessarily restrict more activity than necessary to achieve the protection of confidential or trade secret information. The FTC has also estimated that banning non-competes will have substantial positive effects for \"workers, businesses, and the economy,\" including an estimated 17,000-29,000 more patents each year, increased start-ups, reduced healthcare costs, and higher wages for certain employees. In justifying the proposed rule, the FTC has asserted that employers have alternative strategies to protect confidential or trade secret information, namely trade secret and contract law involving non-disclosure agreements. In view of this expectation underpinning the FTC rule, employers should consider reassessing their protection efforts and focus to prevent unauthorized movement of information rather than the movement of employees who may have access to such information.\n\nAlternative Strategies to Protect Confidential Information: Trade Secret Protection Assessment and Planning\n\nLegal strategies employing trade secret law (via the federal Defend Trade Secrets Act or state implementations of the Uniform Trade Secrets Act) to protect proprietary information are largely unaffected by the FTC rule. In view of the FTC's attempt to ban non-compete agreements, companies should assess whether their remaining efforts to protect information are sufficient to meet or exceed the \"reasonable measures under the circumstances\" that those statutes require. Failing to do so could result in a finding, when asserting the alleged trade secrets, that the unimplemented measures demonstrate the company did not take \"reasonable measures\" to protect its trade secrets. Such a finding could result in a misappropriating employee -- and their new employer -- escaping with no liability at all.\n\nSuccessfully assessing and systematizing trade secret protection is more easily achievable with a plan. While not required as part of reasonable measures to protect a trade secret, planning may be useful to inform present employees of the protected confidential information and steps taken to protect that information, as well as to provide future employees historical context of the information's protection. Additional steps for protecting confidential information may be tailored to the specific nature of a company's trade secrets and to the geographic areas in which the company does business. Planning could address information categorically or with greater specificity. The measures to be taken may address the industry and business risks specific to the business, while avoiding implementation based on overly-generalized assumptions of business risk.\n\nFor many businesses, a protection plan may consider (1) restricting access of sensitive information to only those with a need relating to their employment roles; (2) employing physical, digital, and geographic limitations on access; (3) complementing physical protections with contractual limitations on information use; and (4) implementing an employee education cycle from hiring to termination that reinforces the value and company protection of trade secret and confidential information. Generally, action is better than no action, particularly if after assessment a company determines that additional protective measures should be implemented, and a lack of action or planning may be used by an employee as an indication that information used during work is not company confidential or trade secret information. Small steps taken now may translate to potentially eliminating a larger loss later, when loss recovery is much more costly and less certain.\n\nAlternative Strategies to Protect Confidential Information: Non-Disclosure Agreements\n\nThe FTC rule will not reach regulation of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) per se. In general, an NDA creates an enforceable contractual obligation on the part of an employee to protect and prevent the disclosure or misuse of company confidential information inconsistent with the employee's role. Companies should beware, however, that certain NDA provisions may be found unenforceable under the FTC's proposed rule.\n\nFirst, an agreement may bundle several rights and obligations together, such as a non-disclosure provision, a non-solicitation provision, and a non-compete provision. Absent a severability clause in the agreement, a bundled agreement may be found wholly unenforceable if the non-compete provision is eliminated. Second, the FTC has commented that \"NDAs that are unusually broad in scope may function as de facto non-compete clauses, hence falling within the scope of the proposed rule.\" The FTC has compared such NDAs to more favorable NDAs that \"may prevent workers from disclosing or using certain information, but they generally do not prevent workers from working for a competitor or starting their own business altogether.\" Thus, an NDA's overly broad protectionary language may result in a finding that the non-disclosure provision really falls into the non-compete category, making it unenforceable.\n\nIn view of the FTC's recently issued rule, companies should consider a review of existing agreements to eliminate potentially unenforceable provisions. Problematic existing contractual provisions may be mitigated by entering into new agreements with key company employees.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe FTC's ban on non-compete agreements may affect some companies' efforts to protect confidential or trade secret information. Anticipating implementation of the FTC's announced rule, companies may consider focusing on trade secret and confidential information protection efforts directed to the information itself and not on the individuals that use the information. Such an approach may mitigate future risk if existing information protection measures focused on the restriction of employee movement are found to be unenforceable.\n\nThis article is an update from its original version, published February 22, 2023 in The National Law Journal\u00a9 202X ALM Global Properties, LLC.", "source": {"uri": "mondaq.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mondaq Business Briefing"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_secret", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trade secret"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-compete_clause", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Non-compete clause"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Trade Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Non-disclosure agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal judiciary of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Trade_Secrets_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uniform Trade Secrets Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Severability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_Law_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The National Law Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "De facto"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Services", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Associations", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://www.mondaq.com/images/Mondaq_Share.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549027", "eventUri": "eng-9549027", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Announced on April 23, 2024, following a 3-2 vote by the FTC Commissioners, the rule represents a significant policy shift aimed at increasing market competition and employee mobility. Scheduled to take effect on August 21, 2024, the rule prohibits the use of non-compete clauses in employment contracts, marking a fundamental shift in how companies could protect their competitive interests. The rule applies nationwide and preempts conflicting state laws. Importantly, the FTC indicates other common covenants such as non-disclosure obligations, non-solicitation obligations, and/or clawback provisions (e.g., training repayment agreement provisions (TRAPs)) may still be permissible. This regulatory update is poised to reshape strategies concerning intellectual property (IP) and trade secret management, as well as employee development & retention, compelling businesses to adapt to a landscape where traditional restrictive covenants are no longer enforceable.\n\nNon-disclosure obligations, non-solicitation clauses, and clawback provisions have traditionally been used in conjunction with non-compete clauses. Now such provisions may have added importance to protecting proprietary information or function as quasi-alternatives to non-competes. In the wake of the FTC's ban, businesses must explore alternative approaches to protect their investments while aligning with evolving regulatory standards and fostering a conducive work environment.\n\nThe FTC's ruling could have profound implications for how companies manage their intellectual property and trade secrets. Historically, non-compete agreements have been pivotal in helping employers safeguard their business interests, including sensitive information, key developmental areas, and trade secrets, by restricting employees' activities after their employment ends. The primary aim has been to prevent employees from potentially transferring critical information to direct competitors or becoming a competitor themselves. However, with the new FTC rule coming into force, companies may need to increasingly rely on alternative legal mechanisms, such as patents and trade secrets, and do so in timely fashion, to maintain their competitive edge.\n\nTraditionally, non-compete agreements were utilized by businesses to complement their patent portfolios, serving as an additional layer of protection against competitors seeking to exploit similar technologies or innovations. With the new rule, companies may want to consider the strategic use of patents, and the timing advantages afforded by patent strategies, in order to safeguard their intellectual property assets. Patents provide a robust, legally enforceable right to exclude others from exploiting an invention, offering a layer of protection that does not rely on an employee's adherence to contractual post-employment restrictions. This protection can last up to 20 years -- far outliving the historically acceptable time periods for non-compete agreements. Filing decision and timing may be a critical update to many corporation's filing strategies.\n\nTypically, employment agreements require employees to assign their inventive endeavors to the corporation. Thus, taking advantage of patent filings during the employee's tenure may result in a shift in timing, and an increase in overall patent filings as businesses strive to secure extensive protections for their innovations. Further, employment agreements can include provisions that require the employee assist the prior employer with procuring patents, or other intellectual property rights. Research supports this notion, suggesting that decreasing the enforceability of non-competes significantly boosts the number of patents filed, with the value of patents relative to firm assets increasing by about 31% when non-compete enforceability decreases (Zhaozhao He, 2023).\n\nNon-disclosure obligations are also a very common clause of many employment agreements and protect proprietary information and provide a measure of recourse for misuse. These obligations remain a vital tool for safeguarding proprietary information and trade secrets. They serve as a crucial barrier against intellectual property theft and competitive disadvantage by requiring employees, contractors, and business partners to adhere to confidentiality obligations. In the absence of non-compete agreements, these obligations take on added significance, providing businesses with a means to maintain a competitive edge while fostering innovation and trust within their workforce.\n\nBusinesses may want to revisit current non-disclosure and assignment clauses given their greater importance moving forward to ensure they are effective, appropriately tailored, and resistant to legal attacks.\n\nIn view of the rule, corporations also may turn to more aggressively identifying and safeguarding trade secrets, as the rule may fundamentally alter the landscape of legal disputes surrounding proprietary information. Traditionally, non-compete agreements have been a cornerstone of trade secret protection strategies, providing employers with a legal mechanism to prevent former employees from joining competitors and misusing the trade secrets.\n\nCompanies might enhance their focus on internal security measures and robust confidentiality and other restrictive covenants to properly safeguard trade secrets. Ensuring that trade secrets and proprietary knowledge remain protected under the Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA) and state laws will require more stringent access controls, employee training, and potentially, more aggressive legal actions against breaches. The new landscape may necessitate bolstering permitted restrictive covenants that do not overreach in scope and duration yet provide effective protection for sensitive business information. As part of this, employers are cautioned to be more diligent in identifying trade secrets early in the process, so they can be properly protected as such in the event a key employee leaves the company.\n\nNon-solicitation covenants also remain a valuable means of safeguarding proprietary information and preserving business relationships. Non-solicitation agreements, which prohibit employees from soliciting clients, customers, or other employees of their former employer for a specified period after leaving the company, play a crucial role in preventing unfair competition and preserving client goodwill. By preventing departing employees from poaching valuable clients or skilled colleagues, non-solicitation agreements help businesses maintain continuity in their operations and protect the investments made in building customer relationships and nurturing talent. In the absence of non-compete agreements, non-solicitation agreements become even more critical for businesses seeking to protect their proprietary information and preserve their competitive advantage in the marketplace. Non-disclosure and non-solicitation covenants may often be used in together for greater protection.\n\nCompanies may want to revisit non-solicitation clauses to ensure they are not overly broad such that they function to prevent workers from seeking or accepting work, or operating a business to bolster their enforceability after the FTC ban takes effect.\n\nThe shift away from the enforceability of non-compete agreements also raises questions about the balance between promoting competition and fostering innovation and protecting proprietary information. While increased employee mobility can indeed lead to a more dynamic exchange of ideas and innovation, it also poses risks of inadvertent or intentional disclosure of proprietary information. Companies will need to navigate these waters carefully with the tools available.\n\nMoreover, the enforcement of IP rights and confidentiality agreements will likely become more contentious, as companies adjust to the new norm and test the boundaries of legal protections in place of non-competes. This may lead to an increase in litigation as businesses more vigorously defend their IP assets and trade secrets, as well as NDA's and confidentiality agreements, in the absence of non-compete clauses.\n\nThe FTC's ban on non-compete agreements is set to reshape the competitive landscape, prompting companies to reassess and strengthen their IP and trade secret strategies when it comes to employees. While this change is poised to boost innovation and worker mobility, it also compels businesses to enhance their reliance on timely patent strategies and meticulous management of trade secrets, ensuring they remain competitive within an increasingly open market.", "source": {"uri": "mondaq.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mondaq Business Briefing"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covenant_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Covenant (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_secret", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trade secret"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Employment contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-compete_clause", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Non-compete clause"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Trade Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Intellectual property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_preemption", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal preemption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Competition (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procurement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Procurement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidentiality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Confidentiality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_norm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social norm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defend_Trade_Secrets_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defend Trade Secrets Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketplace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marketplace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Non-disclosure agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-competitive_practices", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-competitive practices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Competitive advantage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business intelligence"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax_Negotiation_and_Representation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax Negotiation and Representation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.mondaq.com/images/Mondaq_Share.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549027", "eventUri": "eng-9549027", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

It's worth noting, however, that California is among the few states that has never supported non-compete agreements. Recently the state strengthened its non-compete stance with new, broad-ranging legislation.\n\nThere are other legal instruments in the US -- such as non-disclosure agreements -- that can protect companies from the theft of intellectual property without limiting employee careers and artificially depressing salaries. So, it's not as if companies are without recourse.\n\nAt least three lawsuits have been filed against the proposed ban. The most significant was brought by the US Chamber of Commerce, the Business Roundtable, and other business interests. They filed a lawsuit seeking a court order to vacate the FTC action. (The lawsuit was filed one day after the FTC issued the new rule.) The FTC faces challenges about whether it has the power to unilaterally invoke the decision to ban non-compete clauses. Here's more detail on the opposing viewpoint.\n\nMany of the largest US corporations are represented in the lawsuit by the Business Roundtable, which is an association of more than 200 CEOs of leading US companies from every sector of the economy. Business Roundtable members include many tech companies, such as Alphabet (Google), Amazon, AMD, Apple, Cisco, Dell, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, HP, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Palo Alto Networks, Qualcomm, Salesforce, and SAP.\n\nThe judge in the lawsuit brought by the US Chamber of Commerce could grant a temporary injunction to delay the FTC ban pending the trial's outcome. Plus, the case could be hung up in appeals for years to come, with the possibility that it would play out in the Supreme Court. So, over the short haul, nothing may change. But companies and employees should be thinking about how the ban might affect them.\n\nIn 2023, research firm Gartner polled HR leaders about the then-proposed ban: 72% said their organization would likely benefit from the ban, increasing the availability of talent by giving them access to a larger pool of skilled workers. Gartner recently polled attendees of a Benchmark with Gartner live webinar about the new FTC rule; 60% strongly or somewhat agreed that their organizations would benefit from better access to talent. But the ban creates a double-edged sword for employers: 51% also either strongly or somewhat agreed that their organizations would be at risk of losing top talent.\n\nCompanies that use non-competes should get their lawyers working on alternatives right away, regardless of the legal fight over the FTC rule.

While this action by the FTC was expected, there were many unanswered questions about the final impact of the non-compete rule in regard to existing non-compete agreements and its scope as applied to future non-compete agreements. These questions were answered under the final rule as promulgated.\n\nThe FTC's final rule banning all non-competition agreements is effective 120 days after its publication in the Federal Register. As of the effective date, all non-competition agreements are banned, with close to no exceptions, except for franchisor/franchisee relationships and for sales of a business between buyer and seller.\n\nIndependent contractors are also included under the umbrella of employees that would no longer be subject to non-competition agreements under the final rule. This would effectively mean that many employees in industries such as film, finance, and other professional services now have the right to switch between employers, which the FTC states \"will ensure Americans have the freedom to pursue a new job, start a new business, or bring a new idea to the market.\"\n\n\"The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has already vowed to block the rule, calling it 'an unlawful power grab' and arguing that the authority to govern non-competition agreements should be left to the states.\"\n\nHowever, and of note, the FTC does not have jurisdiction over nonprofit employers, so non-competition agreements are enforceable in this regard despite the FTC's final rule.\n\nIn addition to prohibiting all non-competition agreements after the effective date of the final rule with limited exceptions, the FTC's rule is retroactive, prohibiting certain non-competition agreements before the effective date of the rule as well.\n\nExisting non-competition agreements can remain in effect as to senior executives, which are defined in the rule as employees in 'policy-making positions' making at least $151,164 per year. Existing non-competition agreements with employees who do not meet this definition are no longer enforceable per the final rule.\n\nDespite the final rule, employers do not need to modify existing non-competition agreements by rescinding them. Employers do, however, need to notify their workers that the employer will not enforce non-competition agreements in the future. The FTC has included in its final rule model language for informing employees of this change, which can be communicated through email, text, or in paper format.\n\nThe final rule does not generally impact non-disclosure agreements or non-solicitation agreements unless they prohibit a worker from seeking or accepting work or operating a business. Employers should be aware that more restrictive state laws governing non-competition agreements remain in effect.\n\nAs of the announcement of the FTC's final rule, challenges are already looming. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has already vowed to block the rule, calling it \"an unlawful power grab\" and arguing that the authority to govern non-competition agreements should be left to the states.\n\nThe statement issued by the Chamber of Commerce goes on to note that, \"since its inception over 100 years ago, the FTC has never been granted the constitutional and statutory authority to write its own competition rules. Non-compete agreements are either upheld or dismissed under well-established state laws governing their use.\"\n\nThis announcement by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce will undoubtedly lead to other challenges through the court system. Indeed, a Dallas-based global tax-services and software provider has already filed suit against the Federal Trade Commission over the impact of the final rule.\n\nThe FTC, as the Chamber of Commerce rightly points out, has no authority to write its own competition rules. The FTC can, however, make rules if it goes through the proper rule-making process, including introducing proposed legislation and leaving it open to comment for a certain amount of time, which did occur here.\n\nHowever, even following this process does not ensure that the rule will stand. The rule still remains open to court challenges from the Chamber of Commerce, individuals, or organizations affected by the rule or any other stakeholders within the final rule. This could mean that changes would be on the horizon for the rule, and possibly a narrowing of its already expansive application.\n\nAs noted, the FTC's final rule is already being challenged through the court system, and a challenge from the Chamber of Commerce will most likely follow suit. Therefore, if an employer has existing non-competition agreements, the employer may not need to rescind them just yet.\n\nFurther, if employers are intending to enter into non-competition agreements that are reasonable and enforceable under existing state laws, other options, such as non-disclosure agreements and non-solicitation agreements, may have to be used, but it would be prudent to wait on further ruling from the existing challenges to the final rule.\n\nIn the meantime, consultation with an attorney will aid in navigating the changing landscape of non-competition agreements.", "source": {"uri": "businesswest.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BusinessWest"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-compete_clause", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Non-compete clause"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Trade Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franchising", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Franchising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Register", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Register"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Chamber_of_Commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Chamber of Commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Employment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_of_commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chamber of commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Non-disclosure agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stakeholder (corporate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property_Rights", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property Rights", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://businesswest.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Law.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549027", "eventUri": "eng-9549027", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-23", "textStart": 3, "textEnd": 11}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

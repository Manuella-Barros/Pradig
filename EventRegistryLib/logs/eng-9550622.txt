Unfortunately for Jags fans, they lost in overtime to the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nThey played their first Sunday Night Football game since 2008. Again, things didn't work out in their favor as they lost 23-7 to the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nThey played 15 Sunday games, including 11 at 1 p.m., two at 9:30 a.m. (London games), one at 4 p.m. and the one in Prime Time. They had the one MNF game, and their annual Thursday contest.\n\nAs we near the NFL's 2024 schedule being released, we'd expect the Jaguars again will be seen in Prime Time games.\n\nThey've gone 9-8 the past two years, making the playoffs and winning a postseason game in 2022, and barely missing the playoffs in 2023.\n\nI'm going to think outside the box a little bit on this one.\n\nThe Jaguars have held their first game of the season on the road for three years in a row.\n\nI think they finally start their season at home, and it will be against the New England Patriots.\n\nLast year, the Jaguars started on the road as the kicked off the Anthony Richardson era in Indianapolis.\n\nThis year, the Drake Maye era will begin in Jacksonville.\n\nThe Jags and Titans always seem to end the season against each other. They will do it this year at home.\n\nIn 2022, the Jags knocked off the Titans in Jacksonville to clinch the AFC South crown.\n\nIn 2023, the Titans defeated the Jaguars in Nashville, eliminating the Jags from the playoffs.\n\nThe Jaguars have opened and closed the season on the road the past two seasons.\n\nThis year, it will be the first time since 2019 that they start and end the season in Jacksonville.\n\nThe Jaguars are the only NFL team to have never played on Thanksgiving. I think that will change this year.\n\nThe Jaguars play at Detroit, and what better way to spend your Thanksgiving than eating turkey and watching Jags-Lions.\n\nThe Lions are fresh off a Super Bowl appearance and the Jaguars feature everyone's favorite goldie-locked QB: Trevor Lawrence.\n\nAs the editor of the T-U in Jacksonville, I'm not looking forward to working on Thanksgiving. But it looks like I may have to.\n\nFor the second year in a row, the Jaguars will play two games in London. Last year they played as the home team first against the Atlanta Falcons, and the away team against the Bills.\n\nI predict this year they will be the away team vs. the Chicago Bears as the road team at Tottenham Hotspur and then the home team at Wembley Stadium against the Cleveland Browns.\n\nThe Bills found out last year that jet lag is real.\n\nCan the Jaguars win both games across the pond again?\n\nThe answer is a firm ... maybe!\n\nThis looks like it could be a great AFC South rivalry for years to come.\n\nWill CJ Stroud hit a sophomore slump? Or will he and his young but talented core get past Jacksonville on a Thursday night?\n\nLast year, the two teams split the series, with the away team winning in each instance.\n\nI predict this one will be in Houston, and it's sure to make for an entertaining start to the NFL's weekend of games. Whatever weekend it is.\n\nIt's always fun when these two teams get together. Last year, the Jaguars pulled the upset in London.\n\nThis year, the game could be played in the snow depending on how late in the season it will be.\n\nAgain, the NFL loves its QB matchups, so having Trevor Lawrence vs. Josh Allen is of course a big draw.\n\nThey both also feature exciting rookie receivers in Brian Thomas Jr. (Jaguars) and Keon Coleman (Bills), whom everyone remembers from his days at Florida State.\n\nThe Jaguars broke a long streak of not being on MNF when they played the Cincinnati Bengals last year. It had been since 2011.\n\nThis year, they get the Green Bay Packers, sure to be a hot draw in Jacksonville.\n\nThe Packers made the playoffs last year and Jordan Love looks to be the real deal.\n\nYou'd have to think this matchup would be a sellout and great time to showcase Jacksonville on a Monday Night.\n\nTrevor Lawrence vs. Love is an attractive matchup.\n\nThe two teams have only played seven times ever, with the Packers leading 5-2. This will be the Packers' fifth time playing in Jacksonville, where they are 3-1.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

They then added nine new rookies in the 2024 NFL Draft, including first round wide receiver Brian Thomas Jr.\n\nAfter last year's late-season collapse, the Jaguars front office and coaching staff went through the offseason targeting improvements on offense, defense, and special teams.\n\n\"Well as we've always said, as coach and I have been on the same page from the get-go. It's not just the defensive coaches, it's all the coaches. Special teams coaches played an extremely important role,\" Jaguars general manager Trent Baalke said after the draft.\n\n\"As you saw we drafted a kicker, drafted a kick returner among other things that Keilan [RB Keilan Robinson] can do. So, as coaches and as personnel people, you try to get the best people in this building as you can that fit the system. So Ryan [defensive coordinator Ryan Nielsen] played a big role and as did the other defensive coaches. The thing is not one person makes these decisions. We've said it from the get-go, it's all of us. It's a combined effort, so they had a lot of say in the guys that we not only picked, but the type of guys that we picked. In terms of strengths, weaknesses and all the other stuff that goes with it.\"\n\nSo, how did the Jaguars' offseason shake out in comparison to the rest of their AFC South peers? Sports Illustrated takes a look at that exact question in its series of offseason grades.\n\nSports Illustrated's Matt Verderame gave the Jaguars a C grade for their offseason, slotting them behind both the Houston Texans (B) and Indianapolis Colts (B) but ahead of the Tennessee Titans (C+),\n\n\"Jacksonville had a busy offseason. The Jaguars made some terrific signings led by a two-year deal for veteran center Mitch Morse, who has played for Doug Peterson during their shared time in Kansas City. Jacksonville was also wise to add Armstead on a three-year pact, putting him on a front with edge rusher Travon Walker and Josh Allen. However, GM Trent Baalke also made some curious choices. He released Williams and receiver Zay Jones, while signing Darby and Davis as their de facto replacements. Are those players upgrades? Slightly, at best,\" SI's Matt Verderame said.\n\n\"In the draft, the Jaguars neglected the corner spot once more until the third round, while adding yet another receiver in Thomas Jr. Jacksonville is essentially betting on the offense to set the pace while the defense has to get home quickly. If it doesn't, the secondary could be a major problem.

Four key offseason takeaways to consider", "body": "JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- There were multiple reasons why the Jacksonville Jaguars won just three of nine games to finish the 2023 season, a collapse that cost them a playoff spot. But the reason that bothered general manager Trent Baalke the most was the ineffectiveness along the line of scrimmage.\n\nBoth the run game and the run defense fell significantly over the final six weeks of the season. Jaguars running backs ran for 26.5 fewer yards per game, and the defense gave up 44.4 more rushing yards per game in Weeks 13-18 than it did in Weeks 1-12.\n\nBaalke's focus on strengthening the offensive and defensive lines was the team's No. 1 priority this offseason. And as the Jaguars head into the OTAs (that begin May 20), it looks like -- on paper, at least -- they have done that.\n\nOn the offensive line, Jacksonville signed Pro Bowl center Mitch Morse -- a nine-year starter for the Bills and Chiefs -- to replace a struggling Luke Fortner. While Fortner ranked 31st in pass block win rate (87.9%) last season, Morse ranked 14th (93%) -- an obvious upgrade. Morse also didn't allow a sack last season, while Fortner allowed 4.5, per NFL Next Gen Stats. For depth, the Jaguars drafted offensive tackle Javon Foster (Missouri) in the fourth round.\n\nOn defense, they signed former 49ers defensive tackle Arik Armstead and drafted defensive tackles Maason Smith (second round) and Jordan Jefferson (fourth round) out of LSU.\n\nArmstead is one of the NFL's best defensive linemen when healthy and he'll start alongside nose tackle DaVon Hamilton. Armstead also provides an interior pass-rush presence (five sacks and 20 QB pressures in 12 games last season, and 33.5 career sacks) that will ease the burden off edge rushers Josh Allen and Travon Walker.\n\nSmith mostly lined up as a three-technique tackle (46% of his snaps) last season at LSU, and his 20 pressures when lined up as a defensive tackle in 2023 were the second most in the SEC, per ESPN Stats & Information. His 84\u215d-inch wingspan was the biggest of any defensive tackle at the scouting combine and he was clocked at a fastest speed of 19.2 mph last season. He'll play multiple spots in the tackle rotation.\n\nThough he has played at multiple spots in his career at West Virginia and LSU, Jefferson will play nose tackle for the Jaguars, according to Baalke. Jefferson was one of the strongest players at the combine: His 34 reps of 225 pounds on the bench press were the second most of any player, behind only Arkansas center Beaux Limmer (39).\n\n\"We've got to get bigger. We've got to get stronger,\" Baalke said at his end-of-season news conference. \"We've got to get more physical in the trenches. If you want to compete for championships you have to do that. I think we've got some good pieces in there [and] we have some good, young players in there but we have to get better.\"\n\nThe Jaguars have also been busy in other areas trying to improve and build depth as they head into the 2024 season. Here are three more takeaways from the Jaguars' offseason so far.\n\nPass-rush depth\n\nWhile the Jaguars took care of business by signing Allen to a five-year contract extension well before the NFL draft, finding edge rusher depth was still a need.\n\nThe Jaguars didn't draft an edge rusher until the seventh round, when they selected Texas Tech's Myles Cole with the 236th overall pick. And Baalke thinks Cole needs some work, so it could be at least one season before he has a chance to get on the field on any kind of regular basis.\n\nThat leaves Trevis Gipson, whom the team signed in March, as the clear No. 3 pass-rusher. He has 11 sacks in his career, yet seven of those came in 2021. Next is second-year player Yasir Abdullah, who tallied 45 snaps in 2023. The Jaguars opted not to re-sign Dawuane Smoot (23.5 sacks in seven seasons with the team) and 2020 first-rounder K'Lavon Chaisson (five sacks in 57 games).\n\nIf Jacksonville wants to add another rusher between now and the start of the season, there are options. Bud Dupree (53 career sacks), Yannick Ngakoue (69), Shaq Lawson (26), Carl Lawson (27) and Bruce Irvin (56.5) are free agents, though all except Ngakoue and Carl Lawson will be 30 or older when the 2024 season starts. Would any be amenable to a reduced role as the third or fourth edge rusher in the rotation?\n\nThe Jaguars have the third-most salary cap space available ($35.26 million), per Roster Management System. Would they use some of that money on an aging player to add depth to the position?\n\nAt this point, it looks like the Jaguars are content to go with Allen (17.5 sacks in 2023), Walker (10 sacks in 2023) and Gipson (one sack in eight games in 2023) as their main edge rushers.\n\nSecondary shuffle\n\nThe Jaguars didn't do a complete overhaul of their secondary, but they made significant changes that they believe will provide an upgrade from what they put on the field in 2023. There are four new players -- including two draft picks -- expected to play key roles, including at two starting spots after the releases of cornerback Darious Williams and safety Rayshawn Jenkins earlier this spring.\n\nThe two returning starters are cornerback Tyson Campbell and safety Andre Cisco, but their future in those roles beyond this season isn't clear. Both are entering the final year of their rookie contract and neither has played consistently at a high enough level to be considered a no-brainer for an extension.\n\nAfter those two, however, it's wait-and-see how new defensive coordinator Ryan Nielsen puts the pieces together.\n\nThe Jaguars signed safety Darnell Savage Jr. in March, but coach Doug Pederson said at the owners meetings that Savage would start out as the team's nickelback. Savage played there at times in Green Bay, so it's not an unfamiliar spot for him, but the Jaguars drafted Jarrian Jones in the third round and view him also as a nickelback (he primarily played there at Florida State) who can play outside.\n\nVeteran journeyman Ronald Darby is set to be the starter at the other cornerback spot, but he has battled injuries throughout his nine-year career and played a full season just once (2020). Jones could move outside if Darby goes down with an injury, but so could fifth-round pick Deantre Prince, who also will get a look at nickelback.\n\nDepending on the look Nielsen wants, second-year player Antonio Johnson or Savage could start at safety next to Cisco. Johnson saw work as a big nickel at times last season and he could also get time there in 2024 as well.\n\nThe Jaguars allowed 18 passing touchdowns to wide receivers in 2023 (fifth most in the NFL) and cornerbacks accounted for only six of the team's 16 interceptions (Williams had four). An upgrade was needed, and while the Jaguars didn't opt for a cornerback in the first round when Alabama's Terrion Arnold was available when they picked 23rd, Baalke and Pederson are confident that Nielsen can put the puzzle together to improve in the secondary in 2024.\n\n\"Ryan and his staff, we've had a very good dialogue,\" Baalke said. \"We've spent a lot of time when he first got here going through exactly what he was looking for at the different positions. How we were going to play the corners in this scheme versus how we played them in the past, how the linebackers are going to fit and how we were going to get the Sam linebacker position filled from within. So we had a lot of great dialogue and it's been fun to learn what he's looking for in players.\"\n\nOT succession plan\n\nThe draft allows teams to replenish depth at key positions that are primed for turnover. Offensive tackle was one of those positions.\n\nLeft tackle Cam Robinson and swing tackle Walker Little are both entering the final year of their contracts, which leaves second-year right tackle Anton Harrison the only offensive tackle with significant starting experience on the roster. Harrison played every snap as a rookie after starting just one game at right tackle in his career at Oklahoma.\n\nRobinson has started 84 games in seven seasons with the Jaguars, but hasn't played a full season since 2020. He's due to make $16.25 million in 2024 and the Jaguars are unlikely to re-sign him for that kind of money.\n\nLittle has started 17 regular-season games in three seasons (13 at left tackle and four at left guard). It's unclear at this point if the Jaguars are interested in bringing him back to be a starter in 2025.\n\nNow they welcome fourth-rounder Foster to the group. He was Missouri's starting left tackle for the past three seasons and a third-team All-American and first-team All-SEC selection in 2023.\n\n\"You start him out in a swing position,\" Baalke said. \"That's for the coaches to settle in on what his role is going to be. But really like the size, the length, two-time captain, leader in the SEC, 31-game starter. A lot of things that played into the pick.\"\n\nIf they like what they see, however, the Jaguars could opt to not re-sign Robinson or Little and go with Foster as a starter at either tackle spot in 2025, depending on where the team thinks Harrison's best spot would be.", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Stroud shares insight, praise for Jaguars rookie WR Brian Thomas Jr.", "body": "Trevor Lawrence will be the quarterback throwing the ball to rookie wideout Brian Thomas Jr. this fall. But, the Jacksonville Jaguars AFC South signal-caller isn't the only one who's been or will be throwing Thomas passes since the end of the football season.\n\nHouston Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud has worked with Thomas this offseason, training with a host of receivers including the Jaguars' first-round pick. After Jacksonville's selection on Day 1 of the draft a couple of weeks ago, Stroud shared his thoughts on Thomas and what he can bring to Jacksonville's defense.\n\n\"I like this pick ... they needed a down-the-field threat vertically for Trevor Lawrence. The ball gets out of his hands so fast, I think this is good for him to finally be able to hold onto it and get it down the field,\" Stroud said on draft day with Bleacher Report's NFL Draft show.\n\nA new era: Jaguars stadium renovation deal will be announced Tuesday, City Council president says\n\nThough Jacksonville's offense grew a reputation for not passing the ball down the field, Lawrence attempted the sixth-most throws beyond 20 yards with 75, according to Pro Football Focus. He was very efficient in doing it, too. Lawrence completed 34 passes of 20 or more yards, the fourth-most in the league last year for 1,048 yards 11 touchdowns and three interceptions.\n\nWhat separated Lawrence from some of the other quarterbacks, though, was that he also had four of those throws dropped, tied for the fourth-highest in the league. Lawrence's down-field passing also wasn't necessarily featured with underneath routes, screens and other shorter route combinations dominating the team's offensive makeup.\n\nInsert Thomas, who caught 68 passes for 1,177 yards (17.3 yards per catch) and 17 touchdowns in his final year at LSU. He adds another dimension to a Jaguars offense that will be without Calvin Ridley after the veteran wideout left for Tennessee earlier this year.\n\nStroud was bullish on Thomas, especially his speed.\n\n\"I threw with BT [Brian Thomas Jr.] this offseason and what stood out to me was how smooth he was. Everything looks like a 'go,' everything is vertical, which is great. I won't say he's exactly [Saints receiver] Chris Olave, but he has a similar game,\" said Stroud.\n\n\"I don't think his release game is there yet, he needs a lot better releases. But, when you talk about speed... off the charts. That's where he reminds me of Chris, catches with his hands. I think it's a great pick.\"\n\nGetting a nod of affirmation from a fellow member of the AFC South means something, especially with the expectations set now for Houston's rise to the top of the south, giving the Jaguars the backseat for at least one more season.\n\nMore importantly, though, Thomas' merits speak for themselves and working out with and getting praise from an NFL quarterback bodes well for what the Jaguars could expect from him this year and beyond.\n\nThe first look Jaguars fans will get of Thomas will be on Friday when the team meets for rookie minicamp, running through Monday, May 13. The camp will showcase the team's nine draft picks, 13 undrafted free agent signees and several first and second-year players in addition to receiver Javis Landry as one of the players working out on a try-out basis.\n\nDemetrius Harvey is the Jacksonville Jaguars reporter for the Florida Times-Union.

And by the time they were on the clock again, the only defensive back off the board was Toledo cornerback Quinyon Mitchell.\n\nBut instead of opting for a cornerback or any other defender at No. 23, the Jaguars went the route of reinforcing their receiver room with Thomas. But according to a recent ESPN report, a cornerback did appear to be the Jaguars' secondary option in the event Thomas was selected.\n\n\"At No. 23 overall, where Jacksonville took LSU receiver Brian Thomas Jr., Alabama cornerback Terrion Arnold also was a strong consideration as the choice. But Jacksonville wanted a receiver with dominant traits to replace Calvin Ridley and figured it could get corner help elsewhere in the draft,\" ESPN's Jeremy Fowler said.\n\n\"I think it's a combination of everything. Again, when you look at Brian and where he's been, the type of young man he is, the ability to check all the boxes as far as what we're looking for in players. There were a lot of good football players on the board, he happens to be one of them,\" Jaguars general manager Trent Baalke said after the draft.\n\n\"Not to discredit anybody else, but at 17, like we said last night, Brian would've been the pick and he ended up being the pick at 23. We're just fortunate to have him and looking forward to getting him on the grass.\"\n\nThomas caught 68 passes for 1,177 yards (17.3 average) and 17 touchdowns for LSU in 2023. In 2022, Thomas caught 31 passes for 361 yards and five touchdowns. In 2021, he caught 28 passes for 359 yards and two touchdowns.\n\n\"Again, as you talk to coach, we're looking for ideal fits. He's an ideal fit for what the coaching staff is looking for, for what we feel we need to expand offensively. All of it, and a culture fit. Like we talk about, bringing in the type of guys that fit into this locker room, fit into this community and he checked all of the boxes that way,\" Baalke said.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_shipley@si.com", "name": "John Shipley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSU_Tigers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LSU Tigers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_Ridley", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Calvin Ridley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Vikings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Vikings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_back", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defensive back"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toledo,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toledo, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toledo, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Baalke", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trent Baalke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2400,h_1350,x_0,y_0/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si-temp/01hxa3hs7xyc57zm1ysv", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550622", "eventUri": "eng-9550622", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

And in this occasion, it wasn't a first-round or a top-100 pick who received the honors for the Jaguars.\n\nInstead, it was fourth round offensive tackle Javon Foster, the Jaguars' fourth selection and the No. 114 pick overall.\n\n\"The Jaguars took fliers on some higher-ceiling athletes with their first three picks of the draft, but their fourth pick might have been my favorite: Javon Foster,\" PFF's Trevor Sikkema said. \"Foster isn't the elite-caliber athlete to garner a top-100 selection, but he started for three years in the SEC and consistently earned grades above 80.0 in all three campaigns.

He ran a 4.69-second 40 at 6-foot-6 and 278 pounds,\" ESPN's Jeremy Fowler said. \"He's long as hell, big as hell, fast as hell,\" an AFC scout said. \"Change of direction is not great, play wasn't great, but there's a lot to work with.\"\n\nCole spent the first four years of his career at Louisiana-Monroe, appearing in 34 games and starting 12 games while recording 3.5 tackles for loss and 1.5 sacks.\n\nCole transferred to Texas Tech in 2022, appearing in 25 games and starting 13. In that span, he recorded nine tackles for loss, 3.5 sacks, and one pass deflection.\n\nCole recorded the longest arms and wingspan at the Senior Bowl and the NFL Scouting Combine with 36 7/8-inch arms.\n\n\"Size, length, he's a developmental guy for sure.

He moved away from the bountiful upside prospects with eyes on a player who seemingly doesn't have as much to prove in his transition to the pros. [affiliatewidget_smgtolocal]\n\nThat player is Jacksonville's first fourth-round choice, offensive tackle Javon Foster from Missouri.\n\nThe Jaguars took fliers on some higher-ceiling athletes with their first three picks of the draft, but their fourth pick might have been my favorite: Javon Foster. Foster isn't the elite-caliber athlete to garner a top-100 selection, but he started for three years in the SEC and consistently earned grades above 80.0 in all three campaigns. If the Jaguars ever have an injury to one of their starting offensive tackles, he is a great \"next man up\" to throw into the lineup. That depth is key.\n\nIndeed, offensive line depth was identified as one of Jacksonville's bigger needs entering the draft. although the team arguably could have benefitted from adding to its interior reserve. Foster profiles primarily as a tackle.\n\nStill, Foster will occupy a crucial role moving forward for the Jaguars as the team's swing tackle, according to general manager Trent Baalke, offering key depth on both sides of the line. Rising fourth-year lineman Walker Little has fulfilled a similar role over the past three seasons.\n\n\"We view him as swing tackle, a guy that can play left and right. He played primarily on the left side in college obviously, but went to the Senior Bowl and proved he could line up on the right side,\" Baalke said about Foster on April 27.\n\n\"You start him out in a swing position. That's for the coaches to settle in on what his role is going to be. But really like the size, the length, two-time captain, leader in the SEC, [41]-game starter. A lot of things that played into the pick.\"\n\nFoster appeared in 50 games over six seasons with Missouri, all but two offensively, and made 39 starts at left tackle with two at right tackle. He logged 2,939 offensive snaps with the Tigers and allowed eight sacks in his college career, per PFF.\n\nJacksonville's starting offensive tackle tandem entering the 2024 season consists of Cam Robinson on the left side and Anton Harrison on the right, entering their eighth and second seasons, respectively.\n\nRobinson has missed 14 games over the last three seasons due to a suspension in 2023 and multiple injuries along the way.\n\nStats, facts and fit: New Jaguars OT Javon Foster\n\nJacksonville Jaguars 2024 NFL draft recap", "source": {"uri": "jaguarswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jaguars Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zach_goodall@jaguarswire.usatoday.com", "name": "Zach Goodall", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Focus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Focus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSU_Tigers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LSU Tigers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southeastern Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Harrison", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anton Harrison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walker_Little", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Walker Little"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Senior Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Baalke", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trent Baalke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam_Robinson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cam Robinson"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://jaguarswire.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2024/04/USATSI_19617629.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550622", "eventUri": "eng-9550622", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-27", "textStart": 2131, "textEnd": 2139}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- With prominent Republicans openly questioning his competence and moral leadership, President Donald Trump burrowed deeper into the racially charged debate over Confederate memorials and lashed out at members of his own party in the latest controversy to engulf his presidency.\n\nOut of sight, but still online, Trump tweeted his defense of monuments to Confederate icons -- bemoaning rising efforts to remove them as an attack on America's \"history and culture.\"\n\nAnd he berated his critics who, with increasingly sharper language, have denounced his initially slow and then ultimately combative comments on the racial violence at a white supremacist rally last weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nTrump was much quicker Thursday to condemn violence in Barcelona, where more than a dozen people were killed when a van veered onto a sidewalk and sped down a busy pedestrian zone in what authorities called a terror attack.\n\nHe then added to his expression of support a tweet reviving a debunked legend about a U.S. general subduing Muslim rebels a century ago in the Philippines by shooting them with bullets dipped in pig blood.\n\n\"Study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught. There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\" Trump wrote.\n\nTrump's unpredictable, defiant and, critics claim, racially provocative behavior has clearly begun to wear on his Republican allies.\n\nTennessee Sen. Bob Corker, whom Trump considered for a Cabinet post, declared Thursday that \"the president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to\" in dealing with crises. And Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska tweeted, \"Anything less than complete & unambiguous condemnation of white supremacists, neo-Nazis and the KKK by the @POTUS is unacceptable. Period.\"\n\nSen. Tim Scott of South Carolina said Trump's \"moral authority is compromised.\"\n\nTrump, who is known to try to change the focus of news coverage with an attention-grabbing declaration, sought to shift Thursday from the white supremacists to the future of statues.\n\n\"You can't change history, but you can learn from it,\" he tweeted. \"Robert E. Lee. Stonewall Jackson -- who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish. ...\n\n\"Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" he tweeted.\n\nTrump met separately Thursday at his golf club in nearby Bedminster with the administrator of the Small Business Administration and Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a longtime Trump supporter. Trump also prepared for an unusual meeting Friday at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland with his national security team to discuss strategy for South Asia, including India, Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\nVice President Mike Pence was cutting short a long-planned Latin America tour to attend the meeting.\n\nThough out of public view, Trump sought to make his voice heard on Twitter as he found himself increasingly under siege and alone while fanning the controversy over race and politics toward a full-fledged national conflagration.\n\nHe dissolved two business councils Wednesday after the CEO members began quitting, damaging his central campaign promise to be a business-savvy chief executive in the Oval Office.\n\nAnd the White House said Thursday that it was abandoning plans to form an infrastructure advisory council.\n\nTwo major charities, the Cleveland Clinic and the American Cancer Society, announced they are canceling fundraisers scheduled for Trump's resort in Palm Beach, Florida, amid the continuing backlash over Trump's remarks.\n\nMeanwhile, rumblings of discontent from his staff grew so loud that the White House had to release a statement saying that Trump's chief economic adviser wasn't quitting. And the president remained on the receiving end of bipartisan criticism for his handling of the aftermath of the Charlottesville clashes.\n\nOn Thursday, he hit back hard -- against Republicans.\n\nHe accused \"publicity-seeking\" Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina of falsely stating Trump's position on the demonstrators. He called Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake \"toxic\" and praised Flake's potential primary election opponent.\n\nGraham said Wednesday that Trump \"took a step backward by again suggesting there is moral equivalency\" between the marching white supremacists and the people who had been demonstrating against them. Flake has been increasingly critical of Trump in recent weeks.\n\nPressured by advisers, the president had softened his words on the dispute Monday, two days after he had enraged many by declining to single out the white supremacists and neo-Nazis whose demonstration against the removal of a Robert E. Lee statute had led to violence and the death of a counter-protester in Charlottesville.\n\nHe returned to his combative stance Tuesday -- insisting anew during an unexpected and contentious news conference at Trump Tower that \"both sides\" were to blame.\n\nAides watching from the sidelines reacted with dismay and disbelief and privately told colleagues they were upset by the president's remarks, though not upset enough for anyone to resign.\n\nThe resignation speculation around Gary Cohn, head of the National Economic Council and a Jew, had grown so intense by Thursday that the White House released a statement saying reports that Cohn was stepping down were \"100 percent false.\"\n\nBut not all of Trump's aides were unhappy with his performance.\n\nAdviser Steve Bannon's job security in the White House has become tenuous -- Trump offered only a \"we'll see\" on Tuesday when asked if his chief strategist would remain in his post -- but Bannon has been telling allies that the president's news conference would electrify the GOP base.\n\nAnd in a pair of interviews Wednesday, Bannon cheered on the president's nationalist tendencies and suggested that a fight over Confederate monuments was a political fight he welcomes.\n\n\"The race-identity politics of the left wants to say it's all racist,\" Bannon told The New York Times. \"Just give me more. Tear down more statues. Say the revolution is coming.

Bob Corker, whom Trump considered for a Cabinet post, declared Thursday that \"the president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to\" in dealing with crises. And Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska tweeted, \"Anything less than complete & unambiguous condemnation of white supremacists, neo-Nazis and the KKK by the \u00e2\u2020*POTUS is unacceptable. Period.\"\n\nSen. Tim Scott of South Carolina said Trump's \"moral authority is compromised.\"\n\nTrump, who is known to try to change the focus of news coverage with an attention-grabbing declaration, sought to shift Thursday from the white supremacists to the future of statues.\n\n\"You can't change history, but you can learn from it,\" he tweeted. \"Robert E.

So foolish. ...\n\n\"Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" he tweeted.\n\nTrump met separately Thursday at his golf club in nearby Bedminster with the administrator of the Small Business Administration and Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a longtime Trump supporter. Trump also prepared for an unusual meeting Friday at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland with his national security team to discuss strategy for South Asia, including India, Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\nVice-President Mike Pence was cutting short a long-planned Latin America tour to attend the meeting.\n\nThough out of public view, Trump sought to make his voice heard on Twitter as he found himself increasingly under siege and alone while fanning the controversy over race and politics toward a full-fledged national conflagration.\n\nHe dissolved two business councils Wednesday after the CEO members began quitting, damaging his central campaign promise to be a business-savvy chief executive in the Oval Office.\n\nAnd the White House said Thursday that it was abandoning plans to form an infrastructure advisory council.\n\nTwo major charities, the Cleveland Clinic and the American Cancer Society, announced they are cancelling fundraisers scheduled for Trump's resort in Palm Beach, Florida, amid the continuing backlash over Trump's remarks.\n\nMeanwhile, rumblings of discontent from his staff grew so loud that the White House had to release a statement saying that Trump's chief economic adviser wasn't quitting. And the president remained on the receiving end of bipartisan criticism for his handling of the aftermath of the Charlottesville clashes.\n\nOn Thursday, he hit back hard - against Republicans.\n\nHe accused \"publicity-seeking\" Sen.

Jeff Flake \"toxic\" and praised Flake's potential primary election opponent.\n\nGraham said Wednesday that Trump \"took a step backward by again suggesting there is moral equivalency\" between the marching white supremacists and the people who had been demonstrating against them. Flake has been increasingly critical of Trump in recent weeks.\n\nPressured by advisers, the president had softened his words on the dispute Monday, two days after he had enraged many by declining to single out the white supremacists and neo-Nazis whose demonstration against the removal of a Robert E. Lee statute had led to violence and the death of a counter-protester in Charlottesville.\n\nHe returned to his combative stance Tuesday - insisting anew during an unexpected and contentious news conference at Trump Tower that \"both sides\" were to blame.\n\nAides watching from the sidelines reacted with dismay and disbelief and privately told colleagues they were upset by the president's remarks, though not upset enough for anyone to resign.\n\nThe resignation speculation around Gary Cohn, head of the National Economic Council and a Jew, had grown so intense by Thursday that the White House released a statement saying reports that Cohn was stepping down were \"100 per cent false.\"\n\nBut not all of Trump's aides were unhappy with his performance.\n\nAdviser Steve Bannon's job security in the White House has become tenuous - Trump offered only a \"we'll see\" on Tuesday when asked if his chief strategist would remain in his post - but Bannon has been telling allies that the president's news conference would electrify the GOP base.\n\nAnd in a pair of interviews Wednesday, Bannon cheered on the president's nationalist tendencies and suggested that a fight over Confederate monuments was a political fight he welcomes.\n\n\"The race-identity politics of the left wants to say it's all racist,\" Bannon told The New York Times. \"Just give me more.

There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\" Trump wrote.\n\nTrump's unpredictable, defiant and, critics claim, racially provocative behavior has clearly begun to wear on his Republican allies.\n\nTennessee Sen. Bob Corker, whom Trump considered for a Cabinet post, declared Thursday that \"the president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to\" in dealing with crises. And Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska tweeted, \"Anything less than a complete & unambiguous condemnation of white supremacists, neo-Nazis and the KKK by the @POTUS is unacceptable. Period.\"\n\nSen. Tim Scott of South Carolina said Trump's \"moral authority is compromised.\"\n\nTrump, who is known to try to change the focus of news coverage with an attention-grabbing declaration, sought to shift Thursday from the white supremacists to the future of statues.\n\n\"You can't change history, but you can learn from it,\" he tweeted. \"Robert E. Lee. Stonewall Jackson -- who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish. ...\n\n\"Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns, and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" he tweeted.\n\nTrump met separately Thursday at his golf club in nearby Bedminster with the administrator of the Small Business Administration and Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a longtime Trump supporter. Trump also prepared for an unusual meeting Friday at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland with his national security team to discuss strategy for South Asia, including India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan.\n\nVice President Mike Pence was cutting short a long-planned Latin America tour to attend the meeting.\n\nThough out of public view, Trump sought to make his voice heard on Twitter as he found himself increasingly under siege and alone while fanning the controversy over race and politics toward a full-fledged national conflagration.\n\nHe dissolved two business councils Wednesday after the CEO members began quitting, damaging his central campaign promise to be a business-savvy chief executive in the Oval Office.\n\nAnd the White House said Thursday that it was abandoning plans to form an infrastructure advisory council.\n\nTwo major charities, the Cleveland Clinic and the American Cancer Society, announced they are canceling fundraisers scheduled for Trump's resort in Palm Beach, Florida, amid the continuing backlash over Trump's remarks.\n\nMeanwhile, rumblings of discontent from his staff grew so loud that the White House had to release a statement saying that Trump's chief economic adviser wasn't quitting. And the president remained on the receiving end of bipartisan criticism for his handling of the aftermath of the Charlottesville clashes.\n\nOn Thursday, he hit back hard -- against Republicans.\n\nHe accused \"publicity-seeking\" Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina of falsely stating Trump's position on the demonstrators. He called Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake \"toxic\" and praised Flake's potential primary election opponent.\n\nGraham said Wednesday that Trump \"took a step backward by again suggesting there is moral equivalency\" between the marching white supremacists and the people who had been demonstrating against them. Flake has been increasingly critical of Trump in recent weeks.\n\nPressured by advisers, the president had softened his words on the dispute Monday, two days after he had enraged many by declining to single out the white supremacists and neo-Nazis whose demonstration against the removal of a Robert E. Lee statue had led to violence and the death of a counter-protester in Charlottesville.\n\nHe returned to his combative stance Tuesday -- insisting anew during an unexpected and contentious news conference at Trump Tower that \"both sides\" were to blame.\n\nAides watching from the sidelines reacted with dismay and disbelief and privately told colleagues they were upset by the president's remarks, though not upset enough for anyone to resign.\n\nThe resignation speculation around Gary Cohn, head of the National Economic Council and a Jew, had grown so intense by Thursday that the White House released a statement saying reports that Cohn was stepping down were \"100 percent false.\"\n\nBut not all of Trump's aides were unhappy with his performance.\n\nAdviser Steve Bannon's job security in the White House has become tenuous -- Trump offered only a \"we'll see\" on Tuesday when asked if his chief strategist would remain in his post -- but Bannon has been telling allies that the president's news conference would electrify the GOP base.\n\nAnd in a pair of interviews Wednesday, Bannon cheered on the president's nationalist tendencies and suggested that a fight over Confederate monuments was a political fight he welcomes.\n\n\"The race-identity politics of the left wants to say it's all racist,\" Bannon told The New York Times. \"Just give me more. Tear down more statues. Say the revolution is coming. I can't get enough of it.\"\n\nShow Comments\n\nAn-Nahar is not responsible for the comments that users post below.

There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\" Trump wrote.\n\nTrump's unpredictable, defiant and, critics claim, racially provocative behavior has clearly begun to wear on his Republican allies.\n\nTennessee Sen. Bob Corker, whom Trump considered for a Cabinet post, declared Thursday that \"the president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to\" in dealing with crises. And Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska tweeted, \"Anything less than complete & unambiguous condemnation of white supremacists, neo-Nazis and the KKK by the @POTUS is unacceptable. Period.\"\n\nSen. Tim Scott of South Carolina said Trump's \"moral authority is compromised.\"\n\nTrump, who is known to try to change the focus of news coverage with an attention-grabbing declaration, sought to shift Thursday from the white supremacists to the future of statues.\n\n\"You can't change history, but you can learn from it,\" he tweeted. \"Robert E. Lee. Stonewall Jackson -- who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish. ...\n\n\"Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" he tweeted.\n\nTrump met separately Thursday at his golf club in nearby Bedminster with the administrator of the Small Business Administration and Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a longtime Trump supporter. Trump also prepared for an unusual meeting Friday at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland with his national security team to discuss strategy for South Asia, including India, Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\nVice President Mike Pence was cutting short a long-planned Latin America tour to attend the meeting.\n\nThough out of public view, Trump sought to make his voice heard on Twitter as he found himself increasingly under siege and alone while fanning the controversy over race and politics toward a full-fledged national conflagration.\n\nHe dissolved two business councils Wednesday after the CEO members began quitting, damaging his central campaign promise to be a business-savvy chief executive in the Oval Office.\n\nAnd the White House said Thursday that it was abandoning plans to form an infrastructure advisory council.\n\nTwo major charities, the Cleveland Clinic and the American Cancer Society, announced they are canceling fundraisers scheduled for Trump's resort in Palm Beach, Florida, amid the continuing backlash over Trump's remarks.\n\nMeanwhile, rumblings of discontent from his staff grew so loud that the White House had to release a statement saying that Trump's chief economic adviser wasn't quitting. And the president remained on the receiving end of bipartisan criticism for his handling of the aftermath of the Charlottesville clashes.\n\nOn Thursday, he hit back hard -- against Republicans.\n\nHe accused \"publicity-seeking\" Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina of falsely stating Trump's position on the demonstrators. He called Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake \"toxic\" and praised Flake's potential primary election opponent.\n\nGraham said Wednesday that Trump \"took a step backward by again suggesting there is moral equivalency\" between the marching white supremacists and the people who had been demonstrating against them. Flake has been increasingly critical of Trump in recent weeks.\n\nPressured by advisers, the president had softened his words on the dispute Monday, two days after he had enraged many by declining to single out the white supremacists and neo-Nazis whose demonstration against the removal of a Robert E. Lee statute had led to violence and the death of a counter-protester in Charlottesville.\n\nHe returned to his combative stance Tuesday -- insisting anew during an unexpected and contentious news conference at Trump Tower that \"both sides\" were to blame.\n\nAides watching from the sidelines reacted with dismay and disbelief and privately told colleagues they were upset by the president's remarks, though not upset enough for anyone to resign.\n\nThe resignation speculation around Gary Cohn, head of the National Economic Council and a Jew, had grown so intense by Thursday that the White House released a statement saying reports that Cohn was stepping down were \"100 percent false.\"\n\nBut not all of Trump's aides were unhappy with his performance.\n\nAdviser Steve Bannon's job security in the White House has become tenuous -- Trump offered only a \"we'll see\" on Tuesday when asked if his chief strategist would remain in his post -- but Bannon has been telling allies that the president's news conference would electrify the GOP base.\n\nAnd in a pair of interviews Wednesday, Bannon cheered on the president's nationalist tendencies and suggested that a fight over Confederate monuments was a political fight he welcomes.\n\n\"The race-identity politics of the left wants to say it's all racist,\" Bannon told The New York Times. \"Just give me more. Tear down more statues. Say the revolution is coming. I can't get enough of it.\"\n\n___\n\nLemire reported from New York.

There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\" Trump wrote.\n\nTrump's unpredictable, defiant and, critics claim, racially provocative behavior has clearly begun to wear on his Republican allies.\n\nTennessee Sen. Bob Corker, whom Trump considered for a Cabinet post, declared Thursday that \"the president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to\" in dealing with crises. And Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska tweeted, \"Anything less than complete & unambiguous condemnation of white supremacists, neo-Nazis and the KKK by the @POTUS is unacceptable. Period.\"\n\nSen. Tim Scott of South Carolina said Trump's \"moral authority is compromised.\"\n\nTrump, who is known to try to change the focus of news coverage with an attention-grabbing declaration, sought to shift Thursday from the white supremacists to the future of statues.\n\n\"You can't change history, but you can learn from it,\" he tweeted. \"Robert E.

And the president remained on the receiving end of bipartisan criticism for his handling of the aftermath of the Charlottesville clashes.\n\nOn Thursday, he hit back hard -- against Republicans.\n\nHe accused \"publicity-seeking\" Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina of falsely stating Trump's position on the demonstrators. He called Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake \"toxic\" and praised Flake's potential primary election opponent.\n\nGraham said Wednesday that Trump \"took a step backward by again suggesting there is moral equivalency\" between the marching white supremacists and the people who had been demonstrating against them. Flake has been increasingly critical of Trump in recent weeks.\n\nPressured by advisers, the president had softened his words on the dispute Monday, two days after he had enraged many by declining to single out the white supremacists and neo-Nazis whose demonstration against the removal of a Robert E. Lee statute had led to violence and the death of a counter-protester in Charlottesville.\n\nHe returned to his combative stance Tuesday -- insisting anew during an unexpected and contentious news conference at Trump Tower that \"both sides\" were to blame.\n\nAides watching from the sidelines reacted with dismay and disbelief and privately told colleagues they were upset by the president's remarks, though not upset enough for anyone to resign.\n\nThe resignation speculation around Gary Cohn, head of the National Economic Council and a Jew, had grown so intense by Thursday that the White House released a statement saying reports that Cohn was stepping down were \"100 percent false.\"\n\nBut not all of Trump's aides were unhappy with his performance.\n\nAdviser Steve Bannon's job security in the White House has become tenuous -- Trump offered only a \"we'll see\" on Tuesday when asked if his chief strategist would remain in his post -- but Bannon has been telling allies that the president's news conference would electrify the GOP base.\n\nAnd in a pair of interviews Wednesday, Bannon cheered on the president's nationalist tendencies and suggested that a fight over Confederate monuments was a political fight he welcomes.\n\n\"The race-identity politics of the left wants to say it's all racist,\" Bannon told The New York Times. \"Just give me more.

(Aug. 17)\n\nBRIDGEWATER, N.J. (AP) -- With prominent Republicans openly questioning his competence and moral leadership, President Donald Trump on Thursday burrowed deeper into the racially charged debate over Confederate memorials and lashed out at members of his own party in the latest controversy to engulf his presidency.\n\nOut of sight, but still online, Trump tweeted his defense of monuments to Confederate icons -- bemoaning rising efforts to remove them as an attack on America's \"history and culture.\"\n\nAnd he berated his critics who, with increasingly sharper language, have denounced his initially slow and then ultimately combative comments on the racial violence at a white supremacist rally last weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nTrump was much quicker Thursday to condemn violence in Barcelona, where more than a dozen people were killed when a van veered onto a sidewalk and sped down a busy pedestrian zone in what authorities called a terror attack.\n\nHe then added to his expression of support a tweet reviving a debunked legend about a U.S. general subduing Muslim rebels a century ago in the Philippines by shooting them with bullets dipped in pig blood.\n\n\"Study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught. There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\" Trump wrote.\n\nTrump's unpredictable, defiant and, critics claim, racially provocative behavior has clearly begun to wear on his Republican allies.\n\nTennessee Sen. Bob Corker, whom Trump considered for a Cabinet post, declared Thursday that \"the president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to\" in dealing with crises. And Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska tweeted, \"Anything less than complete & unambiguous condemnation of white supremacists, neo-Nazis and the KKK by the @POTUS is unacceptable. Period.\"\n\nSen. Tim Scott of South Carolina said Trump's \"moral authority is compromised.\"\n\nTrump, who is known to try to change the focus of news coverage with an attention-grabbing declaration, sought to shift Thursday from the white supremacists to the future of statues.\n\n\"You can't change history, but you can learn from it,\" he tweeted. \"Robert E. Lee. Stonewall Jackson -- who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish. ...\n\n\"Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" he tweeted.\n\nTrump met separately Thursday at his golf club in nearby Bedminster with the administrator of the Small Business Administration and Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a longtime Trump supporter. Trump also prepared for an unusual meeting Friday at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland with his national security team to discuss strategy for South Asia, including India, Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\nVice President Mike Pence was cutting short a long-planned Latin America tour to attend the meeting.\n\nThough out of public view, Trump sought to make his voice heard on Twitter as he found himself increasingly under siege and alone while fanning the controversy over race and politics toward a full-fledged national conflagration.\n\nHe dissolved two business councils Wednesday after the CEO members began quitting, damaging his central campaign promise to be a business-savvy chief executive in the Oval Office.\n\nAnd the White House said Thursday that it was abandoning plans to form an infrastructure advisory council.\n\nTwo major charities, the Cleveland Clinic and the American Cancer Society, announced they are canceling fundraisers scheduled for Trump's resort in Palm Beach, Florida, amid the continuing backlash over Trump's remarks.\n\nMeanwhile, rumblings of discontent from his staff grew so loud that the White House had to release a statement saying that Trump's chief economic adviser wasn't quitting. And the president remained on the receiving end of bipartisan criticism for his handling of the aftermath of the Charlottesville clashes.\n\nOn Thursday, he hit back hard -- against Republicans.\n\nHe accused \"publicity-seeking\" Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina of falsely stating Trump's position on the demonstrators. He called Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake \"toxic\" and praised Flake's potential primary election opponent.\n\nGraham said Wednesday that Trump \"took a step backward by again suggesting there is moral equivalency\" between the marching white supremacists and the people who had been demonstrating against them. Flake has been increasingly critical of Trump in recent weeks.\n\nPressured by advisers, the president had softened his words on the dispute Monday, two days after he had enraged many by declining to single out the white supremacists and neo-Nazis whose demonstration against the removal of a Robert E. Lee statute had led to violence and the death of a counter-protester in Charlottesville.\n\nHe returned to his combative stance Tuesday -- insisting anew during an unexpected and contentious news conference at Trump Tower that \"both sides\" were to blame.\n\nAides watching from the sidelines reacted with dismay and disbelief and privately told colleagues they were upset by the president's remarks, though not upset enough for anyone to resign.\n\nThe resignation speculation around Gary Cohn, head of the National Economic Council and a Jew, had grown so intense by Thursday that the White House released a statement saying reports that Cohn was stepping down were \"100 percent false.\"\n\nBut not all of Trump's aides were unhappy with his performance.\n\nAdviser Steve Bannon's job security in the White House has become tenuous -- Trump offered only a \"we'll see\" on Tuesday when asked if his chief strategist would remain in his post -- but Bannon has been telling allies that the president's news conference would electrify the GOP base.\n\nAnd in a pair of interviews Wednesday, Bannon cheered on the president's nationalist tendencies and suggested that a fight over Confederate monuments was a political fight he welcomes.\n\n\"The race-identity politics of the left wants to say it's all racist,\" Bannon told The New York Times. \"Just give me more. Tear down more statues. Say the revolution is coming. I can't get enough of it.\"\n\n-- -- --\n\nLemire reported from New York.

(AP) - With prominent Republicans openly questioning his competence and moral leadership, President Donald Trump burrowed deeper into the racially charged debate over Confederate memorials and lashed out at members of his own party in the latest controversy to engulf his presidency.\n\nOut of sight, but still online, Trump tweeted his defense of monuments to Confederate icons - bemoaning rising efforts to remove them as an attack on America's \"history and culture.\"\n\nAnd he berated his critics who, with increasingly sharper language, have denounced his initially slow and then ultimately combative comments on the racial violence at a white supremacist rally last weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nTrump was much quicker Thursday to condemn violence in Barcelona, where more than a dozen people were killed when a van veered onto a sidewalk and sped down a busy pedestrian zone in what authorities called a terror attack.\n\nHe then added to his expression of support a tweet reviving a debunked legend about a U.S. general subduing Muslim rebels a century ago in the Philippines by shooting them with bullets dipped in pig blood.\n\n\"Study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught. There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\" Trump wrote.\n\nTrump's unpredictable, defiant and, critics claim, racially provocative behavior has clearly begun to wear on his Republican allies.\n\nTennessee Sen. Bob Corker, whom Trump considered for a Cabinet post, declared Thursday that \"the president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to\" in dealing with crises. And Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska tweeted, \"Anything less than complete & unambiguous condemnation of white supremacists, neo-Nazis and the KKK by the @POTUS is unacceptable. Period.\"\n\nSen. Tim Scott of South Carolina said Trump's \"moral authority is compromised.\"\n\nTrump, who is known to try to change the focus of news coverage with an attention-grabbing declaration, sought to shift Thursday from the white supremacists to the future of statues.\n\n\"You can't change history, but you can learn from it,\" he tweeted. \"Robert E. Lee. Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish. ...\n\n\"Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" he tweeted.\n\nTrump met separately Thursday at his golf club in nearby Bedminster with the administrator of the Small Business Administration and Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a longtime Trump supporter. Trump also prepared for an unusual meeting Friday at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland with his national security team to discuss strategy for South Asia, including India, Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\nVice President Mike Pence was cutting short a long-planned Latin America tour to attend the meeting.\n\nThough out of public view, Trump sought to make his voice heard on Twitter as he found himself increasingly under siege and alone while fanning the controversy over race and politics toward a full-fledged national conflagration.\n\nHe dissolved two business councils Wednesday after the CEO members began quitting, damaging his central campaign promise to be a business-savvy chief executive in the Oval Office.\n\nAnd the White House said Thursday that it was abandoning plans to form an infrastructure advisory council.\n\nTwo major charities, the Cleveland Clinic and the American Cancer Society, announced they are canceling fundraisers scheduled for Trump's resort in Palm Beach, Florida, amid the continuing backlash over Trump's remarks.\n\nMeanwhile, rumblings of discontent from his staff grew so loud that the White House had to release a statement saying that Trump's chief economic adviser wasn't quitting. And the president remained on the receiving end of bipartisan criticism for his handling of the aftermath of the Charlottesville clashes.\n\nOn Thursday, he hit back hard - against Republicans.\n\nHe accused \"publicity-seeking\" Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina of falsely stating Trump's position on the demonstrators. He called Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake \"toxic\" and praised Flake's potential primary election opponent.\n\nGraham said Wednesday that Trump \"took a step backward by again suggesting there is moral equivalency\" between the marching white supremacists and the people who had been demonstrating against them. Flake has been increasingly critical of Trump in recent weeks.\n\nPressured by advisers, the president had softened his words on the dispute Monday, two days after he had enraged many by declining to single out the white supremacists and neo-Nazis whose demonstration against the removal of a Robert E. Lee statute had led to violence and the death of a counter-protester in Charlottesville.\n\nHe returned to his combative stance Tuesday - insisting anew during an unexpected and contentious news conference at Trump Tower that \"both sides\" were to blame.\n\nAides watching from the sidelines reacted with dismay and disbelief and privately told colleagues they were upset by the president's remarks, though not upset enough for anyone to resign.\n\nThe resignation speculation around Gary Cohn, head of the National Economic Council and a Jew, had grown so intense by Thursday that the White House released a statement saying reports that Cohn was stepping down were \"100 percent false.\"\n\nBut not all of Trump's aides were unhappy with his performance.\n\nAdviser Steve Bannon's job security in the White House has become tenuous - Trump offered only a \"we'll see\" on Tuesday when asked if his chief strategist would remain in his post - but Bannon has been telling allies that the president's news conference would electrify the GOP base.\n\nAnd in a pair of interviews Wednesday, Bannon cheered on the president's nationalist tendencies and suggested that a fight over Confederate monuments was a political fight he welcomes.\n\n\"The race-identity politics of the left wants to say it's all racist,\" Bannon told The New York Times. \"Just give me more. Tear down more statues. Say the revolution is coming. I can't get enough of it.\"\n\n___\n\nLemire reported from New York.

There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\" Trump wrote.\n\nTrump's unpredictable, defiant and, critics claim, racially provocative behaviour has clearly begun to wear on his Republican allies.\n\nTennessee Sen. Bob Corker, whom Trump considered for a Cabinet post, declared Thursday that \"the president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to\" in dealing with crises. And Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska tweeted, \"Anything less than complete & unambiguous condemnation of white supremacists, neo-Nazis and the KKK by the \u0393\u00e5\u00f2POTUS is unacceptable. Period.\"\n\nSen. Tim Scott of South Carolina said Trump's \"moral authority is compromised.\"\n\nTrump, who is known to try to change the focus of news coverage with an attention-grabbing declaration, sought to shift Thursday from the white supremacists to the future of statues.\n\n\"You can't change history, but you can learn from it,\" he tweeted. \"Robert E. Lee. Stonewall Jackson -- who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish. ...\n\n\"Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" he tweeted.\n\nTrump met separately Thursday at his golf club in nearby Bedminster with the administrator of the Small Business Administration and Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a longtime Trump supporter. Trump also prepared for an unusual meeting Friday at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland with his national security team to discuss strategy for South Asia, including India, Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\nVice-President Mike Pence was cutting short a long-planned Latin America tour to attend the meeting.\n\nThough out of public view, Trump sought to make his voice heard on Twitter as he found himself increasingly under siege and alone while fanning the controversy over race and politics toward a full-fledged national conflagration.\n\nHe dissolved two business councils Wednesday after the CEO members began quitting, damaging his central campaign promise to be a business-savvy chief executive in the Oval Office.\n\nAnd the White House said Thursday that it was abandoning plans to form an infrastructure advisory council.\n\nTwo major charities, the Cleveland Clinic and the American Cancer Society, announced they are cancelling fundraisers scheduled for Trump's resort in Palm Beach, Florida, amid the continuing backlash over Trump's remarks.\n\nAnd the CEO of 21st Century Fox, James Murdoch, has denounced racism and terrorists while expressing concern over Trump's statements.\n\nMurdoch writes that the event in Charlottesville and Trump's response is a concern for all people. \"I can't believe I have to write this: standing up to Nazis is essential; there are no good Nazis. Or Klansmen, or terrorists.\"\n\nMurdoch is the son of the company's co-executive chairman, Rupert Murdoch, a Trump confidant.\n\nMeanwhile, rumblings of discontent from Trump's staff grew so loud that the White House had to release a statement saying that Trump's chief economic adviser wasn't quitting. And the president remained on the receiving end of bipartisan criticism for his handling of the aftermath of the Charlottesville clashes.\n\nOn Thursday, he hit back hard -- against Republicans.\n\nHe accused \"publicity-seeking\" Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina of falsely stating Trump's position on the demonstrators. He called Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake \"toxic\" and praised Flake's potential primary election opponent.\n\nGraham said Wednesday that Trump \"took a step backward by again suggesting there is moral equivalency\" between the marching white supremacists and the people who had been demonstrating against them. Flake has been increasingly critical of Trump in recent weeks.\n\nPressured by advisers, the president had softened his words on the dispute Monday, two days after he had enraged many by declining to single out the white supremacists and neo-Nazis whose demonstration against the removal of a Robert E. Lee statute had led to violence and the death of a counter-protester in Charlottesville.\n\nHe returned to his combative stance Tuesday -- insisting anew during an unexpected and contentious news conference at Trump Tower that \"both sides\" were to blame.\n\nAides watching from the sidelines reacted with dismay and disbelief and privately told colleagues they were upset by the president's remarks, though not upset enough for anyone to resign.\n\nThe resignation speculation around Gary Cohn, head of the National Economic Council and a Jew, had grown so intense by Thursday that the White House released a statement saying reports that Cohn was stepping down were \"100 per cent false.\"\n\nBut not all of Trump's aides were unhappy with his performance.\n\nAdviser Steve Bannon's job security in the White House has become tenuous -- Trump offered only a \"we'll see\" on Tuesday when asked if his chief strategist would remain in his post -- but Bannon has been telling allies that the president's news conference would electrify the GOP base.\n\nAnd in a pair of interviews Wednesday, Bannon cheered on the president's nationalist tendencies and suggested that a fight over Confederate monuments was a political fight he welcomes.\n\n\"The race-identity politics of the left wants to say it's all racist,\" Bannon told The New York Times. \"Just give me more. Tear down more statues. Say the revolution is coming. I can't get enough of it.\"\n\n------", "id": "9889639", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Trump defends Confederate statues, berates his critics", "image":

There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\" Trump wrote.\n\nTrump's unpredictable, defiant and, critics claim, racially provocative behavior has clearly begun to wear on his Republican allies.\n\nTennessee Sen. Bob Corker, whom Trump considered for a Cabinet post, declared Thursday that \"the president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to\" in dealing with crises. And Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska tweeted, \"Anything less than complete & unambiguous condemnation of white supremacists, neo-Nazis and the KKK by the @POTUS is unacceptable. Period.\"\n\nSen. Tim Scott of South Carolina said Trump's \"moral authority is compromised.\"\n\nTrump, who is known to try to change the focus of news coverage with an attention-grabbing declaration, sought to shift Thursday from the white supremacists to the future of statues.\n\n\"You can't change history, but you can learn from it,\" he tweeted. \"Robert E. Lee. Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish. ...\n\n\"Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" he tweeted.\n\nTrump met separately Thursday at his golf club in nearby Bedminster with the administrator of the Small Business Administration and Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a longtime Trump supporter. Trump also prepared for an unusual meeting Friday at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland with his national security team to discuss strategy for South Asia, including India, Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\nVice President Mike Pence was cutting short a long-planned Latin America tour to attend the meeting.\n\nThough out of public view, Trump sought to make his voice heard on Twitter as he found himself increasingly under siege and alone while fanning the controversy over race and politics toward a full-fledged national conflagration.\n\nHe dissolved two business councils Wednesday after the CEO members began quitting, damaging his central campaign promise to be a business-savvy chief executive in the Oval Office.\n\nAnd the White House said Thursday that it was abandoning plans to form an infrastructure advisory council.\n\nTwo major charities, the Cleveland Clinic and the American Cancer Society, announced they are canceling fundraisers scheduled for Trump's resort in Palm Beach, Florida, amid the continuing backlash over Trump's remarks.\n\nMeanwhile, rumblings of discontent from his staff grew so loud that the White House had to release a statement saying that Trump's chief economic adviser wasn't quitting. And the president remained on the receiving end of bipartisan criticism for his handling of the aftermath of the Charlottesville clashes.\n\nOn Thursday, he hit back hard - against Republicans.\n\nHe accused \"publicity-seeking\" Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina of falsely stating Trump's position on the demonstrators. He called Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake \"toxic\" and praised Flake's potential primary election opponent.\n\nGraham said Wednesday that Trump \"took a step backward by again suggesting there is moral equivalency\" between the marching white supremacists and the people who had been demonstrating against them. Flake has been increasingly critical of Trump in recent weeks.\n\nPressured by advisers, the president had softened his words on the dispute Monday, two days after he had enraged many by declining to single out the white supremacists and neo-Nazis whose demonstration against the removal of a Robert E. Lee statute had led to violence and the death of a counter-protester in Charlottesville.\n\nHe returned to his combative stance Tuesday - insisting anew during an unexpected and contentious news conference at Trump Tower that \"both sides\" were to blame.\n\nAides watching from the sidelines reacted with dismay and disbelief and privately told colleagues they were upset by the president's remarks, though not upset enough for anyone to resign.\n\nThe resignation speculation around Gary Cohn, head of the National Economic Council and a Jew, had grown so intense by Thursday that the White House released a statement saying reports that Cohn was stepping down were \"100 percent false.\"\n\nBut not all of Trump's aides were unhappy with his performance.\n\nAdviser Steve Bannon's job security in the White House has become tenuous - Trump offered only a \"we'll see\" on Tuesday when asked if his chief strategist would remain in his post - but Bannon has been telling allies that the president's news conference would electrify the GOP base.\n\nAnd in a pair of interviews Wednesday, Bannon cheered on the president's nationalist tendencies and suggested that a fight over Confederate monuments was a political fight he welcomes.\n\n\"The race-identity politics of the left wants to say it's all racist,\" Bannon told The New York Times. \"Just give me more. Tear down more statues. Say the revolution is coming. I can't get enough of it.\"\n\n___\n\nLemire reported from New York.

There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\" Trump wrote.\n\nTrump's unpredictable, defiant and, critics claim, racially provocative behavior has clearly begun to wear on his Republican allies.\n\nTennessee Sen. Bob Corker, whom Trump considered for a Cabinet post, declared Thursday that \"the president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to\" in dealing with crises. And Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska tweeted, \"Anything less than complete & unambiguous condemnation of white supremacists, neo-Nazis and the KKK by the @POTUS is unacceptable. Period.\"\n\nSen. Tim Scott of South Carolina said Trump's \"moral authority is compromised.\"\n\nTrump, who is known to try to change the focus of news coverage with an attention-grabbing declaration, sought to shift Thursday from the white supremacists to the future of statues.\n\n\"You can't change history, but you can learn from it,\" he tweeted. \"Robert E. Lee. Stonewall Jackson -- who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish. ...\n\n\"Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" he tweeted.\n\nTrump met separately Thursday at his golf club in nearby Bedminster with the administrator of the Small Business Administration and Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a longtime Trump supporter. Trump also prepared for an unusual meeting Friday at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland with his national security team to discuss strategy for South Asia, including India, Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\nVice President Mike Pence was cutting short a long-planned Latin America tour to attend the meeting.\n\nThough out of public view, Trump sought to make his voice heard on Twitter as he found himself increasingly under siege and alone while fanning the controversy over race and politics toward a full-fledged national conflagration.\n\nHe dissolved two business councils Wednesday after the CEO members began quitting, damaging his central campaign promise to be a business-savvy chief executive in the Oval Office.\n\nAnd the White House said Thursday that it was abandoning plans to form an infrastructure advisory council.\n\nTwo major charities, the Cleveland Clinic and the American Cancer Society, announced they are canceling fundraisers scheduled for Trump's resort in Palm Beach, Florida, amid the continuing backlash over Trump's remarks.\n\nMeanwhile, rumblings of discontent from his staff grew so loud that the White House had to release a statement saying that Trump's chief economic adviser wasn't quitting. And the president remained on the receiving end of bipartisan criticism for his handling of the aftermath of the Charlottesville clashes.\n\nOn Thursday, he hit back hard -- against Republicans.\n\nHe accused \"publicity-seeking\" Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina of falsely stating Trump's position on the demonstrators. He called Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake \"toxic\" and praised Flake's potential primary election opponent.\n\nGraham said Wednesday that Trump \"took a step backward by again suggesting there is moral equivalency\" between the marching white supremacists and the people who had been demonstrating against them. Flake has been increasingly critical of Trump in recent weeks.\n\nPressured by advisers, the president had softened his words on the dispute Monday, two days after he had enraged many by declining to single out the white supremacists and neo-Nazis whose demonstration against the removal of a Robert E. Lee statute had led to violence and the death of a counter-protester in Charlottesville.\n\nHe returned to his combative stance Tuesday -- insisting anew during an unexpected and contentious news conference at Trump Tower that \"both sides\" were to blame.\n\nAides watching from the sidelines reacted with dismay and disbelief and privately told colleagues they were upset by the president's remarks, though not upset enough for anyone to resign.\n\nThe resignation speculation around Gary Cohn, head of the National Economic Council and a Jew, had grown so intense by Thursday that the White House released a statement saying reports that Cohn was stepping down were \"100 percent false.\"\n\nBut not all of Trump's aides were unhappy with his performance.\n\nAdviser Steve Bannon's job security in the White House has become tenuous -- Trump offered only a \"we'll see\" on Tuesday when asked if his chief strategist would remain in his post -- but Bannon has been telling allies that the president's news conference would electrify the GOP base.\n\nAnd in a pair of interviews Wednesday, Bannon cheered on the president's nationalist tendencies and suggested that a fight over Confederate monuments was a political fight he welcomes.\n\n\"The race-identity politics of the left wants to say it's all racist,\" Bannon told The New York Times. \"Just give me more. Tear down more statues. Say the revolution is coming.

(AP) -- With prominent Republicans openly questioning his competence and moral leadership, President Donald Trump burrowed deeper into the racially charged debate over Confederate memorials and lashed out at members of his own party in the latest controversy to engulf his presidency.\n\nOut of sight, but still online, Trump tweeted his defense of monuments to Confederate icons -- bemoaning rising efforts to remove them as an attack on America's \"history and culture.\"\n\nAnd he berated his critics who, with increasingly sharper language, have denounced his initially slow and then ultimately combative comments on the racial violence at a white supremacist rally last weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nTrump was much quicker Thursday to condemn violence in Barcelona, where more than a dozen people were killed when a van veered onto a sidewalk and sped down a busy pedestrian zone in what authorities called a terror attack.\n\nSponsored Content: Sign up for a free webinar as DoD, Air Force and VA offer insights on cybersecurity strategies.\n\nHe then added to his expression of support a tweet reviving a debunked legend about a U.S. general subduing Muslim rebels a century ago in the Philippines by shooting them with bullets dipped in pig blood.\n\n\"Study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught. There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\" Trump wrote.\n\nTrump's unpredictable, defiant and, critics claim, racially provocative behavior has clearly begun to wear on his Republican allies.\n\nTennessee Sen. Bob Corker, whom Trump considered for a Cabinet post, declared Thursday that \"the president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to\" in dealing with crises. And Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska tweeted, \"Anything less than complete & unambiguous condemnation of white supremacists, neo-Nazis and the KKK by the @POTUS is unacceptable. Period.\"\n\nSen. Tim Scott of South Carolina said Trump's \"moral authority is compromised.\"\n\nTrump, who is known to try to change the focus of news coverage with an attention-grabbing declaration, sought to shift Thursday from the white supremacists to the future of statues.\n\nPostal Service may be able to raise price of stamps this fall\n\n\"You can't change history, but you can learn from it,\" he tweeted. \"Robert E.

Period.\"\n\nSenator Tim Scott of South Carolina said the president's \"moral authority is compromised\".\n\nMr Trump, who is known to try to change the focus of news coverage with an attention-grabbing declaration, sought to shift focus from the white supremacists to the future of statues.\n\nSad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments.

Rick Scott, a longtime Trump supporter. Trump also prepared for an unusual meeting Friday at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland with his national security team to discuss strategy for South Asia, including India, Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\nVice President Mike Pence was cutting short a long-planned Latin America tour to attend the meeting.\n\nThough out of public view, Trump sought to make his voice heard on Twitter as he found himself increasingly under siege and alone while fanning the controversy over race and politics toward a full-fledged national conflagration.\n\nHe dissolved two business councils Wednesday after the CEO members began quitting, damaging his central campaign promise to be a business-savvy chief executive in the Oval Office.\n\nAnd the White House said Thursday that it was abandoning plans to form an infrastructure advisory council.\n\nTwo major charities, the Cleveland Clinic and the American Cancer Society, announced they are canceling fundraisers scheduled for Trump's resort in Palm Beach, Florida, amid the continuing backlash over Trump's remarks.\n\nMeanwhile, rumblings of discontent from his staff grew so loud that the White House had to release a statement saying that Trump's chief economic adviser wasn't quitting. And the president remained on the receiving end of bipartisan criticism for his handling of the aftermath of the Charlottesville clashes.\n\nOn Thursday, he hit back hard -- against Republicans.\n\nHe accused \"publicity-seeking\" Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina of falsely stating Trump's position on the demonstrators. He called Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake \"toxic\" and praised Flake's potential primary election opponent.\n\nGraham said Wednesday that Trump \"took a step backward by again suggesting there is moral equivalency\" between the marching white supremacists and the people who had been demonstrating against them. Flake has been increasingly critical of Trump in recent weeks.\n\nPressured by advisers, the president had softened his words on the dispute Monday, two days after he had enraged many by declining to single out the white supremacists and neo-Nazis whose demonstration against the removal of a Robert E. Lee statute had led to violence and the death of a counter-protester in Charlottesville.\n\nHe returned to his combative stance Tuesday -- insisting anew during an unexpected and contentious news conference at Trump Tower that \"both sides\" were to blame.\n\nAides watching from the sidelines reacted with dismay and disbelief and privately told colleagues they were upset by the president's remarks, though not upset enough for anyone to resign.\n\nThe resignation speculation around Gary Cohn, head of the National Economic Council and a Jew, had grown so intense by Thursday that the White House released a statement saying reports that Cohn was stepping down were \"100 percent false.\"\n\nBut not all of Trump's aides were unhappy with his performance.\n\nAdviser Steve Bannon's job security in the White House has become tenuous -- Trump offered only a \"we'll see\" on Tuesday when asked if his chief strategist would remain in his post -- but Bannon has been telling allies that the president's news conference would electrify the GOP base.\n\nAnd in a pair of interviews Wednesday, Bannon cheered on the president's nationalist tendencies and suggested that a fight over Confederate monuments was a political fight he welcomes.\n\n\"The race-identity politics of the left wants to say it's all racist,\" Bannon told The New York Times. \"Just give me more.

There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\"\n\nMr Trump's unpredictable, defiant and, critics claim, racially provocative behaviour has clearly begun to anger his Republican allies.\n\nSenator Bob Corker of Tennessee, who Mr Trump considered for a Cabinet post, declared \"the president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to\" in dealing with crises.\n\nAnd Senator Dan Sullivan of Alaska tweeted: \"Anything less than complete & unambiguous condemnation of white supremacists, neo-Nazis and the KKK by the @POTUS is unacceptable. Period.\"\n\nSenator Tim Scott of South Carolina said the president's \"moral authority is compromised\".\n\nMr Trump, who is known to try to change the focus of news coverage with an attention-grabbing declaration, sought to shift focus from the white supremacists to the future of statues.\n\n\"You can't change history, but you can learn from it,\" he tweeted. \"Robert E Lee. Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish.\n\n\"Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" he tweeted.\n\nMr Trump found himself increasingly under siege and alone while fanning the controversy over race and politics towards a full-fledged national conflagration.\n\nHe dissolved two business councils on Wednesday after the chief executive members began quitting.\n\nThat damaged his central campaign promise to be a business-savvy chief executive in the Oval Office.\n\nAnd the White House said on Thursday it was abandoning plans to form an infrastructure advisory council.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8Cancel Play now\n\nTwo major charities, the Cleveland Clinic and the American Cancer Society, cancelled fundraisers scheduled for Mr Trump's resort in Palm Beach, Florida, amid the continuing backlash over the president's remarks.\n\nMeanwhile, rumblings of discontent from his staff grew so loud that the White House had to release a statement saying Mr Trump's chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn, head of the National Economic Council and a Jew, was not quitting.\n\nThe president hit back hard against Republicans, accusing \"publicity-seeking\" Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina of falsely stating Mr Trump's position on the Charlottesville demonstrators.\n\nHe called Arizona Senator Jeff Flake \"toxic\" and praised his potential primary election opponent.\n\nMr Graham had said Mr Trump \"took a step backward by again suggesting there is moral equivalency\" between the marching white supremacists and the people who had been demonstrating against them.\n\nPressured by advisers, the president had softened his words on the dispute on Monday.\n\nThat was two days after he had enraged many by declining to single out the white supremacists and neo-Nazis whose demonstration against the removal of a Robert E Lee statute had led to violence and the death of a counter-protester in Charlottesville.\n\nBut he returned to his combative stance Tuesday - insisting anew during an unexpected and contentious news conference at Trump Tower that \"both sides\" were to blame.\n\nAides watching from the sidelines reacted with dismay and disbelief and privately told colleagues they were upset by the president's remarks.\n\nBut not all were unhappy with his performance, with adviser Steve Bannon telling allies that it would electrify the Republican Party base.\n\nHis job security in the White House is tenuous - Mr Trump offered only a \"we'll see\" on Tuesday when asked if his chief strategist would remain in his post - but Mr Bannon welcomed a fight over Confederate monuments.\n\nHe told The New York Times: \"The race-identity politics of the left wants to say it's all racist. Just give me more. Tear down more statues. Say the revolution is coming.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 17, 2017\n\nTrump's remarks echoed those he made during a controversial news conference at Trump Tower on Tuesday. While Trump condemned members of white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups who were present during the Charlottesville protests, he also contended that not all of the demonstrators \"were neo-Nazis, believe me.\"\n\n\"Many of those people were there to protest the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee,\" Trump said Tuesday. \"So this week, it is Robert E. Lee. I noticed that Stonewall Jackson is coming down. I wonder, is it George Washington next week? And is it Thomas Jefferson the week after? You know, you really do have to ask yourself, where does it stop?\"\n\nFollowing the weekend incident in Virginia, the city of Baltimore took down four Confederate statues in the middle of the night on Wednesday. A day earlier, several people in North Carolina pulled down a Confederate statue. Four people were eventually arrested in that episode.\n\nhttp://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/08/17/trump-country-being-ripped-apart-by-monument-removals.html", "id": "9706915", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Trump: 'Country being ripped apart' by monument removals | From the Trenches World Report", "image": null, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 1104, "freq": 4, "date": "2017-08-17", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1119}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 1, "id": "189313", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "200134", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "242096", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}, "id": "305262", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "id": "305960", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America"}, {"label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "id": "305969", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Founding Fathers of the United States"}, "id": "318104", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "Thomas Jefferson"}, "id": "332840", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson"}, {"label": {"eng": "University of Virginia"}, "id": "337392", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Virginia"}, {"label": {"eng": "George Washington"}, "id": "337858", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington"}, {"label": {"eng": "Robert E.

There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\" Trump wrote.\n\nTrump's unpredictable, defiant and, critics claim, racially provocative behavior has clearly begun to wear on his Republican allies.\n\nTennessee Sen. Bob Corker, whom Trump considered for a Cabinet post, declared Thursday that \"the president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to\" in dealing with crises. And Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska tweeted, \"Anything less than complete & unambiguous condemnation of white supremacists, neo-Nazis and the KKK by the @POTUS is unacceptable. Period.\"\n\nSen. Tim Scott of South Carolina said Trump's \"moral authority is compromised.\"\n\nTrump, who is known to try to change the focus of news coverage with an attention-grabbing declaration, sought to shift Thursday from the white supremacists to the future of statues.\n\n\"You can't change history, but you can learn from it,\" he tweeted. \"Robert E. Lee. Stonewall Jackson -- who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish. ...\n\n\"Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" he tweeted.\n\nTrump met separately Thursday at his golf club in nearby Bedminster with the administrator of the Small Business Administration and Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a longtime Trump supporter. Trump also prepared for an unusual meeting Friday at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland with his national security team to discuss strategy for South Asia, including India, Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\nVice President Mike Pence was cutting short a long-planned Latin America tour to attend the meeting.\n\nThough out of public view, Trump sought to make his voice heard on Twitter as he found himself increasingly under siege and alone while fanning the controversy over race and politics toward a full-fledged national conflagration.\n\nHe dissolved two business councils Wednesday after the CEO members began quitting, damaging his central campaign promise to be a business-savvy chief executive in the Oval Office.\n\nAnd the White House said Thursday that it was abandoning plans to form an infrastructure advisory council.\n\nTwo major charities, the Cleveland Clinic and the American Cancer Society, announced they are canceling fundraisers scheduled for Trump's resort in Palm Beach, Florida, amid the continuing backlash over Trump's remarks.\n\nMeanwhile, rumblings of discontent from his staff grew so loud that the White House had to release a statement saying that Trump's chief economic adviser wasn't quitting. And the president remained on the receiving end of bipartisan criticism for his handling of the aftermath of the Charlottesville clashes.\n\nOn Thursday, he hit back hard -- against Republicans.\n\nHe accused \"publicity-seeking\" Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina of falsely stating Trump's position on the demonstrators. He called Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake \"toxic\" and praised Flake's potential primary election opponent.\n\nGraham said Wednesday that Trump \"took a step backward by again suggesting there is moral equivalency\" between the marching white supremacists and the people who had been demonstrating against them. Flake has been increasingly critical of Trump in recent weeks.\n\nPressured by advisers, the president had softened his words on the dispute Monday, two days after he had enraged many by declining to single out the white supremacists and neo-Nazis whose demonstration against the removal of a Robert E. Lee statute had led to violence and the death of a counter-protester in Charlottesville.\n\nHe returned to his combative stance Tuesday -- insisting anew during an unexpected and contentious news conference at Trump Tower that \"both sides\" were to blame.\n\nAides watching from the sidelines reacted with dismay and disbelief and privately told colleagues they were upset by the president's remarks, though not upset enough for anyone to resign.\n\nThe resignation speculation around Gary Cohn, head of the National Economic Council and a Jew, had grown so intense by Thursday that the White House released a statement saying reports that Cohn was stepping down were \"100 percent false.\"\n\nBut not all of Trump's aides were unhappy with his performance.\n\nAdviser Steve Bannon's job security in the White House has become tenuous -- Trump offered only a \"we'll see\" on Tuesday when asked if his chief strategist would remain in his post -- but Bannon has been telling allies that the president's news conference would electrify the GOP base.\n\nAnd in a pair of interviews Wednesday, Bannon cheered on the president's nationalist tendencies and suggested that a fight over Confederate monuments was a political fight he welcomes.\n\n\"The race-identity politics of the left wants to say it's all racist,\" Bannon told The New York Times. \"Just give me more.

(AP) -- With prominent Republicans openly questioning his competence and moral leadership, President Donald Trump on Thursday burrowed deeper into the racially charged debate over Confederate memorials and lashed out at members of his own party in the latest controversy to engulf his presidency.\n\nOut of sight, but still online, Trump tweeted his defense of monuments to Confederate icons -- bemoaning rising efforts to remove them as an attack on America's \"history and culture.\"\n\nAnd he berated his critics who, with increasingly sharper language, have denounced his initially slow and then ultimately combative comments on the racial violence at a white supremacist rally last weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nTrump was much quicker Thursday to condemn violence in Barcelona, where more than a dozen people were killed when a van veered onto a sidewalk and sped down a busy pedestrian zone in what authorities called a terror attack.\n\nHe then added to his expression of support a tweet reviving a debunked legend about a U.S. general subduing Muslim rebels a century ago in the Philippines by shooting them with bullets dipped in pig blood.\n\n\"Study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught. There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\" Trump wrote.\n\nTrump's unpredictable, defiant and, critics claim, racially provocative behavior has clearly begun to wear on his Republican allies.\n\nTennessee Sen. Bob Corker, whom Trump considered for a Cabinet post, declared Thursday that \"the president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to\" in dealing with crises. And Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska tweeted, \"Anything less than complete & unambiguous condemnation of white supremacists, neo-Nazis and the KKK by the @POTUS is unacceptable. Period.\"\n\nSen. Tim Scott of South Carolina said Trump's \"moral authority is compromised.\"\n\nTrump, who is known to try to change the focus of news coverage with an attention-grabbing declaration, sought to shift Thursday from the white supremacists to the future of statues.\n\n\"You can't change history, but you can learn from it,\" he tweeted. \"Robert E. Lee. Stonewall Jackson -- who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish. ...\n\n\"Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" he tweeted.\n\nTrump met separately Thursday at his golf club in nearby Bedminster with the administrator of the Small Business Administration and Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a longtime Trump supporter. Trump also prepared for an unusual meeting Friday at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland with his national security team to discuss strategy for South Asia, including India, Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\nVice President Mike Pence was cutting short a long-planned Latin America tour to attend the meeting.\n\nThough out of public view, Trump sought to make his voice heard on Twitter as he found himself increasingly under siege and alone while fanning the controversy over race and politics toward a full-fledged national conflagration.\n\nHe dissolved two business councils Wednesday after the CEO members began quitting, damaging his central campaign promise to be a business-savvy chief executive in the Oval Office.\n\nAnd the White House said Thursday that it was abandoning plans to form an infrastructure advisory council.\n\nTwo major charities, the Cleveland Clinic and the American Cancer Society, announced they are canceling fundraisers scheduled for Trump's resort in Palm Beach, Florida, amid the continuing backlash over Trump's remarks.\n\nMeanwhile, rumblings of discontent from his staff grew so loud that the White House had to release a statement saying that Trump's chief economic adviser wasn't quitting. And the president remained on the receiving end of bipartisan criticism for his handling of the aftermath of the Charlottesville clashes.\n\nOn Thursday, he hit back hard -- against Republicans.\n\nHe accused \"publicity-seeking\" Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina of falsely stating Trump's position on the demonstrators. He called Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake \"toxic\" and praised Flake's potential primary election opponent.\n\nGraham said Wednesday that Trump \"took a step backward by again suggesting there is moral equivalency\" between the marching white supremacists and the people who had been demonstrating against them. Flake has been increasingly critical of Trump in recent weeks.\n\nPressured by advisers, the president had softened his words on the dispute Monday, two days after he had enraged many by declining to single out the white supremacists and neo-Nazis whose demonstration against the removal of a Robert E. Lee statute had led to violence and the death of a counter-protester in Charlottesville.\n\nHe returned to his combative stance Tuesday -- insisting anew during an unexpected and contentious news conference at Trump Tower that \"both sides\" were to blame.\n\nAides watching from the sidelines reacted with dismay and disbelief and privately told colleagues they were upset by the president's remarks, though not upset enough for anyone to resign.\n\nThe resignation speculation around Gary Cohn, head of the National Economic Council and a Jew, had grown so intense by Thursday that the White House released a statement saying reports that Cohn was stepping down were \"100 percent false.\"\n\nBut not all of Trump's aides were unhappy with his performance.\n\nAdviser Steve Bannon's job security in the White House has become tenuous -- Trump offered only a \"we'll see\" on Tuesday when asked if his chief strategist would remain in his post -- but Bannon has been telling allies that the president's news conference would electrify the GOP base.\n\nAnd in a pair of interviews Wednesday, Bannon cheered on the president's nationalist tendencies and suggested that a fight over Confederate monuments was a political fight he welcomes.\n\n\"The race-identity politics of the left wants to say it's all racist,\" Bannon told The New York Times. \"Just give me more. Tear down more statues. Say the revolution is coming. I can't get enough of it.\"\n\n___\n\nLemire reported from New York.

There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\" Trump wrote.\n\nTrump's unpredictable, defiant and, critics claim, racially provocative behavior has clearly begun to wear on his Republican allies.\n\nTennessee Sen. Bob Corker, whom Trump considered for a Cabinet post, declared Thursday that \"the president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to\" in dealing with crises.\n\nAnd Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska tweeted, \"Anything less than complete & unambiguous condemnation of white supremacists, neo-Nazis and the KKK by the @POTUS is unacceptable. Period.\"\n\nSen. Tim Scott of South Carolina said Trump's \"moral authority is compromised.\"\n\nTrump, who is known to try to change the focus of news coverage with an attention-grabbing declaration, sought to shift Thursday from the white supremacists to the future of statues.\n\n\"You can't change history, but you can learn from it,\" he tweeted. \"Robert E. Lee. Stonewall Jackson -- who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish. ...\n\n\"Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" he tweeted.\n\nTrump met separately Thursday at his golf club in nearby Bedminster with the administrator of the Small Business Administration and Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a longtime Trump supporter. Trump also prepared for an unusual meeting Friday at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland with his national security team to discuss strategy for South Asia, including India, Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\nVice President Mike Pence was cutting short a long-planned Latin America tour to attend the meeting.\n\nThough out of public view, Trump sought to make his voice heard on Twitter as he found himself increasingly under siege and alone while fanning the controversy over race and politics toward a full-fledged national conflagration.\n\nHe dissolved two business councils Wednesday after the CEO members began quitting.\n\nAnd the White House said Thursday that it was abandoning plans to form an infrastructure advisory council.", "id": "9872829", "details": {}, "date":

Also... ...the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!? Trump said in a series of tweets.\n\nTrump?s tweets comes after officials in Lexington, Kentucky, Baltimore, New York City and Virginia moved to take down statues, monuments and plaques memorializing figures of the Confederacy.\n\nThe move to remove Confederate statues and monuments came after white supremacists and neo-Nazis took to Charlottesville, Virginia, to violently protest the planned removal of a statue of the Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.\n\nEarlier, President Trump in a press conference, defended some of the white supremacy rally's participants, made the case for Confederate statues and equated neo-Nazis to leftist activist groups.\n\n\"This week, it is Robert E. Lee and this week, Stonewall Jackson. Is it George Washington next? You have to ask yourself, where does it stop?\" Trump said.\n\nThe US President emphasised that both sides of the clashes contributed to the violence which happened in a white supremacists rally in Charlottesville, Virginia over the weekend.\n\nTrump had condemned the violence in Charlottesville, saying that \"the hatred and division in the America must stop as we are all Americans first.\"\n\n\"We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides,\" he had said during a short statement, adding that he had been closely following terrible events unfolding in Virginia.\n\nMentioning that the current unfolding of events in Virginia is not linked to his presidency, Trump said, \"It has been going on for a long time in our country ? not Donald Trump, not Barack Obama. It has been going on for a long, long time. It has no place in America.\"\n\n\"Hate and division in the country must stop. No matter our colour, creed, religion, our political party, we are all Americans first,\" he said, adding that he'd like for his administration to \"study\" why such violence is occurring.\n\n(This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)", "id": "9725254", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Trump denounces removal of Confederate statues as 'foolish'", "image": null, "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Lexington"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "188202", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexington,_Kentucky", "label": {"eng": "Lexington"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "189313", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "200134", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "218049", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Washington"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "235649", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "label": {"eng": "Washington"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "242096", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}, "id": "302950", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama"}, {"label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}, "id": "303042", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Culture"}, "id": "303325", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"}, {"label": {"eng": "Religion"}, "id": "303332", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}, "id": "305262", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "id": "305960", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America"}, {"label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "id": "305969", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy"}, {"label": {"eng": "George Washington"}, "id": "337858", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington"}, {"label": {"eng": "Robert E.

Lee statue.\n\nThey were met with anti-Nazi counter-protestors, and violent clashes ensued, culminating in an act of domestic terror: a 20-year-old white supremacist plowed his car into a crowd, killing Heather Heyer, 32, and injuring 19 others.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath, Trump provided a brief statement on the terror attack loaded with equivocations, and was forced to give an additional statement -- in which he explicitly condemned hate groups -- on Monday after intense backlash.\n\nBut then, on Tuesday, Trump doubled down on his \"both sides\" are at fault narrative, and issued a defense of Confederate monuments, arguing that their removal could entail a slippery slope and eventual removal of odes to George Washington.\n\nFollow Aidan McLaughlin (@aidnmclaughlin) on Twitter", "id": "9701988", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "'You Can't Change History': Trump Tweets Support for 'Beauty' of Confederate Monuments", "image": "https://www.mediaite.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-08-02-at-11.57.53.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 377, "freq": 3, "date": "2017-08-17", "amb": false, "textEnd": 392}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "200134", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Washington"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "235649", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "label": {"eng": "Washington"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nazism"}, "id": "302813", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "Culture"}, "id": "303325", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"}, {"label": {"eng": "History"}, "id": "303747", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}, "id": "305262", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism"}, {"label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "id": "305969", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy"}, {"label": {"eng": "State terrorism"}, "id": "310801", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_terrorism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Robert E.

Lee.\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" Trump said in a series of tweets. \"You can't change history, but you can learn from it.\"Trump's tweets came as he continued to face criticism for comments he made on Tuesday in which he blamed \"both sides\" of the Charlottesville protests -- the white supremacists and those protesting against them -- for the violence that took hold of that small Virginia city. While Trump condemned the neo-Nazi and white supremacists who protested, he insisted there were \"very fine people\" among those protesting the removal of Lee's statue in Charlottesville.Echoing his comments on Tuesday, Trump tweeted Thursday that the removal of Confederate statues could lead to the removal of monuments to the US's founding fathers.\"Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish!\" Trump tweeted. \"Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"Read MoreThe tweets came as Trump continued to face a torrent of criticism for his remarks Tuesday, with several prominent Republicans in Congress admonishing Trump for his response.", "id": "9702888", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Trump: Removing Confederate monuments 'foolish'", "image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170816193414-01-robert-e-lee-statue-0815-super-tease.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "200134", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Township of Bridgewater"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "216278", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgewater_Township,_New_Jersey", "label": {"eng": "Township of Bridgewater"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Washington"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "235649", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "label": {"eng": "Washington"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "242096", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "Culture"}, "id": "303325", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cnn.com"}, "id": "304269", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN"}, {"label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}, "id": "305262", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "id": "305960", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America"}, {"label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "id": "305969", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy"}, {"label": {"eng": "George Washington"}, "id": "337858", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington"}, {"label": {"eng": "Robert E.

Last weekend's violent protest in Charlottesville, Virginia, was sparked by the city's effort to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.\n\nDuring the demonstration, a white supremacist allegedly ran into a crowd, killing 32-year-old counterprotester Heather Heyer. Two Virginia State Police officers also died in a helicopter crash as they responded to the violence.\n\nSince Charlottesville, a number of cities and states have taken steps to address the existence of other Confederate monuments.\n\nThe mayor of Lexington, Kentucky, for example, pushed for two Confederate statues to be relocated to a nearby veterans cemetery. And in Baltimore, city leaders quietly removed four Confederate statues in the dark of night.\n\nMeanwhile, the Council on American Islamic Relations, or CAIR, which is the nation's largest Muslim civil rights organization, called on cities and states across the country to take down Confederate statues and rename roads and highways named for Confederate leaders.\n\nPresident Donald Trump weighed in on the controversy via Twitter on Thursday.

Fields, from Ohio, participated in the rally and was described by a former high school teacher as a fan of Adolf Hitler.", "id": "9756161", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Trump calls efforts to remove Confederate monuments 'so foolish'", "image": "http://www.ajc.com/rf/image_large/Pub/p8/CmgSharedContent/2017/08/15/Videos/4152126.vpx.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 632, "freq": 3, "date": "2017-08-17", "amb": false, "textEnd": 647}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "200134", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "218051", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York", "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Washington"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "235649", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "label": {"eng": "Washington"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "Murder"}, "id": "302958", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder"}, {"label": {"eng": "Violence"}, "id": "302966", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence"}, {"label": {"eng": "Culture"}, "id": "303325", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"}, {"label": {"eng": "Grievous bodily harm"}, "id": "303638", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grievous_bodily_harm"}, {"label": {"eng": "History"}, "id": "303747", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}, {"label": {"eng": "Statue"}, "id": "303774", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "id": "305960", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America"}, {"label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "id": "305969", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Political spectrum"}, "id": "314403", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_spectrum"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rallying"}, "id": "315718", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rallying"}, {"label": {"eng": "Thomas Jefferson"}, "id": "332840", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson"}, {"label": {"eng": "George Washington"}, "id": "337858", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington"}, {"label": {"eng": "Robert E.

Can't believe I had to write that sentence,\" said Ted Lieu, a Democratic congressman from California.\n\nTrump's chief strategist, Steve Bannon, told The New York Times that he believed the president's views were shared by many Americans.\n\n\"President Trump, by asking, 'Where does this all end' -- Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln -- connects with the American people about their history, culture and traditions,\" Bannon said.\n\n\"The race-identity politics of the left wants to say it's all racist,\" Bannon said. \"Just give me more. Tear down more statues. Say the revolution is coming. I can't get enough of it.\"\n\nTrump on Thursday also lashed out at two leading Republican critics in the Senate and accused the media of distorting his views.\n\n\"The public is learning (even more so) how dishonest the Fake News is,\" he said. \"They totally misrepresent what I say about hate, bigotry. etc. Shame!\"\n\nOn Monday Trump singled out the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis as \"repugnant,\" but on Tuesday he said counter-protesters in Charlottesville had been \"very violent\" and equally responsible for the violence.\n\nTrump's weak condemnation of the racist far-right set off a political firestorm across the US political spectrum.

The Charlottesville protests were focused on the planned removal of the Robert E. Lee statue there. Confederate General Stonewall Jackson was trending on Twitter when Trump's tweet flew in because of efforts to remove honors to Jackson in New York, Baltimore and other places.\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments. You can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish!\" Trump tweeted. \"The beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\nHere are the actual Trump tweets:\n\nThe president also criticized Lindsey Graham on Twitter for saying he had made a moral equivalency between Nazis and other protesters.\n\nThe Trump remarks were somewhat a reiteration of the comments that the president made in a dramatic and much-discussed press conference in which he defended his decision to condemn violence on \"many sides\" in the initial response to the Charlottesville car ramming attack that killed paralegal Heather Heyer, a counter protester. Trump later condemned white supremacists but was criticized for not calling them out immediately and for saying that there were good and bad people on both sides of the Charlottesville clashes. (James Alex Fields, an accused Hitler admirer, was charged in the murder of Heyer, and videos and photos showed Neo Nazis marching through the streets with torches.)\n\nIn that press conference, Trump also broached the fact that George Washington and Thomas Jefferson owned slaves, and there are monuments to them. However, the president doubled down on August 17, taking it one step farther by dubbing the statues \"beautiful\" and removing them \"foolish.\"\n\nIn the earlier press conference, Trump had said, in part, \"George Washington as a slave owner. Was George Washington a slave owner? So will George Washington now lose his status? Are we going to take down -- excuse me. Are we going to take down statues to George Washington? How about Thomas Jefferson? What do you think of Thomas Jefferson? You like him. Good. Are we going to take down his statue? He was a major slave owner.\"\n\nMeanwhile, on August 17, statue removals focused on Lee but also Jackson as some officials rushed to get rid of them.\n\n\"Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson will be removed from the CUNY hall of great Americans because New York stands against racism,\" New York Governor Andrew Cuomo tweeted.\n\nOn August 16, statues of Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson were removed from public parks in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nStonewall Jackson's descendants have penned a letter supporting removal of the monuments. Jack and Warren Christian penned the open letter asking for the removal of the statues in Richmond, Virginia.\n\n\"As two of the closest living relatives to Stonewall, we are writing today to ask for the removal of his statue, as well as the removal of all Confederate statues from Monument Avenue.

Lee.\n\nA 32-year-old woman was killed and 19 other people injured when a man suspected of being a white nationalist drove his car into a crowd of counter-protesters.\n\nMoves to remove statues honoring leaders of the Confederacy have gained momentum since the Charlottesville violence with monuments coming down in Baltimore and other cities.\n\nTrump, echoing remarks he first made earlier this week, made it clear he opposed the campaign.\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" Trump said.\n\n\"You can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish!\" he said.\n\n\"Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\" he said.\n\nLee and Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson were Confederate generals while George Washington and Thomas Jefferson were among the Founding Fathers of the United States.\n\nTrump critics were quick to point out the difference.\n\n\"Dear @realDonaldTrump: Robert Lee and Stonewall Jackson are not the same as Washington and Jefferson. Can't believe I had to write that sentence,\" said Ted Lieu, a Democratic congressman from California.\n\n- Trump hits critics, media -\n\nTrump's chief strategist, Steve Bannon, told The New York Times that he believed the president's views were shared by many Americans.\n\n\"President Trump, by asking, 'Where does this all end' - Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln - connects with the American people about their history, culture and traditions,\" Bannon said.\n\n\"The race-identity politics of the left wants to say it's all racist,\" Bannon said. \"Just give me more. Tear down more statues. Say the revolution is coming. I can't get enough of it.\"\n\nTrump on Thursday also lashed out at two leading Republican critics in the Senate and accused the media of distorting his views.\n\n\"The public is learning (even more so) how dishonest the Fake News is,\" he said. \"They totally misrepresent what I say about hate, bigotry. etc. Shame!\"\n\nOn Monday Trump singled out the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis as \"repugnant,\" but on Tuesday he said counter-protestors in Charlottesville had been \"very violent\" and equally responsible for the violence.\n\nTrump's weak condemnation of the racist far-right set off a political firestorm across the US political spectrum. World leaders also criticized Trump's response.\n\nTrump was forced to scrap two White House economic advisory councils on Wednesday as top businessmen began abandoning him to protest his stance on the racial debate.\n\n\"Publicity seeking Lindsey Graham falsely stated that I said there is moral equivalency between the KKK, neo-Nazis & white supremacists... and people like Ms. Heyer,\" Trump said.\n\nHeather Heyer, 32, was the woman killed by the suspected white nationalist in Charlottesville.\n\nGraham had said the US president \"took a step backward\" Tuesday \"by again suggesting there is moral equivalency between the white supremacist neo-Nazis and KKK members who attended the Charlottesville rally\" and people like Heyer.\n\nTrump also blasted Flake, one of the few Republicans openly critical of the president, saying he was \"WEAK on borders, crime and a non-factor in Senate.\"\n\n\"He's toxic!\" Trump tweeted.\n\nFlake, who is running for re-election in Arizona, wrote Tuesday: \"We can't accept excuses for white supremacy & acts of domestic terrorism.

You can't change history, but you can learn from it,\" Trump wrote on Twitter in a three-post flurry Thursday morning. \"Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish! Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nStatues honoring prominent Confederates, including Gens. Lee and Jackson, have grown increasingly unpopular in recent years as they have come to be seen by many as symbols honoring slavery, racism and oppression. Defenders of the statues argue that they represent nothing more that Southern heritage and that their removal would amount to a white-washing of history.\n\nThe spotlight on Confederate statues has shone even brighter this week in the wake of violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, where white supremacist groups gathered for a rally ostensibly to protest the removal of a statue of Lee. The white supremacist groups quickly clashed with counter-protesters in violence that left one woman dead and dozens more injured.\n\nTrump, in remarks on the violence, said that blame for it should be shared between the white supremacists and those who had gathered to protest their presence. He said there were \"very fine people\" in both groups, statements that prompted a swift and nearly unanimous rebuke, not just from Democrats, but from Republicans as well.\n\nBefore last weekend's violence, the removal of such statues has stirred controversy in cities like New Orleans, where Mayor Mitch Landrieu delivered an impassioned speech explaining why he supported the relocation of four such monuments away from prominent locations in his city.

This includes statues and plaques and the like, as well as schools, highways, and other facilities named for Confederate soldiers, even holidays. All told, the Southern Poverty Law Center identified about 1,503 items as of 2016. Moreover, the vast majority of statues and physical markers are located in what can be considered southern states; of the 718 monuments and statues, about 300 are located in Georgia, Virginia, or North Carolina.\n\nAs you already know, Charlottesville's city council voted to remove a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee from the newly-minted Emancipation Park. It was this decision that led to the violence that occurred over the weekend. As of right now, the statue's removal is on hold as the city tries to figure out how to move forward after the protests and tragedy of the weekend. Gainesville, Florida has already moved one statue, and is in the process of raising funds to remove a second. One North Carolina statue was knocked over by protesters in response to what happened in Charlottesville.\n\nFollowing the Charlottesville attack as well, Lexington, Kentucky mayor tweeted that they would be removing two Confederate monuments, writing, \"I am taking action to relocate the Confederate statues. We have thoroughly examined the issue, and heard from many of our citizens.\" In Los Angeles, California, a Confederate monument was removed from the historic Hollywood Forever Cemetery, where 30 Confederate veterans and their families are buried. New York's Hall of Fame for Great Americans will also lose their busts of Lee and Stonewall Jackson.\n\nDonald Trump tweeted about the removal of all of these monuments this morning, in a tweetstorm that I'm sure his aides wish they could have stopped. In his tweets, he calls the statues \"beautiful\" and says that such beauty will \"never be replaced.\" He then goes on to repeat a lot of the talking points (read: incoherent babbling) he gave in his now-infamous \"Both Sides\" speech at Trump Tower, where he took questions from reporters against the advice of his aides and team.\n\nSad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments. You.....\n\n-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 17, 2017\n\n...can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish! Also...\n\n-- Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 17, 2017\n\nThese monuments should have been taken down ages ago, but it's good to see that something's finally being done about them across the country. But even with these ones moving or going down soon, there are still loads strewn all about the U.S., and there's an even longer journey ahead to get those removed.\n\nIt's funny (and a bit ironic, in the best way) to see that even though the \"Unite the Right\" rally may have delayed the removal of the Robert E. Lee statue in Emancipation Park, many more statues are being taken down everywhere else. That's what happens when you rally together in the names of hate, intolerance, and prejudice -- people see you for how you really are, and in some small way, the world responds to that. I'm happy to see these monuments go, but as always, it's important to remember that while these statues of iron, lead, steel, and stone vanish, we must make sure we do the same to the hideous ideologies their defenders stand for. We still have a long journey to look forward to, but at the very least, that journey will look a little brighter without these monuments blotting out the road ahead.", "id": "9737290", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "It's About Damn Time: Many States Begin Removal of Confederate Monuments Following Charlottesville", "image": "https://www.themarysue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/statue-150x100.png", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 2403, "freq": 3, "date": "2017-08-17", "amb": false, "textEnd": 2418}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Gainesville"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "181689", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainesville,_Florida", "label": {"eng": "Gainesville"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Georgia"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "182942", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "label": {"eng": "Georgia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Lexington"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "188202", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexington,_Kentucky", "label": {"eng": "Lexington"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "189313", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "193144", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "200134", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "218049", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "228323", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "242096", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"location": null, "score": 3, "id": "302937", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States", "label": {"eng": "Southern United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "Statue"}, "id": "303774", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trump Tower (New York City)"}, "id": "304759", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Tower_(New_York_City)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "id": "305960", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America"}, {"label": {"eng": "Indian American"}, "id": "340166", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_American"}, {"label": {"eng": "Robert E.

Lee.\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" Trump said in a series of tweets. \"You can't change history, but you can learn from it.\"\n\nTrump's tweets came as he continued to face criticism for comments he made on Tuesday in which he blamed \"both sides\" of the Charlottesville protests -- the white supremacists and those protesting against them -- for the violence that took hold of that small Virginia city. While Trump condemned the neo-Nazi and white supremacists who protested, he insisted there were \"very fine people\" among those protesting the removal of Lee's statue in Charlottesville.\n\nEchoing his comments on Tuesday, Trump tweeted Thursday that the removal of Confederate statues could lead to the removal of monuments to the US's founding fathers.\n\n\"Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish!\" Trump tweeted. \"Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\nTrump's decision to side with those opposed to removing Confederate monuments -- even days after white supremacists and neo-Nazis protested the same cause -- signaled that he was increasingly confident that he had reacted appropriately in a way that would bolster his standing with his core supporters.The President has faced sagging approval ratings for months, but has maintained fervent support among his political base.\n\nThe tweets also came as Trump continued to face a torrent of criticism for his remarks, with several prominent Republican leaders admonishing Trump for his response.\n\nTrump fired back against some of those criticizing him Thursday morning, lashing out against the news media and Sen. Lindsey Graham, the Republican from South Carolina who slammed Trump for expressing a \"moral equivalency\" between the white supremacists and those who took to the streets to counter their racist, anti-Semitic rally.\n\nTrump rebuked Graham for what he termed a \"disgusting lie\" and forcefully reminded Graham that he had solidly defeated him in the South Carolina Republican primary 18 months earlier.\n\nIn his tweet slamming the news media, Trump argued the media \"totally misrepresent what I say about hate, bigotry etc.\"\n\nTrump's rejection of the removal of Confederate monuments also came just a few hours after a CBS News poll showed that while a majority of Americans disapproved of Trump's response to the violence in Charlottesville, two-thirds of Republicans approved of his response.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\nOfficials in several states have called for the removal of public monuments that have become symbols of the Confederacy.\n\nThe Twitter posts were the latest in his escalating remarks that critics contend validates white supremacist groups who led a bloody rally over the weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia. The proposed removal of a statute of the Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from a public park in Charlottesville spurred the demonstrations.\n\nTrump's comments on the Confederate monuments Thursday appeared to shift attention away from his remarks that \"both sides\" were to blame for the violence in Charlottesville, and instead focus the debate on the historical argument to keep the statues in place.\n\nMany people who do not identify as white supremacists support keeping the monuments as a connection to their history and heritage.\n\nA NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll on Monday and Tuesday of 1,125 adults showed 86 percent of the Republicans surveyed thought Confederate statues should remain in place as a symbol of history.\n\nTrump's tweets came the morning after his personal lawyer forwarded an email to conservative journalists, government officials and friends that painted Lee in glowing terms and echoed secessionist sentiment from the Civil War era.\n\nOn Saturday, the day of the protests, Trump did not condemn neo-Nazis or white supremacists in his public remarks about the violence, prompting criticism that his omission suggested support for the racist groups. An Ohio man with white supremacist ties is accused of driving his car into a crowd, killing one woman and injuring 19 other people.\n\nTwo days later, Trump bowed to pressure and said racism was \"evil\" and named racist organizations in his follow-up remarks about Charlottesville. But on Tuesday, Trump reverted to his initial public posture and blamed \"both sides\" for the violence.\n\nTrump said many of those who opposed the statue's removal were good people protesting the loss of their culture, and he questioned whether taking down statues of Lee could lead to monuments of George Washington also being removed.\n\nMost of the statues were erected in the 1890s, as Jim Crow laws were being established, and in the 1950s, during a period of Southern resistance to the civil rights movement.\n\nSome in favor of keeping the statues argue that the interpretation of the monuments could be revised to teach future generations about white privilege. But practically, that is unrealistic, said W. Fitzhugh Brundage, a history professor at the University of North Carolina. Brundage said it would be expensive to add explanatory plaques next to the Confederate monuments, and that may not be a prominent enough display of the reinterpretation.\n\nTo those who argue that the statues are not about hate but heritage, Brundage said relocating them to a museum would not erase the heritage.\n\n\"You're not erasing history,\" Brundage said. \"You're just transforming a landscape so that you can make it one you're comfortable living in.\"\n\nCorey Stewart, a Republican who has said he plans to run against Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., in 2018, defended Trump on Thursday.\n\n\"The president is absolutely right,\" Stewart, who was Trump's campaign chairman in Virginia, said on CNN. \"After they get done removing statues to Confederate generals because, arguably, they fought to preserve the institution of slavery, they are going right after slave owners, including the founders -- Jefferson, Madison, Washington -- and when you undermine the founding fathers, you undermine the founding documents, namely the Constitution of the United States.\"", "id": "9759825", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title":

Lee.\n\nA 32-year-old woman was killed and 19 other people injured when a man suspected of being a white nationalist drove his car into a crowd of counter-protesters.\n\nMoves to remove statues honoring leaders of the Confederacy have gained momentum since the Charlottesville violence with monuments coming down in Baltimore and other cities.\n\nTrump, echoing remarks he first made earlier this week, made it clear he opposed the campaign.\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" Trump said.\n\n\"You can't change history, but you can learn from it.

Can't believe I had to write that sentence,\" said Ted Lieu, a Democratic congressman from California.\n\n- Trump hits critics, media -\n\nTrump's chief strategist, Steve Bannon, told The New York Times that he believed the president's views were shared by many Americans.\n\n\"President Trump, by asking, 'Where does this all end' - Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln - connects with the American people about their history, culture and traditions,\" Bannon said.\n\n\"The race-identity politics of the left wants to say it's all racist,\" Bannon said. \"Just give me more. Tear down more statues. Say the revolution is coming. I can't get enough of it.\"\n\nTrump on Thursday also lashed out at two leading Republican critics in the Senate and accused the media of distorting his views.\n\n\"The public is learning (even more so) how dishonest the Fake News is,\" he said. \"They totally misrepresent what I say about hate, bigotry. etc. Shame!\"\n\nOn Monday Trump singled out the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis as \"repugnant,\" but on Tuesday he said counter-protestors in Charlottesville had been \"very violent\" and equally responsible for the violence.\n\nTrump's weak condemnation of the racist far-right set off a political firestorm across the US political spectrum. World leaders also criticized Trump's response.\n\nTrump was forced to scrap two White House economic advisory councils on Wednesday as top businessmen began abandoning him to protest his stance on the racial debate.\n\nThe president took aim at two fellow Republican senators, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Jeff Flake of Arizona, in a series of tweets.\n\n\"Publicity seeking Lindsey Graham falsely stated that I said there is moral equivalency between the KKK, neo-Nazis & white supremacists... and people like Ms. Heyer,\" Trump said.\n\nHeather Heyer, 32, was the woman killed by the suspected white nationalist in Charlottesville.\n\nGraham had said the US president \"took a step backward\" Tuesday \"by again suggesting there is moral equivalency between the white supremacist neo-Nazis and KKK members who attended the Charlottesville rally\" and people like Heyer.\n\nTrump also blasted Flake, one of the few Republicans openly critical of the president, saying he was \"WEAK on borders, crime and a non-factor in Senate.\"\n\n\"He's toxic!\" Trump tweeted.\n\nFlake, who is running for re-election in Arizona, wrote Tuesday: \"We can't accept excuses for white supremacy & acts of domestic terrorism.

Lee and Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson on a flatbed truck after they were removed from a public park in Baltimore, Maryland\n\nA defiant President Donald Trump shrugged off a barrage of bipartisan criticism on Thursday and said US culture and history were being \"ripped apart\" by the removal of Confederate statues.\n\nTrump waded back into the charged racial debate over monuments to the pro-slavery South with a volley of tweets doubling down on his controversial remarks of the past few days.\n\nTrump has come under fire from Republicans and Democrats alike for saying that anti-racism protestors deserved equal blame for violence last weekend at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, held to protest the planned removal of a statue of Confederate general Robert E. Lee.\n\nA 32-year-old woman was killed and 19 other people injured when a man suspected of being a white nationalist drove his car into a crowd of counter-protesters.\n\nMoves to remove statues honoring leaders of the Confederacy have gained momentum since the Charlottesville violence with monuments coming down in Baltimore and other cities.\n\nTrump, echoing remarks he first made earlier this week, made it clear he opposed the campaign.\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" Trump said.\n\n\"You can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish!\" he said.\n\n\"Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\" he said.\n\nLee and Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson were Confederate generals while George Washington and Thomas Jefferson were among the Founding Fathers of the United States.\n\nTrump critics were quick to point out the difference.\n\n\"Dear @realDonaldTrump: Robert Lee and Stonewall Jackson are not the same as Washington and Jefferson. Can't believe I had to write that sentence,\" said Ted Lieu, a Democratic congressman from California.\n\n- Trump hits critics, media -\n\nTrump's chief strategist, Steve Bannon, told The New York Times that he believed the president's views were shared by many Americans.\n\n\"President Trump, by asking, 'Where does this all end' - Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln - connects with the American people about their history, culture and traditions,\" Bannon said.\n\n\"The race-identity politics of the left wants to say it's all racist,\" Bannon said. \"Just give me more. Tear down more statues. Say the revolution is coming. I can't get enough of it.\"\n\nTrump on Thursday also lashed out at two leading Republican critics in the Senate and accused the media of distorting his views.\n\n\"The public is learning (even more so) how dishonest the Fake News is,\" he said. \"They totally misrepresent what I say about hate, bigotry. etc. Shame!\"\n\nOn Monday Trump singled out the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis as \"repugnant,\" but on Tuesday he said counter-protestors in Charlottesville had been \"very violent\" and equally responsible for the violence.\n\nTrump's weak condemnation of the racist far-right set off a political firestorm across the US political spectrum. World leaders also criticized Trump's response.\n\nTrump was forced to scrap two White House economic advisory councils on Wednesday as top businessmen began abandoning him to protest his stance on the racial debate.\n\nThe president took aim at two fellow Republican senators, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Jeff Flake of Arizona, in a series of tweets.\n\n\"Publicity seeking Lindsey Graham falsely stated that I said there is moral equivalency between the KKK, neo-Nazis & white supremacists... and people like Ms. Heyer,\" Trump said.\n\nHeather Heyer, 32, was the woman killed by the suspected white nationalist in Charlottesville.\n\nGraham had said the US president \"took a step backward\" Tuesday \"by again suggesting there is moral equivalency between the white supremacist neo-Nazis and KKK members who attended the Charlottesville rally\" and people like Heyer.\n\nTrump also blasted Flake, one of the few Republicans openly critical of the president, saying he was \"WEAK on borders, crime and a non-factor in Senate.\"\n\n\"He's toxic!\" Trump tweeted.\n\nFlake, who is running for re-election in Arizona, wrote Tuesday: \"We can't accept excuses for white supremacy & acts of domestic terrorism. We must condemn.

Lee.\n\nA 32-year-old woman was killed and 19 other people injured when a man suspected of being a white nationalist drove his car into a crowd of counter-protesters.\n\nMoves to remove statues honouring leaders of the Confederacy have gained momentum since the Charlottesville violence with monuments coming down in Baltimore and other cities.\n\nTrump, echoing remarks he first made earlier this week, made it clear he opposed the campaign.\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" Trump said.\n\n\"You can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish!\n\n\"Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\nLee and Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson were Confederate generals while George Washington and Thomas Jefferson were among the Founding Fathers of the United States.\n\nTrump critics were quick to point out the difference.\n\nPlaying with fire: why won't Trump just condemn white supremacists, instead of blaming 'many sides'?\n\n\"Dear @realDonaldTrump: Robert Lee and Stonewall Jackson are not the same as Washington and Jefferson. Can't believe I had to write that sentence,\" said Ted Lieu, a Democratic congressman from California.\n\nTrump on Thursday also lashed out at two leading Republican critics in the Senate and accused the media of distorting his views.\n\n\"The public is learning (even more so) how dishonest the Fake News is,\" he said. \"They totally misrepresent what I say about hate, bigotry. etc. Shame!\"\n\nOn Monday, Trump singled out the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis as \"repugnant,\" but on Tuesday he said counter-protesters in Charlottesville had been \"very violent\" and equally responsible for the violence.\n\nTrump's weak condemnation of the racist far-right set off a political firestorm across the US political spectrum. World leaders also criticised Trump's response.\n\nTrump was forced to scrap two White House economic advisory councils on Wednesday as top businessmen began abandoning him to protest his stance on the racial debate.\n\nThe president took aim at two fellow Republican senators, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Jeff Flake of Arizona, in a series of tweets.\n\n\"Publicity seeking Lindsey Graham falsely stated that I said there is moral equivalency between the KKK, neo-Nazis & white supremacists ... and people like Ms. Heyer,\" Trump said.\n\nAlleged Charlottesville killer James Fields 'sympathised with Nazism and idolised Hitler', former teacher recalls\n\nHeather Heyer, 32, was the woman killed by the suspected white nationalist in Charlottesville.\n\nGraham had said the US president \"took a step backward\" Tuesday \"by again suggesting there is moral equivalency between the white supremacist neo-Nazis and KKK members who attended the Charlottesville rally\" and people like Heyer.\n\nTrump also blasted Flake, one of the few Republicans openly critical of the president, saying he was \"WEAK on borders, crime and a non-factor in Senate.\"\n\n\"He's toxic!\" Trump tweeted.\n\nFlake, who is running for re-election in Arizona, wrote Tuesday: \"We can't accept excuses for white supremacy & acts of domestic terrorism.

Lee. The violence that erupted led to the death of 32-year-old Heather Heyer. It has also led to a national conversation about race, as well as how, or if, it's right to publicly preserve the memory of the Confederacy and its soldiers.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has come under intense scrutiny for his reaction to the issue. He has been chastised by GOP and Democratic lawmakers alike for not condemning white nationalism outright, saying there were bad people on both sides of the protest.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump took to Twitter to reiterate statements about his disdain for the removal of the statues that he initially made in a press conference earlier in the week.\n\nSad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments.

Durham, North Carolina protestors took it upon themselves to topple a statue of a Confederate soldier, and mayors in cities where Confederate statues stand have taken action about what to do next.\n\nBaltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh was in favor of removing the monuments and after city council's unanimous approval, the city's four monuments were removed in the dead of night.\n\nIn Richmond, Viriginia, - the capital city of the Confederacy - the mayor is now considering removing statues on the city's Monument Avenue. In June, a commission was formed to determine a way to add context to the five statues.\n\n\"Effective immediately, the Monument Avenue Commission will include an examination of the removal and/or relocation of some or all of the Confederate statues,\" Richmond mayor Levar Stoney said in a statement, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch.\n\nSo what do you think?

While Trump condemned the neo-Nazi and white supremacists who protested, he insisted there were \"very fine people\" among those protesting the removal of Lee's statue in Charlottesville.\n\nEchoing his comments on Tuesday, Trump tweeted Thursday that the removal of Confederate statues could lead to the removal of monuments to the US's founding fathers.\n\n\"Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson?

Lindsey Graham, the Republican from South Carolina who slammed Trump for expressing a \"moral equivalency\" between the white supremacists and those who took to the streets to counter their racist, anti-Semitic rally.\n\nTrump rebuked Graham for what he termed a \"disgusting lie\" and forcefully reminded Graham that he had solidly defeated him in the South Carolina Republican primary 18 months earlier.\n\nIn his tweet slamming the news media, Trump argued the media \"totally misrepresent what I say about hate, bigotry etc.\"\n\nTrump's rejection of the removal of Confederate monuments also came just a few hours after a CBS News poll showed that while a majority of Americans disapproved of Trump's response to the violence in Charlottesville, two-thirds of Republicans approved of his response. The poll, however, was conducted in part before Trump's impromptu news conference on Tuesday.", "id": "9730402", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "President Trump calls removal of Confederate monuments 'so foolish'", "image": "https://tribwttv.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/170814180409-confederate-statue-2-exlarge-tease.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=640", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "196726", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "200134", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Washington"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "235649", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "label": {"eng": "Washington"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "242096", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Racism"}, "id": "302940", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}, "id": "302944", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Politics"}, "id": "302948", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Culture"}, "id": "303325", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"}, {"label": {"eng": "Statue"}, "id": "303774", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "News media"}, "id": "304391", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_media"}, {"label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}, "id": "305262", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "id": "305960", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America"}, {"label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "id": "305969", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bigotry"}, "id": "310173", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigotry"}, {"label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}, "id": "310713", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Protest"}, "id": "319773", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protest"}, {"label": {"eng": "Lindsey Graham"}, "id": "324838", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindsey_Graham"}, {"label": {"eng": "Robert E.

Lee.\n\nA 32-year-old woman was killed and 19 other people injured when an Ohio man suspected of being a white nationalist drove his car into a crowd of counter-protesters.\n\nTrump -- who rose to political prominence by casting doubt on whether Barack Obama, America's first black president, was born in the United States -- has been deluged with demands to unambiguously disavow white hate groups, whose members have been emboldened by his election.\n\nTrump did condemn neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan on several occasions this week but many say he did not go far enough. He has earned rebukes from across the political spectrum, even from former presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush.\n\nWorld leaders also criticized Trump's response and the president was forced to scrap two White House economic advisory councils on Wednesday as top businessmen began abandoning him in protest.\n\n\"Because of the manner in which you have handled the Charlottesville tragedy you are now receiving praise from some of the most racist and hate-filled individuals in our country,\" Senator Lindsey Graham said Thursday.\n\n\"For the sake of our Nation -- as our president -- please fix this,\" said the Republican senator from South Carolina, which was the first southern state to secede from the Union in 1861.\n\nWith moves to dismantle Confederate monuments gaining momentum, Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader in the House of Representatives, called for Confederate statues to be removed from the U.S. Capitol.\n\n\"The Confederate statues in the halls of Congress have always been reprehensible,\" Pelosi said.\n\n\"There is no room for celebrating the violent bigotry of the men of the Confederacy in the hallowed halls of the United States Capitol.\"\n\nTrump made it clear though on Thursday that he opposed such a move.\n\n\"You can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish!\" Trump said.\n\n\"Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\nLee commanded the Army of Northern Virginia and General Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson was one of his top lieutenants, while George Washington and Thomas Jefferson were among the Founding Fathers of the United States.\n\nTrump's chief strategist, Steve Bannon, told The New York Times, meanwhile, that he believed the president's views were shared by many Americans.\n\n\"President Trump, by asking, 'Where does this all end' -- Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln -- connects with the American people about their history, culture and traditions,\" Bannon said.\n\n\"The race-identity politics of the left wants to say it's all racist,\" Bannon said. \"Just give me more. Tear down more statues. Say the revolution is coming. I can't get enough of it.\"\n\nA poll released Thursday would appear to support the view that many Americans oppose removing the monuments to the Confederacy.\n\nThe NPR/PBS/NewsHour/Marist poll of 1,125 adults asked whether Confederate statues should remain as a historical symbol or be removed because they offend some people.\n\nSixty-two percent said they should remain while 27 percent said they should be taken down.\n\nTrump on Thursday also lashed out at Graham and accused the media of distorting his views.\n\n\"The public is learning (even more so) how dishonest the Fake News is,\" he said. \"They totally misrepresent what I say about hate, bigotry. etc. Shame!\"\n\n\"Publicity seeking Lindsey Graham falsely stated that I said there is moral equivalency between the KKK, neo-Nazis & white supremacists... and people like Ms Heyer,\" Trump added.\n\nHeather Heyer, 32, was the woman killed by the suspected white nationalist in Charlottesville.\n\nIn a report published in April 2016, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) -- a civil rights advocacy group -- found that more than 1,500 symbols of the Confederacy are located on US public lands, mostly in the South.\n\nAccording to historians and the SPLC report, most Confederate monuments were erected during the Jim Crow era of racial segregation and in response to the civil rights movement.\n\nDefenders of preserving the Confederate symbols argue that they serve as a reminder of a proud Southern heritage, and that removing them is effectively a way of erasing history.\n\n\u00a9 2017 AFP", "id": "9779459", "details":

Lee and \"Stonewall\" Jackson today may demand the removal of George Washington or Thomas Jefferson tomorrow.\n\nThe country's first president and the author of the Declaration of Independence were both slave-owners. A pastor in Chicago, Illinois has already asked the city authorities to change the name of a park currently named after Washington, as well as another that bears the name of Andrew Jackson, the seventh US president.\n\nIn his tweets on Thursday, Trump called the demands to remove monuments \"foolish\" and argued that \"the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\nHis statement comes after several cities across the US decided to remove Confederate monuments following the confrontation between white nationalists and 'antifa' counter-protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia over the weekend.\n\nBaltimore, Maryland had contractors remove four statues in the middle of the night on Wednesday. On Tuesday, protesters in Durham, North Carolina toppled a monument to Confederate soldiers outside a courthouse. One activist was later arrested.\n\nIn Atlanta, Georgia, activists attempted to tear down a Peace Monument featuring a Confederate soldier surrendering, but were stopped by police. One activist was injured by a piece of the statue that was broken off.\n\nA judge in Georgia was suspended this week, after he compared the removal of monuments to the actions of Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) terrorists and their destruction of non-Islamic art.\n\nAlthough Trump unequivocally condemned the racists, neo-Nazis and Ku Klux Klan (KKK) marchers, he also called out the \"alt-left\" counter-protesters that engaged in violence in Charlottesville, to the chagrin of most US media and many leading members of the Republican party.", "id": "9704030", "details": {}, "date":

Bush.\n\n- 'Please fix this' -\n\nWorld leaders also criticized Trump's response and the president was forced to scrap two White House economic advisory councils on Wednesday as top businessmen began abandoning him in protest.\n\n\"Because of the manner in which you have handled the Charlottesville tragedy you are now receiving praise from some of the most racist and hate-filled individuals in our country,\" Senator Lindsey Graham said Thursday.\n\n\"For the sake of our Nation -- as our President -- please fix this,\" said the Republican senator from South Carolina, which was the first southern state to secede from the Union in 1861.\n\nWith moves to dismantle Confederate monuments gaining momentum, Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader in the House of Representatives, called for Confederate statues to be removed from the US Capitol.\n\n\"The Confederate statues in the halls of Congress have always been reprehensible,\" Pelosi said.\n\n\"There is no room for celebrating the violent bigotry of the men of the Confederacy in the hallowed halls of the United States Capitol.\"\n\nTrump made it clear though on Thursday that he opposed such a move.\n\n\"You can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish!\" Trump said.\n\n\"Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\nLee commanded the Army of Northern Virginia and General Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson was one of his top lieutenants, while George Washington and Thomas Jefferson were among the Founding Fathers of the United States.\n\n- Trump hits critics, media -\n\nTrump's chief strategist, Steve Bannon, told The New York Times meanwhile that he believed the president's views were shared by many Americans.\n\n\"President Trump, by asking, 'Where does this all end' -- Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln -- connects with the American people about their history, culture and traditions,\" Bannon said.\n\n\"The race-identity politics of the left wants to say it's all racist,\" Bannon said. \"Just give me more. Tear down more statues. Say the revolution is coming. I can't get enough of it.\"\n\nA poll released Thursday would appear to support the view that many Americans oppose removing the monuments to the Confederacy.\n\nThe NPR/PBS/NewsHour/Marist poll of 1,125 adults asked whether Confederate statues should remain as a historical symbol or be removed because they offend some people.\n\nSixty-two percent said they should remain while 27 percent said they should be taken down.\n\nTrump on Thursday also lashed out at Graham and accused the media of distorting his views.\n\n\"The public is learning (even more so) how dishonest the Fake News is,\" he said. \"They totally misrepresent what I say about hate, bigotry. etc. Shame!\"\n\n\"Publicity seeking Lindsey Graham falsely stated that I said there is moral equivalency between the KKK, neo-Nazis & white supremacists... and people like Ms. Heyer,\" Trump added.\n\nHeather Heyer, 32, was the woman killed by the suspected white nationalist in Charlottesville.\n\nIn a report published in April 2016, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) -- a civil rights advocacy group -- found that more than 1,500 symbols of the Confederacy are located on US public lands, mostly in the South.\n\nAccording to historians and the SPLC report, most Confederate monuments were erected during the Jim Crow era of racial segregation and in response to the civil rights movement.\n\nDefenders of preserving the Confederate symbols argue that they serve as a reminder of a proud Southern heritage, and that removing them is effectively a way of erasing history.", "id": "9760163", "details": {}, "date":

Lee. The president argued that the ongoing efforts of states and cities to take down statues of Confederate figures is \"foolish\" and that the monuments are an irreplaceable reminder of U.S. history.\n\nSad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments.

So foolish! Also... -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\n...the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\nSince the violent rally in Charlottesville, some cities have begun expediting their efforts to remove statues memorializing Lee, Stonewall Jackson, and other leaders of the Confederacy. Baltimore officials swiftly took down two statues late Tuesday night, while civil rights groups and citizens of Gainesville, Florida and Lexington, Kentucky called for the removal of other Confederate monuments without the delays that have been involved in such decisions in New Orleans, Charlottesville, and other cities.\n\nProponents of removing the monuments argue that they serve as painful reminders of slavery. As Tyler Zimmer pointed out this week in the socialist magazine Jacobin, Confederate symbols also recall the efforts of wealthy slave owners to recruit southerners into a worldview and a resulting bloody conflict built on the idea that poor white farmers had more in common with rich white landowners than they did with black slaves who had no economic power -- a worldview of white supremacy:\n\nIn [fighting for the right to own slaves]...these men also betrayed their own class and themselves -- all for the sake of protecting the wealth and power of a tiny ruling class who looked upon them with scorn. From the beginning of the Confederacy, the Southern ruling classes fretted over whether they could win over masses of poor, non-slaveowning whites to their cause. This, of course, is the problem every minority ruling class in history has had to face -- the problem of how to make the sectional, particular interests of the ruling elite appear to be the universal interests of all.\n\nThose who want the monuments taken down point out the significance of how many were erected decades after the Civil War, calling into question the notion that their sole purpose was to commemorate the lives lost. In a study in 2016, the Southern Poverty Law Center detailed how the vast majority of Confederate monuments were built between 1890 and 1920, around the time that Jim Crow laws came to prominence.\n\n\"The argument that the Confederate flag and other displays represent 'heritage, not hate' ignores the near-universal heritage of African Americans whose ancestors were enslaved by the millions in the South,\" said the report. \"It trivializes their pain, their history and their concerns about racism -- whether it's the racism of the past or that of today.\"\n\nOn Twitter, many took issue with Trump's statement that the monuments will be \"never able to be comparably replaced!\" -- noting that many Americans have made more positive contributions to the country and the South than Robert E.

Lee.\n\nA 32-year-old woman was killed and 19 other people injured when an Ohio man suspected of being a white nationalist drove his car into a crowd of counter-protesters.\n\nTrump -- who rose to political prominence by casting doubt on whether Barack Obama, America's first black president, was born in the United States -- has been deluged with demands to unambiguously disavow white hate groups, whose members have been emboldened by his election.\n\nTrump did condemn neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan on several occasions this week -- but many say he did not go far enough. He has earned rebukes from across the political spectrum, even from former presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush.\n\n'Please fix this'\n\nSenator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, on Thursday became the latest member of Trump's Republican Party to criticize the president.\n\n\"I don't think that the president has appropriately spoken to the nation on this issue,\" the senator from Tennessee said.\n\n\"Helping inspire divisions because it generates support from your political base is not a formula for causing our nation to advance.\"\n\n\"The president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful,\" Corker said.\n\n\"And without the things that I just mentioned happening our nation is going to go through great peril.\"\n\nThe president was forced to scrap two White House economic advisory councils on Wednesday as top businessmen began abandoning him in protest.\n\nA White House official said Thursday plans to form a presidential advisory council on infrastructure had also been dropped.\n\nAlong with repealing Obamacare, Trump had promised tax reform and a $1 trillion plan to improve the country's infrastructure.\n\nEfforts to repeal Obama's signature health plan failed, however, and the tax and infrastructure programs have made little headway.\n\nWith moves to dismantle Confederate monuments gaining momentum, Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader in the House of Representatives, called for Confederate statues to be removed from the US Capitol.\n\n\"The Confederate statues in the halls of Congress have always been reprehensible,\" Pelosi said.\n\n\"There is no room for celebrating the violent bigotry of the men of the Confederacy in the hallowed halls of the United States Capitol.\"\n\nTrump made it clear though on Thursday that he opposed removing Confederate monuments.\n\n\"You can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson -- who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish!\" Trump said.\n\n\"Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\nLee commanded the Army of Northern Virginia and General Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson was one of his top lieutenants, while George Washington and Thomas Jefferson were among the Founding Fathers of the United States.\n\nTrump hits critics, media\n\nTrump's chief strategist, Steve Bannon, told The New York Times meanwhile he believed the president's views were shared by many Americans.\n\n\"President Trump, by asking, 'Where does this all end' -- Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln -- connects with the American people about their history, culture and traditions,\" Bannon said.\n\nA poll released Thursday would appear to support the view that many Americans oppose removing the monuments to the Confederacy.\n\nThe NPR/PBS/NewsHour/Marist poll of 1,125 adults asked whether Confederate statues should remain as a historical symbol or be removed because they offend some people.\n\nSixty-two percent said they should remain while 27 percent said they should be taken down.\n\nTrump on Thursday also lashed out at a frequent Republican critic, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and accused the media of distorting his views.\n\n\"The public is learning (even more so) how dishonest the Fake News is,\" he said. \"They totally misrepresent what I say about hate, bigotry. etc. Shame!\"\n\n\"Publicity seeking Lindsey Graham falsely stated that I said there is moral equivalency between the KKK, neo-Nazis & white supremacists... and people like Ms. Heyer,\" Trump said.\n\nHeather Heyer, 32, was the woman killed by the suspected white nationalist in Charlottesville.", "id": "9859992", "details": {},

Tear down more statues. Say the revolution is coming. I can't get enough of it.\"\n\nTrump on Thursday also lashed out at two leading Republican critics in the Senate and accused the media of distorting his views.\n\n\"The public is learning (even more so) how dishonest the Fake News is,\" he said. \"They totally misrepresent what I say about hate, bigotry. etc. Shame!\"\n\nOn Monday Trump singled out the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis as \"repugnant,\" but on Tuesday he said counter-protestors in Charlottesville had been \"very violent\" and equally responsible for the violence.\n\nTrump's weak condemnation of the racist far-right set off a political firestorm across the US political spectrum. World leaders also criticized Trump's response.\n\nTrump was forced to scrap two White House economic advisory councils on Wednesday as top businessmen began abandoning him to protest his stance on the racial debate.\n\nThe president took aim at two fellow Republican senators, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Jeff Flake of Arizona, in a series of tweets.\n\n\"Publicity seeking Lindsey Graham falsely stated that I said there is moral equivalency between the KKK, neo-Nazis & white supremacists... and people like Ms. Heyer,\" Trump said.\n\nHeather Heyer, 32, was the woman killed by the suspected white nationalist in Charlottesville.\n\nGraham had said the US president \"took a step backward\" Tuesday \"by again suggesting there is moral equivalency between the white supremacist neo-Nazis and KKK members who attended the Charlottesville rally\" and people like Heyer.\n\nTrump also blasted Flake, one of the few Republicans openly critical of the president, saying he was \"WEAK on borders, crime and a non-factor in Senate.\"\n\n\"He's toxic!\" Trump tweeted.\n\nFlake, who is running for re-election in Arizona, wrote Tuesday: \"We can't accept excuses for white supremacy & acts of domestic terrorism.

You can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish! Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\" Trump posted on Twitter.\n\nOfficials in several states have called for the removal of public monuments that have become symbols of the Confederacy.\n\nLater Thursday, Trump sent out another tweet praising the counterterrorism tactics of Gen. John J. \"Black Jack\" Pershing, who fought insurgents in the Philippines in the early 1900s.\n\n\"Study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught. There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\" Trump wrote.\n\nMost historians say the episodes cited by the president - including ordering bullets dipped in the blood of pigs, which Muslims are prohibited from eating - are unproven legends stemming from battles around 1911. The rebellion did not end until 1913, and the region was still chaotic for decades - indicating that even if the mythical tactics took place, they did not work.\n\nShifting the spotlight\n\nThe early-morning Twitter posts were the latest in his escalating remarks that critics contend validate white supremacist groups who led a bloody rally over the weekend in Charlottesville, Va. The proposed removal of a statue of the Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from a public park in Charlottesville spurred the demonstrations.\n\nTrump's comments on the Confederate monuments Thursday appeared to shift attention away from his remarks that \"both sides\" were to blame for the violence in Charlottesville, and instead focus the debate on the historical argument to keep the statues in place.\n\nMany people who do not identify as white supremacists support keeping the monuments as a connection to their history and heritage.\n\nAn NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll on Monday and Tuesday of 1,125 adults showed 86 percent of the Republicans surveyed thought Confederate statues should remain in place as a symbol of history.\n\nTrump's tweets came the morning after his personal lawyer forwarded an email to conservative journalists, government officials and friends that painted Lee in glowing terms and echoed secessionist sentiment from the Civil War era.\n\nOn Saturday, the day of the protests, Trump did not condemn neo-Nazis or white supremacists in his remarks about the violence, prompting criticism that his omission suggested support for the racist groups. An Ohio man with white supremacist ties is accused of driving his car into a crowd, killing one woman and injuring 19 people.\n\nTwo days later, Trump bowed to pressure and said racism was \"evil\" and named racist organizations in his follow-up remarks about Charlottesville. But on Tuesday, Trump reverted to his initial public posture and blamed \"both sides\" for the violence.\n\nTrump said many of those who opposed the statue's removal were good people protesting the loss of their culture, and he questioned whether taking down statues of Lee could lead to monuments of George Washington also being removed.\n\nMost of the statues were erected in the 1890s, as Jim Crow laws were being established, and in the 1950s, during a period of Southern resistance to the civil rights movement.\n\n'Not erasing history'\n\nSome in favor of keeping the statues argue that the interpretation of the monuments could be revised to teach future generations about white privilege. But practically, that is unrealistic, said W. Fitzhugh Brundage, a history professor at the University of North Carolina. Brundage said it would be expensive to add explanatory plaques next to the Confederate monuments, and that may not be a prominent enough display of the reinterpretation.\n\nTo those who argue that the statues are not about hate but heritage, Brundage said relocating them to a museum would not erase the heritage.\n\n\"You're not erasing history,\" Brundage said. \"You're just transforming a landscape so that you can make it one you're comfortable living in.\"\n\nCorey Stewart, a Republican who has said he plans to run against Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., in 2018, defended Trump on Thursday.\n\n\"The president is absolutely right,\" Stewart, who was Trump's campaign chairman in Virginia, said on CNN. \"After they get done removing statues to Confederate generals because, arguably, they fought to preserve the institution of slavery, they are going right after slave owners, including the founders - Jefferson, Madison, Washington - and when you undermine the founding fathers, you undermine the founding documents, namely the Constitution of the United States.\"", "id": "9827578", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title":

There are parks, schools and army bases named after confederate leaders and generals.\n\nVirginia has the maximum number of 223 Confederate symbols. States like Texas, Georgia, North Carolina, Alabama have more than 100 such statues and monuments.\n\nIn a statement, Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe supported the move to remove all of them.\n\n\"As we attempt to heal and learn from the tragic events in Charlottesville, I encourage Virginia's localities and the General Assembly which are vested with the legal authority to take down these monuments and relocate them to museums or more appropriate settings,\" McAuliffe said.\n\n\"I hope we can all now agree that these symbols are a barrier to progress, inclusion and equality in Virginia and, while the decision may not be mine to make, I believe the path forward is clear,\" the Governor added.\n\nA crowd of protesters in Durham, North Carolina brought down a confederate statues, while the Mayor or Lexington in Kentucky is taking actions to removal of two confederate era monuments from the city s former court house.\n\nCongressman Bennie Thompson has called for permanent removal of all offensive and despicable Confederate imagery from the Capitol. There are about 10 such monuments within the US Capitol. Every State gets to install two statues there.\n\nOfficials said it is up to individual states to take a call on that. \"Confederate memorabilia have no place in this country and especially not in the US Capitol,\" he said.\n\n\"These images symbolize a time of racial discrimination and segregation that continues to haunt this country and many African-Americans who still to this day face racism and bigotry,\" he added.\n\n(This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)", "id": "9725196", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Trump

You can't change history, but you can learn from it,' Trump tweeted.\n\nWhile he did not mention confederate statutes, but his tweets were apparently referring to the increasing trend in the US to remove statues and monuments related to confederation.\n\nIt all started with the decision of the city council in Charlottesville to remove the statue of Robert R Lee, an American general known for commanding the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia in the American Civil war from 1862 until his surrender in 1865.\n\nThe White supremacists and neo-Nazis held a protest in Charlottesville against the removal of the statues, which was opposed by an equally strong protest from the other side, resulting in deadly violence over the weekend.\n\nTrump has blamed both sides, resulting in hue and cry from his political opponents. -- PTI", "id": "9816015", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "LIVE!

Lee.\n\nA 32-year-old woman was killed and 19 other people injured when an Ohio man suspected of being a white nationalist drove his car into a crowd of counter-protesters.\n\nTrump -- who rose to political prominence by casting doubt on whether Barack Obama, America's first black president, was born in the United States -- has been deluged with demands to unambiguously disavow white hate groups, whose members have been emboldened by his election.\n\nTrump did condemn neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan on several occasions this week -- but many say he did not go far enough. He has earned rebukes from across the political spectrum, even from former presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush.\n\n- 'Please fix this' -\n\nSenator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, on Thursday became the latest member of Trump's Republican Party to criticize the president.\n\n\"I don't think that the president has appropriately spoken to the nation on this issue,\" the senator from Tennessee said.\n\n\"Helping inspire divisions because it generates support from your political base is not a formula for causing our nation to advance.\"\n\n\"The president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful,\" Corker said.\n\n\"And without the things that I just mentioned happening our nation is going to go through great peril.\"\n\nThe president was forced to scrap two White House economic advisory councils on Wednesday as top businessmen began abandoning him in protest.\n\nA White House official said Thursday plans to form a presidential advisory council on infrastructure had also been dropped.\n\nAlong with repealing Obamacare, Trump had promised tax reform and a $1 trillion plan to improve the country's infrastructure.\n\nEfforts to repeal Obama's signature health plan failed, however, and the tax and infrastructure programs have made little headway.\n\nWith moves to dismantle Confederate monuments gaining momentum, Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader in the House of Representatives, called for Confederate statues to be removed from the US Capitol.\n\n\"The Confederate statues in the halls of Congress have always been reprehensible,\" Pelosi said.\n\n\"There is no room for celebrating the violent bigotry of the men of the Confederacy in the hallowed halls of the United States Capitol.\"\n\nTrump made it clear though on Thursday that he opposed removing Confederate monuments.\n\n\"You can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson -- who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish!\" Trump said.\n\n\"Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\nLee commanded the Army of Northern Virginia and General Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson was one of his top lieutenants, while George Washington and Thomas Jefferson were among the Founding Fathers of the United States.\n\n- Trump hits critics, media -\n\nTrump's chief strategist, Steve Bannon, told The New York Times meanwhile he believed the president's views were shared by many Americans.\n\n\"President Trump, by asking, 'Where does this all end' -- Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln -- connects with the American people about their history, culture and traditions,\" Bannon said.\n\nA poll released Thursday would appear to support the view that many Americans oppose removing the monuments to the Confederacy.\n\nThe NPR/PBS/NewsHour/Marist poll of 1,125 adults asked whether Confederate statues should remain as a historical symbol or be removed because they offend some people.\n\nSixty-two percent said they should remain while 27 percent said they should be taken down.\n\nTrump on Thursday also lashed out at a frequent Republican critic, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and accused the media of distorting his views.\n\n\"The public is learning (even more so) how dishonest the Fake News is,\" he said. \"They totally misrepresent what I say about hate, bigotry. etc. Shame!\"\n\n\"Publicity seeking Lindsey Graham falsely stated that I said there is moral equivalency between the KKK, neo-Nazis & white supremacists... and people like Ms. Heyer,\" Trump said.\n\nHeather Heyer, 32, was the woman killed by the suspected white nationalist in Charlottesville.", "id": "9851080", "details": {},

You..... -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\n...can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish! Also... -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\n...the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\nPressured by advisers, the president had taken a step back from the dispute on Monday, two days after he had enraged many by declining to single out the white supremacists and neo-Nazis whose demonstration against the removal of a Robert E. Lee statue had led to violence and the death of a counter-protester in Charlottesville.\n\nIn Baltimore, four Confederate-tied monuments--including one monument to Stonewall Jackson and Robert E. Lee, and another to Chief Justice Roger B. Taney--were removed from late Tuesday through early Wednesday. Also Wednesday, the State House Trust voted to remove a statue of Taney outside the State House in Annapolis.\n\nTrump returned to his combative stance on Wednesday -- insisting anew that \"both sides\" were to blame. And then in a burst of tweets on Thursday he renewed his criticism of efforts to remove memorials and tributes to the Civil War Confederacy.\n\n\"You can't change history, but you can learn from it,\" he tweeted. \"Robert E. Lee. Stonewall Jackson -- who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish. ...\n\n\"Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\nHe wasn't talking about beauty in earlier tweets, lashing at GOP Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Jeff Flake of Arizona.\n\nHe accused \"publicity-seeking\" Graham of falsely stating his position on the demonstrators, called Flake \"toxic\" and praised a Flake primary election opponent.\n\nGraham said Wednesday that Trump \"took a step backward by again suggesting there is moral equivalency\" between the marching white supremacists and the people who had been demonstrating against them. And Flake has been increasingly critical of Trump in recent weeks.\n\nOther Republicans, including the most powerful in Congress, have been making strong statements on Charlottesville and racism, but few have been mentioning Trump himself.\n\nThe Senate's top Republican, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, condemned \"hate and bigotry.\" House Speaker Paul Ryan charged that, \"White supremacy is repulsive.\" But neither criticized the president's insistence that there were \"very fine people on both sides\" of the violent weekend clash in Virginia.\n\nThe nuanced statements reflect the party establishment's delicate dance. Few top Republican officeholders want to defend the president in the midst of an escalating political crisis, yet they are unwilling to declare all-out opposition to him and risk alienating his loyalists.\n\nIn another major sign of discontent within the Republican Party, Trump abruptly abolished two of his White House business councils Wednesday as corporate chiefs began resigning in protest of his racial statements.\n\n\"Rather than putting pressure on the businesspeople of the Manufacturing Council & Strategy & Policy Forum, I am ending both. Thank you all!\" Trump tweeted from New York. His action came after one of the panels had already agreed to disband earlier in the day.\n\nThe White House is trying to deal with the repercussions from Trump's defiant remarks on the Virginia tragedy. Advisers hunkered down, offering no public defense while privately expressing frustration with his comments.\n\nBut Trump himself, staying at his golf club in New Jersey, was increasing rather than slowing his tweet-a-thon.\n\nOn Wednesday, he had told associates he was pleased with how his combative press conference had gone a day earlier, saying he believed he had effectively stood up to the media, according to three people familiar with the conversations who demanded anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about them.\n\nRep. Dutch Ruppersberger, speaking by phone to The C4 Show Thursday, said confederate monuments must be removed.\n\n\"These statues represent a history of repression and having these statues on public land is not who we are as Americans,\" the Timonium Democrat said. \"But there is history. There's no question, we need to learn history, we need to study history, but there are places for these statues to go. It's very simple.\"\n\nHe said Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh made a \"fantastic\" decision in having Baltimore's Confederate monuments taken out without warning and overnight.\n\n\"She avoided another confrontation where people would come together in a violent way fighting what happened,\" he said.\n\nThe president, however, has taken precisely the wrong tack, Ruppersberger said, in suggesting that some of those rallying around the statues, a group that included neo-Nazis and white nationalists, were \"very fine people.\"\n\n\"This is not who we are as Americans, we want to be the greatest country in the world, we want to be patriotic,\" Ruppersberger. \"And whether you're pro-Trump or not, this stuff has got to stop and we've got to move forward and start talking about the issues that are important to America. But if he keeps tweeting and not leading, then we're going to have to see about that.\"\n\nRuppersberger said he plans to reach out to colleagues from both parties to restore Department of Homeland Security grants aimed at countering violent extremism. The White House budget proposal would cut the grant program started in the Obama administration from $50 million to zero in fiscal year 2018.", "id": "9731978", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17",

Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson -- who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish!\"\n\nHe added: \"Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\nOn Aug. 15, Trump ignited controversy by asserting during a White House press conference that white nationalists and anti-racist counter-protesters shared equal responsibility for the violence that led to the death of 32-year-old Heather Heyer in Charlottesville. Trump also asserted that not all members of the \"alt-right\" rally, which contained Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazi members, were racist, CNBC reports.\n\n\"You have some very bad people in that group, but you also had people that were very fine people on both sides,\" Trump said. \"You have people in that group that were there to protest the taking down of, to them, a very, very important statue and the renaming of a park from Robert E. Lee to another name.\"\n\nSeveral White House staffers were reportedly dismayed by Trump's response to the violence in Charlottesville. One adviser, who requested anonymity, told Politico the president had diverted from his talking points during the press conference because he was upset that critics accused him of condemning white nationalists too late.\n\n\"In some ways, Trump would rather have people calling him racist than say he backed down the minute he was wrong,\" the adviser said. \"This may turn into the biggest mess of his presidency because he is stubborn and doesn't realize how bad this is getting.\"\n\nIn 2016, the Southern Poverty Law Center estimated that there were roughly 1,500 Confederate symbols on public lands across the U.S., including more than 700 statues and monuments, according to CNN.\n\nThe same morning that Trump defended Confederate monuments on Twitter, Republican Gov. Paul LePage of Maine asserted during a radio interview that removing the statues was like desecrating shrines to the victims of the 9/11 terrorist attack, The Associated Press reports.\n\n\"To me, it's just like going to New York City right now and taking down the monument of those who perished in 9/11,\" LePage said. \"It will come to that.\"\n\nThe majority of Confederate monuments were erected in the 20th century. Activists and lawmakers who called for their removal assert that the statues glorify the institution of slavery and state secession.\n\n\"We will never solve America's race problem if we continue to honor traitors who fought against the United States in order to keep African Americans in chains,\" Democratic Rep. Cedric Richmond of Louisiana said in a statement, reports ABC News. \"By the way, thank god, they lost.\"\n\nOn Aug. 16, Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey announced he would introduce a bill to remove the Confederate monuments that adorn the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"I will be introducing a bill to remove Confederate statues from the US Capitol building,\" Booker tweeted. \"This is just one step.

Lee.\n\nA 32-year-old woman was killed and 19 other people injured when an Ohio man suspected of being a white nationalist drove his car into a crowd of counter-protesters.\n\nTrump -- who rose to political prominence by casting doubt on whether Barack Obama, America's first black president, was born in the United States -- has been deluged with demands to unambiguously disavow white hate groups, whose members have been emboldened by his election.\n\nTrump did condemn neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan on several occasions this week -- but many say he did not go far enough. He has earned rebukes from across the political spectrum, even from former presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush.\n\n'Please fix this'\n\nSenator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, on Thursday became the latest member of Trump's Republican Party to criticize the president.\n\n\"I don't think that the president has appropriately spoken to the nation on this issue,\" the senator from Tennessee said.\n\n\"Helping inspire divisions because it generates support from your political base is not a formula for causing our nation to advance.\"\n\n\"The president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful,\" Corker said.\n\n\"And without the things that I just mentioned happening our nation is going to go through great peril.\"\n\nThe president was forced to scrap two White House economic advisory councils on Wednesday as top businessmen began abandoning him in protest.\n\nA White House official said Thursday plans to form a presidential advisory council on infrastructure had also been dropped.\n\nAlong with repealing Obamacare, Trump had promised tax reform and a $1 trillion plan to improve the country's infrastructure.\n\nEfforts to repeal Obama's signature health plan failed, however, and the tax and infrastructure programs have made little headway.\n\nWith moves to dismantle Confederate monuments gaining momentum, Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader in the House of Representatives, called for Confederate statues to be removed from the US Capitol.\n\n\"The Confederate statues in the halls of Congress have always been reprehensible,\" Pelosi said.\n\n\"There is no room for celebrating the violent bigotry of the men of the Confederacy in the hallowed halls of the United States Capitol.\"\n\nTrump made it clear though on Thursday that he opposed removing Confederate monuments.\n\n\"You can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson -- who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish!\" Trump said.\n\n\"Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\nLee commanded the Army of Northern Virginia and General Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson was one of his top lieutenants, while George Washington and Thomas Jefferson were among the Founding Fathers of the United States.\n\nTrump hits critics, media\n\nTrump's chief strategist, Steve Bannon, told The New York Times meanwhile he believed the president's views were shared by many Americans.\n\n\"President Trump, by asking, 'Where does this all end' -- Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln -- connects with the American people about their history, culture and traditions,\" Bannon said.\n\nA poll released Thursday would appear to support the view that many Americans oppose removing the monuments to the Confederacy.\n\nThe NPR/PBS/NewsHour/Marist poll of 1,125 adults asked whether Confederate statues should remain as a historical symbol or be removed because they offend some people.\n\nSixty-two percent said they should remain while 27 percent said they should be taken down.\n\nTrump on Thursday also lashed out at a frequent Republican critic, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and accused the media of distorting his views.\n\n\"The public is learning (even more so) how dishonest the Fake News is,\" he said. \"They totally misrepresent what I say about hate, bigotry. etc. Shame!\"\n\n\"Publicity seeking Lindsey Graham falsely stated that I said there is moral equivalency between the KKK, neo-Nazis & white supremacists... and people like Ms. Heyer,\" Trump said.\n\nHeather Heyer, 32, was the woman killed by the suspected white nationalist in Charlottesville.", "id": "9798503", "details": {},

Lee.\n\nBut on Thursday morning Mr Trump criticised the removal of monuments.\n\nSad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\nHis comments put him at odds with the family of Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson, one of the most famous of all confederate generals.\n\n\"Confederate monuments like the Jackson statue were never intended as benign symbols,\" wrote two of Jackson's great-great grandsons.\n\n\"Rather, they were the clearly articulated artwork of white supremacy.\"\n\nIn an open letter to the mayor of Richmond, Virginia - where they live - they called for the removal of statues celebrating their ancestor.\n\n\"While we are not ashamed of our great-great-grandfather, we are ashamed to benefit from white supremacy while our black family and friends suffer. We are ashamed of the monument,\" they wrote.\n\n\"As two of the closest living relatives to Stonewall, we are writing today to ask for the removal of his statue, as well as the removal of all Confederate statues from Monument Avenue. They are overt symbols of racism and white supremacy, and the time is long overdue for them to depart from public display.\"\n\nStatues were removed in New Orleans in April and in Baltimore after the Charlottesville protests. In Alabama they have been covered up in a wooden box this week, as the mayor of the city looks at what to do with them. In Lexington, Kentucky, they are due to be removed.\n\nThe family of Robert E. Lee, whose statue sparked the Charlottesville riots, expressed their horror at the events and said the life of the commander of the army of Northern Virginia \"was about duty, honor and country.\"\n\nThey added: \"At the end of the Civil War, he implored the nation to come together to heal our wounds and to move forward to become a more unified nation.\n\n\"He never would have tolerated the hateful words and violent actions of white supremacists, the KKK, or neo-Nazis.\"\n\nThe statues, many of which were erected in the 20th Century, have been a flashpoint in America since Dylann Roof, a self-confessed white supremacist, murdered nine black worshippers in a Charleston church in June 2015.\n\nHe had posed with the confederate flag, and recorded a manifesto saying he hoped to start a race war.\n\nAll 11 former confederate states have had protests against the statues this year. Many have been removed, and placed in museums.\n\nA descendant of Lee, who commanded the confederate forces from 1862 until their surrender in 1865, echoed the thoughts of the Jackson family and said he had no problem with their removal.\n\n\"Eventually, someone is going to have to make a decision, and if that's the local lawmaker, so be it,\" said Robert E. Lee V, the great-great grandson of the general.\n\n\"But we have to be able to have that conversation without all of the hatred and the violence.\n\n\"And if they choose to take those statues down, fine.\"\n\nMr Lee, 54, of Washington DC, told CNN: \"Maybe it's appropriate to have them in museums or to put them in some sort of historical context in that regard.\"\n\nBertram Hayes-Davis, great-great-grandson of the confederate president Jefferson Davis, agreed with Mr Lee, and said that the statues should be moved to a museum if \"that's offensive to a large majority of the public.\"\n\nHe said: \"In a public place, if it is offensive and people are taking issue with it, let's move it. Let's put it somewhere where historically it fits with the area around it so you can have people come to see it, who want to understand that history and that individual.\"\n\nSome have argued that the removal of the confederate statues is an attempt to erase history, and worried that the Founding Fathers - many of whom owned slaves - would be next.\n\nBut, in an editorial published on Wednesday entitled \"The nation can only weep\", The Washington Post said it was not a complicated distinction to make between confederate generals and the founders of the country.\n\n\"Yes, there are reasonable Americans who fear that slaveholding Founding Fathers will be the next target.\n\n\"But we don't find it difficult to distinguish between a monument to George Washington, say, and statues to Confederate generals that were erected in the 20th century with the goal of maintaining white supremacy.\"\n\nMr Trump's position was backed, however, by the Republican governor of Maine.\n\nPaul LePage, a notorious figure, said on Thursday morning that removing the confederate statues was \"just like\" removing a monument to people who died in the 9/11 attacks.\n\nMr LePage, asked for his response to Charlottesville, said he condemns \"both sides\" that demonstrated, adding that he finds white nationalist and far-Left protesters \"equally as bad\" and \"disgusting.\"\n\nHe added that he believed Left-wing protesters who want to remove confederate statues are ignorant of history and want to erase it, comparing them to \"the Taliban in Afghanistan\" in their desire to remove monuments.\n\nHe told his local television station that he was unaware of the violence in Charlottesville until Tuesday, because he does not read newspapers or watch TV.", "id": "9715638", "details":

You can't change history, but you can learn from it,\" Trump wrote on Twitter.\n\n\"Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish!\" Trump added.\n\nHe was referring to two Confederate generals in the Civil War that ended in 1865, and to early US presidents George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, who owned slaves but whose legacy is overwhelmingly honoured.\n\nHe took aim at the removal or consideration for removal of Confederate statues and monuments in a long list of cities in California, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, New York, North Carolina, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, Tennessee, Virginia and Texas.\n\nOpponents call the statues a festering symbol of racism, while supporters say they honour American history.

There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\" Trump wrote.\n\nTrump's unpredictable, defiant and, critics claim, racially provocative behavior has clearly begun to wear on his Republican allies.\n\nTennessee Sen. Bob Corker, whom Trump considered for a Cabinet post, declared Thursday that \"the president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to\" in dealing with crises. And Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska tweeted, \"Anything less than complete & unambiguous condemnation of white supremacists, neo-Nazis and the KKK by the @POTUS is unacceptable. Period.\"\n\nSen. Tim Scott of South Carolina said Trump's \"moral authority is compromised.\"\n\nTrump, who is known to try to change the focus of news coverage with an attention-grabbing declaration, sought to shift Thursday from the white supremacists to the future of statues.\n\n\"You can't change history, but you can learn from it,\" he tweeted. \"Robert E. Lee. Stonewall Jackson -- who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish. ...\n\n\"Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" he tweeted.\n\nTrump met separately Thursday at his golf club in nearby Bedminster with the administrator of the Small Business Administration and Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a longtime Trump supporter. Trump also prepared for an unusual meeting Friday at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland with his national security team to discuss strategy for South Asia, including India, Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\nVice President Mike Pence was cutting short a long-planned Latin America tour to attend the meeting.\n\nThough out of public view, Trump sought to make his voice heard on Twitter as he found himself increasingly under siege and alone while fanning the controversy over race and politics toward a full-fledged national conflagration.\n\nHe dissolved two business councils Wednesday after the CEO members began quitting, damaging his central campaign promise to be a business-savvy chief executive in the Oval Office.\n\nTwo major charities, the Cleveland Clinic and the American Cancer Society, announced they are canceling fundraisers scheduled for Trump's resort in Palm Beach, Florida, amid the continuing backlash over Trump's remarks.\n\nMeanwhile, rumblings of discontent from his staff grew so loud that the White House had to release a statement saying that Trump's chief economic adviser wasn't quitting. And the president remained on the receiving end of bipartisan criticism for his handling of the aftermath of the Charlottesville clashes.\n\nOn Thursday, he hit back hard -- against Republicans.\n\nHe accused \"publicity-seeking\" Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina of falsely stating Trump's position on the demonstrators. He called Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake \"toxic\" and praised Flake's potential primary election opponent.\n\nGraham said Wednesday that Trump \"took a step backward by again suggesting there is moral equivalency\" between the marching white supremacists and the people who had been demonstrating against them. Flake has been increasingly critical of Trump in recent weeks.\n\nPressured by advisers, the president had softened his words on the dispute Monday, two days after he had enraged many by declining to single out the white supremacists and neo-Nazis whose demonstration against the removal of a Robert E. Lee statute had led to violence and the death of a counter-protester in Charlottesville.\n\nHe returned to his combative stance Tuesday -- insisting anew during an unexpected and contentious news conference at Trump Tower that \"both sides\" were to blame.\n\nAides watching from the sidelines reacted with dismay and disbelief and privately told colleagues they were upset by the president's remarks, though not upset enough for anyone to resign.\n\nThe resignation speculation around Gary Cohn, head of the National Economic Council and a Jew, had grown so intense by Thursday that the White House released a statement saying reports that Cohn was stepping down were \"100 percent false.\"\n\nBut not all of Trump's aides were unhappy with his performance.\n\nAdviser Steve Bannon's job security in the White House has become tenuous -- Trump offered only a \"we'll see\" on Tuesday when asked if his chief strategist would remain in his post -- but Bannon has been telling allies that the president's news conference would electrify the GOP base.\n\nAnd in a pair of interviews Wednesday, Bannon cheered on the president's nationalist tendencies and suggested that a fight over Confederate monuments was a political fight he welcomes.\n\n\"The race-identity politics of the left wants to say it's all racist,\" Bannon told The New York Times. \"Just give me more. Tear down more statues. Say the revolution is coming. I can't get enough of it.\"\n\nLemire reported from New York.

Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish!\"\n\n\"The beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\" he continued.\n\nThe president's tweets came amid criticism Trump has received over his response to the Charlottesville, Va., attack last weekend.\n\nDuring a press conference on Tuesday, Trump defended his initial response that \"many sides\" were responsible for violence that resulted from protests and counter-protests in Charlottesville -- clashes sparked by the removal of a Confederate statue there, and which resulted in the death of 32-year-old counter-protester Heather Heyer.\n\nPoliticians from both parties reacted differently.\n\nMaine Gov. Paul LePage, an outspoken conservative, hailed Trump's stance. He condemned the Ku Klux Klan, members of which were in attendance in Charlottesville, but said counter-protesters who incited violence were \"equally as bad.\"\n\nHe also likened the removal of Confederate statues to taking down monuments honoring victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.\n\n\"Whether we like it or not this is what our history is and to me it's just like going to New York City right now and taking down the monument of those who perished in 9/11,\" LePage told WGAN radio during a weekly interview. \"It will come to that.\"\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., though, called on House Speaker Paul Ryan to remove all Confederate monuments from the grounds of the U.S. Capitol.\n\n\"The Confederate statues in the halls of Congress have always been reprehensible,\" Pelosi said in a statement. \"If Republicans are serious about rejecting white supremacy, I call upon Speaker Ryan to join Democrats to remove the Confederate statues from the Capitol immediately.\"\n\nPelosi pointed out that when Democrats were in control of Congress, they moved a statue of Lee, the Confederate general, out of Statuary Hall in the Capitol and replaced it with one of civil rights activist Rosa Parks.\n\nAt the local level, cities have grappled with how to handle Confederate statues that have the potential to become flash points for racial animus. The city of Baltimore removed multiple Confederate monuments in the early morning hours Wednesday with no warning.\n\nThe fallout from Trump's press conference includes the dismantling of two of his advisory boards -- the American Manufacturing Council and the Strategic and Policy Forum.\n\n\"Racism and murder are unequivocally reprehensible and are not morally equivalent to anything else that happened in Charlottesville,\" Campbell Soup President and CEO Denise Morrison wrote after she left the manufacturing council Wednesday. \"Following [Tuesday's] remarks from the president, I cannot remain on the Manufacturing Jobs Initiative. I will continue to support all efforts to spur economic growth and advocate for the values that have always made America great.\"", "id": "9748542", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title":

Lee, the President demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the moral problem of the Confederacy: building monuments that lionize Confederate war heroes like Jackson and Lee celebrate the lives of men who sought to break the nation apart in the name of slavery.\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" Trump tweeted, doubling down on comments he made earlier in the week to reporters at Trump Tower.\n\n\"You can't change history but you can learn from it. Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish! Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced.\"\n\nThe problem with Trump's argument though, as the executive director of the American Historical Association told CNN's John Berman on Wednesday, is that comparing Jackson and Lee to Washington and Jefferson is a \"specious comparison\" at best.\n\n\"Yes, these were all slaveholders and in that sense, Washington and Jefferson were deeply flawed individuals,\" he said. \"Lee and Jackson, however have been honored for one thing, which is the attempt to create and then defend a new nation that existed for one reason, which was to protect the rights of some individuals to own other individuals.\"\n\nMitch Landrieu, the mayor of New Orleans, addressed this very distinction in an emotional speech earlier this year that capped two years of intense debate in his city over what the monuments said and what they mean.\n\nThe monuments, Landrieu said \"are not just innocent remembrances of a benign history.\"\n\n\"These monuments celebrate a fictional, sanitized Confederacy ignoring the death, ignoring the enslavement, ignoring the terror that it actually stood for,\" he said.\n\nThe argument that removing Confederate monuments is \"changing history\" and \"culture\" as the President did this week also fails to recognize the historical context and tainted culture in which the monuments were erected.\n\nHistorians note that there are two peak periods of Confederate monument building in the United states: one between 1890 and 1920, as Jim Crow was being established and the power of the KKK was at its zenith, and again during the civil rights era of the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nAs such, it is hard to see the very construction of the monuments themselves as less about honoring the individuals they represent, and more about a concrete display of white supremacy during periods of intimidation and subjugation.\n\nThe President is right on one count here: You can not change history, and by its very definition, no one can erase it.

Our history doesn't change when a monument is removed. And how we view history inevitably changes from generation to generation, and should, whether we remove monuments or not.\n\nMany of these monuments were erected long after the Civil War. Did their erection rip apart our history and culture? It did not. Neither will their removal.\n\nTrump also tweeted:\n\nRobert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson -- who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish!\n\nWashington and Jefferson are easily distinguished from Lee and Jackson. The first two never led men into war against the United States.\n\nStill, Trump isn't wrong to worry that memorials to Washington and Jefferson will become targets of the left's purge. We've already seen such stirrings. However, this concern isn't a sufficient reason to retain statues of different sorts of historical figures deemed by the local community to be unworthy of celebration.\n\nIn sum, I disagree with the thrust of Trump's tweets. However, the reaction to them has been over the top, as usual. Politico breathlessly reported that \"Trump's Confederacy fight threatens GOP agenda in Congress.\"\n\nReally? Trump's stance on Confederate statues is going to affect how GOP legislators deal with the debt ceiling and tax reform? Even though more Americans disapprove of removing statutes of Confederates than approve of doing so.\n\nEither the authors of the Politico story or congressional Republicans are idiots.\n\nAnd there was this from the New York Times:\n\nMr. Trump made clear that he has no intention of stepping back from his assertions about the Charlottesville rally that have drawn widespread condemnation. In three tweets, Mr. Trump defended Civil War-era statues, using language very similar to that of white supremacists to argue the statues should remain in place.\n\n(Emphasis added)\n\nThis is very deceptive reporting. There is nothing \"white supremacist\" about Trump's tweets regarding the statues. I have already quoted two of them -- the one about ripping history and culture apart and the one about the slippery slope of Washington and Jefferson. I disagree with Trump's arguments, but they certainly don't express racism.\n\nTrump also tweeted: \"The beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\" and \"\"You can't change history, but you can learn from it.\" Where's the expression of racism in these statements? It doesn't exist.\n\nIf white supremacists are using this language to defend the statues, it's because they are trying to mask their racism by making respectable arguments, in the hope of broadening the appeal of this cause. Therefore, it is dishonest, but all too characteristic, of anti-Trump zealots Michael Shear and Maggie Haberman to make this back door attempt to associate Trump's tweets with racism.\n\nWould it be politically wise for Trump to move on from this dispute? I don't know. I think I know why he doesn't want to move on. He hates the media and won't be intimidated by its braying.", "id": "9818069", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Trump defends monuments to Confederates", "image": "http://www.powerlineblog.com/wp-content/themes/powerline/images/icon.png", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "200134", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Washington"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "235649", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "label": {"eng": "Washington"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Racism"}, "id": "302940", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}, "id": "302944", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Culture"}, "id": "303325", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"}, {"label": {"eng": "History"}, "id": "303747", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}, {"label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}, "id": "303936", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times"}, {"label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}, "id": "304059", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress"}, {"label": {"eng": "Language"}, "id": "305042", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language"}, {"label": {"eng": "American Civil War"}, "id": "305954", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War"}, {"label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "id": "305960", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America"}, {"label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "id": "305969", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Politico"}, "id": "314809", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico"}, {"label": {"eng": "Monument"}, "id": "331127", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monument"}, {"label": {"eng": "Robert E.

Bob Corker, whom Trump considered for a Cabinet post, declared Thursday that \"the president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to\" in dealing with crises.\n\nAnything less than complete & unambiguous condemnation of white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and the KKK by the @POTUS is unacceptable. Period. -- SenDanSullivan (@SenDanSullivan) August 17, 2017\n\nSen. Tim Scott of South Carolina said Trump's \"moral authority is compromised.\"Trump, who is known to try to change the focus of news coverage with an attention-grabbing declaration, sought to shift Thursday from the white supremacists to the future of statues.\n\nSad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 17, 2017\n\nTrump met separately Thursday at his golf club in nearby Bedminster with the administrator of the Small Business Administration and Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a longtime Trump supporter. Trump also prepared for an unusual meeting Friday at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland with his national security team to discuss strategy for South Asia, including India, Pakistan and Afghanistan.Vice President Mike Pence was cutting short a long-planned Latin America tour to attend the meeting.Though out of public view, Trump sought to make his voice heard on Twitter as he found himself increasingly under siege and alone while fanning the controversy over race and politics toward a full-fledged national conflagration.He dissolved two business councils Wednesday after the CEO members began quitting, damaging his central campaign promise to be a business-savvy chief executive in the Oval Office.Meanwhile, rumblings of discontent from his staff grew so loud that the White House had to release a statement saying that Trump's chief economic adviser wasn't quitting. And the president remained on the receiving end of bipartisan criticism for his handling of the aftermath of the Charlottesville clashes.On Thursday, he hit back hard -- against Republicans.He accused \"publicity-seeking\" Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina of falsely stating Trump's position on the demonstrators and called Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake \"toxic\" and praised Flake's potential primary election opponent.Graham said Wednesday that Trump \"took a step backward by again suggesting there is moral equivalency\" between the marching white supremacists and the people who had been demonstrating against them. Flake has been increasingly critical of Trump in recent weeks.Pressured by advisers, the president had softened his words on the dispute Monday, two days after he had enraged many by declining to single out the white supremacists and neo-Nazis whose demonstration against the removal of a Robert E. Lee statute had led to violence and the death of a counter-protester in Charlottesville.He returned to his combative stance on Tuesday -- insisting anew during an unexpected and contentious news conference at Trump Tower that \"both sides\" were to blame.Aides watching from the sidelines reacted with dismay and disbelief and privately told colleagues they were upset by the president's remarks, though not upset enough for anyone to resign.The resignation speculation around Gary Cohn, head of the National Economic Council and a Jew, had grown so intense by Thursday that the White House released a statement saying reports that Cohn was stepping down were \"100 percent false.\"But not all of Trump's aides were unhappy with his performance.Adviser Steve Bannon's job security in the White House has become tenuous -- Trump offered only a \"we'll see\" on Tuesday when asked if his chief strategist would remain in his post -- but Bannon has been telling allies that the president's news conference would electrify the GOP base.And in a pair of interviews Wednesday, Bannon cheered on the president's nationalist tendencies and suggested that a fight over Confederate monuments was a political fight he welcomes.\"The race-identity politics of the left wants to say it's all racist,\" Bannon told The New York Times. \"Just give me more.

You can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson -- who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish! Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\" Trump posted on Twitter.\n\nOfficials in several states have called for the removal of public monuments that have become symbols of the Confederacy.\n\nLater Thursday, Trump sent out another tweet, praising the counterterrorism tactics of Gen. John \"Black Jack\" Pershing, who fought insurgents in the Philippines in the early 1900s.\n\n[PRESIDENT TRUMP: Timeline, appointments, executive orders + guide to actions in first 200 days]\n\n\"Study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught. There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\" Trump wrote.\n\nMost historians say the episodes cited by the president -- including ordering bullets dipped in the blood of pigs, which Muslims are prohibited from eating -- are unproved legends.\n\nThe early-morning Twitter posts were the latest in his escalating remarks that critics contend validate white-supremacist groups that led a bloody rally over the weekend in Charlottesville, Va., in which counterprotester Heather Heyer, 32, was killed.\n\nThe proposed removal of a statue of the Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from a public park in Charlottesville spurred the demonstrations.\n\nThe tweets came the morning after his personal lawyer forwarded an email to conservative journalists, government officials and friends that painted Lee in glowing terms and echoed secessionist sentiment from the Civil War era.\n\nTrump's comments, though, run directly counter to the sentiments expressed by descendants of the same Confederate leaders he referred to. Relatives of those leaders said they don't agree that the statues should stay up, particularly after the violence in Charlottesville.\n\n\"If it can avoid any days like this past Saturday in Charlottesville, then take them down today,\" Robert E. Lee V, who is named for the Confederate general and now lives in Washington, said in an interview Thursday.\n\nKaren Finney, another descendant of Lee's, wrote in an essay published by The Washington Post that his legacy doesn't \"deserve to be honored or defended.\"\n\nTwo men who describe themselves as great-great-grandsons of Thomas Jonathan Jackson -- better known as \"Stonewall,\" a nickname he picked up during the first Battle of Bull Run in 1861 -- echoed the comments from Lee's descendants. In an open letter addressing a statue honoring Jackson in Richmond, Va., the onetime capital of the Confederacy, the men said they were \"ashamed of the monument\" to their ancestor.\n\n\"As two of the closest living relatives to Stonewall, we are writing today to ask for the removal of his statue, as well as the removal of all Confederate statues from Monument Avenue,\" William Jackson Christian and Warren Edmund Christian wrote in the letter published late Wednesday by Slate. \"They are overt symbols of racism and white supremacy, and the time is long overdue for them to depart from public display.\"\n\nOn Saturday, the day of the protests, Trump did not condemn neo-Nazis or white supremacists in his public remarks about the violence, prompting criticism that his omission suggested support for the groups. An Ohio man with white-supremacist ties is accused of driving his car into a crowd, killing Heyer and injuring 19 people.\n\nTwo days later, Trump bowed to pressure and said racism was \"evil\" and named supremacist organizations in his follow-up remarks about Charlottesville. But on Tuesday, Trump reverted to his initial public posture and blamed \"both sides\" for the violence.\n\nTrump said many of those who opposed the Charlottesville statue's removal were good people protesting the loss of their culture, and he questioned whether taking down statues of Lee could lead to monuments of George Washington also being removed.\n\nMost of the statues were erected in the 1890s, as Jim Crow laws were being established, and in the 1950s, during a period of Southern resistance to the civil-rights movement.\n\nIn Washington, Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, called Thursday for the removal of Confederate statues from the U.S. Capitol.\n\n\"The Confederate statues in the halls of Congress have always been reprehensible,\" Pelosi said, putting pressure on House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin to act.\n\n\"If Republicans are serious about rejecting white supremacy,\" Pelosi added, \"I call upon Speaker Ryan to join Democrats to remove the Confederate statues from the Capitol immediately.\"\n\nBut Corey Stewart, a Republican who has said he plans to run against Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., in 2018, defended Trump's stance on such monuments.\n\n\"The president is absolutely right,\" Stewart, who was Trump's campaign chairman in Virginia, said Thursday on CNN. \"After they get done removing statues to Confederate generals because, arguably, they fought to preserve the institution of slavery, they are going right after slave owners, including the founders -- Jefferson, Madison, Washington -- and when you undermine the Founding Fathers, you undermine the founding documents, namely the Constitution of the United States.\"\n\nLOSING GOP SUPPORT\n\nYet Trump's comments continued to erode support among many other Republicans.\n\nSen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said Trump \"recently has not demonstrated that he understands the character of this nation.\" In comments to reporters after a speech to the Chattanooga Rotary Club, Corker called for \"radical changes\" in how the Trump White House operates.\n\nCorker has sought to be a strong supporter of Trump's, particularly on foreign-policy matters. But a few months ago, over reports that Trump had disclosed highly classified information to a pair of Russian diplomats in the Oval Office, Corker said the White House was \"in a downward spiral.\" In recent weeks, Corker had largely declined to answer questions about Trump's tweets or other political drama, telling reporters covering Congress that he was focused instead on matters of policy.\n\nHe elected to weigh in Thursday, however. Noting that the country is polarized, Corker wrote on Facebook, \"Helping inspire divisions because it generates support from your political base is not a formula for causing our nation to advance, our nation to overcome the many issues that we have to deal with right now.\"\n\nMeanwhile, more Republicans aired critiques of Trump's response to the events in Charlottesville.\n\nSen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska tweeted, \"Anything less than complete & unambiguous condemnation of white supremacists, neo-Nazis and the KKK by the POTUS is unacceptable. Period.\"\n\nSen. Tim Scott of South Carolina said Trump's \"moral authority is compromised.\"\n\nAnd as denunciations from Republicans mounted, Trump hit back.\n\nIn a Thursday tweet, Trump accused \"publicity seeking\" Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina of falsely stating Trump's position on the demonstrators.\n\nGraham said Wednesday that Trump \"took a step backward by again suggesting there is moral equivalency\" between the marching white supremacists and the people who had been demonstrating against them.\n\nIn going after Graham, Trump suggested that the senator, who also ran for president in 2016, was still smarting from his loss to Trump in the Republican primaries.\n\nTrump tweeted: \"Publicity seeking Lindsey Graham falsely stated that I said there is moral equivalency between the KKK, neo-Nazis & white supremacists ... and people like Ms. Heyer. Such a disgusting lie. He just can't forget his election trouncing. The people of South Carolina will remember!\"\n\nGraham responded with a statement in which he said Trump's handling of the Charlottesville violence was being praised by \"some of the most racist and hate-filled individuals and groups in our country. For the sake of our Nation -- as our President -- please fix this. History is watching us all.\"\n\nAlso Thursday, Trump called Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona \"toxic\" while praising his potential primary-election opponent. Flake recently published a book that was highly critical of Trump.\n\nTrump tweeted: \"Great to see that Dr. Kelli Ward is running against Flake Jeff Flake, who is WEAK on borders, crime and a non-factor in Senate. He's toxic!\"\n\nCorker, in his Thursday comments, defended his Republican colleague.\n\nFlake is \"one of the finest best human beings I've ever met,\" Corker said. He said the White House would be well served to embrace Flake because of his substance and character. Flake has a \"conscience and is a real conservative,\" Corker said.\n\nSeparately Thursday, the White House took the unusual step of saying National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn would not resign, in response to speculation that Cohn would do so in response to Trump's remarks about Charlottesville.\n\nCohn, who funded the Cohn Jewish Student Center at Kent State University in 2009, was mortified by Trump's comments, three people close to him said, and he has been bombarded with calls from friends asking him if he will leave.\n\nThe White House said in a statement that reports about Cohn resigning are \"100 percent false.\"\n\nInformation for this article was contributed by Eileen Sullivan, Maggie Haberman and Thomas Kaplan of The New York Times; by Jonathan Lemire, Darlene

Lee and Stonewall Jackson will be removed from the CUNY hall of great Americans because New York stands against racism.\n\n\"There are many great Americans, many of them New Yorkers worthy of a spot in this great hall. These two confederates are not among them.\"\n\nHe also requested confederate names be removed from the streets of Fort Hamilton in Brooklyn.\n\nConfederate monuments were removed from Baltimore in the middle of the night.\n\nThe Mayor, Catherine Pugh, told the New York Times: \"For me, the statues represented pain, and not only did I want to protect my city from any more of that pain, I also wanted to protect my city from any of the violence that was occurring around the nation.\"\n\nCharlottesville made the decision to have a monument to General Robert E Lee removed, with violence breaking out in August 2017 over the decision.\n\nFar-right groups had rallied to protest the decision to bring the statue down, with a 32-year-old woman involved in a counter-protest killed when a car rammed through crowds.\n\nThe removal of the statue has been put on hold due to legal issues.\n\nTwo memorials will be removed from the Forest Hill Cemetery.\n\nThe Madison Mayor Paul Soglin said that removing the monuments would not erase history, pointing out the legacy would always be with the US.\n\nDonald Trump has called the removal of Confederate statues \"so foolish\".\n\nThe US President voiced his opinion in a series of tweets, writing: \"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments.\n\n\"You can't change history, but you can learn from it.\"\n\nHe had earlier warned: \"Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson?

Trump.\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" the president said on Twitter Thursday morning, a day after the city removed four monuments from their pedestals in an unannounced overnight operation. \"You can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson -- who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish!\"\n\nWhile Trump did not call out Baltimore by name, a statue of the two Confederate generals in Wyman Park Dell was among the four memorials removed from public display before dawn on Wednesday, swiftly resolving an issue that multiple cities are confronting following last weekend's white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., that left a counter-protester dead.\n\nIn a signal of how protracted a battle this may be, on Thursday, someone knocked over the protest statue of a black woman, titled Madre Luz, that activists had placed on the pedestal after the removal of Lee and Jackson. Police said the person was a white male in a blue shirt and khaki shorts who left in a vehicle. Earlier someone had painted the base with the words: \"Honor history.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the push to take down Confederate monuments received unexpected support from descendants of Jackson. Writing to Richmond, Va., Mayor Levar Stoney, a longtime critic of his city's Confederate statues, two great-great-grandsons of Jackson called the monuments \"overt symbols of racism and white supremacy\" that should have been taken down long ago.\n\n\"Overnight, Baltimore has seen fit to take this action,\" William Jackson Christian and Warren Edmund Christian wrote in an open letter. \"Richmond should, too.\"\n\nThe descendants went on to say, \"While we are not ashamed of our great-great-grandfather, we are ashamed to benefit from white supremacy while our black family and friends suffer. We are ashamed of the monument.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Stoney ordered a city commission to look into removing Confederate statutes that line Monument Avenue, an option previously not under consideration in this former capital of the Confederacy during the Civil War.\n\nWhile not a new issue, after what happened in Charlottesville, emotions have intensified on both sides of the debate. Trump's stance on the violent protests have only fueled the fire.\n\nTrump angered many when, on Saturday, he tweeted condemnation of \"this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides,\" seemingly making no distinction between the white supremacists and those who opposed them.\n\nOn Monday, under mounting attacks even from within his Republican Party, Trump made a second statement, saying, \"Racism is evil. And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including KKK, neo-Nazis, White Supremacists, and other hate groups are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.\"\n\nBut by Tuesday, he not only returned to his many-sides equivalence but added that there were many \"fine people\" on both sides. He also waded into the Confederate monuments controversy, firmly planting himself in the side of keeping them intact, and seemingly putting Lee and Jackson on the same level as two founding fathers.\n\n\"So this week, it is Robert E. Lee. I noticed that Stonewall Jackson is coming down. I wonder, is it George Washington next week? And is it Thomas Jefferson the week after? You know, you really do have to ask yourself, where does it stop?\" Trump said.\n\nIn response to a reporter's question about taking down statues of Lee, Trump said that decision belongs to local communities or the federal government, depending on the location.\n\nOn Thursday, a day after most Baltimoreans woke up to discover the Confederate statues gone, Trump decried the statues's removal in a tweetstorm, concluding that \"the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\nThat drew rebukes, including one from U.S. Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger, who tweeted, \"There is plenty of beauty in Baltimore WITHOUT monuments glorifying our country's darkest chapters, @realDonaldTrump.\"\n\nAlso on Thursday, U.S. Sen. Corey Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, announced plans to introduce a bill to remove statues honoring Confederate soldiers from the U.S. Capitol.\n\nIn addition to the Lee and Jackson statue, Baltimore removed the Confederate Soldiers and Sailors Monument on Mount Royal Avenue and the Confederate Women's Monument on West University Parkway. A fourth monument, memorializing Chief Justice Roger B. Taney at Mount Vernon Place, also was removed Wednesday. Taney wrote the Supreme Court decision in the Dred Scott case, which ruled blacks were not citizens.\n\nMayor Catherine Pugh said she decided Tuesday morning to remove them \"quickly and quietly\" under cover of darkness to avoid any violent disturbances like the one in Charlottesville.\n\nPugh reiterated Thursday that Baltimore officials do not plan to destroy the city's Confederate monuments and will instead consider requests to acquire them. She formed a working group to determine their fate.\n\n\"The working group will consider any proposals or requests to acquire the monuments,\" Pugh's spokesman, Anthony McCarthy, said in an email.\n\nIt's unclear whether any such request have been received.\n\nTerry Klima, commander of the Maryland division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, said the monuments \"should go back exactly where they were found.\"\n\nHe said Pugh's action was \"inappropriate\" and called on the Maryland Historical Trust to intervene. He declined to say whether he would support placing the memorials in a Confederate cemetery, a museum or elsewhere.\n\nFor now they remain in a city-owned lot, unrecognizable behemoths underneath tarps.\n\nBaltimore City Councilman Brandon Scott has suggested melting them down to create statues of prominent Baltimoreans, such as Clarence Du Burns, the city's first black mayor.\n\nConfederate symbols faced a nationwide backlash after the 2015 killing of nine black Americans at a church in Charleston, S.C., by white supremacist terrorist Dylann Roof.\n\nElizabeth Nix, an assistant professor of public history at the University of Baltimore, served on a task force, formed by former Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake to study the Confederate monuments. She called it \"wise\" to keep the statues protected on city property until officials figure out what to do.\n\n\"Before this process, a lot of people did not know we had four Confederate monuments on public property in Baltimore City,\" she said. \"The commission heard testimony from hundreds of people who came and testified on both sides. That discussion is just what public historians want to see happen -- a discussion of history and its role in our lives today.\"\n\nNix said commission members had hoped the statue of Lee and Jackson could be sent to Chancellorsville, Va., where the two Confederate generals met on the battlefield. She also likes Pugh's idea of placing the statues to fallen Confederate soldiers in Confederate cemeteries.\n\nAs for the Taney statue, she suggested melting it down and making it into another monument.\n\n\"I love the idea of having a Frederick Douglass statute,\" she said.\n\n-- -- --\n\n(Sun staffers Luke Broadwater and Carrie Wells contributed to this article.)", "id": "9895666",

Robert E. Lee. Charlottesville's plans to remove the statute was the stated reason for a white supremacist march in that city over the weekend, which led to violent clashes and one death.\n\nBut Trump's remarks, made in a Tweet on Thursday, also may be part of an effort to direct the debate over the president's defense of some of the marchers, which has drawn a rebuke from some members of his own party, to one over the removal of statues.\n\nDespite the controversy over Trump's remarks, chief strategist Steve Bannon sees it as working in Trump's favor.\n\n\"The race-identity politics of the left wants to say it's all racist. Just give me more. Tear down more statues. Say the revolution is coming. I can't get enough of it,\" he said to the New York Times.\n\nBannon's future has been in doubt this week, but he is said to be supportive and even pleased with the way that Trump has responded to the Charlottesville attacks.

See reaction tweets from Hollywood stars below.\n\nIn his fiery press conference on Tuesday, Trump slammed calls for the removal of Confederate statues in the wake of the violent Charlottesville protest. That event, which proved deadly, was sparked in part by neo-Nazis and white supremacists objecting to the potential removal of a Robert E. Lee monument. After the rioting, many have argued that such symbols across the country should come down because they celebrate slavery and the Southern states' failed secession during the Civil War.\n\nNow on Thursday, as some towns, cities and states have started to either remove statues or consider the possibility of doing so, the president is doubling-down on his objection. He tweeted, \"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments. You can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish! Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\nMany on social media were quick to accuse Trump of favoring America's racist past over a progressive, united future that embraces equality. And a number of people calling him out are celebs. Mia Farrow replied, \"Sir, Put those 'beautiful statues' of guys who tried to keep black ppl in chains on your own lawn. U cd add some 'beautiful' Hitler statues.\" She went on in a second tweet, \"There is NOTHING beautiful about slavery or those who fought to perpetuate it.\" Farrow also noted that \"Trump bulldozed historic art to build Trump Tower. Monuments 'fell to the floor and shattered in a million pieces.'\"\n\nAndy Cohen sarcastically told the president, \"Sweetie we will fight hard to keep the Hitler statues up so you have something pretty to look at.\" Don Cheadle responded to him, \"Wow. Talked to Gen. Kelly lately? How's he feeling?\" George Takei simply said, \"Just. Stop.\" He also posted, \"Yes, it's time for these symbols of hate to go.\" Soledad O'Brien stressed to followers, \"He's talking about monuments to white supremacy.\"\n\n\"This is learning, you dumb ass. Now shut up and resign,\" Samantha Ronson bluntly told the president, adding, \"You are an actual garbage person. Can't wait to replace you. #maga.\" Sharing a news story about dozens of people in North Carolina coming together to take joint responsibility after a woman was arrested for her role in toppling a statue, Alyssa Milano declared, \"This. Is. My. Country.\" She also wrote to Trump, \"You know what would be strong leadership? Call to have them taken down.

Be tough & strong, we love you!\n\n-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 17, 2017\n\nShortly afterward, he followed up by suggesting his followers research a debunked story about U.S. Army Gen. John J. Pershing executing Muslims with bullets that had been dipped in pig's blood.\n\nStudy what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught. There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\n\n-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 17, 2017\n\nThe swift condemnation and attribution of blame was decidedly divergent from the president's reaction to the events in Charlottesville, where a car driven by an alleged white supremacist rammed a group of counterprotesters, killing Heather Heyer, 32, and injuring 19 others.\n\nIn a tweet that came hours after violent clashes between white supremacists and counterprotesters, Trump initially shied away from calling out any one group.\n\nWe ALL must be united & condemn all that hate stands for. There is no place for this kind of violence in America. Lets come together as one!\n\n-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 12, 2017\n\nApproximately forty minutes later, the president tweeted again.\n\nAm in Bedminster for meetings & press conference on V.A. & all that we have done, and are doing, to make it better-but Charlottesville sad!\n\n-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 12, 2017\n\nAt a signing event later in the day in Bedminster, N.J., Trump offered another take on the violence.\n\n\"We're closely following the terrible events unfolding in Charlottesville, Va.,\" Trump said. \"We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence, on many sides -- on many sides. It's been going on for a long time in our country.\"\n\nTrump's choice to condemn \"many sides\" was widely derided as an inadequate response to the hate groups in Charlottesville and an attempt to equate them with the counterprotesters. Later on Saturday, Trump tweeted tributes to Heyer and two Virginia state troopers who died when the helicopter they were using to monitor the scene crashed.\n\nDeepest condolences to the families & fellow officers of the VA State Police who died today. You're all among the best this nation produces.\n\n-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 12, 2017\n\nCondolences to the family of the young woman killed today, and best regards to all of those injured, in Charlottesville, Virginia. So sad!\n\n-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 12, 2017\n\nAs criticism over his initial response gathered steam, Trump was convinced by advisers to make a further statement on Monday from the White House. \"Racism is evil,\" Trump said, reading from a teleprompter. \"And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.\"\n\nWhile his amended statement was applauded by many of his supporters, it ushered in new questions about why the president did not condemn those hate groups in the first place. As that criticism was amplified by the media, Trump returned to Twitter to vent his frustration.\n\nMade additional remarks on Charlottesville and realize once again that the #Fake News Media will never be satisfied...truly bad people!\n\n-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 14, 2017\n\nThat anger bubbled over at a press conference Tuesday at Trump Tower in New York City, during which the president returned to the rationale that blame for the Charlottesville violence was shared.\n\n\"I think there's blame on both sides, and I have no doubt about it,\" Trump said during a combative back and forth with reporters.\n\nTrump defended his Saturday statement by insisting he \"didn't know all of the facts,\" and had hedged his words out of a measure of caution.\n\nWhile he said some \"very bad people\" partook in the \"Unite the Right\" rally, he also took pains to add, \"You also had people that were very fine people, on both sides.\"\n\nThe \"Unite the Right\" rally was organized to protest the planned removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, and Trump seemed to side with those activists by comparing Civil War figures with the Founding Fathers.\n\n\"Was George Washington a slave owner?\" Trump asked a reporter at the press conference. \"So will George Washington now lose his status? Are we going to take down -- excuse me -- are we going to take down statues to George Washington? How about Thomas Jefferson? What do you think of Thomas Jefferson?\"\n\n\"You are changing history, you're changing culture,\" Trump continued, before returning to the violence that transpired in Charlottesville. \"You had people, and I'm not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists, because they should be condemned totally. You had many people in that group other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists, O.K.? And the press has treated them absolutely unfairly.\"\n\nWednesday, after those comments drew fresh rebukes from members of both parties, Trump highlighted the memorial for Heyer, but otherwise did not comment on Charlottesville.\n\nMemorial service today for beautiful and incredible Heather Heyer, a truly special young woman. She will be long remembered by all!\n\n-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 16, 2017\n\nBy Thursday, Trump's frustration was once again on display on Twitter. He first bashed Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., for the latter's harsh statement decrying the president's remarks.\n\nPublicity seeking Lindsey Graham falsely stated that I said there is moral equivalency between the KKK, neo-Nazis & white supremacists......\n\n-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 17, 2017\n\n...and people like Ms. Heyer. Such a disgusting lie. He just can't forget his election trouncing.The people of South Carolina will remember!\n\n-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 17, 2017\n\nTrump then moved on to targeting his avowed enemy, the press.\n\nThe public is learning (even more so) how dishonest the Fake News is. They totally misrepresent what I say about hate, bigotry etc. Shame!\n\n-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 17, 2017\n\nThen, defiantly, he returned to the subject of Confederate monuments, bemoaning that \"the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\nSad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments. You.....\n\n-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 17, 2017\n\n...can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish! Also...\n\n-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 17, 2017\n\n...the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\n\n-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 17, 2017\n\nTrump has already sparked controversy by invoking the debunked story about Pershing in response to the Barcelona terror attacks.

Statues in cities like Baltimore and Durham, North Carolina, have been taken down this week after the fatal violence in Charlottesville, sparked by debate over its Robert E. Lee statue. \"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" he tweeted shortly after 9 a.m. \"You can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson -- who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish!\" He added that \"the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\nThis isn't just another crazy Trump tweet. In light of the violence in Charlottesville, it may well be another win for white supremacists: Like the president, they believe monuments erected to glorify Confederate generals who fought for the right of white people to own black slaves are \"beautiful\" reminders of the past, so much so that they descended on Charlottesville to fight for the city's Lee statue. That the president -- who first expressed his support of Confederate monuments in his controversial press conference on Tuesday -- felt compelled to repeat his stance and potentially embolden further violence is staggering. Richard Spencer has already vowed to return to Charlottesville; does the president really want to give him a nudge?\n\nTrump's defense feels especially misplaced given that the descendants of Stonewall Jackson -- one of the Confederate generals whose legacy the president is so passionate about protecting -- completely disagree with him. In an open letter at Slate, Jackson's great-great grandsons ask Richmond mayor Levar Stoney and the city's Monument Avenue Commission to remove Jackson's statue and all other Confederate statues from its Monument Avenue thoroughfare, calling them \"overt symbols of racism and white supremacy.\"\n\n\"Charlottesville showed us unequivocally that Confederate statues offer pre-existing iconography for racists,\" wrote William Jackson Christian and Warren Edmund Christian. \"To them, the Robert E. Lee statue is a clear symbol of their hateful ideology. The Confederate statues on Monument Avenue are, too -- especially Jackson, who faces north, supposedly as if to continue the fight.\"\n\nJackson's descendants say that while they've learned that Jackson was loving to his family and had taught Sunday school to slaves in Lexington, Virginia, they ultimately \"cannot ignore his decision to own slaves, his decision to go to war for the Confederacy, and, ultimately, the fact that he was a white man fighting on the side of white supremacy,\" they wrote. \"While we are not ashamed of our great great grandfather, we are ashamed to benefit from white supremacy while our black family and friends suffer. We are ashamed of the monument.\" Note to President Trump: Before you continue invoking Jackson, you may want to sit down with these guys.\n\nMeanwhile in Charlottesville last night, new lights shone on the University of Virginia campus as thousands of people gathered for a candlelight \"Take Back the Lawn\" vigil in the same spot where, on Friday night, torch-wielding white supremacists and neo-Nazis had marched, chanting, \"Jews will not replace us.\" This time the crowd sang \"Lean on Me\" and \"We Shall Overcome.\"", "id": "9722673", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Actually, President Trump, Even Stonewall Jackson's Descendants Believe \"Monuments Must Go\" - Vogue", "image": "http://assets.vogue.com/photos/5995a4b448f10d45959bcffd/16:9/pass/00-social-tout-stonewall-jackson-monument.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "189313", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Durham"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "192672", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durham,_North_Carolina", "label": {"eng": "Durham"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "200134", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Lexington"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "200993", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexington,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Lexington"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Richmond"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "201613", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Richmond"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fox News Channel"}, "id": "302938", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News_Channel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Racism"}, "id": "302940", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism"}, {"label": {"eng": "White people"}, "id": "303415", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "Christian"}, "id": "304283", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian"}, {"label": {"eng": "African American"}, "id": "304393", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American"}, {"label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "id": "305960", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America"}, {"label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "id": "305969", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Slavery"}, "id": "309898", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ideology"}, "id": "309967", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology"}, {"label": {"eng": "Slavery in the United States"}, "id": "318253", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "Slate (magazine)"}, "id": "321020", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_(magazine)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Iconography"}, "id": "355036", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iconography"}, {"label": {"eng": "Robert E.

These monuments purposefully celebrate a fictional, sanitized Confederacy; ignoring the death, ignoring the enslavement, and the terror that it actually stood for.\"", "id": "9722989", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Trump Defends 'Beauty' Of Confederate Memorials", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201708/544152462.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "200134", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Crime"}, "id": "302901", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime"}, {"label": {"eng": "Racism"}, "id": "302940", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}, "id": "302944", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Violence"}, "id": "302966", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence"}, {"label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}, "id": "303042", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Culture"}, "id": "303325", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"}, {"label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}, "id": "304050", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "Independent (politician)"}, "id": "305074", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_(politician)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}, "id": "305262", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "id": "305960", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America"}, {"label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "id": "305969", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy"}, {"label": {"eng": "History of the United States"}, "id": "306055", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "White House Press Secretary"}, "id": "308023", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Press_Secretary"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nation"}, "id": "308370", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation"}, {"label": {"eng": "NPR"}, "id": "308986", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bigotry"}, "id": "310173", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigotry"}, {"label": {"eng": "History of slavery"}, "id": "311765", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_slavery"}, {"label": {"eng": "Founding Fathers of the United States"}, "id": "318104", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ku Klux Klan"}, "id": "318256", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan"}, {"label": {"eng": "Robert E.

There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\" Trump wrote.\n\nTrump's unpredictable, defiant and, critics claim, racially provocative behavior has clearly begun to wear on his Republican allies.\n\nTennessee Sen. Bob Corker, whom Trump considered for a Cabinet post, declared Thursday that \"the president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to\" in dealing with crises. And Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska tweeted, \"Anything less than complete & unambiguous condemnation of white supremacists, neo-Nazis and the KKK by the POTUS is unacceptable. Period.\"\n\nSen. Tim Scott of South Carolina said Trump's \"moral authority is compromised.\"\n\nTrump, who is known to try to change the focus of news coverage with an attention-grabbing declaration, sought to shift Thursday from the white supremacists to the future of statues.\n\n\"You can't change history, but you can learn from it,\" he tweeted. \"Robert E. Lee. Stonewall Jackson -- who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish. ...\n\n\"Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" he tweeted.\n\nTrump met separately Thursday at his golf club in nearby Bedminster with the administrator of the Small Business Administration and Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a longtime Trump supporter. Trump also prepared for an unusual meeting Friday at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland with his national security team to discuss strategy for South Asia, including India, Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\nVice President Mike Pence was cutting short a long-planned Latin America tour to attend the meeting.\n\nThough out of public view, Trump sought to make his voice heard on Twitter as he found himself increasingly under siege and alone while fanning the controversy over race and politics toward a full-fledged national conflagration.\n\nHe dissolved two business councils Wednesday after the CEO members began quitting, damaging his central campaign promise to be a business-savvy chief executive in the Oval Office.\n\nAnd the White House said Thursday that it was abandoning plans to form an infrastructure advisory council.\n\nTwo major charities, the Cleveland Clinic and the American Cancer Society, announced they are canceling fundraisers scheduled for Trump's resort in Palm Beach, Florida, amid the continuing backlash over Trump's remarks.\n\nMeanwhile, rumblings of discontent from his staff grew so loud that the White House had to release a statement saying that Trump's chief economic adviser wasn't quitting. And the president remained on the receiving end of bipartisan criticism for his handling of the aftermath of the Charlottesville clashes.\n\nOn Thursday, he hit back hard -- against Republicans.\n\nHe accused \"publicity-seeking\" Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina of falsely stating Trump's position on the demonstrators. He called Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake \"toxic\" and praised Flake's potential primary election opponent.\n\nGraham said Wednesday that Trump \"took a step backward by again suggesting there is moral equivalency\" between the marching white supremacists and the people who had been demonstrating against them. Flake has been increasingly critical of Trump in recent weeks.\n\nPressured by advisers, the president had softened his words on the dispute Monday, two days after he had enraged many by declining to single out the white supremacists and neo-Nazis whose demonstration against the removal of a Robert E. Lee statute had led to violence and the death of a counter-protester in Charlottesville.\n\nHe returned to his combative stance Tuesday -- insisting anew during an unexpected and contentious news conference at Trump Tower that \"both sides\" were to blame.\n\nAides watching from the sidelines reacted with dismay and disbelief and privately told colleagues they were upset by the president's remarks, though not upset enough for anyone to resign.\n\nThe resignation speculation around Gary Cohn, head of the National Economic Council and a Jew, had grown so intense by Thursday that the White House released a statement saying reports that Cohn was stepping down were \"100 percent false.\"\n\nBut not all of Trump's aides were unhappy with his performance.\n\nAdviser Steve Bannon's job security in the White House has become tenuous -- Trump offered only a \"we'll see\" on Tuesday when asked if his chief strategist would remain in his post -- but Bannon has been telling allies that the president's news conference would electrify the GOP base.\n\nAnd in a pair of interviews Wednesday, Bannon cheered on the president's nationalist tendencies and suggested that a fight over Confederate monuments was a political fight he welcomes.\n\n\"The race-identity politics of the left wants to say it's all racist,\" Bannon told The New York Times. \"Just give me more. Tear down more statues. Say the revolution is coming. I can't get enough of it.\"", "id": "9812687", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Under fire  --  from GOP  --  Trump digs in on Confederate icons | HeraldNet.com", "image":

Notwithstanding its self-professed tag of being the world's greatest democracy, the country's founders were slave-owners, and white supremacists - many of whom adore Trump for his unabashedly nativist stance - idolize and idealize the country's dark past, including celebrating Southern Confederate generals who opposed the end of slavery.\n\nNone of this is a secret, but Trump has stirred latent unrest over the country's past. In yet another series of controversial tweets on Thursday morning, the US President argued that White supremacists and nativists protesting the removal of Confederate monuments (celebrating pro-slavery figures) were not wrong because it was part of the country's history that could not be changed, and those who were pressing for the removal of such monuments were \"foolish.\"\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments. You can't change history, but you can learn from it,\" Trump tweeted, further roiling a country that is already inflamed by debate on slavery and racism after violent clashes between all-white, alt-right elements seeking, like Trump, to preserve - and in some cases celebrate -- the country's dark past, and left-liberal activists seeking to erase it.\n\n\"So foolish! Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\" Trump continued, invoking names of Confederate heroes Robert Lee and Stonewall Jackson, whose monuments and memorials are being removed in many US cities and states that have rejected racist white hypernationalism.\n\nIronically, even descendants of Lee and Jackson are saying they have no problem with statues of their forbears being taken down or mothballed.\n\n\"Maybe it's appropriate to have them in museums or to put them in some sort of historical context in that regard,\" Gen. Lee's great-great-grandson Robert E Lee told CNN. \"In a public place, if it is offensive and people are taking issue with it, let's move it. Let's put it somewhere where historically it fits with the area around it so you can have people come to see it, who want to understand that history and that individual,\" added Bertram Hayes-Davis, great-great-grandson of Confederate president Jefferson Davis.\n\nMonuments, roads, and highways named after Confederate heroes abound in South-Eastern United States, including in and around Washington DC. But they are gradually being removed in cities such as Baltimore, New Orleans, and Atlanta, where these are seen as an abrasive reminder to blacks and liberals of the country's dark past.\n\nConversely, the monuments have become a rallying point for white supremacists who believed they are being marginalized in a country they think they own and belongs only to them.\n\nSuch supremacists, including reactionary and extremist Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis, constituted a large segment of the alt-right rally in Charlottesville last week that degenerated into violence, and resulted in the mowing down of a liberal counter-demonstrator by a white extremist. Although Trump condemned the murder and expressed admiration for the liberal activist, the rest of his remarks and arguments are widely seen as being sympathetic to the all-white, alt-right cause - which also constitutes his primary voting base.\n\nIn fact, the Lee family went so far as to condemn the ugly and racist rally that President Trump has repeatedly tried to rationalize and justify. \"At the end of the Civil War, he (Gen Lee) implored the nation to come together to heal our wounds and to move forward to become a more unified nation,\" the family said in a statement referring to events in Charlottesville. \"He never would have tolerated the hateful words and violent actions of white supremacists, the KKK, or neo-Nazis.\"\n\nBut Trump insists that he is against the bigotry and hate expressed at the rally even as his own partymen are mortified and shamed by his statements. As usual, he is also blaming the media for \"misrepresenting\" statements that white extremists have been celebrating.\n\n\"The public is learning (even more so) how dishonest the Fake News is. They totally misrepresent what I say about hate, bigotry etc. Shame!\" he raged on Twitter, lashing out at Republican Senator Lindsey Graham for concluding that Trump has drawn a moral equivalency between the KKK, neo-Nazis & white supremacists, and the slain protester.\n\nThe looming question before the United States is where all this will end. As has increasingly become the pattern, Trump is heading out to his support base in Middle America for succor, even as the coastal liberals disdain him. \"Join me at 7:00 P.M. on Tuesday, August 22nd in Phoenix, Arizona at the Phoenix Convention Center!\" he announced Thursday on Twitter.\n\nGet latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for

(AP) -- With prominent Republicans openly questioning his competence and moral leadership, President Donald Trump on Thursday burrowed deeper into the racially charged debate over Confederate memorials and lashed out at members of his own party in the latest controversy to engulf his presidency.\n\nOut of sight, but still online, Trump tweeted his defense of monuments to Confederate icons -- bemoaning rising efforts to remove them as an attack on America's \"history and culture.\"\n\nAnd he berated his critics who, with increasingly sharper language, have denounced his initially slow and then ultimately combative comments on the racial violence at a white supremacist rally last weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nTrump was much quicker Thursday to condemn violence in Barcelona, where more than a dozen people were killed when a van veered onto a sidewalk and sped down a busy pedestrian zone in what authorities called a terror attack.\n\nHe then added to his expression of support a tweet reviving a debunked legend about a U.S. general subduing Muslim rebels a century ago in the Philippines by shooting them with bullets dipped in pig blood.\n\n\"Study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught. There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\" Trump wrote.\n\nTrump's unpredictable, defiant and, critics claim, racially provocative behavior has clearly begun to wear on his Republican allies.\n\nTennessee Sen. Bob Corker, whom Trump considered for a Cabinet post, declared Thursday that \"the president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to\" in dealing with crises. And Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska tweeted, \"Anything less than complete & unambiguous condemnation of white supremacists, neo-Nazis and the KKK by the @POTUS is unacceptable. Period.\"\n\nSen. Tim Scott of South Carolina said Trump's \"moral authority is compromised.\"\n\nTrump, who is known to try to change the focus of news coverage with an attention-grabbing declaration, sought to shift Thursday from the white supremacists to the future of statues.\n\n\"You can't change history, but you can learn from it,\" he tweeted. \"Robert E. Lee. Stonewall Jackson -- who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish. ...\n\n\"Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" he tweeted.\n\nTrump met separately Thursday at his golf club in nearby Bedminster with the administrator of the Small Business Administration and Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a longtime Trump supporter. Trump also prepared for an unusual meeting Friday at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland with his national security team to discuss strategy for South Asia, including India, Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\nVice President Mike Pence was cutting short a long-planned Latin America tour to attend the meeting.\n\nThough out of public view, Trump sought to make his voice heard on Twitter as he found himself increasingly under siege and alone while fanning the controversy over race and politics toward a full-fledged national conflagration.\n\nHe dissolved two business councils Wednesday after the CEO members began quitting, damaging his central campaign promise to be a business-savvy chief executive in the Oval Office.\n\nTwo major charities, the Cleveland Clinic and the American Cancer Society, announced they are canceling fundraisers scheduled for Trump's resort in Palm Beach, Florida, amid the continuing backlash over Trump's remarks.\n\nMeanwhile, rumblings of discontent from his staff grew so loud that the White House had to release a statement saying that Trump's chief economic adviser wasn't quitting. And the president remained on the receiving end of bipartisan criticism for his handling of the aftermath of the Charlottesville clashes.\n\nOn Thursday, he hit back hard -- against Republicans.\n\nHe accused \"publicity-seeking\" Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina of falsely stating Trump's position on the demonstrators. He called Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake \"toxic\" and praised Flake's potential primary election opponent.\n\nGraham said Wednesday that Trump \"took a step backward by again suggesting there is moral equivalency\" between the marching white supremacists and the people who had been demonstrating against them. Flake has been increasingly critical of Trump in recent weeks.\n\nPressured by advisers, the president had softened his words on the dispute Monday, two days after he had enraged many by declining to single out the white supremacists and neo-Nazis whose demonstration against the removal of a Robert E. Lee statute had led to violence and the death of a counter-protester in Charlottesville.\n\nHe returned to his combative stance Tuesday -- insisting anew during an unexpected and contentious news conference at Trump Tower that \"both sides\" were to blame.\n\nAides watching from the sidelines reacted with dismay and disbelief and privately told colleagues they were upset by the president's remarks, though not upset enough for anyone to resign.\n\nThe resignation speculation around Gary Cohn, head of the National Economic Council and a Jew, had grown so intense by Thursday that the White House released a statement saying reports that Cohn was stepping down were \"100 percent false.\"\n\nBut not all of Trump's aides were unhappy with his performance.\n\nAdviser Steve Bannon's job security in the White House has become tenuous -- Trump offered only a \"we'll see\" on Tuesday when asked if his chief strategist would remain in his post -- but Bannon has been telling allies that the president's news conference would electrify the GOP base.\n\nAnd in a pair of interviews Wednesday, Bannon cheered on the president's nationalist tendencies and suggested that a fight over Confederate monuments was a political fight he welcomes.\n\n\"The race-identity politics of the left wants to say it's all racist,\" Bannon told The New York Times. \"Just give me more. Tear down more statues. Say the revolution is coming.

Trump said that removing the statues of Confederate generals meant removing \"beauty\" -- that would \"never able to be comparably replaced\" -- from American cities. As he did in a Tuesday press conference, he also attempted to equate some Confederate generals with some of the Founding Fathers.\n\nStrung together, the tweets read:\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments. You can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish! Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\" [ellipses removed for clarity]\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters declined to discuss the tweets with reporters on Thursday morning, saying, \"The tweets speak for themselves.\"\n\nThe tweets come after days of the president whipsawing back and forth on his response to the violence in Charlottesville, Va., that led to the death of 32-year-old Heather Heyer after a man drove his car into a crowd of counterprotesters.\n\nShortly after that incident, Trump condemned both the white nationalist protesters and the counterprotesters, saying there was an \"egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides.\"\n\nAfter Democrats and Republicans alike castigated him for those remarks, the president came out more forcefully against racist groups, declaring that \"racism is evil\" and characterizing members of the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis as \"criminals and thugs.\"\n\nBut Trump's impromptu remarks at a Tuesday press conference -- originally intended to focus on infrastructure -- represented a strong swing back to his original position, which suggested equivalency between white supremacist group and the alt-right, on the one hand, and the groups who opposed them like Black Lives Matter and leftist antifa protesters, on the other hand.\n\nAround half of Americans -- 52 percent -- believe the president's response to the violence in Charlottesville was \"not strong enough,\" according to an NPR/Marist poll released Wednesday. Only 27 percent said it was strong enough (the remainder were unsure).\n\nThose views shift heavily by party -- a majority of Republicans, 59 percent, say the president's response was strong enough (compared to 10 percent of Democrats). Meanwhile, an overwhelming majority of Democrats -- 79 percent -- believe the response was not strong enough (compared to 19 percent of Republicans).\n\nHowever, nearly two-thirds of Americans do also believe that statues honoring the confederacy should \"remain as a historical symbol,\" according to that NPR/Marist poll. And while there's also a partisan divide here, a sizable share of Democrats, 44 percent, believe those statues should remain (along with 86 percent of Republicans and 61 percent of independents).\n\nDebate over removal of Confederate memorials has spread nationwide in recent years. While defenders say that such memorials simply represent a part of the nation's history, the monuments and statues are for many Americans a reminder of the nation's painful history of slavery and the people who fought to defend it.\n\nIn a widely circulated May speech on his city's removal of four statues commemorating the Confederacy, New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu, a Democrat, explained why he believed that removing the memorials was necessary.\n\n\"These statues are not just stone and metal,\" he said. \"They are not just innocent remembrances of a benign history. These monuments purposefully celebrate a fictional, sanitized Confederacy; ignoring the death, ignoring the enslavement, and the terror that it actually stood for.\"", "id": "9721441", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Trump Defends 'Beauty' Of Confederate Memorials", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201708/544152462.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "200134", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Washington"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "235649", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "label": {"eng": "Washington"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Crime"}, "id": "302901", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime"}, {"label": {"eng": "Racism"}, "id": "302940", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}, "id": "302944", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Violence"}, "id": "302966", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence"}, {"label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}, "id": "303042", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Culture"}, "id": "303325", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"}, {"label": {"eng": "Infrastructure"}, "id": "303871", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure"}, {"label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}, "id": "304050", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "Independent (politician)"}, "id": "305074", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_(politician)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}, "id": "305262", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "id": "305960", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America"}, {"label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "id": "305969", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy"}, {"label": {"eng": "History of the United States"}, "id": "306055", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "Coming out"}, "id": "308019", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out"}, {"label": {"eng": "White House Press Secretary"}, "id": "308023", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Press_Secretary"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nation"}, "id": "308370", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation"}, {"label": {"eng": "NPR"}, "id": "308986", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bigotry"}, "id": "310173", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigotry"}, {"label": {"eng": "History of slavery"}, "id": "311765", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_slavery"}, {"label": {"eng": "Founding Fathers of the United States"}, "id": "318104", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ku Klux Klan"}, "id": "318256", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan"}, {"label": {"eng": "Anti-fascism"}, "id": "339838", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-fascism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Robert E.

Trump began ranting about Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham (South Carolina) and Jeff Flake (Arizona), consistent critics of Trump's behavior. Trump called Graham a publicity seeker and expressed happiness that Flake was facing a primary opponent.\n\nAnd then Trump decided to wade back into the Confederate monument debate, after having been blasted on all sides yesterday. A trio of tweets to get your morning started:\n\nSad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments. You..... -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\n...can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish! Also... -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\n...the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\nTrump knows all about removing art that will be missed and cannot be replaced. When Trump was building his tower in New York City he had destroyed art deco friezes a museum wanted to preserve because it delayed the demolition of a skyscraper that needed to come down.\n\nTrump also has a monument to a civil war battle that never happened at his golf club in Virginia.\n\nAs for the slippery slope contention -- that this will lead to the tearing down of non-Confederate memorials because people are offended -- Eric Boehm and Ronald Bailey have both explained effectively here at Reason how easy it is to draw a line between American historical figures who have owned slaves or have done other bad things versus those who waged war with the United States in order to preserve slavery.\n\nIt is worth noting that Trump is hardly an outlier in not wanting monuments to come down. An NPR poll released this week showed that 62 percent of Americans want these statues to remain \"as a historical symbol.\" A remarkable nugget from the poll: Even more African Americans (44 percent) want them to remain than want them removed (40 percent). Unsurprisingly, more African Americans were unsure what to do with them (16 percent) than white people (8 percent) or Latino people (11 percent) polled.\n\nThere are many ways to interpret these results that have nothing to do with support for the Confederacy. The results may say more about the unease of many Americans with what appears to be censorship (even when it's not actually censorship).\n\nPerhaps it would be easier if these statues were not in the hands of government, and the social cost of the controversy shouldered by private individuals. And as an added bonus, it wouldn't cost taxpayers to deal with it. I joked on Twitter that cities should sell the Confederate statues to people who care so much about preserving them and redistribute the money back to its citizens.\n\nIn Los Angeles, a memorial for Confederate soldiers at Hollywood Forever Cemetery was just removed at the request of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, the group who placed the marker there at the 1920s. Yes, there was some social pressure to remove it, obviously, but private people making the decision about whether to display such a memorial is preferable to government officials deciding the correct way to remember our Confederate history and Civil War.", "id": "9734499", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Trump's Idea of Uniting the Country: Complaining About Removal of Confederate

On Thursday morning he took his apologist rhetoric to Twitter, reiterating his position on monuments celebrating pro-slavery generals. In several tweets, Trump defended the \"beauty\" of Confederate monuments, declaring that American history and culture was \"being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments.\"\n\nThis was an echo of his comments from his provocative Tuesday press conference, when he asked, \"I wonder, is it George Washington next week?\" He also posited that monuments to Thomas Jefferson could soon go. Both owned slaves, but neither rebelled against the country's government that they helped establish as Founding Fathers. His views on Twitter, though, are perhaps even more unprecedented, to use the word of the week.\n\nThis will further alienate Trump from other Republicans who have all but universally condemned white supremacists in the wake of the Charlottesville violence that resulted in three deaths and dozens injured. They've also doubled down on it after Trump tried to place the blame on \"many\" and \"both sides.\" The comments have already stirred debate online, with some 30,000 replies in the first hour of them going up, and other politicians are sure to weigh in.\n\nThe Unite the Right rally was first planned in response to moves to take down a statue of Robert E. Lee from a Charlottesville park. This week Baltimore removed statues of both Lee and Thomas J. \"Stonewall\" Jackson, two generals who fought for the South, as well as one of Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger B. Taney. Taney wrote the 1857 Dred Scott decision, which found African-Americans were not guaranteed equal rights because of bigotry that existed at the time the Constitution was written. It was later overturned.\n\nTrump and other modern Confederate sympathizers have spoken about history when trying to defend the monuments. But the history that they really speak to is the backlash against Reconstruction and the Civil Rights Movement, as a recent article in Vox proves.

You can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish! Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\" Mr Trump posted on Twitter on Thursday.\n\nOfficials in several states have called for the removal of public monuments that have become symbols of the Confederacy.\n\nThe Twitter posts were the latest in his escalating remarks that critics contend validates white supremacist groups who led a bloody rally over the weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nThe proposed removal of a statute of the Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from a public park in Charlottesville spurred the demonstrations.\n\nOn Saturday, the day of the protests, Mr Trump did not condemn neo-Nazis or white supremacists in his public remarks about the violence, prompting criticism that his omission suggested support for the racist groups.\n\nAn Ohio man with white supremacist ties is accused of driving his car into a crowd, killing one woman and injuring 19 other people. Two days later, Mr Trump bowed to pressure and said racism was \"evil\" and named racist organisations in his follow-up remarks about Charlottesville.\n\nBut on Tuesday, Mr Trump reverted to his initial public posture and blamed \"both sides\" for the violence.\n\nOn Thursday morning, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham repeated his criticism of the president's actions in a series of Twitter posts after Mr Trump tweeted that Mr Graham was \"publicity seeking.\"\n\n\"Because of the manner in which you have handled the Charlottesville tragedy you are now receiving praise from some of the most racist and hate-filled individuals and groups in our country. For the sake of our Nation, as our President, please fix this,\" Mr Graham wrote on Twitter.\n\nOther Republicans, including the most powerful in Congress, have been making strong statements on Charlottesville and racism, but few have been mentioning Mr Trump himself. The Senate's top Republican, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, condemned \"hate and bigotry\". House Speaker Paul Ryan said that \"white supremacy is repulsive\". But neither criticised the president's insistence that there were \"very fine people on both sides\" of the violent weekend clash in Virginia. The nuanced statements reflect the party establishment's delicate dance. Few top Republican officeholders want to defend the president in the midst of an escalating political crisis, yet they are unwilling to declare all-out opposition to him and risk alienating his loyalists.\n\nIn another major sign of discontent within the Republican Party, Mr Trump abruptly abolished two of his White House business councils on Wednesday as corporate chiefs began resigning in protest over his racial statements.\n\n\"Rather than putting pressure on the business people of the Manufacturing Council & Strategy & Policy Forum, I am ending both. Thank you all!\" Mr Trump tweeted from New York.\n\nHis action came after one of the panels had already agreed to disband earlier in the day. The White House is trying to deal with the repercussions from Mr Trump's defiant remarks on the Virginia tragedy.\n\nAdvisers hunkered down, offering no public defence while privately expressing frustration with his comments. But Mr Trump himself, staying at his golf club in New Jersey, was increasing rather than slowing his tweet-a-thon.\n\nOn Wednesday, he had told associates he was pleased with how his combative press conference had gone a day earlier, saying he believed he had effectively stood up to the media, according to three people familiar with the conversations.", "id": "9764206", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Trump 'sad' to see history 'ripped apart' with removal of 'beautiful statues'", "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3189621.1502983025!/image/image.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "200134", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 1, "id": "218051", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York", "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "219910", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "242096", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Business"}, "id": "302720", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business"}, {"label": {"eng": "Racism"}, "id": "302940", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}, "id": "302944", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Politics"}, "id": "302948", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics"}, {"label": {"eng": "White House"}, "id": "303051", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House"}, {"label": {"eng": "Culture"}, "id": "303325", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"}, {"label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}, "id": "304059", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "Paul Ryan"}, "id": "304743", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Ryan"}, {"label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}, "id": "304752", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives"}, {"label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}, "id": "305157", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate"}, {"label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "id": "305165", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"}, {"label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}, "id": "305262", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "id": "305960", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America"}, {"label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "id": "305969", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mitch McConnell"}, "id": "307368", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_McConnell"}, {"label": {"eng": "Demonstration (protest)"}, "id": "312931", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonstration_(protest)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Lindsey Graham"}, "id": "324838", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindsey_Graham"}, {"label": {"eng": "Robert E.

(AP) -- With prominent Republicans openly questioning his competence and moral leadership, President Donald Trump on Thursday burrowed deeper into the racially charged debate over Confederate memorials and lashed out at members of his own party in the latest controversy to engulf his presidency.\n\nOut of sight, but still online, Trump tweeted his defense of monuments to Confederate icons -- bemoaning rising efforts to remove them as an attack on America's \"history and culture.\"\n\nAnd he berated his critics who, with increasingly sharper language, have denounced his initially slow and then ultimately combative comments on the racial violence at a white supremacist rally last weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nTrump was much quicker Thursday to condemn violence in Barcelona, where more than a dozen people were killed when a van veered onto a sidewalk and sped down a busy pedestrian zone in what authorities called a terror attack.\n\nHe then added to his expression of support a tweet reviving a debunked legend about a U.S. general subduing Muslim rebels a century ago in the Philippines by shooting them with bullets dipped in pig blood.\n\n\"Study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught. There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\" Trump wrote.\n\nTrump's unpredictable, defiant and, critics claim, racially provocative behavior has clearly begun to wear on his Republican allies.\n\nTennessee Sen. Bob Corker, whom Trump considered for a Cabinet post, declared Thursday that \"the president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to\" in dealing with crises. And Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska tweeted, \"Anything less than complete & unambiguous condemnation of white supremacists, neo-Nazis and the KKK by the @POTUS is unacceptable. Period.\"\n\nSen. Tim Scott of South Carolina said Trump's \"moral authority is compromised.\"\n\nTrump, who is known to try to change the focus of news coverage with an attention-grabbing declaration, sought to shift Thursday from the white supremacists to the future of statues.\n\n\"You can't change history, but you can learn from it,\" he tweeted. \"Robert E. Lee. Stonewall Jackson -- who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish. ...\n\n\"Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" he tweeted.\n\nTrump met separately Thursday at his golf club in nearby Bedminster with the administrator of the Small Business Administration and Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a longtime Trump supporter. Trump also prepared for an unusual meeting Friday at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland with his national security team to discuss strategy for South Asia, including India, Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\nVice President Mike Pence was cutting short a long-planned Latin America tour to attend the meeting.\n\nThough out of public view, Trump sought to make his voice heard on Twitter as he found himself increasingly under siege and alone while fanning the controversy over race and politics toward a full-fledged national conflagration.\n\nHe dissolved two business councils Wednesday after the CEO members began quitting, damaging his central campaign promise to be a business-savvy chief executive in the Oval Office.\n\nAnd the White House said Thursday that it was abandoning plans to form an infrastructure advisory council.\n\nTwo major charities, the Cleveland Clinic and the American Cancer Society, announced they are canceling fundraisers scheduled for Trump's resort in Palm Beach, Florida, amid the continuing backlash over Trump's remarks.\n\nMeanwhile, rumblings of discontent from his staff grew so loud that the White House had to release a statement saying that Trump's chief economic adviser wasn't quitting. And the president remained on the receiving end of bipartisan criticism for his handling of the aftermath of the Charlottesville clashes.\n\nOn Thursday, he hit back hard -- against Republicans.\n\nHe accused \"publicity-seeking\" Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina of falsely stating Trump's position on the demonstrators. He called Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake \"toxic\" and praised Flake's potential primary election opponent.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nSign up now and get breaking news alerts delivered to your inbox.\n\nGraham said Wednesday that Trump \"took a step backward by again suggesting there is moral equivalency\" between the marching white supremacists and the people who had been demonstrating against them. Flake has been increasingly critical of Trump in recent weeks.\n\nPressured by advisers, the president had softened his words on the dispute Monday, two days after he had enraged many by declining to single out the white supremacists and neo-Nazis whose demonstration against the removal of a Robert E. Lee statute had led to violence and the death of a counter-protester in Charlottesville.\n\nHe returned to his combative stance Tuesday -- insisting anew during an unexpected and contentious news conference at Trump Tower that \"both sides\" were to blame.\n\nAides watching from the sidelines reacted with dismay and disbelief and privately told colleagues they were upset by the president's remarks, though not upset enough for anyone to resign.\n\nThe resignation speculation around Gary Cohn, head of the National Economic Council and a Jew, had grown so intense by Thursday that the White House released a statement saying reports that Cohn was stepping down were \"100 percent false.\"\n\nBut not all of Trump's aides were unhappy with his performance.\n\nAdviser Steve Bannon's job security in the White House has become tenuous -- Trump offered only a \"we'll see\" on Tuesday when asked if his chief strategist would remain in his post -- but Bannon has been telling allies that the president's news conference would electrify the GOP base.\n\nAnd in a pair of interviews Wednesday, Bannon cheered on the president's nationalist tendencies and suggested that a fight over Confederate monuments was a political fight he welcomes.\n\n\"The race-identity politics of the left wants to say it's all racist,\" Bannon told The New York Times. \"Just give me more. Tear down more statues. Say the revolution is coming. I can't get enough of it.\"\n\n-- -- --\n\nLemire reported from New York.

You.....\n\n-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 17, 2017\n\n...can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish! Also...\n\n-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 17, 2017\n\n...the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\n\n-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 17, 2017\n\n\"The tweets speak for themselves,\" a White House spokeswoman said to reporters on Thursday.\n\nTrump's words come at a time when leaders across the country are removing Confederate monuments from public spaces, recognizing their historical ties to racism, and when even the president's fellow Republicans are unable to defend him.\n\nMany people do believe that Confederate monuments should remain in tact \"as a historical symbol.\" A new Marist poll found that 67 percent of Americans feel this way. And a YouGov poll found that 67 percent of Americans believe Confederate monuments represent \"Southern pride,\" while only 26 percent link them with racism.\n\nHowever, this changes when broken down by race, suggesting that Trump is taking only one group of Americans into consideration when talking about the history of the \"beautiful\" statues.\n\nAccording to the Marist poll, Black Americans are almost evenly divided on whether the monuments should stay or be removed. Forty-four percent believe they should not be removed, while 40 percent said they should be. The YouGov poll, meanwhile, found that 47 percent of Blacks perceive the monuments as symbols of racism and 17 percent connect them to Southern pride. Thirty-five percent were not sure.\n\nCities in California, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, New York, North Carolina, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, Tennessee, Virginia, and Texas, as well as Washington, D.C., have all either removed statues and monuments pertaining to the Confederacy or are considering doing so.\n\nThis week Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh had four Confederate monuments removed: a Confederate Soldiers and Sailors monument, a Confederate Women's monument, a statue of Lee and Jackson and a statue of Supreme Court Justice Roger Taney. Taney authored the decision in the Dred Scott v. Stanford case, in which Dred Scott, who was enslaved, sued for his freedom. In the 7-2 ruling led by Taney, the court rejected his request.\n\nThe removals were done in the middle of the night, drawing less public attention and trying to prevent any clashes with protesters.\n\nMaryland's Republican Gov. Larry Hogan this week expressed his support for removing the Taney statue. Notably, he had a very different opinion in 2015 -- one more similar to Trump's. At the time he pointed to the history tied to Confederate monuments.\n\n\"Where do we draw the line?\" he said at the time. \"Some of this is our history. We hear people saying we should dig up the Confederate cemeteries in Maryland.\"\n\n\"George Washington was a slave owner,\" Hogan also said. \"Should we remove him from the statehouse?\"\n\nWhile Maryland was a slave state during the Civil War era, it was considered a Border state. Most of its soldiers fought for the North, though.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump's fellow Republicans have been distancing themselves from him amid his numerous offensive and racist statements over the days following Charlottesville.\n\nSen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) called into question Trump's competence to fulfill his duties as POTUS.\n\n\"The president has not yet been able to demonstrate the ability or the competence that he needs to be successful,\" Corker said.\n\n\"He has not demonstrated that he understands what has made this nation great and what it is today, and he's got to demonstrate the characteristics of a president who understands that,\" he also said. \"And without the things that I just mentioned happening, our nation is going to go through great peril.\"\n\nSen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only Black Republican senator, said in an interview with VICE on Thursday that Trump's comments this week compromise the \"clarity and moral authority\" people need to see from a president.\n\nTrump took to Twitter to attack Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), saying that the senator was speaking out against the president only for \"publicity.\"\n\nGraham responded in a series of tweets.\n\nMr. President, like most I seek to move our nation, my state, and our party forward - toward the light - not back to the darkness. (1) https://t.co/K1j4JnhCgf\n\n-- Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) August 17, 2017\n\nHowever, because of the manner in which you have handled the Charlottesville tragedy you are now receiving praise from some.....(3)\n\n-- Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) August 17, 2017\n\n....you are now receiving praise from some of the most racist and hate-filled individuals and groups in our country. (4)\n\n-- Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) August 17, 2017\n\nThe debate of what Confederacy symbolizes in today's society was largely reawakened after white supremacist Dylann Roof murdered nine Black parishioners at a historically Black church in South Carolina. Photos of Roof later surfaced with Confederate memorabilia.\n\nIn May New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu delivered a powerful speech after the last of four Confederate monuments were taken down in his city. He believes New Orleans, which he describes as \"truly a city of many nations, a melting pot\" and is also \"rooted in a diverse people who have been here together every step of the way,\" is better for it.\n\n\"These monuments purposefully celebrate a fictional, sanitized Confederacy, ignoring the death, ignoring the enslavement and the terror that it actually stood for,\" Landrieu said in a powerful speech on Friday.\n\nTo those who tie the Confederacy to history, Landrieu points to a much darker part of history that is often left out of the conversation:\n\n\"And it immediately begs the questions, why there are no slave ship monuments, no prominent markers on public land to remember the lynchings or the slave blocks; nothing to remember this long chapter of our lives; the pain, the sacrifice, the shame... all of it happening on the soil of New Orleans. So for those self-appointed defenders of history and the monuments, they are eerily silent on what amounts to this historical malfeasance, a lie by omission. There is a difference between remembrance of history and reverence of it.\"\n\nThe statues were not erected in honor of history -- they were erected \"to rewrite history to hide the truth, which is that the Confederacy was on the wrong side of humanity,\" Landrieu said.", "id": "9898148", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Confederate Monuments' Removal Was 'Foolish,' Says Trump |

(AP) -- With prominent Republicans openly questioning his competence and moral leadership, President Donald Trump on Thursday burrowed deeper into the racially charged debate over Confederate memorials and lashed out at members of his own party in the latest controversy to engulf his presidency.\n\nOut of sight, but still online, Trump tweeted his defense of monuments to Confederate icons -- bemoaning rising efforts to remove them as an attack on America's \"history and culture.\"\n\nAnd he berated his critics who, with increasingly sharper language, have denounced his initially slow and then ultimately combative comments on the racial violence at a white supremacist rally last weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nTrump was much quicker Thursday to condemn violence in Barcelona, where more than a dozen people were killed when a van veered onto a sidewalk and sped down a busy pedestrian zone in what authorities called a terror attack.\n\nHe then added to his expression of support a tweet reviving a debunked legend about a U.S. general subduing Muslim rebels a century ago in the Philippines by shooting them with bullets dipped in pig blood.\n\n\"Study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught. There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\" Trump wrote.\n\nTrump's unpredictable, defiant and, critics claim, racially provocative behavior has clearly begun to wear on his Republican allies.\n\nTennessee Sen. Bob Corker, whom Trump considered for a Cabinet post, declared Thursday that \"the president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to\" in dealing with crises. And Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska tweeted, \"Anything less than complete & unambiguous condemnation of white supremacists, neo-Nazis and the KKK by the @POTUS is unacceptable. Period.\"\n\nSen. Tim Scott of South Carolina said Trump's \"moral authority is compromised.\"\n\nTrump, who is known to try to change the focus of news coverage with an attention-grabbing declaration, sought to shift Thursday from the white supremacists to the future of statues.\n\n\"You can't change history, but you can learn from it,\" he tweeted. \"Robert E. Lee. Stonewall Jackson -- who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish. ...\n\n\"Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" he tweeted.\n\nTrump met separately Thursday at his golf club in nearby Bedminster with the administrator of the Small Business Administration and Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a longtime Trump supporter. Trump also prepared for an unusual meeting Friday at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland with his national security team to discuss strategy for South Asia, including India, Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\nVice President Mike Pence was cutting short a long-planned Latin America tour to attend the meeting.\n\nThough out of public view, Trump sought to make his voice heard on Twitter as he found himself increasingly under siege and alone while fanning the controversy over race and politics toward a full-fledged national conflagration.\n\nHe dissolved two business councils Wednesday after the CEO members began quitting, damaging his central campaign promise to be a business-savvy chief executive in the Oval Office.\n\nAnd the White House said Thursday that it was abandoning plans to form an infrastructure advisory council.\n\nTwo major charities, the Cleveland Clinic and the American Cancer Society, announced they are canceling fundraisers scheduled for Trump's resort in Palm Beach, Florida, amid the continuing backlash over Trump's remarks.\n\nMeanwhile, rumblings of discontent from his staff grew so loud that the White House had to release a statement saying that Trump's chief economic adviser wasn't quitting. And the president remained on the receiving end of bipartisan criticism for his handling of the aftermath of the Charlottesville clashes.\n\nOn Thursday, he hit back hard -- against Republicans.\n\nHe accused \"publicity-seeking\" Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina of falsely stating Trump's position on the demonstrators. He called Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake \"toxic\" and praised Flake's potential primary election opponent.\n\nGraham said Wednesday that Trump \"took a step backward by again suggesting there is moral equivalency\" between the marching white supremacists and the people who had been demonstrating against them. Flake has been increasingly critical of Trump in recent weeks.\n\nPressured by advisers, the president had softened his words on the dispute Monday, two days after he had enraged many by declining to single out the white supremacists and neo-Nazis whose demonstration against the removal of a Robert E. Lee statute had led to violence and the death of a counter-protester in Charlottesville.\n\nHe returned to his combative stance Tuesday -- insisting anew during an unexpected and contentious news conference at Trump Tower that \"both sides\" were to blame.\n\nAides watching from the sidelines reacted with dismay and disbelief and privately told colleagues they were upset by the president's remarks, though not upset enough for anyone to resign.\n\nThe resignation speculation around Gary Cohn, head of the National Economic Council and a Jew, had grown so intense by Thursday that the White House released a statement saying reports that Cohn was stepping down were \"100 percent false.\"\n\nBut not all of Trump's aides were unhappy with his performance.\n\nAdviser Steve Bannon's job security in the White House has become tenuous -- Trump offered only a \"we'll see\" on Tuesday when asked if his chief strategist would remain in his post -- but Bannon has been telling allies that the president's news conference would electrify the GOP base.\n\nAnd in a pair of interviews Wednesday, Bannon cheered on the president's nationalist tendencies and suggested that a fight over Confederate monuments was a political fight he welcomes.\n\n\"The race-identity politics of the left wants to say it's all racist,\" Bannon told The New York Times. \"Just give me more. Tear down more statues. Say the revolution is coming. I can't get enough of it.\"\n\n___\n\nLemire reported from New York.

There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\" Trump wrote.\n\nTrump's unpredictable, defiant and, critics claim, racially provocative behavior has clearly begun to wear on his Republican allies.\n\nTennessee Sen. Bob Corker, whom Trump considered for a Cabinet post, declared Thursday that \"the president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to\" in dealing with crises. And Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska tweeted, \"Anything less than complete & unambiguous condemnation of white supremacists, neo-Nazis and the KKK by the @POTUS is unacceptable. Period.\"\n\nSen. Tim Scott of South Carolina said Trump's \"moral authority is compromised.\"\n\nTrump, who is known to try to change the focus of news coverage with an attention-grabbing declaration, sought to shift Thursday from the white supremacists to the future of statues.\n\n\"You can't change history, but you can learn from it,\" he tweeted. \"Robert E. Lee. Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish. ...\n\n\"Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" he tweeted.\n\nTrump met separately Thursday at his golf club in nearby Bedminster with the administrator of the Small Business Administration and Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a longtime Trump supporter. Trump also prepared for an unusual meeting Friday at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland with his national security team to discuss strategy for South Asia, including India, Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\nVice President Mike Pence was cutting short a long-planned Latin America tour to attend the meeting.\n\nThough out of public view, Trump sought to make his voice heard on Twitter as he found himself increasingly under siege and alone while fanning the controversy over race and politics toward a full-fledged national conflagration.\n\nHe dissolved two business councils Wednesday after the CEO members began quitting, damaging his central campaign promise to be a business-savvy chief executive in the Oval Office.\n\nAnd the White House said Thursday that it was abandoning plans to form an infrastructure advisory council.\n\nTwo major charities, the Cleveland Clinic and the American Cancer Society, announced they are canceling fundraisers scheduled for Trump's resort in Palm Beach, Florida, amid the continuing backlash over Trump's remarks.\n\nMeanwhile, rumblings of discontent from his staff grew so loud that the White House had to release a statement saying that Trump's chief economic adviser wasn't quitting. And the president remained on the receiving end of bipartisan criticism for his handling of the aftermath of the Charlottesville clashes.\n\nOn Thursday, he hit back hard - against Republicans.\n\nHe accused \"publicity-seeking\" Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina of falsely stating Trump's position on the demonstrators. He called Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake \"toxic\" and praised Flake's potential primary election opponent.\n\nGraham said Wednesday that Trump \"took a step backward by again suggesting there is moral equivalency\" between the marching white supremacists and the people who had been demonstrating against them. Flake has been increasingly critical of Trump in recent weeks.\n\nPressured by advisers, the president had softened his words on the dispute Monday, two days after he had enraged many by declining to single out the white supremacists and neo-Nazis whose demonstration against the removal of a Robert E. Lee statute had led to violence and the death of a counter-protester in Charlottesville.\n\nHe returned to his combative stance Tuesday - insisting anew during an unexpected and contentious news conference at Trump Tower that \"both sides\" were to blame.\n\nAides watching from the sidelines reacted with dismay and disbelief and privately told colleagues they were upset by the president's remarks, though not upset enough for anyone to resign.\n\nThe resignation speculation around Gary Cohn, head of the National Economic Council and a Jew, had grown so intense by Thursday that the White House released a statement saying reports that Cohn was stepping down were \"100 percent false.\"\n\nBut not all of Trump's aides were unhappy with his performance.\n\nAdviser Steve Bannon's job security in the White House has become tenuous - Trump offered only a \"we'll see\" on Tuesday when asked if his chief strategist would remain in his post - but Bannon has been telling allies that the president's news conference would electrify the GOP base.\n\nAnd in a pair of interviews Wednesday, Bannon cheered on the president's nationalist tendencies and suggested that a fight over Confederate monuments was a political fight he welcomes.\n\n\"The race-identity politics of the left wants to say it's all racist,\" Bannon told The New York Times. \"Just give me more. Tear down more statues. Say the revolution is coming. I can't get enough of it.\"\n\n___\n\nLemire reported from New York.

Lee was vandalized on early Aug. 17, 2017 in Durham, North Carolina. This is the latest instance of Confederate statues and monuments being removed, vandalized, or destroyed. (Sara D. Davis/Getty Images)\n\nGroups of far-left protesters are tearing down and vandalizing historical statues and monuments they deem antithetical to their views. They began by targeting Confederate statues and monuments, and have now expanded their efforts to include those of other historical figures, with some analysts saying their real goal is to tear down the legitimacy of the American founding.\n\nIn Durham, North Carolina, a mob tore down a statue of a Confederate soldier on Aug. 14, and on Aug. 17 an unknown individual vandalized a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee.\n\nIn Atlanta, Georgia, another mob of protesters vandalized the Peace Monument which depicts an angel directing a Confederate soldier to lay down his weapon.\n\nIn other parts of the country, including in Florida and Baltimore, local government officials are having Confederate statues removed. And in San Antonia, Texas, local officials are looking to remove a statue of a famous leader at the Alamo, which some have allegedly mistaken for a Confederate statue.\n\nThe efforts of the far left are moving beyond Confederate statues to include those of other historical figures as well.\n\nAn unknown assailant vandalized the Lincoln Memorial on Aug. 15, in Washington, using red spray paint to leave the phrase \"F*** Law.\" In Chicago, a bust of Abraham Lincoln erected in 1926 was found defaced and burned. Lincoln was the head of the Republican Party and the leader of the Union, which fought against the Confederates.\n\nAngela Rye, a commentator for CNN, political analyst for NPR, and head of her own political advocacy firm in Washington, D.C., has called for tearing down the statues of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, because these founding fathers were slave owners.\n\nOn CNN on Aug. 17 during a heated discussion she said, \"I don't care if it's a George Washington statue or a Thomas Jefferson statue, they all need to come down.\"\n\nIn his press conference on Aug. 15, Trump had warned that the statues of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson would be next as the demand for removing Confederate statues expanded.\n\nPresident Donald Trump tweeted on the morning of Aug. 17: \"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments. You can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish!\"\n\n\"Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\" Trump tweeted.\n\nA poll released by NPR, PBS, NewsHour, and Marist on Aug. 16 found that 62 percent of Americans believe that \"statues honoring leaders of the Confederacy,\" should \"remain as a historical symbol.\" It found that only 27 percent of respondents believed the statues should be removed.\n\nThe efforts to tear down the statues received additional fuel after violent protests in Charlottesville, Virginia, where a group that included white supremacists protested plans to tear down the statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee.\n\nThe protests turned violent after a group of anarchist-communist protesters with Antifa arrived with weapons and launched attacks, and a female protester was killed after a man crashed into two cars at an intersection filled with pedestrians -- an incident that is still being investigated.\n\nJohn Daniel Davidson, a senior correspondent at The Federalist, gave his analysis on the recent events during an Aug. 15 segment on Fox News with Tucker Carlson.\n\n\"This has been coming down the pipe for a number of years,\" Davidson said, noting that in April 2015, around the 150th anniversary of the Confederate surrender at Appomattox, some far-left news outlets in the mainstream media were even calling for the desecration of Confederate graves.\n\nHe compared the recent developments to the Cultural Revolution under the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), from 1966 to 1976, where people were directed to destroy their historical relics and traditional culture. It was led by Mao Zedong, history's most prolific mass murderer, credited with killing 60 to 70 million Chinese people.\n\n\"If you want to see where tearing down statues by mobs will get you, look at pictures of China's Cultural Revolution, where they tore down statues, temples, the whole thing -- even stomping on them,\" Davidson said.\n\nHe added, however, that it appears the protesters aren't necessarily just against the ideas of the Confederates. Rather, he said, \"They're trying to delegitimize the U.S. government and the traditions of American society because they don't believe in them.\"\n\n\"This is not about the Confederacy,\" he said. \"This is not about the Civil War. This is about political power.\"", "id": "9790531", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Movement to Remove Confederate Statues Expanding", "image":

Thousands of protesters crowded the streets around Trump Tower before U.S. President Donald Trump's first visit to the building since taking office on Monday. (Xinhua/Li Muzi)\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday took to Twitter to decry the removal of confederate statues across the United States, saying the move was \"foolish\".\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" Trump said in the first of three consecutive tweets.\n\n\"You can't change history, but you can learn from it.

Charlie Baker said today, adding that he's been \"very disturbed and dismayed\" by Trump's reaction to the fallout of last week's violence in Charlottesville, Va.\n\n\"Many of (the memorials) glorify and honor a very dark period in our history when we were engaged in a war over slavery,\" Baker told the Herald after an event in Framingham this morning. \"And if folks in states and communities want to take down memorials and monuments that honor and glorify the preservation of slavery -- which is really what the Civil War was all about -- then they should feel free to do so.\n\n\"I think on this one the president is mistaken,\" the state's Republican governor said.\n\nBaker earlier in the day joined Senate President Stanley Rosenberg, Speaker of the House Robert DeLeo and other lawmakers to sign a resolution condemning white nationalism and Neo-Nazis. Officials planned to send a copy of the resolution to Trump and officials in Virginia.\n\nBaker's comments come amid continuing criticism of Trump in the wake of the deadly white supremacist rally last weekend in Virginia. Some local officials across the South have moved quickly to call for the removal of memorials of Confederate leaders in their communities, including in Baltimore, where the city took down several during the middle of the night.\n\nIn a series of morning tweets today, Trump lamented the removal of what he called \"beautiful\" statues of Confederate leaders.\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" Trump wrote, adding in another tweet: \"You can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next (George) Washington, (Thomas) Jefferson. Foolish!\"\n\nTrump went on to say that the \"beauty\" of the statues being removed from \"cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\nTrump posted the tweets amid waves of bipartisan backlash he's received since a combative Tuesday news conference, where he blamed the violence at the Virginia rally on \"both sides\" -- white nationalists and counter-protesters -- and described those who marched last Friday with white supremacists as \"very fine people.\"\n\nU.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, implored Trump to \"fix this\" in a statement addressed directly to Trump this morning.\n\nBaker on Monday criticized Trump's initial reaction to the Virginia. On Tuesday -- following Trump's press conference -- he released a carefully worded statement saying he was \"deeply disappointed\" in the president's response.\n\nToday, he made sure to note his support of a state or city's authority to choose what to do with memorials, calling himself a \"big believer\" of local-decision-making.\n\nBaker came under fire in 2015 when he said that states should be entitled to make a decision on whether to fly a Confederate flag, a comment he quickly apologized for later that day and amended, saying he believes the flag should not be flown. At the time, a debate raged in South Carolina over whether to remove the flag from the state capitol there in the wake of a racially motivated mass shooting that left nine dead at a historic black church.\n\nBaker said today, \"If people want to take something down, for a variety of reasons, they should be able to take it down.\n\n\"I've said several times that I'm shocked and sickened by some of the comments that were made and some of the terms and the phrases that were used in Charlottesville, and very disturbed and dismayed by the President's comments in response to that,\" he later added of Trump.\n\n\"There's no place in American society for neo-Nazism or for the KKK or for white supremacy. I think on all these issues we as Americans need to stand up and make very clear that, you know, with liberty and justice for all means for all.\"", "id": "9777398", "details": {}, "date":

There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\" Trump wrote.\n\nTrump's unpredictable, defiant and, critics claim, racially provocative behavior has clearly begun to wear on his Republican allies.\n\nTennessee Sen. Bob Corker, whom Trump considered for a Cabinet post, declared Thursday that \"the president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to\" in dealing with crises. And Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska tweeted, \"Anything less than complete & unambiguous condemnation of white supremacists, neo-Nazis and the KKK by the @POTUS is unacceptable. Period.\"\n\nSen. Tim Scott of South Carolina said Trump's \"moral authority is compromised.\"\n\nTrump, who is known to try to change the focus of news coverage with an attention-grabbing declaration, sought to shift Thursday from the white supremacists to the future of statues.\n\n\"You can't change history, but you can learn from it,\" he tweeted. \"Robert E. Lee. Stonewall Jackson -- who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish. ...\n\n\"Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" he tweeted.\n\nTrump met separately Thursday at his golf club in nearby Bedminster with the administrator of the Small Business Administration and Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a longtime Trump supporter. Trump also prepared for an unusual meeting Friday at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland with his national security team to discuss strategy for South Asia, including India, Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\nVice President Mike Pence was cutting short a long-planned Latin America tour to attend the meeting.\n\nThough out of public view, Trump sought to make his voice heard on Twitter as he found himself increasingly under siege and alone while fanning the controversy over race and politics toward a full-fledged national conflagration.\n\nHe dissolved two business councils Wednesday after the CEO members began quitting, damaging his central campaign promise to be a business-savvy chief executive in the Oval Office.\n\nAnd the White House said Thursday that it was abandoning plans to form an infrastructure advisory council.\n\nTwo major charities, the Cleveland Clinic and the American Cancer Society, announced they are canceling fundraisers scheduled for Trump's resort in Palm Beach, Florida, amid the continuing backlash over Trump's remarks.\n\nMeanwhile, rumblings of discontent from his staff grew so loud that the White House had to release a statement saying that Trump's chief economic adviser wasn't quitting. And the president remained on the receiving end of bipartisan criticism for his handling of the aftermath of the Charlottesville clashes.\n\nOn Thursday, he hit back hard -- against Republicans.\n\nHe accused \"publicity-seeking\" Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina of falsely stating Trump's position on the demonstrators. He called Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake \"toxic\" and praised Flake's potential primary election opponent.\n\nGraham said Wednesday that Trump \"took a step backward by again suggesting there is moral equivalency\" between the marching white supremacists and the people who had been demonstrating against them. Flake has been increasingly critical of Trump in recent weeks.\n\nPressured by advisers, the president had softened his words on the dispute Monday, two days after he had enraged many by declining to single out the white supremacists and neo-Nazis whose demonstration against the removal of a Robert E. Lee statute had led to violence and the death of a counter-protester in Charlottesville.\n\nHe returned to his combative stance Tuesday -- insisting anew during an unexpected and contentious news conference at Trump Tower that \"both sides\" were to blame.\n\nAides watching from the sidelines reacted with dismay and disbelief and privately told colleagues they were upset by the president's remarks, though not upset enough for anyone to resign.\n\nThe resignation speculation around Gary Cohn, head of the National Economic Council and a Jew, had grown so intense by Thursday that the White House released a statement saying reports that Cohn was stepping down were \"100 percent false.\"\n\nBut not all of Trump's aides were unhappy with his performance.\n\nAdviser Steve Bannon's job security in the White House has become tenuous -- Trump offered only a \"we'll see\" on Tuesday when asked if his chief strategist would remain in his post -- but Bannon has been telling allies that the president's news conference would electrify the GOP base.\n\nAnd in a pair of interviews Wednesday, Bannon cheered on the president's nationalist tendencies and suggested that a fight over Confederate monuments was a political fight he welcomes.\n\n\"The race-identity politics of the left wants to say it's all racist,\" Bannon told The New York Times. \"Just give me more. Tear down more statues. Say the revolution is coming.

Trump also prepared for an unusual meeting Friday at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland with his national security team to discuss strategy for South Asia, including India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan.\n\nVice President Mike Pence was cutting short a long-planned Latin America tour to attend the meeting.\n\nThough out of public view, Trump sought to make his voice heard on Twitter as he found himself increasingly under siege and alone while fanning the controversy over race and politics toward a full-fledged national conflagration.\n\nHe dissolved two business councils Wednesday after the CEO members began quitting and on Thursday abandoned plans to form an infrastructure advisory council.\n\nMeanwhile, rumblings of discontent from his staff grew so loud that the White House had to release a statement saying that Trump's chief economic adviser wasn't quitting. And the president remained on the receiving end of bipartisan criticism for his handling of the aftermath of the Charlottesville clashes.\n\nOn Thursday, he hit back hard -- against Republicans.\n\nHe accused ''publicity-seeking'' Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina of falsely stating Trump's position on the demonstrators and called Arizona Senator Jeff Flake ''toxic'' and praised Flake's potential primary election opponent.\n\nGraham said Wednesday that Trump ''took a step backward by again suggesting there is moral equivalency'' between the marching white supremacists and the people who had been demonstrating against them. Flake has been increasingly critical of Trump in recent weeks.\n\nPressured by advisers, the president had softened his words on the dispute Monday, two days after he had enraged many by declining to single out the white supremacists and neo-Nazis whose demonstration against the removal of a Robert E. Lee statute had led to violence and the death of a counterprotester in Charlottesville.\n\nHe returned to his combative stance on Tuesday -- insisting anew during an unexpected and contentious news conference at Trump Tower that ''both sides'' were to blame.\n\nAides watching from the sidelines reacted with dismay and disbelief and privately told colleagues they were upset by the president's remarks, though not upset enough for anyone to resign.\n\nThe resignation speculation around Gary Cohn, head of the National Economic Council and a Jew, had grown so intense by Thursday that the White House released a statement saying reports that Cohn was stepping down were ''100 percent false.''\n\nBut not all of Trump's aides were unhappy with his performance. Adviser Steve Bannon's job security in the White House has become tenuous -- Trump offered only a ''we'll see'' on Tuesday when asked if his chief strategist would remain in his post -- but Bannon has been telling allies that the president's news conference would electrify the GOP base.\n\nAnd in a pair of interviews Wednesday, Bannon cheered on the president's nationalist tendencies and suggested that a fight over Confederate monuments was a political fight he welcomes.\n\n''The race-identity politics of the left wants to say it's all racist,'' Bannon told The New York Times. ''Just give me more. Tear down more statues. Say the revolution is coming. I can't get enough of it.''", "id": "9803405", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Under fire  --  from GOP  --  Trump digs in on Confederate icons - The Boston Globe", "image":

Lee, Jefferson Davis, and PGT Beauregard in New Orleans, but President Donald Trump has finally come around to seeing eye-to-eye with Louisiana Lieutenant Gov. Billy Nungesser on the beauty and importance of Confederate monuments.\n\nNungesser, you may recall, sent a letter to the president in April, asking Trump to intervene to stop Mayor Mitch Landrieu and the New Orleans City Council from evicting Lee, Davis, and Beauregard from their public pedestals. Lee and Beauregard were Confederate generals in the Civil War. Davis was the president of the Confederacy.\n\nThe lieutenant governor said he was concerned that bills aimed at stopping the purge would die a quick death in the Louisiana Legislature, which turned out to be true. Nungesser said he was responding to a public outcry to preserve the monuments.\n\n\"People are outraged,\" Nungesser said. \"We're getting calls from all over the country.\"\n\nConvinced that the pro-monument legislation would fail and unable to find legal grounds for his office to step in, Nungesser decided to go all the way to the commander and chief with his appeal.\n\n\"I wrote him a letter and I asked him to look out your window, look at the statue of Jackson there at the White House because Andrew Jackson in Jackson Square is next in New Orleans if we don't do something,\" Nungesser said.\n\nIt's not clear whether Trump got the chance to follow Nungesser's suggestion, but the president failed to respond in time to save the New Orleans sculptures, which were removed in May.\n\nBut Trump tweeted out Thursday (Aug. 17) his sadness over the loss of \"beautiful statues and monuments\" being taken down in the wake of the violent clashes as white supremacists protested the planned removal of a Lee statue in Charlottesville, Va.\n\nSad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments. You..... -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\n...can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish! Also... -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\n...the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\nThe president also has echoed Nungesser's fear that the removal of these Confederate statues put us on a slippery slope that will eventually lead to the Founding Fathers and others.\n\n\"George Washington was a slave owner. Was George Washington a slave owner? So will George Washington now lose his status?\" Trump said. \"Are we going to take down statues to George Washington? How about Thomas Jefferson? ... Are we going to take down the statue? Because he was a major slave owner. Now are we going to take down his statue?\n\n\"You're changing history. You're changing culture.\"\n\nTrump's tweets seemed to reinforce that he will not be backing down from claims he made Tuesday that some of the demonstrators had legitimate grievances over the loss of Southern \"history,\" and that \"both sides\" were to blame for the violence that left a woman dead and at least 19 more injured.\n\nThe president made a 180-degree turn from comments a day earlier in which he condemned the neo-Nazi and Klux Klan groups that organized the Unite the Right rally.\n\nMembers of Take 'Em Down NOLA, chief advocates for removing New Orleans monuments linked to the Confederacy, are in fact already lobbying City Hall to expand the statue removals.\n\n\"We call on the City Council to finish the work it began in December 2015, by removing all remaining monuments honoring white supremacy,\" Take Em Down organizer Malcolm Suber said in a statement issued Thursday.\n\nIt's not clear what Trump or Nungesser will be able to do about any of those efforts, which will need to be approved by the City Council.

Graham and Flake on Twitter.\n\nA defiant President Donald Trump on Thursday further inflamed racial tensions and the GOP divide, tweeting out his support for \"beautiful\" Confederate statues and attacking Republican senators who have panned his response to the violent Charlottesville white supremacist protests.\n\nRepublican lawmakers, CEOs and military leaders have raced to distance themselves from the president after he doubled down on his claim that \"both sides\" were to blame for the violent clashes that left one dead and injured more than a dozen others.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut the president is showing no signs of backing down.\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" Trump wrote Thursday morning. \"You can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish!\"\n\n\"Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\" added Trump, who appeared to be sympathizing with some of the white supremacists and neo-Nazis who rallied to protest the removal of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee's statue.\n\nTrump also went on the attack against Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who had accused Trump of taking \"a step backward by again suggesting there is moral equivalency between the white supremacist neo-Nazis and KKK members who attended the Charlottesville rally.\"\n\nThe president responded with anger, tweeting on Thursday morning that the \"publicity seeking\" lawmaker's statement was false. \"Such a disgusting lie,\" Trump said. \"He just can't forget his election trouncing.\"\n\nTrump went after Sen. Jeff Flake as well, after the Arizona Republican had warned on Wednesday that the GOP \"can't claim to be the party of Lincoln if we equivocate in condemning white supremacy.\"\n\n\"Great to see that Dr. Kelli Ward is running against Flake Jeff Flake, who is WEAK on borders, crime and a non-factor in Senate,\" Trump said, seemingly endorsing the GOP primary challenger over the vulnerable incumbent senator. \"He's toxic!\"\n\nTaken together, the chaos of the week represents another low for Trump's presidency, especially as he tries to revive efforts to repeal Obamacare, pass tax reform and push an infrastructure package, while also finding a congressional compromise that can avert a government shutdown and government default this fall. Trump can ill afford to lose the support of fellow Republicans, with the slim majority the party holds in the Senate.\n\nAnd it's not just lawmakers who are shunning Trump and his rhetoric. A steady flow of business leaders have also severed ties with the White House, prompting Trump to disband two advisory councils to stem the tide of defections. Even military leaders on the Joint Chiefs of Staff have taken stands, unequivocally stating that racism and hatred won't be tolerated within the armed forces.\n\n\"I can absolutely and unambiguously tell you there is no place -- no place -- for racism and bigotry in the U.S. military or in the United States as a whole,\" Marine Corps Gen. Joe Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Thursday from Beijing.\n\nTrump is also facing heightened turmoil in his White House, a dynamic that chief strategist Steve Bannon further aggravated by giving multiple interviews in which he broke from the president on North Korea, attacked his West Wing colleagues -- including economic adviser Gary Cohn -- and threatened to overhaul the Defense and State Departments.\n\nHe took a dig at Trump officials who are shying away from an aggressive trade policy, saying \"they are wetting themselves.\"\n\n\"That's a fight I fight every day here,\" Bannon said. \"We're still fighting. There's Treasury and Gary Cohn and Goldman Sachs lobbying.\"\n\nThe embattled White House aide also amplified Trump's culture wars message, saying the president's \"where does it all end\" skepticism \"connects with the American people about their history, cultures and traditions.\"\n\n\"The race-identity politics of the left wants to say it's all racist. Just give me more,\" Bannon told The New York Times. \"Tear down more statues. Say the revolution is coming. I can't get enough of it.\"\n\nBut descendants of Confederate Gen. Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson have called for the removal of his statue and others who represent the Confederacy.\n\n\"They are overt symbols of racism and white supremacy, and the time is long overdue for them to depart from public display,\" Jackson's great-great-grandsons William Jackson Christian and Warren Edmund Christian wrote in an open letter to the mayor of Richmond, Virginia.\n\nDouglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University, said on Thursday that Trump has joined Andrew Johnson and Woodrow Wilson \"as the most virulently racist\" presidents of the post-Civil War.\n\n\"Donald Trump seems to want to incite a cultural war,\" Brinkley said, adding that the president is \"willing to be incendiary on racial issues for political gain.\"\n\nBut he questioned the upside of defending Confederate monuments, noting that the Midwestern states that ultimately carried Trump to victory -- Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania -- all fought on the side of the Union.\n\nA CBS News poll released Thursday morning shows that 55 percent of Americans disapprove of Trump's response to Charlottesville, though more than two-thirds of Republicans surveyed do approve. The poll was conducted Monday, when Trump declared racism \"evil\" and condemned hate groups by name, through Wednesday, a day after the president doubled down on his initial response that white supremacists weren't the only people responsible for violence.\n\nTrump, however, eyed a different data point. \"Many meetings today in Bedminster including with Secretary Linda M and Small Business,\" he tweeted, after attacking Republican senators but before tweeting about the Confederate monuments being taken down across the country. \"Job numbers are looking great!\"", "id":

Do they have a problem?

Lee, Stonewall Jackson and other Confederate leaders.\n\nTrump on Thursday tweeted it was \"foolish\" to remove \"beautiful\" Confederate monuments and \"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart.\"\n\nAfter taking criticism for finding \"many sides\" to blame in the violence that erupted in Charlottesville, the president has finally found victims he can support.\n\nThey are made out of stone and bronze and represent men who actually did try to rip the country apart.\n\nThey celebrate people who took up arms against the country, the country Trump now leads, so that they could continue owning slaves.\n\nAnd they are modern-day rallying points for torch-carrying, swastika-waving groups worried that Jews, blacks and Hispanics just aren't letting white people get a fair shake.\n\nTrump in his defense of Confederate statues went on to tweet that: \"...the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\nWhile Trump may think there is nothing comparable to the beauty of a statue depicting someone who committed treason, I can think of a few possible replacements.\n\nHow about, we trade every Robert E. Lee statue for a Frederick Douglass?\n\nWhile General Lee owned slaves and led a rebellion against his country, Douglass escaped slavery and became a world-renowned abolitionist and champion of freedom.\n\nAnd for every Stonewall Jackson statue that comes down, we could build a new monument to Harriet Tubman. Jackson's success against the Union army may have been an impressive military feat, but I don't think it compares to Tubman leading hundreds of slaves to freedom as part of the Underground Railroad.\n\nStatues for Douglass and Tubman would fill the void created by removing Confederate monuments that Trump says he will miss so much. Plus, they would honor two people who really tried to make America great again.\n\nabreid@sunsentinel.com, 561-228-5504 or Twitter@abreidnews", "id": "9735941", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Trump should find other statues to support | Opinion", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5995bb9e/turbine/fl-op-buzz-trump-confederate-statues-20170817", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "200134", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "White people"}, "id": "303415", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"}, {"label": {"eng": "Statue"}, "id": "303774", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "African American"}, "id": "304393", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "id": "304554", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews"}, {"label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}, "id": "305262", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "id": "305960", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America"}, {"label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "id": "305969", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Slavery"}, "id": "309898", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery"}, {"label": {"eng": "Treason"}, "id": "318728", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treason"}, {"label": {"eng": "Abolitionism in the United States"}, "id": "328032", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolitionism_in_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "Underground Railroad"}, "id": "345196", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underground_Railroad"}, {"label": {"eng": "Swastika"}, "id": "357315", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swastika"}, {"label": {"eng": "Robert E.

Lee statue in Charlottesville, Virginia. The resulting tension between neo-Nazis and counter-protesters in the city's Emancipation Park came to a head when 20-year-old James Fields Jr. drove into a crowd, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer with his car.\n\nSince the weekend's disturbing events, city officials in Baltimore, Maryland, have quietly removed four of its Confederate monuments in the middle of the night. Demonstrators tore down a similar statue in Durham, North Carolina.\n\n\"The beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed,\" Trump said in response, \"and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\nSad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments. You..... -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\n...can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson?

Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\n...the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\nFor someone so ostensibly concerned with history, Trump seems to have forgotten his own track record with historic artifacts. In fact, shortly after the president tweeted his remarks, The New York Times' Michael Barbaro kindly reminded Trump that he had destroyed a \"beautiful statue\" in 1980 in order to construct Trump Tower.\n\nTo build his skyscraper, Trump demolished the Bonwit Teller building, which was erected in 1929 and included a historically significant Art Deco relief. The Metropolitan Museum of Art was reportedly interested in preserving the artwork around the time of the building's demolition, and, according to a 1980 report from the NYT, Trump originally agreed to donate them to the museum as long as the price wasn't too high.\n\nIt turned out, however, the price was too high ($32,000). Instead of preserving and gifting the reliefs, Trump ordered demolition workers to jackhammer them and shatter the remains. Allegedly posing as his fake spokesperson John Baron, Trump described the relief to the NYT as being \"without artistic merit,\" adding \"the merit of these stones was not great enough to justify the effort to save them.\"\n\nMembers of the art world, however, strongly disagreed, with gallery owner Robert Miller describing the loss as \"tragic.\" As Ashton Hawkins, vice president and secretary of the Board of Trustees at the Met put it, \"Can you imagine the museum accepting them if they were not of artistic merit?\"\n\nTrump was once again accused of scrapping historical remains during the transformation of a landmark post office in Washington, D.C., into a \"super luxury\" Trump Hotel. Six blocks from the White House, the building is \"considered an architectural masterpiece,\" the NYT explained in 2016. \"Built in the Romanesque Revival style, it dates to 1899; it is the tallest high-rise federal building in the city.\"\n\nDuring the development of his hotel, Trump did away with much of the edifice's original interior, even after pledging to preserve certain elements. He put carpet over the floors, covered up windows, removed plaster walls and installed gold leaf. Eventually, John Cullinane, who was serving as a preservationist architect for the development project, resigned from his position.\n\n\"I left because I couldn't support what they were doing to the building,\" he said. \"They were covering up or tearing out everything that was historic.\"\n\nAlong with destroying historic relics, Trump has also apparently fabricated one of his own. During renovations of a Sterling, Virginia-based golf course he purchased in 2009, Trump installed a stone pedestal commemorating the lives lost in \"The River of Blood,\" the the NYT reported in 2015.\n\n\"Many great American soldiers, both of the North and South, died at this spot,\" the inscription reads. \"The casualties were so great that the water would turn red and thus became known as 'The River of Blood.'\" The message concludes: \"It is my great honor to have preserved this important section of the Potomac River!\" It is signed \"Donald John Trump.\"\n\nTrump claimed that he checked with \"many historians,\" none mentioned by name, regarding the validity of the inscription. \"That was a prime site for river crossings,\" Trump said. \"So, if people are crossing the river, and you happen to be in a civil war, I would say that people were shot -- a lot of them.\"\n\nHowever, when the paper fact-checked the plaque's inscription with historians, they denied any existence of the so-called \"River of Blood.\" As Richard Gillespie, the executive director of the Mosby Heritage Area Association, phrased it, \"No. Uh-uh. No way. Nothing like that ever happened there.\"\n\nWhen the NYT relayed historians' dubious responses, Trump rebutted, \"How would they know that? Were they there?\"\n\nFurthermore, despite the fact that Trump bemoaned \"our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" he is actually the only president to ever suggest rescinding a national monument's status, according to The Atlantic.\n\nIn 2016, President Barack Obama proclaimed 1.3 million acres in southeast Utah as Bears Ears National Monument and vowed federal protections for the land deemed sacred to many local Native American tribes. In 2017, Trump described Obama's creation of national monuments as an \"egregious abuse of executive power\" and expressed his unclear desire to \"free it up.\"\n\nAccording to the Antiquities Act, only Congress can \"undo\" a national monument after it's established.\n\nIn direct contradiction to his claims on Twitter, Trump has an established record of altering, destroying and fabricating \"beautiful statues and monuments.\" Particularly when it proves advantageous.

There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\" Trump wrote.\n\nTrump's unpredictable, defiant and, critics claim, racially provocative behavior has clearly begun to wear on his Republican allies.\n\nTennessee Sen. Bob Corker, whom Trump considered for a Cabinet post, declared Thursday that \"the president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to\" in dealing with crises. And Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska tweeted, \"Anything less than complete & unambiguous condemnation of white supremacists, neo-Nazis and the KKK by the @POTUS is unacceptable. Period.\"\n\nSen. Tim Scott of South Carolina said Trump's \"moral authority is compromised.\"\n\nTrump, who is known to try to change the focus of news coverage with an attention-grabbing declaration, sought to shift Thursday from the white supremacists to the future of statues.\n\n\"You can't change history, but you can learn from it,\" he tweeted. \"Robert E. Lee. Stonewall Jackson -- who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish. ...\n\n\"Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" he tweeted.\n\nTrump met separately Thursday at his golf club in nearby Bedminster with the administrator of the Small Business Administration and Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a longtime Trump supporter. Trump also prepared for an unusual meeting Friday at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland with his national security team to discuss strategy for South Asia, including India, Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\nVice President Mike Pence was cutting short a long-planned Latin America tour to attend the meeting.\n\nThough out of public view, Trump sought to make his voice heard on Twitter as he found himself increasingly under siege and alone while fanning the controversy over race and politics toward a full-fledged national conflagration.\n\nHe dissolved two business councils Wednesday after the CEO members began quitting, damaging his central campaign promise to be a business-savvy chief executive in the Oval Office.\n\nMeanwhile, rumblings of discontent from his staff grew so loud that the White House had to release a statement saying that Trump's chief economic adviser wasn't quitting. And the president remained on the receiving end of bipartisan criticism for his handling of the aftermath of the Charlottesville clashes.\n\nOn Thursday, he hit back hard -- against Republicans.\n\nHe accused \"publicity-seeking\" Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina of falsely stating Trump's position on the demonstrators and called Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake \"toxic\" and praised Flake's potential primary election opponent.\n\nGraham said Wednesday that Trump \"took a step backward by again suggesting there is moral equivalency\" between the marching white supremacists and the people who had been demonstrating against them. Flake has been increasingly critical of Trump in recent weeks.\n\nPressured by advisers, the president had softened his words on the dispute Monday, two days after he had enraged many by declining to single out the white supremacists and neo-Nazis whose demonstration against the removal of a Robert E. Lee statute had led to violence and the death of a counter-protester in Charlottesville.\n\nHe returned to his combative stance on Tuesday -- insisting anew during an unexpected and contentious news conference at Trump Tower that \"both sides\" were to blame.\n\nAides watching from the sidelines reacted with dismay and disbelief and privately told colleagues they were upset by the president's remarks, though not upset enough for anyone to resign.\n\nThe resignation speculation around Gary Cohn, head of the National Economic Council and a Jew, had grown so intense by Thursday that the White House released a statement saying reports that Cohn was stepping down were \"100 percent false.\"\n\nBut not all of Trump's aides were unhappy with his performance.\n\nAdviser Steve Bannon's job security in the White House has become tenuous -- Trump offered only a \"we'll see\" on Tuesday when asked if his chief strategist would remain in his post -- but Bannon has been telling allies that the president's news conference would electrify the GOP base.\n\nAnd in a pair of interviews Wednesday, Bannon cheered on the president's nationalist tendencies and suggested that a fight over Confederate monuments was a political fight he welcomes.\n\n\"The race-identity politics of the left wants to say it's all racist,\" Bannon told The New York Times. \"Just give me more. Tear down more statues. Say the revolution is coming. I can't get enough of it.\"\n\n-- -- --\n\nLemire reported from New York.

Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\nRepublican Senator Lindsey Graham said on Wednesday that Mr. Trump \"took a step backward by again suggesting there is moral equivalency\" between the marching white supremacists and the people who had been demonstrating against them.\n\nNuanced remarks\n\nOther Republicans, including the most powerful in Congress, have been making strong statements on Charlottesville and racism, but few have been mentioning Mr. Trump himself.\n\nThe Senate's top Republican, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, condemned \"hate and bigotry\". House Speaker Paul Ryan charged that, \"White supremacy is repulsive\". But neither criticised the President's insistence that there were \"very fine people on both sides\" of the violent weekend clash in Virginia.\n\nThe nuanced statements reflect the party establishment's delicate dance. Few top Republican officeholders want to defend the President in the midst of an escalating political crisis, yet they are unwilling to declare all-out opposition to him and risk alienating his loyalists.\n\nIn another major sign of discontent within the Republican Party, Mr. Trump abruptly abolished two of his White House business councils on Wednesday as corporate chiefs began resigning in protest of his statements.\n\nThe White House is trying to deal with the repercussions from Mr. Trump's defiant remarks on the Virginia tragedy. Advisers hunkered down, offering no public defence while privately expressing frustration with his comments.\n\nBut Mr. Trump himself was increasing rather than slowing his tweet-a-thon.\n\nOn Wednesday, he had told associates he was pleased with how his combative press conference had gone a day earlier, saying he believed he had effectively stood up to the media, according to three people familiar with the conversations who demanded anonymity because they were not authorised to speak publicly about them.", "id": "9741215", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Trump defends civil war statues ", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article19511369.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH18UScol", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "200134", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "242096", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Racism"}, "id": "302940", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}, "id": "302944", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Politics"}, "id": "302948", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics"}, {"label": {"eng": "White House"}, "id": "303051", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House"}, {"label": {"eng": "Culture"}, "id": "303325", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"}, {"label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}, "id": "304059", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "Paul Ryan"}, "id": "304743", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Ryan"}, {"label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}, "id": "304752", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives"}, {"label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}, "id": "305157", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate"}, {"label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}, "id": "305262", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "id": "305960", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America"}, {"label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "id": "305969", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mitch McConnell"}, "id": "307368", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_McConnell"}, {"label": {"eng": "Lindsey Graham"}, "id": "324838", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindsey_Graham"}, {"label": {"eng": "Robert E.

On the issue of Charlottesville and Civil War statues, Donald Trump is approaching Luray Cavern depth, and he's still shoveling away. What began as a foolish reaction Saturday, an attempt at correction Monday and then a full meltdown Tuesday continues to yield that now-familiar Trumpian combination of bluster, counter attack and a blatant rewriting of history. As the Great Emancipator might have said, it's altogether fitting and proper that we should gather today to bury President Donald Trump's continuing defense of the neo-Nazis and white supremacists who marched in Virginia.\n\nBut before we recall the president's immortal impromptu news conference at Trump Tower, we should also pause to note that Baltimore returned to Mr. Trump's sights. This morning, a day after Mayor Catherine Pugh's surprise removal of Baltimore's four Confederate statues, President Trump issued a series of tweets writing it was \"sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments.\" He named Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson and equated those two men who nearly ripped the nation in half to two men who created it, George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. \"So foolish!\" He tweeted. \"Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\" The \"beauty\" claims were kind of novel since most of his past references to Charm City have suggested it's a negative place, such as claiming he was \"irritated\" to learn Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein was from here (he actually isn't; he just had a job requiring his presence), declining to speak to the NAACP convention here or accusing the city of having roving gangs of illegal immigrants (which it doesn't).\n\nThe glass-half-full interpretation? President Trump thinks Baltimore had beautiful parks at one time. Well, that was kind of nice. Too bad he fails to see that it is the presence, not the removal, of those statues in places like Baltimore that causes the country to suffer and how tributes to Confederate generals distort, rather than illuminate, our history.\n\nThat takes us back to the Tuesday news conference, which was a lot like the Gettysburg Address -- had Abraham Lincoln shown up at the battlefield to talk about U.S. infrastructure and then descended into madness and a shouting match with Mathew Brady. Here are some of the Trump claims that merit Alternative Fact of the Week consideration:\n\n\"The statement I made on Saturday, the first statement, was a fine statement.\" That's true only if by \"fine,\" he meant that it was a statement that received near-universal condemnation because it failed to single out neo-Nazis and their ilk for criticism and instead faulted \"many sides.\" \"Not all of those people were white supremacists, by any stretch. ... Those people were also there because they wanted to protest the taking down of a statue of Robert E. Lee.\" Mr. Trump also claimed there were many \"fine people\" in the group, but if they weren't all white supremacists, they were people perfectly happy to march shoulder-to-shoulder with large numbers of white males shouting, \"Jews will not replace us\" or the Nazi slogan, \"blood and soil.\" Is there really much of a distinction there? \"And I'll tell you, we're spending a lot of money on the inner cities. We're fixing the inner cities. We're doing far more than anybody has done with respect to the inner cities. It's a priority for me, and it's very important.\" Is such a claim even worth serious analysis? Mr. Trump has proposed cutting agencies that help cities like HUD and has attacked social safety net programs from job training to aid to public education. There's simply no conceivable way to make that boast true.\n\nAnd then there's the matter of the \"alt-left\" and Mr. Trump's continued castigation of those who came to protest the white supremacists as being equally to blame for the violence (conveniently ignoring that it was a supremacist who drove a car into a crowd, killing one woman and injuring 19 others). After Sen. Lindsey Graham denounced such \"moral equivalency\" Wednesday, President Trump shot back today, tweeting, \"Publicity seeking Lindsey Graham falsely stated that I said there is moral equivalency between the KKK, neo-Nazis & white supremacists and people like [crash victim Heather] Heyer. Such a disgusting lie.\"\n\nPerhaps Mr. Trump simply doesn't understand the concept of moral equivalency, but he ought to; he's been doing a lot of it lately. He ought to at least know the meaning of the word, \"lie.\"\n\nBecome a subscriber today to support editorial writing like this.

After officials removed four statues in Baltimore and announced plans to remove a fifth in Annapolis, and after demonstrators spontaneously destroyed a Confederate memorial in Durham, N.C., President Trump weighed in on the matter: \"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" he wrote in a series of tweets . \"You can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson -- who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish! Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\nLet's be clear. No one is talking about ripping the country apart -- unless it's the president himself. The tons of Confederate iconography installed long ago were put there as part of an ideological campaign whose goals were to glorify men and women who betrayed the United States in the cause of human slavery and to marginalize descendants of the enslaved. That is historical fact. To hail the \"beauty\" of the statues is to ignore all that, possibly for short-term political advantage, which is what factional demagogues always seek -- but not true national leaders.\n\nAmericans face a challenge that might be called the mass curation of our public spaces, in light of contemporary sensibilities, yes, but just as important, in service of what has always been the truth. There may be many ways for local communities to address that challenge; though removing offensive statues may be the most straightforward, in some cases communities may prefer to add historical context and explanation. What is not acceptable anymore is the status quo. Far from ripping the country apart, a full and fair reckoning with Confederate monuments could, if guided by thoughtful leaders, bring people together, on the basis of more equitable and hence more sustainable consensus about the past.\n\nAre George Washington and Thomas Jefferson next? The first and third presidents, and many other Founding Fathers and presidents, held slaves , which does make their legacy a complex challenge for all thoughtful Americans. For purposes of public memorialization, however, there is a distinction between people who partook of their era's moral flaws and those whose primary claim to fame is to have betrayed their country with the ultimate goal of making it impossible for slavery ever to be abolished in roughly half of the United States.\n\nIn any case, the involvement of our historical forebears in slavery ought not to be shied away from, even as we study their achievements and appropriately honor them. Curators of presidential homes such as Monticello and James Monroe's Highland, both near Charlottesville, are getting better at doing so every year. You can't change history, and you can learn from it.

There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\" he wrote.\n\nTrump's unpredictable, defiant and, critics claim, racially provocative behavior has clearly begun to wear on his Republican allies.\n\nTennessee Sen. Bob Corker said Thursday that \"the president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to\" in dealing with crises. And Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska tweeted, \"Anything less than complete & unambiguous condemnation of white supremacists, neo-Nazis and the KKK by the @POTUS is unacceptable. Period.\"\n\nSen. Tim Scott of South Carolina said Trump's \"moral authority is compromised.\"\n\nTrump sought to shift from white supremacists to the future of statues. \"You can't change history, but you can learn from it,\" he tweeted. \"Robert E. Lee. Stonewall Jackson -- who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish. ...\n\n\"Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" he tweeted.\n\nThough out of public view at his Bedminster, N.J., golf club, Trump sought to make his voice heard on Twitter as he found himself increasingly under siege and alone while fanning the controversy over race and politics toward a full-fledged national conflagration.\n\nTwo major charities, the Cleveland Clinic and the American Cancer Society, announced that they are canceling fundraisers scheduled for Trump's resort in Palm Beach, Fla., amid the backlash.\n\nMeanwhile, rumblings of discontent from his staff grew so loud that the White House had to release a statement saying that Trump's chief economic adviser wasn't quitting. And the president remained on the receiving end of bipartisan criticism for his handling of the aftermath of the Charlottesville clashes.\n\nOn Thursday, he hit back hard -- against Republicans.\n\nHe accused \"publicity-seeking\" Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina of falsely stating Trump's position on the demonstrators. He called Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake \"toxic\" and praised Flake's potential primary election opponent.\n\nGraham said Wednesday that Trump \"took a step backward by again suggesting there is moral equivalency\" between the marching white supremacists and the people who had been demonstrating against them. Flake has been increasingly critical of Trump.\n\nPressured by advisers, Trump had softened his words on the blame for the Charlottesville violence Monday but returned to a combative stance Tuesday -- insisting anew that \"both sides\" were to blame.\n\nAides reacted with dismay and disbelief and privately told colleagues they were upset by the president's remarks, though not enough to resign.\n\nThe resignation speculation around Gary Cohn, head of the National Economic Council and a Jew, had grown so intense by Thursday that the White House released a statement saying reports that Cohn was stepping down were \"100 percent false.\"", "id": "9808714", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Trump, under siege, takes aim at Republicans", "image":

(Virginia Bridges/The Herald-Sun via Associated Press)\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" President Trump tweeted peevishly on Thursday. \"You can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington? Jefferson? So foolish! Also ... the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\nLike he is about a lot of things, Trump is wrong about this. The monuments to Confederate leaders that started to come down in cities across the country after white supremacists used a Charlottesville statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee as a rallying point to express their racist and anti-Semitic ideas about the state of the country are neither permanent features of our landscape nor honest and searching attempts to explore American history. No matter what secessionist emails from Trump's personal lawyer suggest, it is possible to tell the difference between the men who fought for American independence and those who were traitors to their country, and we can do it without help from statues that emphasize the valor of the latter and downplay their betrayal. While it might be tempting to dismiss every element of these particular Trump tweets, there's one misconception in particular that I want to focus on: that we can never \"comparably\" replace the beauty of statues that are coming down.\n\nThis moment, far from being some sort of national tragedy, is actually a tremendous opportunity to re-imagine our public spaces. Many Confederate monuments were erected as part of post-Civil War efforts to recast secession as a glorious Lost Cause. Taking them down, or moving them to museums and battlefields where they can be put in context, is just a start. It's also time to think about what kind of monuments and public art might go up in their place, and who might be honored instead of figures such as Lee, Confederate President Jefferson Davis, Confederate Vice President Alexander Hamilton Stephens and Nathan Bedford Forrest. In the void these statues leave behind, we should erect a new, more honest and more genuinely glorious vision of what it means to be an American hero.\n\nIn some places, this important work is already underway. In 2015, I interviewed Joseph Riley, then the mayor of Charleston, S.C., about his decades-long efforts to change the way his city understood and presented its history to residents and visitors. In 1976, the city hung a portrait by Dorothy B. Wright of Denmark Vesey, a free black man who was hanged in 1822 for planning a slave revolt, in the Gaillard Auditorium, the city's premiere performance space. And in 2014, Riley succeeded in getting a statue of Vesey, with his carpenter's tools in his right hand and the Bible in his left, installed in the city's Hampton Park. When I spoke to Riley, he told me that both the portrait and the statue were beautiful to him.\n\nI agree with him on both an aesthetic and a political level. Seeing Vesey restored to a place of honor in his city through art that captures his dignity and determination affirms the nobility of his cause and cuts through depictions that portrayed him as \"a brutal would-be killer of white people,\" as Riley put it. Monuments can obscure history, as they have with the Confederacy, but they can restore the truth of the past, too. It's not as if the United Daughters of the Confederacy are the only people with the savvy to design artistically and politically effective public art.\n\nRiley isn't alone. In recent days, the artist Kara Walker has suggested that she has ideas for how to repurpose the three-acre carving of Davis, Lee and Confederate Gen. Stonewall Jackson on the face of Stone Mountain in Georgia. The Democratic strategist Paul Begala pointed to the statue of Barbara Jordan, a leader in the civil rights movement who served in the U.S. House of Representatives, at the University of Texas at Austin campus, naming it \"my kind of Southern statue.\" This September, the city of Philadelphia is conducting a project called Monument Lab that involves staging temporary works around the city as a way of probing \"what is an appropriate monument for the current city of Philadelphia?\"\n\nThat's a critically important question, not just for Philadelphia, but for all of us. As Confederate statues come down from their original places, we shouldn't leave patches of dead grass and old plinths behind. We should fill the physical and moral spaces they leave in our parks, plazas and capital rotundas with images of true heroes, people who affirmed their country's best values instead of betraying them.", "id": "9749980", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Opinion | Take down Confederate monuments.

Esther Lee, president of the Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, chapter of the group, said the statues have historical significance and shouldn't be removed.\n\n\"You can't eliminate what history is. So I disapprove with young people pulling down those statues,\" she said.\n\nThe kerfuffle over the Confederate monuments reached a fever pitch after Saturday's violent clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia, where neo-Nazis, white supremacists and KKK sympathizers rallied to oppose the removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.\n\nAt one point during the rioting, James Fields, 20, drove his car into a crowd of counterprotesters, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer and injuring dozens more.\n\nTrump faced criticism from conservatives and liberals for not being strong enough in his initial statements against the hate groups involved in Saturday's protests. That afternoon, he condemned the violence coming from \"many sides.\"\n\nBy Monday, the president specifically rebuked neo-Nazis, the KKK and white supremacists. But he stepped on his message Tuesday during a combative press conference, when he assigned some of the blame for Saturday's violence to left-leaning protesters.\n\nA slight majority -- 52 percent -- said Trump's statements about Charlottesville were \"not strong enough,\" while only 27 percent said they were satisfied with the president's remarks.", "id": "9830688", "details": {"gpCnt": 4}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "A Majority of Americans Say Confederate Statues Should Remain in Place", "image": "https://cdn1.ijr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/GettyImages-478303912-1.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "200134", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Bethlehem"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "220594", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethlehem,_Pennsylvania", "label": {"eng": "Bethlehem"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}, "id": "302944", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Culture"}, "id": "303325", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"}, {"label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}, "id": "304050", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"}, {"label": {"eng": "News"}, "id": "304070", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}, "id": "304967", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}, "id": "305262", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}, "id": "305377", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "id": "305960", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America"}, {"label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "id": "305969", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy"}, {"label": {"eng": "NPR"}, "id": "308986", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR"}, {"label": {"eng": "National Association for the Advancement of Colored People"}, "id": "310785", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Colored_People"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ku Klux Klan"}, "id": "318256", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan"}, {"label": {"eng": "Robert E.

There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\" Trump wrote.\n\nTrump's unpredictable, defiant and, critics claim, racially provocative behavior has clearly begun to wear on his Republican allies.\n\nTennessee Sen. Bob Corker, whom Trump considered for a Cabinet post, declared Thursday that \"the president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to\" in dealing with crises. And Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska tweeted, \"Anything less than complete & unambiguous condemnation of white supremacists, neo-Nazis and the KKK by the @POTUS is unacceptable. Period.\"\n\nSen. Tim Scott of South Carolina said Trump's \"moral authority is compromised.\"\n\nTrump, who is known to try to change the focus of news coverage with an attention-grabbing declaration, sought to shift Thursday from the white supremacists to the future of statues.\n\n\"You can't change history, but you can learn from it,\" he tweeted. \"Robert E. Lee. Stonewall Jackson -- who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish. ...\n\n\"Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" he tweeted.\n\nTrump met separately Thursday at his golf club in nearby Bedminster with the administrator of the Small Business Administration and Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a longtime Trump supporter. Trump also prepared for an unusual meeting Friday at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland with his national security team to discuss strategy for South Asia, including India, Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\nVice President Mike Pence was cutting short a long-planned Latin America tour to attend the meeting.\n\nThough out of public view, Trump sought to make his voice heard on Twitter as he found himself increasingly under siege and alone while fanning the controversy over race and politics toward a full-fledged national conflagration.\n\nHe dissolved two business councils Wednesday after the CEO members began quitting, damaging his central campaign promise to be a business-savvy chief executive in the Oval Office.\n\nTwo major charities, the Cleveland Clinic and the American Cancer Society, announced they are canceling fundraisers scheduled for Trump's resort in Palm Beach, Florida, amid the continuing backlash over Trump's remarks.\n\nMeanwhile, rumblings of discontent from his staff grew so loud that the White House had to release a statement saying that Trump's chief economic adviser wasn't quitting. And the president remained on the receiving end of bipartisan criticism for his handling of the aftermath of the Charlottesville clashes.\n\nOn Thursday, he hit back hard -- against Republicans.\n\nHe accused \"publicity-seeking\" Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina of falsely stating Trump's position on the demonstrators. He called Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake \"toxic\" and praised Flake's potential primary election opponent.\n\nGraham said Wednesday that Trump \"took a step backward by again suggesting there is moral equivalency\" between the marching white supremacists and the people who had been demonstrating against them. Flake has been increasingly critical of Trump in recent weeks.\n\nPressured by advisers, the president had softened his words on the dispute Monday, two days after he had enraged many by declining to single out the white supremacists and neo-Nazis whose demonstration against the removal of a Robert E. Lee statute had led to violence and the death of a counter-protester in Charlottesville.\n\nHe returned to his combative stance Tuesday -- insisting anew during an unexpected and contentious news conference at Trump Tower that \"both sides\" were to blame.\n\nAides watching from the sidelines reacted with dismay and disbelief and privately told colleagues they were upset by the president's remarks, though not upset enough for anyone to resign.\n\nThe resignation speculation around Gary Cohn, head of the National Economic Council and a Jew, had grown so intense by Thursday that the White House released a statement saying reports that Cohn was stepping down were \"100 percent false.\"\n\nBut not all of Trump's aides were unhappy with his performance.\n\nAdviser Steve Bannon's job security in the White House has become tenuous -- Trump offered only a \"we'll see\" on Tuesday when asked if his chief strategist would remain in his post -- but Bannon has been telling allies that the president's news conference would electrify the GOP base.\n\nAnd in a pair of interviews Wednesday, Bannon cheered on the president's nationalist tendencies and suggested that a fight over Confederate monuments was a political fight he welcomes.\n\n\"The race-identity politics of the left wants to say it's all racist,\" Bannon told The New York Times. \"Just give me more. Tear down more statues. Say the revolution is coming. I can't get enough of it.\"\n\n-- -- --\n\nLemire reported from New York.

There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\"\n\nMr Trump's unpredictable, defiant and, critics claim, racially provocative behaviour has clearly begun to anger his Republican allies.\n\nSenator Bob Corker of Tennessee, who Mr Trump considered for a Cabinet post, declared \"the president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to\" in dealing with crises.\n\nAnd Senator Dan Sullivan of Alaska tweeted: \"Anything less than complete & unambiguous condemnation of white supremacists, neo-Nazis and the KKK by the @POTUS is unacceptable. Period.\"\n\nSenator Tim Scott of South Carolina said the president's \"moral authority is compromised\".\n\nMr Trump, who is known to try to change the focus of news coverage with an attention-grabbing declaration, sought to shift focus from the white supremacists to the future of statues.\n\n\"You can't change history, but you can learn from it,\" he tweeted. \"Robert E Lee. Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish.\n\n\"Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" he tweeted.\n\nMr T rump found himself increasingly under siege and alone while fanning the controversy over race and politics towards a full-fledged national conflagration.\n\nHe dissolved two business councils on Wednesday after the chief executive members began quitting.\n\nThat damaged his central campaign promise to be a business-savvy chief executive in the Oval Office.\n\nAnd the White House said on Thursday it was abandoning plans to form an infrastructure advisory council.\n\nTwo major charities, the Cleveland Clinic and the American Cancer Society, cancelled fundraisers scheduled for Mr Trump's resort in Palm Beach, Florida, amid the continuing backlash over the president's remarks.\n\nMeanwhile, rumblings of discontent from his staff grew so loud that the White House had to release a statement saying Mr Trump's chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn, head of the National Economic Council and a Jew, was not quitting.\n\nThe president h it back hard against Republicans, accusing \"publicity-seeking\" Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina of falsely stating Mr Trump's position on the Charlottesville demonstrators.\n\nHe called Arizona Senator Jeff Flake \"toxic\" and praised his potential primary election opponent.\n\nMr Graham had said Mr Trump \"took a step backward by again suggesting there is moral equivalency\" between the marching white supremacists and the people who had been demonstrating against them.\n\nPressured by advisers, the president had softened his words on the dispute on Monday.\n\nThat was two days after he had enraged many by declining to single out the white supremacists and neo-Nazis whose demonstration against the removal of a Robert E Lee statute had led to violence and the death of a counter-protester in Charlottesville.\n\nBut he returned to his combative stance Tuesday - insisting anew during an unexpected and contentious news conference at Trump Tower that \"both sides\" were to blame.\n\nAides watching from the sidelines reacted with dismay and disbelief and privately told colleagues they were upset by the president's remarks.\n\nBut not all were unhappy with his performance, with adviser Steve Bannon telling allies that it would electrify the Republican Party base.\n\nHis job security in the White House is tenuous - Mr Trump offered only a \"we'll see\" on Tuesday when asked if his chief strategist would remain in his post - but Mr Bannon welcomed a fight over Confederate monuments.\n\nHe told The New York Times: \"The race-identity politics of the left wants to say it's all racist.

Richard Burr, R-N.C., reacted Thursday to President Trump's tweets that the removal of Confederate statues around the country is foolish and would damage the nation's history and culture.\n\nBurr and U.S. Rep. David Price, D-4th, were the only members of the state's delegation to Congress who talked about Trump's most recent statements about Confederate monuments.\n\nBurr, some his fellow Republicans in the U.S. House and the state's three Democratic House members also have publicly discussed the Charlottesville events amid a renewed effort to remove Confederate statues from public property across the country.\n\nIn a series of tweets, Trump wrote partly that, \"the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\" He also tweeted, \"Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson -- who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish!\"\n\nBurr told WXII Television in Greensboro that \"I'm not sure that removing every historical marker in America heals the country. That doesn't heal the country.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Burr termed Trump's statement that both sides of the protesters in Charlottesville share equal blame for the violence \"misguided.\"\n\nMembers of the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazis and pro-Confederate groups gathered in Charlottesville last Saturday to rally against that city's decision to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from a downtown park. Counterprotesters gathered to oppose the white nationalists' rally, and some members on both sides fought.\n\nHeather Heyer, 32, a counterprotester, was killed when a car plowed into counterprotesters after authorities broke up the white nationalist Unite the Right rally. James Alex Fields, 20, of Maumee, Ohio, and a Nazi sympathizer, has been charged with murder and other offenses in Heyer's death.\n\nSome Republican senators and House members have criticized Trump for failing to initially identify the white nationalist groups by name on Saturday. The president identified those groups Monday, but said again on Tuesday that both sides share equal blame for the violence in Charlottesville.\n\nIn the wake of Saturday's events, elected leaders in many cities and towns across the country have said that Confederate statues should be removed from public property. Gov. Roy Cooper, D-N.C., joined that chorus Wednesday as he called for the removal of all Confederate monuments on public property in North Carolina.\n\nIn addition, U.S. Rep. Alma Adams, D-12th, has called for the removal of Confederate statues in North Carolina and in Washington, D.C.\n\nCooper also said that a state law that requires state officials to approve any action to remove those statues should be repealed.\n\nU.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-5th, pointed to her Saturday tweet about the mayhem in Charlottesville in which she said that the violence and bigotry displayed there was an affront to American values.\n\n\"My position on the attack of our shared American values remains unchanged,\" Foxx said in a statement Thursday. \"I am repulsed by the violence promulgated in Charlottesville by white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups.\n\n\"I offer my deepest condolences to the family of Heather Heyer, and I will continue to pray for all of those affected by the tragedy in Charlottesville,\" Foxx said.\n\nU.S. Rep. Mark Walker, R-6th, criticized right-wing hate groups in a statement.\n\n\"The message of white nationalists, supremacists and other groups that project hate is evil and contrary to God's call to love all mankind and that every life is valuable,\" Walker said. \"I hope the voices of Americans -- especially those of faith -- will be loud enough to drown out every voice of hate. As a state and as a nation, we should focus on the things and ideas that bring us together, rather than further division.\"\n\nPrice criticized Trump's tweets about the Confederate statues.\n\n\"What this president can't seem to comprehend is that the darkest parts of our history are best learned through teachers, textbooks, and museums, not statues put on pedestals in town squares and public buildings,\" Price said. \"Communities, including those in states like North Carolina, should be able to remove the icons they deem offensive without interference from the state legislature or reprimand from Donald Trump.\n\n\"We don't get to choose our history, but we do get to choose the history we celebrate,\" Price said.\n\nU.S. Rep. George Holding, R-2nd, said he condemned slavery, but he supports keeping the Confederate monuments in place.\n\n\"There are moments in American history we can point to with pride, and there are other moments when men made mistakes and when what they did was wrong,\" Holding said. \"And, often, the same men who did good also made mistakes.\n\n\"Slavery was one of our terrible mistakes,\" Holding said. \"It was wrong. But we also can be proud of how, at Appomattox, Lincoln and Grant and Lee put our country on the road to healing and unity.\n\n\"That is why I do not believe we should take down memorials to the soldiers who fought in the Civil War,\" Holding said. \"Instead, we should learn from history, as Lincoln said in 1865 a month before Appomattox, 'With malice toward none, with charity for all.'\"",

Lee statue, armed with semi-automatic weapons and mace and chanting \"Jews will not replace us!\" and \"Blood and Soil!\"\n\nTrump, who previously said, during Tuesday's \"infrastructure\" press conference, that local governments should determine whether to remove confederate statues and symbols in their community, this morning tweeted his displeasure, in 10-minute-ish intervals, that several local governments had done just that. He kicked things off tweeting how \"sad\" it was to see \"the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart\" in this way:\n\nHe again pulled out his Robert E. Lee And George Washington: No Difference argument he'd used earlier in the week at his unhinged Trump Tower press conference:\n\nAnd, finally, Trump warned that the \"beauty\" of effigies memorializing the war to break up the country or the sake of slavery \"will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\nPointedly, Baltimore's mayor had crews quietly remove four of the city's Confederate monuments, without notice, hours after Trump's Tuesday presser, at which he argued removing statues of Confederate leaders would lead to removal of monuments to George Washington.\n\nBaltimore Mayor Catherine E. Pugh had announced Monday she was in talks with contractors to haul away the statues, and the city council approved a removal plan that night, WaPo reported.\n\nTrump's morning tweets mark his latest stab at doing over his response to the deadly rally in Charlottesville, in which a woman was killed when a white supremacist plowed his car into demonstrators. Trump initially said there was fault \"on all sides\" - a statement for which he was widely blasted by government chiefs around the world, by Dems at home and even by Republicans. Trump revealed his first do-over on Monday, at the White House, callingout neo-Nazis and white supremacists by name. But he delivered it without any vim and political wags said the unwilling fix irked him.

Lee from a park in the city.\n\nThe city's local council had voted to remove the statue and numerous similar statues around the US have been removed since.\n\nIn a series of tweets this afternoon, Trump said that he did not support the removal of the statues.\n\nSource: Donald J.

(AP) - With prominent Republicans openly questioning his competence and moral leadership, President Donald Trump on Thursday burrowed deeper into the racially charged debate over Confederate memorials and lashed out at members of his own party in the latest controversy to engulf his presidency.\n\nOut of sight, but still online, Trump tweeted his defense of monuments to Confederate icons - bemoaning rising efforts to remove them as an attack on America's \"history and culture.\"\n\nAnd he berated his critics who, with increasingly sharper language, have denounced his initially slow and then ultimately combative comments on the racial violence at a white supremacist rally last weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nTrump was much quicker Thursday to condemn violence in Barcelona, where more than a dozen people were killed when a van veered onto a sidewalk and sped down a busy pedestrian zone in what authorities called a terror attack.\n\nHe then added to his expression of support a tweet reviving a debunked legend about a U.S. general subduing Muslim rebels a century ago in the Philippines by shooting them with bullets dipped in pig blood.\n\n\"Study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught. There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\" Trump wrote.\n\nTrump's unpredictable, defiant and, critics claim, racially provocative behavior has clearly begun to wear on his Republican allies.\n\nTennessee Sen. Bob Corker, whom Trump considered for a Cabinet post, declared Thursday that \"the president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to\" in dealing with crises. And Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska tweeted, \"Anything less than complete & unambiguous condemnation of white supremacists, neo-Nazis and the KKK by the @POTUS is unacceptable. Period.\"\n\nSen. Tim Scott of South Carolina said Trump's \"moral authority is compromised.\"\n\nTrump, who is known to try to change the focus of news coverage with an attention-grabbing declaration, sought to shift Thursday from the white supremacists to the future of statues.\n\n\"You can't change history, but you can learn from it,\" he tweeted. \"Robert E. Lee. Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish. ...\n\n\"Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" he tweeted.\n\nTrump met separately Thursday at his golf club in nearby Bedminster with the administrator of the Small Business Administration and Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a longtime Trump supporter. Trump also prepared for an unusual meeting Friday at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland with his national security team to discuss strategy for South Asia, including India, Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\nVice President Mike Pence was cutting short a long-planned Latin America tour to attend the meeting.\n\nThough out of public view, Trump sought to make his voice heard on Twitter as he found himself increasingly under siege and alone while fanning the controversy over race and politics toward a full-fledged national conflagration.\n\nHe dissolved two business councils Wednesday after the CEO members began quitting, damaging his central campaign promise to be a business-savvy chief executive in the Oval Office.\n\nTwo major charities, the Cleveland Clinic and the American Cancer Society, announced they are canceling fundraisers scheduled for Trump's resort in Palm Beach, Florida, amid the continuing backlash over Trump's remarks.\n\nMeanwhile, rumblings of discontent from his staff grew so loud that the White House had to release a statement saying that Trump's chief economic adviser wasn't quitting. And the president remained on the receiving end of bipartisan criticism for his handling of the aftermath of the Charlottesville clashes.\n\nOn Thursday, he hit back hard - against Republicans.\n\nHe accused \"publicity-seeking\" Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina of falsely stating Trump's position on the demonstrators. He called Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake \"toxic\" and praised Flake's potential primary election opponent.\n\nGraham said Wednesday that Trump \"took a step backward by again suggesting there is moral equivalency\" between the marching white supremacists and the people who had been demonstrating against them. Flake has been increasingly critical of Trump in recent weeks.\n\nPressured by advisers, the president had softened his words on the dispute Monday, two days after he had enraged many by declining to single out the white supremacists and neo-Nazis whose demonstration against the removal of a Robert E. Lee statute had led to violence and the death of a counter-protester in Charlottesville.\n\nHe returned to his combative stance Tuesday - insisting anew during an unexpected and contentious news conference at Trump Tower that \"both sides\" were to blame.\n\nAides watching from the sidelines reacted with dismay and disbelief and privately told colleagues they were upset by the president's remarks, though not upset enough for anyone to resign.\n\nThe resignation speculation around Gary Cohn, head of the National Economic Council and a Jew, had grown so intense by Thursday that the White House released a statement saying reports that Cohn was stepping down were \"100 percent false.\"\n\nBut not all of Trump's aides were unhappy with his performance.\n\nAdviser Steve Bannon's job security in the White House has become tenuous - Trump offered only a \"we'll see\" on Tuesday when asked if his chief strategist would remain in his post - but Bannon has been telling allies that the president's news conference would electrify the GOP base.\n\nAnd in a pair of interviews Wednesday, Bannon cheered on the president's nationalist tendencies and suggested that a fight over Confederate monuments was a political fight he welcomes.\n\n\"The race-identity politics of the left wants to say it's all racist,\" Bannon told The New York Times. \"Just give me more. Tear down more statues. Say the revolution is coming. I can't get enough of it.\"\n\n___\n\nLemire reported from New York.

There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\" Trump wrote.\n\nTrump's unpredictable, defiant and, critics claim, racially provocative behavior has clearly begun to wear on his Republican allies.\n\nTennessee Sen. Bob Corker, whom Trump considered for a Cabinet post, declared Thursday that \"the president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to\" in dealing with crises. And Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska tweeted, \"Anything less than complete & unambiguous condemnation of white supremacists, neo-Nazis and the KKK by the @POTUS is unacceptable. Period.\"\n\nSen. Tim Scott of South Carolina said Trump's \"moral authority is compromised.\"\n\nTrump, who is known to try to change the focus of news coverage with an attention-grabbing declaration, sought to shift Thursday from the white supremacists to the future of statues.\n\n\"You can't change history, but you can learn from it,\" he tweeted. \"Robert E.

So foolish. ...\n\n\"Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" he tweeted.\n\nTrump met separately Thursday at his golf club in nearby Bedminster with the administrator of the Small Business Administration and Florida Gov.

There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\" Trump wrote.\n\nTrump's unpredictable, defiant and, critics claim, racially provocative behavior has clearly begun to wear on his Republican allies.\n\nTennessee Sen. Bob Corker, whom Trump considered for a Cabinet post, declared Thursday that \"the president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to\" in dealing with crises. And Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska tweeted, \"Anything less than complete & unambiguous condemnation of white supremacists, neo-Nazis and the KKK by the @POTUS is unacceptable. Period.\"\n\nSen. Tim Scott of South Carolina said Trump's \"moral authority is compromised.\"\n\nTrump, who is known to try to change the focus of news coverage with an attention-grabbing declaration, sought to shift Thursday from the white supremacists to the future of statues.\n\n\"You can't change history, but you can learn from it,\" he tweeted. \"Robert E. Lee. Stonewall Jackson -- who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish. ...\n\n\"Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" he tweeted.\n\nTrump met separately Thursday at his golf club in nearby Bedminster with the administrator of the Small Business Administration and Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a longtime Trump supporter. Trump also prepared for an unusual meeting Friday at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland with his national security team to discuss strategy for South Asia, including India, Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\nVice President Mike Pence was cutting short a long-planned Latin America tour to attend the meeting.\n\nThough out of public view, Trump sought to make his voice heard on Twitter as he found himself increasingly under siege and alone while fanning the controversy over race and politics toward a full-fledged national conflagration.\n\nHe dissolved two business councils Wednesday after the CEO members began quitting, damaging his central campaign promise to be a business-savvy chief executive in the Oval Office.\n\nMeanwhile, rumblings of discontent from his staff grew so loud that the White House had to release a statement saying that Trump's chief economic adviser wasn't quitting. And the president remained on the receiving end of bipartisan criticism for his handling of the aftermath of the Charlottesville clashes.\n\nOn Thursday, he hit back hard -- against Republicans.\n\nHe accused \"publicity-seeking\" Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina of falsely stating Trump's position on the demonstrators and called Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake \"toxic\" and praised Flake's potential primary election opponent.\n\nGraham said Wednesday that Trump \"took a step backward by again suggesting there is moral equivalency\" between the marching white supremacists and the people who had been demonstrating against them. Flake has been increasingly critical of Trump in recent weeks.\n\nPressured by advisers, the president had softened his words on the dispute Monday, two days after he had enraged many by declining to single out the white supremacists and neo-Nazis whose demonstration against the removal of a Robert E. Lee statute had led to violence and the death of a counter-protester in Charlottesville.\n\nHe returned to his combative stance on Tuesday -- insisting anew during an unexpected and contentious news conference at Trump Tower that \"both sides\" were to blame.\n\nAides watching from the sidelines reacted with dismay and disbelief and privately told colleagues they were upset by the president's remarks, though not upset enough for anyone to resign.\n\nThe resignation speculation around Gary Cohn, head of the National Economic Council and a Jew, had grown so intense by Thursday that the White House released a statement saying reports that Cohn was stepping down were \"100 percent false.\"\n\nBut not all of Trump's aides were unhappy with his performance.\n\nAdviser Steve Bannon's job security in the White House has become tenuous -- Trump offered only a \"we'll see\" on Tuesday when asked if his chief strategist would remain in his post -- but Bannon has been telling allies that the president's news conference would electrify the GOP base.\n\nAnd in a pair of interviews Wednesday, Bannon cheered on the president's nationalist tendencies and suggested that a fight over Confederate monuments was a political fight he welcomes.\n\n\"The race-identity politics of the left wants to say it's all racist,\" Bannon told The New York Times. \"Just give me more. Tear down more statues. Say the revolution is coming. I can't get enough of it.\"", "id": "9788278", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Under fire _ from GOP _ Trump digs in on Confederate icons", "image":

(AP) - With prominent Republicans openly questioning his competence and moral leadership, President Donald Trump on Thursday burrowed deeper into the racially charged debate over Confederate memorials and lashed out at members of his own party in the latest controversy to engulf his presidency.\n\nOut of sight, but still online, Trump tweeted his defense of monuments to Confederate icons - bemoaning rising efforts to remove them as an attack on America's \"history and culture.\"\n\nAnd he berated his critics who, with increasingly sharper language, have denounced his initially slow and then ultimately combative comments on the racial violence at a white supremacist rally last weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nTrump was much quicker Thursday to condemn violence in Barcelona, where more than a dozen people were killed when a van veered onto a sidewalk and sped down a busy pedestrian zone in what authorities called a terror attack.\n\nHe then added to his expression of support a tweet reviving a debunked legend about a U.S. general subduing Muslim rebels a century ago in the Philippines by shooting them with bullets dipped in pig blood.\n\n\"Study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught. There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\" Trump wrote.\n\nTrump's unpredictable, defiant and, critics claim, racially provocative behavior has clearly begun to wear on his Republican allies.\n\nTennessee Sen. Bob Corker, whom Trump considered for a Cabinet post, declared Thursday that \"the president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to\" in dealing with crises. And Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska tweeted, \"Anything less than complete & unambiguous condemnation of white supremacists, neo-Nazis and the KKK by the @POTUS is unacceptable. Period.\"\n\nSen. Tim Scott of South Carolina said Trump's \"moral authority is compromised.\"\n\nTrump, who is known to try to change the focus of news coverage with an attention-grabbing declaration, sought to shift Thursday from the white supremacists to the future of statues.\n\n\"You can't change history, but you can learn from it,\" he tweeted. \"Robert E. Lee. Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish. ...\n\n\"Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" he tweeted.\n\nTrump met separately Thursday at his golf club in nearby Bedminster with the administrator of the Small Business Administration and Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a longtime Trump supporter. Trump also prepared for an unusual meeting Friday at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland with his national security team to discuss strategy for South Asia, including India, Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\nVice President Mike Pence was cutting short a long-planned Latin America tour to attend the meeting.\n\nThough out of public view, Trump sought to make his voice heard on Twitter as he found himself increasingly under siege and alone while fanning the controversy over race and politics toward a full-fledged national conflagration.\n\nHe dissolved two business councils Wednesday after the CEO members began quitting, damaging his central campaign promise to be a business-savvy chief executive in the Oval Office.\n\nMeanwhile, rumblings of discontent from his staff grew so loud that the White House had to release a statement saying that Trump's chief economic adviser wasn't quitting. And the president remained on the receiving end of bipartisan criticism for his handling of the aftermath of the Charlottesville clashes.\n\nOn Thursday, he hit back hard - against Republicans.\n\nHe accused \"publicity-seeking\" Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina of falsely stating Trump's position on the demonstrators and called Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake \"toxic\" and praised Flake's potential primary election opponent.\n\nGraham said Wednesday that Trump \"took a step backward by again suggesting there is moral equivalency\" between the marching white supremacists and the people who had been demonstrating against them. Flake has been increasingly critical of Trump in recent weeks.\n\nPressured by advisers, the president had softened his words on the dispute Monday, two days after he had enraged many by declining to single out the white supremacists and neo-Nazis whose demonstration against the removal of a Robert E. Lee statute had led to violence and the death of a counter-protester in Charlottesville.\n\nHe returned to his combative stance on Tuesday - insisting anew during an unexpected and contentious news conference at Trump Tower that \"both sides\" were to blame.\n\nAides watching from the sidelines reacted with dismay and disbelief and privately told colleagues they were upset by the president's remarks, though not upset enough for anyone to resign.\n\nThe resignation speculation around Gary Cohn, head of the National Economic Council and a Jew, had grown so intense by Thursday that the White House released a statement saying reports that Cohn was stepping down were \"100 percent false.\"\n\nBut not all of Trump's aides were unhappy with his performance.\n\nAdviser Steve Bannon's job security in the White House has become tenuous - Trump offered only a \"we'll see\" on Tuesday when asked if his chief strategist would remain in his post - but Bannon has been telling allies that the president's news conference would electrify the GOP base.\n\nAnd in a pair of interviews Wednesday, Bannon cheered on the president's nationalist tendencies and suggested that a fight over Confederate monuments was a political fight he welcomes.\n\n\"The race-identity politics of the left wants to say it's all racist,\" Bannon told The New York Times. \"Just give me more. Tear down more statues. Say the revolution is coming. I can't get enough of it.\"\n\n___\n\nLemire reported from New York.

Bannon's death might be greatly exaggerated. President Trump's wholehearted embrace of Confederate monuments as a new wedge issue underscores how much juice the White House's chief strategist still has. Bannon has been in the doghouse, and Trump resents how much credit he's gotten for his victory last November. But even if he loses his government job, which is still a possibility, the former chairman of Breitbart News's brand of populism and scorched-earth tactics will continue to heavily influence Trump's approach to governing.\n\nTrump's sudden decision to become the leading cheerleader for preserving Confederate memorials is a strategic political maneuver designed to change the terms of the post-Charlottesville conversation. There's vastly more public support, especially among Republicans, for preserving monuments than for the false moral equivalencies Trump espoused earlier in the week. It's also a distraction from the failure to follow through on his biggest promises and the mounting Russia investigations.\n\n-- Bannon welcomes a fight with Democrats over Confederate monuments because he sees it as a fight Trump can win.\n\n\"President Trump, by asking, 'Where does this all end' -- Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln -- connects with the American people about their history, culture and traditions,\" he told the New York Times. \"The race-identity politics of the left wants to say it's all racist. Just give me more. Tear down more statues. Say the revolution is coming. I can't get enough of it.\"\n\n\"The Democrats, the longer they talk about identity politics, I got 'em,\" Bannon added in a separate interview with the liberal American Prospect. \"I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\"\n\nBannon, described in 2011 by the late Andrew Breitbart as \"the Leni Riefenstahl of the Tea Party movement,\" argues that Democrats do not understand Trump and continue to underestimate his appeal. \"This past election, the Democrats used every personal attack, including charges of racism, against President Trump,\" Bannon wrote in an email to The Post's Robert Costa last night. \"He then won a landslide victory on a straightforward platform of economic nationalism. As long as the Democrats fail to understand this, they will continue to lose. But leftist elites do not value history, so why would they learn from history?\"\n\n-- One of the reasons Trump's move is so cynical is that, until very recently, he held another position: In 2015, Trump endorsed then-South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley's decision to remove a Confederate flag from the statehouse after the shooting in Charleston. \"I would take it down, yes,\" he said. \"I think they should put it in a museum and respect whatever it is you have to respect.\"\n\nBut Trump can never turn down a good wedge issue, if he's convinced it will gin up conservatives: In November 2012, Trump said Mitt Romney lost the election because he was too \"mean-spirited\" on immigration and toward Hispanics. \"He had a crazy policy of self-deportation, which was maniacal,\" Trump told Newsmax. \"It sounded as bad as it was, and he lost all of the Latino vote. ... He lost everybody who is inspired to come into this country.\" Just months later, though, Trump was convinced by his advisers that an especially hardline on Mexican immigration was crucial to win the GOP nomination. So he went vastly further than Romney ever did.\n\n-- \"On the right, Trump's political opponents have seen him benefit tremendously in moments of protest and conflict, when blame could be shifted to a violent left,\" Dave Weigel notes. \"The defining moment came on March 11, 2016, when Trump was scheduled to appear at the University of Illinois in Chicago. Protesters swarmed the room where he was supposed to speak, and the event was canceled, with images of cheering left-wing activists and brawling Trump supporters covered live on television. ... According to strategists with knowledge of internal polling, the mess in Chicago ... moved his numbers up, helping secure razor-thin victories in Missouri and North Carolina over (Ted) Cruz.\"\n\n-- In this vein, the Bannonites believe they are laying a trap that Democrats are unknowingly walking into. An NPR-PBS survey conducted earlier this week by Marist College found that 62 percent of Americans think statues honoring Confederate leaders should remain as a historical symbol. Only 27 percent said they should be removed because they are offensive to some people. Our Scott Clement flags that the survey found a large partisan divide: Republicans prefer to keep statues by 86 percent to 6 percent, while Democrats split 44 percent for keeping them and 47 percent for removing them.\n\nOther polling testifies to the deeper cultural resentments and anxieties that Trump is trying to tap into. A survey by PRRI earlier this year found that 48 percent of white working-class Americans agreed with the following statement: \"Things have changed so much that I often feel like a stranger in my own country.\" Seven in 10 believe the United States \"is in danger of losing its culture and identity.\" A feeling of cultural displacement was one of the strongest predictors of whether someone supported Trump in the 2016 election, stronger than any economic factor.\n\n-- Good morning from Palo Alto, Calif. I'm at Stanford University for a media roundtable at the Hoover Institution. On the flight out yesterday, I read Joshua Green's \"Devil's Bargain.\" The Bloomberg Businessweek reporter persuasively makes the case that Trump could not have won the presidency without the advice he got from Bannon over the years, even before he formally joined the campaign in August 2016. It's a good, quick read that shows how Bannon formed his worldview.\n\n-- Trump is reportedly frustrated by coverage of the book, which is high on bestseller lists, because he believes Bannon is trying to take credit that he does not deserve. \"It would certainly be ironic for the alt-right conscience of the White House to be dismissed at the moment of his triumph,\" Michael Gerson, a speechwriter for George W. Bush, notes in his column today. \"Now the operative question is not 'Should Bannon leave?' It has become: 'Why should anyone not named Bannon stay at the White House?'\"\n\n-- Trump's willingness to pick the fight over Confederate monuments may pay some short-term political dividends, but it could also cement the president's brand in a way that will make it harder long-term to win back suburban moderates who reluctantly backed him over Hillary Clinton.\n\n-- Consider these three magazine covers that will be on newsstands next week:\n\nMEANWHILE, MORE STATUES ARE COMING DOWN:\n\n-- \"Workers dismantled a 145-year-old statue of Supreme Court Justice Roger B. Taney outside the Maryland State House shortly after midnight Friday,\" Josh Hicks reports from Annapolis. \"Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) said his revulsion at what happened in Charlottesville ... prompted him to change his mind about the Taney statute and push for its removal, an act long sought by civil rights groups. The State House Trust board voted Wednesday to remove the memorial to Taney, a former chief justice who defended slavery in the court's 1857 Dred Scott decision. Taney's ruling said blacks, whether slaves or not, could never be U.S. citizens. Police blocked off the streets around the State House complex Thursday evening. A crane and two flatbed trucks arrived shortly after midnight, and a crew soon began the process of removing the memorial from its base, with more than two dozen bystanders looking on ... As the crane's arm started extending toward the monument shortly after 1 a.m., sprinklers erupted on the State House lawn, sending crew members scrambling and briefly disrupting their work, as though Taney was making a last stand atop his perch. After work resumed, the crane lifted the statue and maneuvered it to a flatbed truck, where the memorial was wrapped in a tarp and driven away around 2:20 a.m. Hogan's spokesman, Doug Mayer, said the monument would be placed in an undisclosed state storage facility. The perch remained on the lawn, covered by a wooden box.\"\n\n-- Eight people were charged for toppling a Confederate statue in Durham, N.C., as scores line up to confess. (Janell Ross)\n\n-- Authorities in Arizona are investigating two Confederate statues that were vandalized in recent days, including one dedicated to Jefferson Davis, which was tarred and feathered. (Arizona Republic)\n\n-- Paul Ryan said he will not intervene to remove Confederate statues from the Capitol. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) proposed legislation to remove at least a dozen statues of Confederate soldiers in the building. Each state gets to send whichever two statues it wants. A spokesman for the Speaker of the House said congressional Republicans will not remove any statues without the consent of the states. \"These are decisions for those states to make,\" said Ryan spokesman Doug Andres.\n\n-- The Post's local editor, Mike Semel, interviewed Robert E. Lee V, the great-great-grandson of Gen. Robert E. Lee, about why his family is happy to have monuments to their ancestor taken down. The D.C. resident is the longtime boys' athletic director at the Potomac School in McLean, Va. \"First and foremost, if it can avoid any days like this past Saturday in Charlottesville, then take them down today,\" he said. \"That's not what our family is at all interested in, and that's not what we think General Lee would want whatsoever. ... And maybe the second step is put these statues in some place where there is historical context, like a museum, and people can talk about the context. Put it in context of the 1860s and the 1800s, so people better understand the times they [Civil War figures] lived in.\" (Read the full Q&A here.)\n\n-- \"One of Europe's top tourist destinations shuddered under coordinated terrorist attacks when a van drove down Barcelona's iconic Las Ramblas promenade, killing at least 13 ... while police shot dead five men in car also attacking pedestrians several hours later outside the city,\" James McAuley, Michael Birnbaum and Paul Schemm report. The attacks were claimed by the Islamic State and are the worst to hit Spain in more than a decade. \"The Las Ramblas carnage and the killing by police of five suspects in the nearby seaside resort of Cambrils as they tried to mow down pedestrians in the early hours of the morning are connected, said Catalan region's top security official ... [A senior] Catalan police official told reporters that two men were arrested in connection with the attack, a Moroccan national and a Spanish citizen from the enclave of Melilla. The driver is still thought to be at large, he said. A third suspect was arrested in the northern Catalan town of Ripoli.\"\n\n\"It was around 1 a.m. on Friday that police responded to an attack near the boardwalk of the beach town of Cambrils ... where an Audi had plowed into a crowd. The police exchanged fire with the men in the car, killing four immediately while a fifth later died ... Six others, [including a police officer], were injured ... Amateur video [from the attack] showed several police cars speeding along what appeared to be a seafront boulevard as people screamed, followed by a brief volley of about 10 bullets. A second video showed three bodies on the ground in front of the town's yacht club. Authorities carried out controlled detonations of what they thought were explosive belts worn by the men, but turned out to be well made fakes.\"\n\n\"Whitney Cohn, a mathematics teacher from Montebello, N.Y., was walking along [Barcelona's Las Ramblas] with her husband and two daughters ... when the van came careening through the crowd, throwing people aside like dolls as screams pierced the air,\" the New York Times's Anne Sophie Bolon and James C. McKinley Jr. report: \"She grabbed her daughters and started running. 'It was flying,' Ms. Cohn said ... 'The van missed us by a sec.\"\n\n\"A national police official ... said at least three vans had been rented under [one suspect's] name,\" the Times reports. \"As night fell, the Barcelona police were frantically searching for the two other vans, combing the streets and underground parking garages ... [And] a counterterrorism expert, who was briefed on the details of the investigation, said late Thursday night that the police now believed the plot initially involved the use of explosives and a large truck. 'Part of the plan was they tried to rent a larger truck, but they didn't have the right permit and so they ended up getting' smaller vans, said the expert ...\"\n\n-- Trump, who waited two days to assign blame in the Charlottesville attack because he likes to \"have all the facts,\" responded to the terrorist attack in Barcelona by instructing his 36 million Twitter followers to study a highly discredited story about killing terrorists with bullets dipped in pigs' blood. \"Study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught,\" Trump said. \"There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\" \"The story has been found to be unsubstantiated by numerous fact-checkers in the media,\" David Nakamura reports: \"But Trump first told the story during a campaign rally in February 2016, as he defended his position of supporting methods of torture, such as waterboarding, on terrorist suspects. Trump also tweeted messages of support for the victims, in which he said the United States 'condemns the terror attack.'\" That stands in sharp contrast to Trump's reaction Saturday to the protests in Charlottesville.\n\n-- Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, yesterday questioned Trump's fundamental fitness for the job of president. \"The president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful,\" Corker told reporters in Tennessee. \"And we need for him to be successful.\" Trump, he added, \"recently has not demonstrated that he understands the character of this nation ... He has not demonstrated that he understands what has made this nation great and what it is today.\" \"I don't think that the president has appropriately spoken to the nation on this issue,\" he added, referring to language Trump has used about white supremacists. (Sean Sullivan)\n\n-- Trump attacked Sens. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) on Twitter yesterday after they expressed concern about his response to Charlottesville. David Nakamura and Ed O'Keefe report: \"Trump [called] Graham 'publicity-seeking' and Flake 'toxic' and endorsing a primary challenger to Flake in his reelection bid next year. Flake recently published a book that was highly critical of Trump. Trump [also] appeared to throw his support behind former Arizona state senator Kelli Ward, who is already mounting a primary challenge against Flake. ... In going after Graham, Trump suggested the senator, who also ran for president in 2016, was still smarting from his loss to Trump in the Republican primaries. ... Graham responded with a statement in which he said Trump's handling of the Charlottesville violence was being praised by 'some of the most racist and hate-filled individuals and groups in our country. For the sake of our Nation -- as our President -- please fix this. History is watching us all.'\"\n\n-- Democratic strategist J.B. Poersch, the president of Senate Majority PAC, would not rule out that his group may spend in the Arizona Senate GOP primary to boost Flake's primary challenger, Kelli Ward, next year. If Trump's favored candidate toppled Flake, Democrats might have a much better chance of picking up the seat. \"We're interested in winning, and we do what we need to in order to win,\" he said during an interview with The Washington Post's Sean Sullivan and McClatchy's Alex Roarty yesterday for C-SPAN's \"Newsmakers.\" The complete interview will air this weekend, but Sean emailed the highlights. \"That said,\" J.B. added, \"there's an awful lot that's going to have to play out in Arizona. I'm not even sure I can tell you who would be our best opponent right now.\"\n\n-- Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) continued to question Trump's \"moral authority,\" telling Vice News that he is not going to \"defend the indefensible.\" \"[Trump's] comments on Monday were strong,\" said the lone African American Republican senator. \"His comments on Tuesday started erasing the comments that were strong. What we want to see from our president is clarity and moral authority. And that moral authority is compromised when Tuesday happened.\"\n\n-- Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) tweeted yesterday: \"Anything less than complete & unambiguous condemnation of white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and the KKK by the @POTUS is unacceptable. Period.\"\n\n-- All of this is going to make it harder for Trump to put points on the board in the coming months, including an overhaul of the tax code. From Abby Phillip: \"Among Republicans in Washington, the spectacle seemed to confirm a growing feeling that Trump's presidency is unlikely to get on track, leaving the party's leaders in Congress feeling 'demoralized,' according to one Republican with close ties to GOP leadership.\"\n\nTRUMP'S INCREASING ISOLATION:\n\n-- Three giants canceled fundraising galas planned for Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club on Thursday -- signaling that the Charlottesville blowback may start to affect the president's bottom line. Drew Harwell and David Fahrenthold report: \"The American Cancer Society, a high-dollar client at the club since at least 2009, cited its 'values and commitment to diversity' in a statement on its decision to move an upcoming fundraising gala. Another longtime Mar-a-Lago customer, the Cleveland Clinic, abruptly changed course on its winter event only days after saying it planned to continue doing business at Mar-a-Lago ... The American Friends of Magen David Adom, which raises money for Israel's equivalent of the Red Cross, also said it would not hold its 2018 gala at the club 'after considerable deliberation' ... The charity had one of Mar-a-Lago's biggest events last season, with about 600 people in attendance. The cancellations will undoubtedly squeeze revenue for the private club ... where similar-size events have often brought in fees of between $100,000 and $275,000 each. But the Florida club may face an even deeper crisis of confidence from the local business community. The head of the Palm Beach Chamber of Commerce, of which Mar-a-Lago is a member, called the business 'morally reprehensible' on Thursday and said she expected more charities to defect. 'The glitter, the shine has gone from the club,' chamber executive director Laurel Baker said, 'and I can't help but think there will be more fallout from it.'\"\n\n-- Facing more corporate defections, the White House announced that it is disbanding the Presidential Advisory Council on Infrastructure. John Wagner reports: \"Two other outside corporate advisory groups were disbanded Wednesday after an exodus of business leaders upset with Trump's controversial statements ... Shortly after taking office in January, Trump tapped two Manhattan real estate developers, Richard LeFrak and Steven Roth, to head up a council aimed at guiding Trump's promised $1 trillion infusion into roads, bridges, airports and other aging infrastructure.\"\n\n-- 21st Century Fox CEO James Murdoch, Rupert's son, blasted Trump's response to Charlottesville in a note to employees last night and pledged a $1 million donation to the Anti-Defamation League. \"[W]hat we watched this last week in Charlottesville and the reaction to it by the President of the United States concern all of us as Americans and free people,\" Murdoch said. \"I can't even believe I have to write this: standing up to Nazis is essential; there are no good Nazis. Or Klansmen, or terrorists. Democrats, Republicans, and others must all agree on this, and it compromises nothing for them to do so.\" (Yahoo News's Sam Ro)\n\n-- Kevin Durant said that he has no plans to visit the White House to celebrate the Golden State Warriors' NBA championship if Trump invites the team, remarking on ESPN that he \"[doesn't] respect who's in office right now.\" Durant also said he doesn't suspect any of his team members would say yes to the invite either: \"If I know my guys well enough, they'll agree with me,\" he said. (Marissa Payne)\n\n-- The White House annnounced yesterday that Gary Cohn is not resigning from his position as National Economic Council chairman, an unusual clarification intended to reassure jittery markets. Damian Paletta and Renae Merle report: \"Cohn, who funded the Cohn Jewish Student Center at Kent State University in 2009, was mortified by Trump's comments ... and he has been bombarded with calls from friends asking him if he will leave. Instead, the White House said that Cohn plans to stay put ... It was unclear, though, how long Cohn would remain in the job or if he is still a leading candidate to be nominated as the next chairman of the Federal Reserve. Worries on Thursday that Cohn might join the exodus of business leaders ... helped send the Dow Jones industrial average down 274.14 points ... the largest sell-off in three months. Investors feared that the Trump administration might lose a leading architect of the president's economic agenda just as it approaches a critical juncture.\"\n\nTHE NEW WORLD ORDER:\n\n-- Jim Mattis and Rex Tillerson tried to clarify the Trump administration's policy on North Korea, reiterating during a news conference Thursday that America's focus is on applying diplomatic and economic pressure on the rogue nation. But they said the country is willing to use force if Pyongyang steps out of line. \"In close collaboration with our allies, there are strong military consequences if the DPRK initiates hostilities,\" the secretary of defense said. \"In the event of a missile launch towards the territory of Japan, Guam, the United States, [South] Korea, we would take immediate specific actions to take it down.\" Karen DeYoung writes that Mattis's remarks fell somewhere between Trump's bombast last week and White House chief strategist Steve Bannon's comments this week that North Korea is a \"sideshow\" for which there is \"no military solution.\" Tillerson declined to comment directly on Bannon's remarks, saying only: \"I think we have been quite clear as to what the policy and the posture towards North Korea is.\"\n\n2020 WATCH:\n\n-- \"Democrats are already preparing for a possible 2020 presidential bid by [Mike Pence], with a major group dedicating staff -- including on the ground in Indiana -- to dig up dirt on him, amid rumblings that Pence is positioning himself for a run,\" Buzzfeed News's Tarini Parti reports: \"American Bridge 21st Century -- a Democratic opposition super PAC and nonprofit funded by liberal mega-donors -- is leading the effort, which started earlier this summer ... The group, which will simultaneously continue its focus on targeting Trump, has three staffers dedicated to Pence more than three years before the 2020 election. Through a [FOIA] request, American Bridge has a document signed by Pence that holds him responsible for 'Transition Procedures, Identification of Transition Contacts, and Access to Non-public Government and Transition Information.' Because former national security adviser Michael Flynn's contacts with Russian officials during this period are under investigation, the group is seeking to connect Pence, who was in charge of the transition, to the Russia probe.\"\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:\n\nThe debate over Confederate monuments continued on Twitter. From Slate's chief political correspondent:\n\nOthers thought of some fun relocation spots for those monuments:\n\nThis message from Johnny Cash's family was widely shared:\n\nThe Obamas offered their condolences following the Barcelona attack:\n\n-- New York Times, \"A 2:15 Alarm, 2 Trains and a Bus Get Her to Work by 7 A.M.,\" by Conor Dougherty and Andrew Burton: \"Like many in the housing-starved San Francisco region, Sheila James has moved far inland, gaining affordable space at the price of a brutal commute.\"\n\n-- New York Times, \"As Vehicle Attacks Rise, an Ordinary Object Becomes an Instrument of Fear,\" by Amanda Taub: \"If anything -- even something as ubiquitous as a car -- can be a weapon, that adds a sense of menace to daily urban life. Years of research has found that fear can eventually divide and poison societies, hardening people against perceived outsiders, even causing them to abandon key values. This kind of attack, using one of the most ordinary objects of daily life, could heighten that effect. [Political scientists], for instance, have found that when people who are usually open and trusting toward outsiders feel they are at risk of a terrorist attack, they become more likely to support harsh, authoritarian policies and more willing to sacrifice civil liberties in exchange for perceived safety. By twisting the purpose of a commonplace machine, attacks like the one in Barcelona create a sense that public life is tinged with inescapable danger. It does not take any special skills or resources to obtain a van and drive it into a crowd of innocent people. All it takes is motivation.\"\n\n-- TGIF! It's going to be another day of muggy weather and possible PM storms on the horizon, per today's Capital Weather Gang forecast: \"It's August and the reemergence of a hot and humid pattern may feel familiar. Near-90 to low-90s look probable by mid-to-late afternoon, right around the same time showers and storms should start to develop. As we head into evening, a period of strong to severe storms, with heavy downpours and gusty winds are possible at times. Some flooding could pop up in spots if storms linger.\"\n\n-- The Nationals beat the Padres, 2-1.\n\n-- A former bank vice president in Virginia pleaded guilty Thursday to wire fraud, bank fraud, and aggravated identity theft, after he was accused of using his job to forge documents, falsify signatures, and approve loans that did not meet the bank's lending criteria. Officials say his actions led to more than $3 million in losses. (Rachel Weiner)\n\n-- \"Republican Ed Gillespie has been fighting to keep the focus of his campaign for Virginia governor on state issues and away from [Trump],\" Fenit Nirappil reports. \"That task grew more challenging this week after Trump defended some of the white nationalists who marched in Charlottesville and bashed efforts to remove Confederate statues -- directly injecting national politics into the Virginia governor's race. While Trump is highly unpopular in Virginia, and lost the state by five points to [Clinton] ... Gillespie needs support from some Trump voters in November if he is to beat Democrat Ralph Northam, who has a slight lead on Gillespie in recent polls. 'Gillespie seems to be faced with one hurdle after another that Trump is actually placing in front of him in Virginia,' said Bob Holsworth, a retired Virginia Commonwealth University professor ... 'In each of these hurdles, he is trying not to directly criticize Trump, but to significantly distance himself in some fashion from Trump. That's quite a tightrope to walk.'\"\n\nVIDEOS OF THE DAY:\n\nTina Fey, a UVa. alumna, says instead of fighting with neo-Nazis, Americans should stuff their faces with sheet cake:\n\nTrump calls Obama

The Confederate flag is one of the six mentioned in the park's name.\n\nThe debate over Civil War-related statues and memorials to the Confederacy has grown tense in the wake of recent violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, that centered around a white nationalist rally. Clashes between between people protesting the planned removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee and counter-protestors left one woman dead and dozens of people injured.\n\nThe amusement park flies the first official flag of the Confederacy, called the \"Stars and Bars,\" over the the park's entrance. The flag, which represents the Confederate States of America, is displayed alongside flags from the five different nations that have governed Texas: Spain, France, Mexico, the Republic of Texas (a sovereign country that existed in North America from March 2, 1836, to Feb. 19, 1846) and the United States of America.\n\n\"Six Flags Over Texas continues to fly the Confederate States of America Flag and does not fly or sell any variation of the Confederate Battle Flag,\" Sharon Parker, a Six Flags spokeswoman, told Chron.com.\n\nThe company's logo has also featured all six of the flags.\n\nReminders of the Confederacy, where slavery played a large role, are still widespread in portions of the South. A number of states annually commemorate those who died during the Civil War as part of the Confederacy with Confederate Memorial Day events.\n\nSupporters of such celebrations and monuments say they preserve history and memorialize the dead. Critics argue the icons promote racism by honoring those who fought to uphold slavery.\n\nThe debate became particularly heated after June 17, 2015, when nine black parishioners were fatally shot by a white supremacist in a South Carolina church. South Carolina removed the Confederate flag from its statehouse grounds following the killings. The city of New Orleans began removing four Confederate monuments in April.\n\nThe events in Charlottesville inflamed the debate, prompting some cities - like Baltimore, Maryland, and Gainesville, Florida - to remove their Confederate-era icons.\n\nOn Thursday, President Donald Trump again weighed in on the issue, defending the Confederate-era monuments and saying the removal of \"our beautiful statutes and monuments\" has torn apart the nation's history and culture.\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" Trump tweeted. \"You can't change history, but you can learn from it.

But in controversial unscripted remarks this week, Trump claimed \"leftists\" were trying to rewrite history by destroying monuments.\n\n\"This week it's Robert E. Lee. I notice that Stonewall Jackson is coming down,\" he said on Tuesday, referring to the top two generals of the Confederacy in the Civil War. \"I wonder,\" he continued, \"is it George Washington next week? And is it Thomas Jefferson the week after. You really do have to ask yourself, where does it stop?\"\n\nThe president was speaking off-the-cuff in response to reporters' questions about the racially charged violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Saturday.\n\nHe doubled down on that sentiment on Thursday with a series of tweets, saying \"the history and culture of our great country\" are being \"ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments.\"\n\nSad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments. You.....\n\n-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 17, 2017\n\nHis sentiment has strong echoes in the rhetoric of white supremacist groups, and even some more moderate conservative groups, about the need to defend \"heritage\" against what they see as an attempt to erase or rewrite history. It fits those groups' narrative about the demographic and cultural displacement of \"white\" Americans.\n\nCalls for the demolition of Confederate cemeteries and memorials to their war dead, and criticisms of Thomas Jefferson and other prominent slave owners from the early days of the republic, have created unease among some whites, an unease that white supremacist, neo-Nazi and white nationalist groups appear to be attempting to exploit as a galvanizing issue to win funding and recruits.\n\nA CBS poll released Thursday says 67 percent of Republicans approve of the president's response to Charlottesville.\n\nOn the other side of the issue, an effort is underway in towns and cities across the South to remove statues and monuments commemorating Confederate leaders and soldiers. The argument is that these are symbols of white supremacy erected in the era of Jim Crow and segregation, from the 1890s into the 1950s.\n\nSo how is a nation supposed to memorialize a divided and controversial history? Well, America is not alone in this and plenty of models exist.\n\nOne person who has given this issue a lot of thought is Laurent Dubois, professor of history at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. On Wednesday, he tweeted out this thought:\n\n1. Monuments are the public embodiment of social values, and have to be reconsidered and transformed as society changes\n\n-- Laurent Dubois (@Soccerpolitics) August 16, 2017\n\nDubois went on to suggest Americans leave the empty pedestals there and develop historical panels explaining their history as monuments. Alongside them, he suggests, Americans could place panels with photographs recounting how and why they came down.\n\nIn that way, he says, \"you'd actually get a sense of the dynamism of history, and the fact that monuments are about public declaration of values.\"\n\nHe cites as an example, a statue in the Caribbean island of Martinique of Empress Josephine, wife and lover of Napoleon Bonaparte. She was also a member of a family that grew wealthy on the backs of slaves working sugar plantations in the French colony. Napoleon ordered a brutal campaign to reconquer the island and reintroduce slavery. He and his local wife were therefore celebrated by the white ruling elite there.\n\nIn the 1980s, independence activists decapitated the statue and painted it with blood, as though it had been guillotined. Rather than replace the head, the local community decided to leave it as it was, as a way to reinterpret history.\n\n\"In the middle of the town square,\" Dubois says, \"you have a monument that's been transformed by activists, and that Martiniquans now see as their monument, as they've reclaimed it in a certain way.\"\n\nRelated: Three ways the Trump administration has downplayed white supremacy\n\n\"A monument always has to do with three different historical moments,\" he says. \"It's a reference to a particular moment in the past. It's also a representation of the moment when it was built ... and then we in the present have to think about these monuments and what they mean today, and whether they fit with our values as a society.\"\n\n\"It's also the case,\" Dubois adds, \"that we need to cultivate and expand a broader historical memory. So the history of slavery itself -- the history of abolitionists, the history of how slavery was destroyed, the history of the enslaved people who fought against slavery -- all those are things that could be much better known and much more present in our public spaces.\"\n\n\"One solution is to think about that ... both the removal of some monuments, but also what kinds of public art, what kinds of public recognition of history do we want to foreground?\" he says. \"And there are lots and lots of Americans that have fought for justice and equality, who fought against slavery, who could be acknowledged and could be celebrated.\"\n\nDubois is less comfortable with calls for removing grave markers and memorials to the Confederate war dead. \"Graves are generally considered a really different situation, obviously, just because of the sacredness that people have around graveyards,\" he says. \"But of course monuments to the dead are kind of in-between.\"\n\nHe points out that there are monuments to the dead in Germany from World War II, despite that nation's absolute repudiation of Nazism and Nazi symbols. \"Those kinds of questions are really, really complicated,\" he says.", "id": "9793650", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "What to do with America's Confederate statues and monuments", "image": null, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 1070, "date":

Cooper offered justification for why the monument honoring Presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, and Teddy Roosevelt should be destroyed. In \"Let's Blow up Mount Rushmore\", Cooper writes \"Donald Trump says removing confederate statues is a slippery slope that could get out of control. Maybe he's right -- would that be such a bad thing?\"\n\nSad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments. You..... -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\nCooper wrote that President Trump \"painted a picture of a slippery slope where those fighting for the removal of Confederate statues today might be destroying tributes to more mainstream slave-owning icons like George Washington tomorrow.\" He noted that Trump lamented that \"the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\n...can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish! Also... -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\nHe wrote that both Jefferson and Washington were \"remarkable individuals who helped usurp British rule in America and...establish a new empire. But they also enslaved their fellow man, committing special kinds of inhumane acts that should never be confined to footnotes. Unfortunately, that is exactly how those troublesome truths are treated when you face the awesome grandeur of Rushmore, a monument so incredible it obscures the multifaceted nature of these old dudes, transmogrifying them from individuals with a capacity both for greatness and evil into pure American deities.\"\n\n...the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\nCooper admitted that he would not want Barack Obama similarly \"lionized with some sort of larger-than-life monument, either.\" He added that as \"great as the optics of Obama's presidency were, they seem to have done little to heal the wounds of racism in this nation or dismantle the institutional apparatuses that fuel injustice.\"\n\nHe wrote that those ideas and legacies of the past with which he is in disagreement should be destroyed: \"Let's take with us the righteous ideas and beliefs and leave everything else on the pyre.\"\n\nDemocrats Coca Cola was invented by John Pemberton a Confederate Lt Colonel during the Civil War. Are you going to stop drinking Coke too?\u1f602\u1f602 -- Elder Lansing (@ElderLansing)\n\nAugust 16, 2017\n\nWriting that Trump is \"basically justifying neo-Nazism, it seems unthinkable that we will ever see a day when there is a serious push to blow up Rushmore and other monuments like it. But if that moment ever arrives, I suspect I'd be onboard. Demystifying the historical figures of the past, pulling them off the great mountain top back down to Earth where they shat, farted, spit, pissed, fucked, raped, murdered, died, and rotted seems like important business for this country. As long as we allow those men to be cults of personality who exist beyond reproach, we're never going to be able to see them for all of their good and all of their evil.\"\n\nFormer Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich was interviewed on Fox News on Thursday. He likened the current push from the left to destroy Confederate monuments to similar destruction wrought by the Muslims terrorist groups such as ISIS and the Taliban. Speaking rhetorically, Gingrich said \"Maybe we need a Committee to Perfect American History. You could decide, for example, about Sen. Bob Byrd, a Democrat who was a member of the Ku Klux Klan. Should we erase all references to Bob Byrd? Former member of the Supreme Court Hugo Black was a member of the Ku Klux Klan. Should we erase all memory of Hugo Black?\" While he said that he understood the symbolism involved, he pointed out that there are \"huge problems\" for the nation to face, including a wave of shootings in Baltimore and Chicago. \"All of this is a lot of noise. It doesn't fix a single one of the underlying key problems that have trapped people in poverty and violence in America.\"", "id": "9773192", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Gingrich

Senator Bob Corker, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, questioned the president's \"stability,\" and Senator Tim Scott, the only black Republican in the Senate, declared Mr Trump's moral authority is \"compromised.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, Mr Trump made clear that he had no intention of stepping back from his assertions about the Charlottesville rally that have drawn widespread condemnation.\n\nIn three tweets, the president defended Civil War-era statues, using language very similar to that of white supremacists to argue the statues should remain in place.\n\nMr Trump said it would be \"foolish\" to remove statues of Robert E.

As the restive president ostensibly vacationed at his golf club in New Jersey, his unnerved aides were left to deal with the fallout from his tweets and verbal blasts in the days since Saturday, when white separatists provoked deadly violence in Charlottesville, Va.\n\nFor Trump, the challenge of governing has grown ever more daunting since he took office in January without the usual bounce of popularity for a new president. As his support has declined, he has relied more on his most ardent supporters, who generally are white, older, non-urban and deeply conservative.\n\nYet by his efforts to please the hard-right activists, the president is pushing mainstream supporters further away. Polls show his job approval rating below 40 percent, sometimes dipping into the low 30s, and they suggest his core support -- the people who say they will never abandon him -- amounts to about 1 in 4 Americans.\n\nThat base, together with some more moderate voters who hoped Trump would use his impulsiveness and business instincts to shake up Washington, allowed him to eke out a narrow Electoral College victory against an unpopular Hillary Clinton. But governing has been a struggle, diminishing Trump's leverage over congressional Republicans the more they fear his unpopularity will imperil their majorities.\n\nTrump struck back hard with his Twitter finger Thursday from early morning on, all but endorsing the Republican opponent of Jeff Flake, a GOP senator from Arizona who has criticized him, and assailing local efforts to remove monuments to Confederate heroes.\n\nAfter news broke of a terrorist attack in Barcelona, Spain, the president repeated a dubious myth he previously invoked on the campaign trail, to much criticism, about a general who used bullets coated in pigs' blood to execute insurgents in the Philippines in the early 20th century; to followers of Islam, pigs are impure.\n\n\"Study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught,\" Trump tweeted. \"There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\"\n\nTrump's quick condemnation of the Barcelona carnage as a terrorist attack, and his suggestion that Muslims were at fault, came before Spanish authorities had released conclusive information. As such, Trump's rapid response contrasted with his slowness in calling out the white supremacists in Charlottesville -- blame he rescinded on Tuesday, when he said \"both sides\" were culpable for violence there -- and contradicted his claim in that instance that he only comments on such incidents after all the facts are known.\n\nTrump still has not called the fatal attack in Charlottesville, in which a car driven by an alleged white supremacist plowed into a crowd, an act of terrorism.\n\nHis tweets extolling Confederate memorials on Thursday drew an explicit link to the threats many of his far-right followers see to the nation's cultural identity. Separately, his polarizing adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, egged on the escalating culture wars in rare public comments.\n\nAs Trump plans for a rally Tuesday in Arizona, the mayor of Phoenix has asked him to stay away in the interests of public safety, a perhaps unprecedented request to a sitting president.\n\nThe state is home to Flake, who has written a book critical of Trump, as well as fellow GOP Sen. John McCain, whom Trump also mocked this week, reigniting their long-running feud. The president tweeted praise for Republican Kelli Ward, a former Arizona state senator who plans to challenge Flake next year -- after recently suggesting that McCain step down given his cancer diagnosis so the governor could appoint her in his place.\n\nTrump has suggested he might pardon controversial former Sheriff Joe Arpaio, a vocal campaign supporter. Arpaio was recently convicted of ignoring a judge's order to halt his practice of racial profiling as part of immigration enforcement efforts when he was sheriff in Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix.\n\nWhile Trump's public approval has hovered near 40 percent, some of that support is soft. Republican pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson, looking at a range of recent polls, estimated his hardcore backing at about 1 in 4 Americans.\n\nIn a recent poll by CNN, for example, 24 percent of respondents said they trusted all or most of what they hear from the White House. A poll by ABC and The Washington Post found 24 percent saying Trump acts in a presidential manner. In a poll earlier this week from Monmouth University, 24 percent of respondents said they supported Trump and couldn't think of anything he could do that would change their minds.\n\nA poll by Marist College for National Public Radio and PBS, released Thursday, found that 27 percent of those surveyed approved of Trump's response to the violence in Charlottesville, and that 20 percent \"strongly approve\" of the job he is doing as president.\n\nTrump excited that base on Tuesday when he defended the monuments during a chaotic news conference, saying the memorials' future should be left to localities. But by redoubling his opposition to their removal on Thursday, the president is certain to roil the local debates.\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" Trump tweeted.\n\n\"You can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson -- who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish!\" he added.\n\nTrump's equation of Lee and Jackson, who took up arms for the South's secession, with founders George Washington and Thomas Jefferson echoed one of the major arguments that defenders of the Confederate monuments make.\n\nMonuments to leaders of the Confederacy were erected across the South, and in some other parts of the country, mostly starting in the early 20th century as whites fought to restrict black citizens' freedoms.\n\nTo African-Americans and many white Southerners, the statues have long been a symbol of racial oppression. In recent years, the movement to take them down, and in some cases to put them in museums, has gained momentum.\n\nThe argument for the monuments may be a better one for Trump than his emphasis in his other comments Tuesday defending the armed white supremacists in Charlottesville as no more to blame for the violence than those who marched against them.\n\nThis week's Marist Poll said that 62 percent of Americans would like to keep such symbols. It's uncertain whether Trump's association with the issue now will drag that support down given his personal unpopularity.\n\nBannon, who has pushed Trump to embrace cultural fights since joining his campaign last year, says it's a winning argument, especially if the debate draws the left away from offering an economic message.\n\n\"The race-identity politics of the left wants to say it's all racist,\" Bannon told The New York Times, speaking of the furor over the monuments. \"Just give me more. Tear down more statues. Say the revolution is coming. I can't get enough of it.\"\n\nBannon gave several rare interviews in recent days as his own job appears tenuous; Trump refused to rule out firing him earlier in the week. In the most surprising exchange, in the liberal publication American Prospect, Bannon derided many on the far right who protested in Charlottesville as losers, \"a fringe element\" and \"a collection of clowns,\" even as he welcomed their cultural warfare.\n\n(EDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE)\n\nBut the interview also provided further evidence of the rifts in the White House that have added to Trump's governing challenges. Bannon spoke openly about dispatching rivals in the administration, including in the Defense and State departments, who oppose his drive to confront China on trade. \"They're wetting themselves,\" he added.\n\nHe flatly contradicted Trump's strategy of tough talk in the face of North Korea's nuclear threat: \"There's no military solution, forget it.\"\n\nAnd he cast Gary Cohn, Trump's top economic adviser, along with \"Goldman Sachs lobbying,\" as forces aligned against his economic agenda.\n\nThe comments forced the White House and State Department to issue separate statements reinforcing that Cohn and Susan Thornton, an Asia policy official also singled out by Bannon, were both still in their jobs.\n\nPHOTOS (for help with images, contact 312-222-4194): BALTIMORE-CONFEDERATE-MONUMENTS",

Robert E. Lee in that Charlottesville, Va., park were put up long after the Civil War. The Lee statue, for example, was dedicated in 1924. They went up when slavery was banned but racism still pervaded the law and the culture in everything from segregation to criminal justice to suppression of voting rights.\n\nThose statues of proud Confederate heroes stood as daily reminders that the oppressors remained in charge.\n\nNow there can be legitimate debate about whether advancement of society is better served by removing these monuments to an ignoble cause or allowing them to remain. It's not only fair, but essential, for a community to decide what message a statue is sending before adding or removing one. The sickening scenes of torch-wielding white supremacists in Charlottesville chanting racist and anti-Semitic vitriol as they protested the Lee statue's impending removal demonstrated its potent symbolism to forces of hate.\n\nIt deserves to go.\n\nIt was shameful enough that the president proved unwilling or unable to forthrightly condemn white supremacists. He sank deeper into the muck of moral ambiguity Thursday with his defiant defense of Confederate monuments.\n\n\"The beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\" Trump tweeted.\n\nThey will not be missed.\n\nAs for his bogus argument that the movement will ultimately lead to monuments to Thomas Jefferson and George Washington: It is certainly true that some of our Founding Fathers owned slaves, and were imperfect humans. Yet they founded a nation with ideals that ultimately compelled Americans to recognize and rectify its original sin, and the discrimination it engenders, on the never-ending course to a more perfect union.\n\nTheir memorials should stand.\n\nThe Civil War was about advancing those ideals, and plenty of patriotic blood was spilled in their defense.\n\nMonuments against those ideals should not stand.", "id": "9830589", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Editorial: The see-no-evil president", "image": "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/64/55/27/13817328/3/rawImage.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "200134", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Law"}, "id": "302557", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"}, {"label": {"eng": "Human"}, "id": "302854", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"}, {"label": {"eng": "Racism"}, "id": "302940", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Culture"}, "id": "303325", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"}, {"label": {"eng": "Statue"}, "id": "303774", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue"}, {"label": {"eng": "Society"}, "id": "304273", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"}, {"label": {"eng": "Suffrage"}, "id": "305323", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffrage"}, {"label": {"eng": "George W.

Listen to the full interview.\n\n\"This week it's Robert E. Lee. I notice that Stonewall Jackson is coming down,\" he said on Tuesday, referring to the top two generals of the Confederacy in the Civil War. \"I wonder,\" he continued, \"is it George Washington next week? And is it Thomas Jefferson the week after. You really do have to ask yourself, where does it stop?\"\n\nThe president was speaking off-the-cuff in response to reporters' questions about the racially charged violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Saturday.\n\nHe doubled down on that sentiment on Thursday with a series of tweets, saying \"the history and culture of our great country\" are being \"ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments.\"\n\nSad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments. You.....\n\n-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 17, 2017\n\nHis sentiment has strong echoes in the rhetoric of white supremacist groups, and even some more moderate conservative groups, about the need to defend \"heritage\" against what they see as an attempt to erase or rewrite history. It fits those groups' narrative about the demographic and cultural displacement of \"white\" Americans.\n\nCalls for the demolition of Confederate cemeteries and memorials to their war dead, and criticisms of Thomas Jefferson and other prominent slave owners from the early days of the republic, have created unease among some whites, an unease that white supremacist, neo-Nazi and white nationalist groups appear to be attempting to exploit as a galvanizing issue to win funding and recruits.\n\nA CBS poll released Thursday says 67 percent of Republicans approve of the president's response to Charlottesville.\n\nOn the other side of the issue, an effort is underway in towns and cities across the South to remove statues and monuments commemorating Confederate leaders and soldiers. The argument is that these are symbols of white supremacy erected in the era of Jim Crow and segregation, from the 1890s into the 1950s.\n\nSo how is a nation supposed to memorialize a divided and controversial history? Well, America is not alone in this and plenty of models exist.\n\nOne person who has given this issue a lot of thought is Laurent Dubois, professor of history at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. On Wednesday, he tweeted out this thought:\n\n1. Monuments are the public embodiment of social values, and have to be reconsidered and transformed as society changes\n\n-- Laurent Dubois (@Soccerpolitics) August 16, 2017\n\nDubois went on to suggest Americans leave the empty pedestals there and develop historical panels explaining their history as monuments. Alongside them, he suggests, Americans could place panels with photographs recounting how and why they came down.\n\nIn that way, he says, \"you'd actually get a sense of the dynamism of history, and the fact that monuments are about public declaration of values.\"\n\nHe cites as an example, a statue in the Caribbean island of Martinique of Empress Josephine, wife and lover of Napoleon Bonaparte. She was also a member of a family that grew wealthy on the backs of slaves working sugar plantations in the French colony. Napoleon ordered a brutal campaign to reconquer the island and reintroduce slavery. He and his local wife were therefore celebrated by the white ruling elite there.\n\nIn the 1980s, independence activists decapitated the statue and painted it with blood, as though it had been guillotined. Rather than replace the head, the local community decided to leave it as it was, as a way to reinterpret history.\n\n\"In the middle of the town square,\" Dubois says, \"you have a monument that's been transformed by activists, and that Martiniquans now see as their monument, as they've reclaimed it in a certain way.\"\n\nRelated: Three ways the Trump administration has downplayed white supremacy\n\n\"A monument always has to do with three different historical moments,\" he says. \"It's a reference to a particular moment in the past. It's also a representation of the moment when it was built ... and then we in the present have to think about these monuments and what they mean today, and whether they fit with our values as a society.\"\n\n\"It's also the case,\" Dubois adds, \"that we need to cultivate and expand a broader historical memory. So the history of slavery itself -- the history of abolitionists, the history of how slavery was destroyed, the history of the enslaved people who fought against slavery -- all those are things that could be much better known and much more present in our public spaces.\"\n\n\"One solution is to think about that ... both the removal of some monuments, but also what kinds of public art, what kinds of public recognition of history do we want to foreground?\" he says. \"And there are lots and lots of Americans that have fought for justice and equality, who fought against slavery, who could be acknowledged and could be celebrated.\"\n\nDubois is less comfortable with calls for removing grave markers and memorials to the Confederate war dead. \"Graves are generally considered a really different situation, obviously, just because of the sacredness that people have around graveyards,\" he says. \"But of course monuments to the dead are kind of in-between.\"\n\nHe points out that there are monuments to the dead in Germany from World War II, despite that nation's absolute repudiation of Nazism and Nazi symbols. \"Those kinds of questions are really, really complicated,\" he says.", "id": "9789402", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "What to do with America's Confederate statues and monuments", "image":

As the restive president ostensibly vacationed at his golf club in New Jersey, his unnerved aides were left to deal with the fallout from his tweets and verbal blasts in the days since Saturday, when white separatists provoked deadly violence in Charlottesville, Va.\n\nFor Trump, the challenge of governing has grown ever more daunting since he took office in January without the usual bounce of popularity for a new president. As his support has declined, he has relied more on his most ardent supporters, who generally are white, older, nonurban and deeply conservative.\n\nYet by his efforts to please the hard-right activists, the president is pushing mainstream supporters further away. Polls show his job approval rating below 40%, sometimes dipping into the low 30s, and they suggest his core support -- the people who say they will never abandon him -- amounts to about 1 in 4 Americans.\n\nThat base, together with some more moderate voters who hoped Trump would use his impulsiveness and business instincts to shake up Washington, allowed him to eke out a narrow electoral college victory against an unpopular Hillary Clinton. But governing has been a struggle, diminishing Trump's leverage over congressional Republicans the more they fear his unpopularity will imperil their majorities.\n\nTrump struck back hard with his Twitter finger Thursday from early morning on, all but endorsing the Republican opponent of Jeff Flake, a GOP senator from Arizona who has criticized him, and assailing local efforts to remove monuments to Confederate heroes.\n\nAfter news broke of a terrorist attack in Barcelona, Spain, the president repeated a dubious myth he previously invoked on the campaign trail, to much criticism, about a general who used bullets coated in pigs' blood to execute insurgents in the Philippines in the early 20th century\u200b; to followers of Islam, pigs are impure.\n\n\"Study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught,\" Trump tweeted. \"There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\"\n\nTrump's quick condemnation of the Barcelona carnage as a terrorist attack, and his suggestion that Muslims were at fault, came before Spanish authorities had released conclusive information. As such, Trump's rapid response contrasted with his slowness in calling out the white supremacists in Charlottesville -- blame he rescinded on Tuesday, when he said \"both sides\" were culpable for violence there -- and contradicted his claim in that instance that he only comments on such incidents after all the facts are known.\n\nTrump still has not called the fatal attack in Charlottesville, in which a car driven by an alleged white supremacist plowed into a crowd, an act of terrorism.\n\nHis tweets extolling Confederate memorials on Thursday drew an explicit link to the threats many of his far-right followers see to the nation's cultural identity. Separately, his polarizing advisor, Stephen K. Bannon, egged on the escalating culture wars in rare public comments.\n\nAs Trump plans for a rally Tuesday in Arizona, the mayor of Phoenix has asked him to stay away in the interests of public safety, a perhaps unprecedented request to a sitting president.\n\nThe state is home to Flake, who has written a book critical of Trump, as well as fellow GOP Sen. John McCain, whom Trump also mocked this week, reigniting their long-running feud. The president tweeted praise for Republican Kelli Ward, a former Arizona state senator who plans to challenge Flake next year -- after recently suggesting that McCain step down given his cancer diagnosis so the governor could appoint her in his place.\n\nTrump has suggested he might pardon controversial former Sheriff Joe Arpaio, a vocal campaign supporter. Arpaio was recently convicted of ignoring a judge's order to halt his practice of racial profiling as part of immigration enforcement efforts when he was sheriff in Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix.\n\nWhile Trump's public approval has hovered near 40%, some of that support is soft. Republican pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson, looking at a range of recent polls, estimated his hardcore backing at about 1 in 4 Americans.\n\nIn a recent poll by CNN, for example, 24% of respondents said they trusted all or most of what they hear from the White House. A poll by ABC and the Washington Post found 24% saying Trump acts in a presidential manner. In a poll earlier this week from Monmouth University, 24% of respondents said they supported Trump and couldn't think of anything he could do that would change their minds.\n\nA poll by Marist College for National Public Radio and PBS, released Thursday, found that 27% approved of Trump's response to the violence in Charlottesville. The same poll found that 20% of those surveyed said they \"strongly approve\" of the job he is doing as president.\n\nTrump excited that base on Tuesday when he defended the monuments during a chaotic news conference, saying the memorials' future should be left to localities. But by redoubling his opposition to their removal on Thursday, the president is certain to roil the local debates.\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" Trump tweeted.\n\n\"You can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish!\" he added.\n\nTrump's equation of Lee and Jackson, who took up arms for the South's secession, with founders George Washington and Thomas Jefferson echoed one of the major arguments that defenders of the Confederate monuments make.\n\nMonuments to leaders of the Confederacy were erected across the South, and in some other parts of the country, mostly starting in the early 20th century as whites fought to restrict black citizens' freedoms.\n\nTo African Americans and many white Southerners, the statues have long been a symbol of racial oppression. In recent years, the movement to take them down, and in some cases to put them in museums, has gained momentum.\n\nThe argument for the monuments may be a better one for Trump than his emphasis in his other comments Tuesday defending the armed white supremacists in Charlottesville as no more to blame for the violence than those who marched against them.\n\nThis week's Marist Poll said that 62% of Americans would like to keep such symbols. It's uncertain whether Trump's association with the issue now will drag that support down given his personal unpopularity.\n\nBannon, who has pushed Trump to embrace cultural fights since joining his campaign last year, says it's a winning argument, especially if the debate draws the left away from offering an economic message.\n\n\"The race-identity politics of the left wants to say it's all racist,\" Bannon told the New York Times, speaking of the furor over the monuments. \"Just give me more. Tear down more statues. Say the revolution is coming. I can't get enough of it.\"\n\nBannon gave several rare interviews in recent days as his own job appears tenuous; Trump refused to rule out firing him earlier in the week. In the most startling exchange, in the liberal publication American Prospect, Bannon derided many on the far right who protested in Charlottesville as losers, \"a fringe element\" and \"a collection of clowns,\" even as he welcomed their cultural warfare.\n\nBut the interview also provided further evidence of the rifts in the White House that have added to Trump's governing challenges. Bannon spoke openly about dispatching rivals in the administration, including in the Defense and State departments, who oppose his drive to confront China on trade. \"They're wetting themselves,\" he added.\n\nHe flatly contradicted Trump's strategy of tough talk in the face of North Korea's nuclear threat: \"There's no military solution, forget it.\"\n\nAnd he cast Gary Cohn, Trump's top economic advisor, along with \"Goldman Sachs lobbying,\" as forces aligned against his economic agenda.\n\nThe comments forced the White House and State Department to issue separate statements reinforcing that Cohn and and Susan Thornton, an Asia policy official also singled out by Bannon, were both still in their jobs.\n\nnoah.bierman@latimes.com\n\nTwitter:

Some of the monuments have become rallying points for white nationalists.\n\nMr Trump also sharply criticised two fellow Republicans in the US Senate, Jeff Flake and Lindsey Graham, while denying he had spoken of \"moral equivalency\" between white supremacists, neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan, and anti-racism activists.\n\nSince taking office in January, Trump has periodically feuded with lawmakers in his own party. The latest spats could hinder his efforts to work with the Republican-controlled Congress on a legislative agenda that includes tax cuts and spending bills when lawmakers return next month from their summer break.", "id": "9799680", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Trump defends monuments to pro-slavery Confederacy", "image":

Lee in Charlottesville, Virginia, the NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll found that 62 per cent felt the statues should remain as historical symbols.\n\n\"Just 27 per cent said they should go,\" said NPR. And, in a striking breakdown, 44 per cent of African Americans agreed the statues should stay, against 40 per cent who said they should be removed.\n\nLocated mostly in south-eastern United States, there are some 1,500 symbols of the pro-slavery Confederacy which fought and lost a war to secede from 1861-65.

There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\" Trump tweeted.\n\nTrump's unpredictable, defiant and, critics claim, racially provocative behavior has clearly begun to wear on his Republican allies -- and also has upset the mother of Heather Heyer, the young woman killed in the Charlottesville violence.\n\nHeyer's mother, Susan Bro, told ABC's \"Good Morning America\" on Friday that she initially missed the first few calls to her from the White House. But she said \"now I will not\" talk to the president after a news conference in which Trump equated violence by white supremacists at the rally with violence by those protesting the rally.\n\nHeyer was killed when a driver rammed a car into a crowd of demonstrators protesting the white nationalists.\n\nTrump found no comfort in his own party, either. Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, whom Trump had considered for a Cabinet post, declared Thursday that \"the president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to\" in dealing with crises. And Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska tweeted, \"Anything less than complete & unambiguous condemnation of white supremacists, neo-Nazis and the KKK by the @POTUS is unacceptable. Period.\"\n\nSen. Tim Scott of South Carolina said Trump's \"moral authority is compromised.\"\n\nTrump, who is known to try to change the focus of news coverage with an attention-grabbing declaration, sought to shift Thursday from the white supremacists to the future of statues.\n\n\"You can't change history, but you can learn from it,\" he tweeted. \"Robert E. Lee. Stonewall Jackson -- who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish. ...\n\n\"Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" he tweeted.\n\nTrump met separately Thursday at his golf club in nearby Bedminster with the administrator of the Small Business Administration and Florida Gov. Rick Scott. Trump also prepared for an unusual meeting Friday at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland with his national security team to discuss strategy for South Asia, including India, Pakistan and the way forward in Afghanistan.\n\nVice President Mike Pence cut short a long-planned Latin America tour to attend.\n\nBefore the trip to Camp David, Trump tweeted Friday morning that \"Radical Islamic Terrorism must be stopped by whatever means necessary!\" In a separate tweet, he added that the Department of Homeland Security and law enforcement are \"on alert & closely watching for any sign of trouble.\"\n\nThough out of public view for two consecutive days, Trump sought to make his voice heard on Twitter as he found himself increasingly under siege and alone while fanning the controversy over race and politics toward a full-fledged national conflagration.\n\nHe dissolved two business councils Wednesday after the CEO members began quitting, damaging his central campaign promise to be a business-savvy chief executive in the Oval Office.\n\nAnd the White House said Thursday that it was abandoning plans to form an infrastructure advisory council.\n\nTwo major charities, the Cleveland Clinic and the American Cancer Society, announced they are canceling fundraisers scheduled for Trump's resort in Palm Beach, Fla., amid the continuing backlash over Trump's remarks.\n\nAnd the CEO of 21st Century Fox, James Murdoch, has denounced racism and terrorists while expressing concern over Trump's statements.\n\nMurdoch writes that the event in Charlottesville and Trump's response is a concern for all people. \"I can't believe I have to write this: standing up to Nazis is essential; there are no good Nazis. Or Klansmen, or terrorists.\"\n\nMurdoch is the son of the company's co-executive chairman, Rupert Murdoch, a Trump confidant.\n\nMeanwhile, rumblings of discontent from Trump's staff grew so loud that the White House was forced to release a statement saying that Trump's chief economic adviser wasn't quitting. And the president remained on the receiving end of bipartisan criticism for his handling of the aftermath of the Charlottesville clashes.\n\nOn Thursday, he hit back hard -- against Republicans.\n\nHe accused \"publicity-seeking\" Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina of falsely stating Trump's position on the demonstrators. He called Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake \"toxic\" and praised Flake's potential primary election opponent.\n\nGraham said Wednesday that Trump \"took a step backward by again suggesting there is moral equivalency\" between the marching white supremacists and the people who had been demonstrating against them. Flake has been increasingly critical of Trump in recent weeks.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label":

The plans were submitted last October, and Thursday's report represents Ofwat's draft view, with a final decision scheduled for December.\n\nCustomers of struggling Thames Water will face a 22% increase in their bills over the next five years after the industry regulator limited a larger rise proposed by the company.\n\nRelated: Debt, sewage and dividends: the rising tide of Thames Water's troubles\n\nOfwat said Thames would be allowed to increase bills by \u00a399 to \u00a3535, \u00a392 less than the company had proposed. Thames had asked the regulator to raise bills by 44% over the next five years.\n\nThe biggest bill increase Ofwat allowed were from Southern Water, with a \u00a3183 rise to \u00a3603, D\u0175r Cymru in Wales, which will increase bills by \u00a3137 to \u00a3603, and Hafren Dyfrdwy, rising by \u00a3128 to \u00a3524. Southern and Thames will be allowed to add a further \u00a316 and \u00a35 to bills respectively if their plans meet certain criteria with Ofwat.\n\nBills will rise for customers of all water companies in England and Wales, apart from those of Wessex Water and Sutton and East Surrey Water.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats' environment spokesperson, Tim Farron, said: \"Any insulting price hikes by water companies must be blocked. It is a national scandal that these disgraced firms are demanding more money from families and pensioners in a cost of living crisis, all while dumping raw sewage into our rivers.\"\n\nMike Keil, the chief executive of the Consumer Council for Water, said: \"Millions of people will feel upset and anxious at the prospect of these water bill rises and question the fairness of them, given some water companies' track record of failure and poor service.\"\n\nWater companies have been criticised for asking customers to pay for a \u00a396bn investment programme to stop raw sewage dumping, build new reservoirs and reduce leaks.\n\nCampaigners for clean water argue that customers should not be paying for infrastructure investment that should have already been carried out to comply with companies' operational permits.\n\nWater companies, including Thames, have faced sustained criticism over leaky pipes, sewage dumping and extracted dividends.\n\nThe government said the environment secretary, Steve Reed, would meet water industry bosses on Thursday to \"make clear that under this government water companies will be answerable for their performance\".\n\nReed has written to them to ask for investment funding to be ringfenced, to put \"customers and the environment at the heart of their objectives\" and strengthen compensation rules when water supplies are interrupted. \"We will never look the other way while water companies pump sewage into our rivers, lakes and seas,\" he said.\n\nThe regulator said companies would invest \u00a310bn to tackle storm overflows with a target to reduce spills by 44% from levels in 2021. A string of new environmental targets will be introduced, including tasking companies in England to spills to 16 incidents a year by 2029.\n\nThe price review is seen as crucial for the future of Thames Water, which is creaking under \u00a315.2bn of debt. The company said this week that, after the review, it would approach potential investors this autumn, before Ofwat's final verdict in December.\n\nOfwat said given Thames' performance, it would impose a \"turnaround oversight regime\", meaning the company must regularly report on the progress of its investment plan and provide a \"financial resilience plan\" after Thursday's draft review.\n\nIn order to exit the regime, the company could be limited in the amount of debt it can take on, separate the business into two or more companies or list the business on the stock exchange to secure extra equity.\n\nIt revised an original \u00a318.7bn spending plan submitted in October 2023 up to \u00a319.8bn. Ofwat said on Thursday that it would be allowed to spend \u00a316.9bn. Within that, more than \u00a33bn is contingent on Thames proving it is \"ready and able\" to make the investments.\n\nAn important figure for water companies is the allowed rate of return, which has been set at 3.72%, below the 4.25% Thames had hoped for.", "source": {"uri": "uk.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Ofwat is also considering appointing a so-called independent monitor, which would have \"full access\" to the company's financial information, to report on its progress.\n\nThames will also have to provide a \"delivery action plan\", outlining how it intends to improve its performance on sewage spills and leakage, which has been among the worst in the industry in recent years.\n\nWater companies had requested increases averaging \u00a3144 over five years, but this too has been rejected by Ofwat, who have instead proposed that bills increase by an average of \u00a319 per year over the next five years. The 21% bill increase is a third less than what was requested by the companies.\n\nThe firms wanted to increase their total spending by \u00a329bn but Ofwat said its scrutiny of companies' cost proposals, to ensure they deliver efficiently, had led to a \u00a316bn reduction.\n\nA spokesperson for Water UK said Ofwat's decision means it \"will be repeating the mistakes of the past\". They said it amounted to \"the biggest ever cut in investment by Ofwat\".\n\nThe spokesperson added: \"For far too long, Ofwat has failed to be realistic about the levels of investment needed and what it will take to deliver and maintain necessary infrastructure...\n\n\"Water companies are ready to invest in an unprecedented overhaul of the country's water and sewage infrastructure. Ofwat now needs to let them get on with it.\"\n\nThames Water has 16 million customers in London and the Thames Valley region in the South East. Its plans - now rejected - would've seen spending rise to \u00a319.8bn to update its infrastructure and reduce sewage spills. However, that would've also involved increasing customer bills by 44%.\n\nSouthern Water have already announced a 9% rise this year, adding an extra \u00a340 per year to customer bills. They blamed the increase on inflation and increased costs for energy, fuel and raw materials. However, they want a 91% increase in bills to \u00a3915 a year by 2030.\n\nThe chart below shows the average increase - or decrease - of customers' water bills in percentage terms.\n\nThe data below shows the draft proposals for the average bills customers will be charged by water and wastewater companies in England and Wales by 2029/30. The average bill for 2024/25 is also listed, along with the increase or decrease between the two figures:\n\nWater firms say they need to increase bills due to the need to spend money on replacing infrastructure. Increases will fund \u00a3100bn of spending over the period, which will include replacing ageing, leaking pipes and reducing sewage discharges into rivers and seas.\n\nHowever, the increases would come off the back of disastrous recent environmental records that sparked a nationwide scandal over pollution. Thames said pollution incidents increased to 350, up on 331 last year, which it blamed on a rainier-than-expected year. They say the number of \"serious pollutions\" decreased by 18%.\n\nAccording to Environment Agency data, 2023 was the worst year for sewage spills since records began. Sewage was discharged for some 3.6 million hours across England - a 105% increase from 1.7 million hours in 2022.\n\nWhat may be particularly galling for customers is that while water firms have generally been profitable, their profits have been put into dividends for shareholders rather than investing in improvements. In May, Severn Trent hiked its dividend to shareholders after profits rose by a fifth last year, despite sewage spills by the company rising by a third in 2023. With increased sewage spills, the firms are now asking the taxpayer to help bail them out of their financial difficulties.\n\nThe bill rises also come in the wake of huge bonus payouts for water firm bosses. Liv Garfield, chief executive of Severn Trent received a \u00a33.2m pay packet for 2023, which includes salary, bonuses and shares. Over the past four years she has earned nearly \u00a313m.\n\nLast month Susan Davy, the chief executive of Pennon - which owns South West Water - saw her pay package jump 58% after picking up a \u00a3298,000 shares bonus despite seeing pollution incidents nearly double at the firm last year.\n\nDespite the controversy, Water UK chief executive David Henderson defended asking customers to pay for what he described as \"important\" investment in the water network.\n\nWhen asked how water companies can justify rising bills on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the head of the trade association for the water industry, said: \"We need to increase our water supply and if we don't make these investments we won't get it. Unfortunately the investment will paid for up front by the shareholders of the companies and then slowly recouped over time.\"\n\nLabour has already ruled out nationalising the water industry. In their manifesto, published during the general election campaign, the party said they want to end water companies \"self-monitoring\".\n\nLabour has said it will pursue criminal charges against water company executives responsible for persistent pollution. It also said in its manifesto that regulators would be given new powers to block bonuses against executives who pollute waterways.\n\nPrime minister Keir Starmer's official spokesman told reporters on Monday: \"The government has said in its manifesto that we will put failing water companies into special measures and they will have no choice but to clean up their act. We talked about giving regulators the power to block payment of bonuses to executives who pollute our waterways and impose automatic and severe fines on them for wrongdoing.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofwat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ofwat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Water", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thames Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sewage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Thames", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "River Thames"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_UK", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Water UK"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Water", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southern Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severn_Trent", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Severn Trent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thames Valley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wastewater", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wastewater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England and Wales"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_United_Kingdom_general_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2010 United Kingdom general election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_West_Water", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South West Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trade association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Water industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Environment Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nationalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifesto", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manifesto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Today_(BBC_Radio_4)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Today (BBC Radio 4)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Water supply"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/kRbImQ2nFc9_j0niSdlRnw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03OTk7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-07/66ec93f0-3e9e-11ef-bd7a-fe57ed32c0ef", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717113", "eventUri": "eng-9717113", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

Our draft decisions on company plans approve a tripling of investment to make sustained improvement to customer service and the environment at a fair price for customers.\n\n'These proposals aim to deliver a 44% reduction in spills from storm overflows compared to levels in 2021. We expect all companies to embrace innovation and go further and faster to reduce spills wherever possible.\n\n'Today's announcement also increases the resilience of our water supplies to the impact of climate change and will reduce how much water is taken from rivers by enabling a range of long-term water supply projects, which includes plans for nine reservoirs.\n\n'Let me be very clear to water companies - we will be closely scrutinising the delivery of their plans and will hold them to account to deliver real improvements to the environment and for customers and on their investment programmes.'\n\nOfwat said it has imposed a 'turnaround oversight regime' on Thames Water and opposed the utility firm's planned 44% hike in consumer bills over the next five years.\n\nThe cash-strapped firm said the bills hike will help fund \u00a319.8 billion of improvements to its network of drains, sewers and reservoirs.\n\nIt has also asked Ofwat to lower the amount it fines the water company for incidents such as sewage spills and leakages.\n\nThames warned on Tuesday that it has only enough money to last it until the end of May 2025 before it goes out of business.\n\nThe water firm is drowning in more than \u00a315 billion of debt, and said on Tuesday that it needs fresh investment in the coming months to keep it afloat.\n\nAlready, existing shareholders pulled the plug on \u00a3500 million worth of emergency funding in March.\n\nThames said Ofwat's initial assessments of its business plan had made the company \"uninvestable\".\n\nIf it ultimately fails to attract fresh funding, Thames' fraying finances will present Sir Keir Starmer's newly elected Labour Government with a significant industrial crisis.\n\nA blueprint codenamed Project Timber was being drawn up in Whitehall in the spring, according to reports, which could see the company effectively nationalised.\n\nOfwat's ruling on Thursday is only a draft decision, and kicks off a period of negotiation until its final verdict in December.\n\nBut the regulator has rarely made major deviations between its draft and final rulings in previous years, meaning Thursday's statement will give all parties an indication of how lenient it is likely to be later on.\n\nThe draft decision comes against a backdrop of public anger over the water companies and their role in the degraded state of the country's rivers, lakes and coastal waters, which are facing a perfect storm of creaking water infrastructure, intensive farming, a growing population and climate change.\n\nNot a single river in England is considered to be in good overall health, and beauty spots including Windermere in the Lake District have been hit by sewage spills.\n\nFigures released earlier this year showed storm overflows - which release untreated wastewater into rivers and seas when there is heavy rain to prevent sewers becoming overwhelmed - dumped sewage into the environment for more than 3.6 million hours in 2023.\n\nThe releases are legal, but environmental watchdog the Office for Environmental Protection is investigating the Environment Department (Defra), the Environment Agency and Ofwat over possible failures in regulating sewer overflows.\n\nIt is concerned that discharges have been permitted more often than the 'exceptional circumstances' allowed by law.\n\nWater utilities have also been hit by large fines for illegal pollution in recent years, with a record \u00a390 million fine handed to Southern Water in 2021 for 6,971 unpermitted sewage discharges.\n\nOther companies including Thames Water, Severn Trent, South West Water and Yorkshire Water have been handed fines that ran into the millions for massive, damaging or repeated pollution incidents.\n\nMORE : This

Ofwat is also considering appointing a so-called independent monitor, which would have \"full access\" to the company's financial information, to report on its progress.\n\nThames will also have to provide a \"delivery action plan\", outlining how it intends to improve its performance on sewage spills and leakage, which has been among the worst in the industry in recent years.\n\nWater companies had requested increases averaging \u00a3144 over five years, but this too has been rejected by Ofwat, who have instead proposed that bills increase by an average of \u00a319 per year over the next five years. The 21% bill increase is a third less than what was requested by the companies.\n\nThe firms wanted to increase their total spending by \u00a329bn but Ofwat said its scrutiny of companies' cost proposals, to ensure they deliver efficiently, had led to a \u00a316bn reduction.\n\nA spokesperson for Water UK said Ofwat's decision means it \"will be repeating the mistakes of the past\". They said it amounted to \"the biggest ever cut in investment by Ofwat\".\n\nThe spokesperson added: \"For far too long, Ofwat has failed to be realistic about the levels of investment needed and what it will take to deliver and maintain necessary infrastructure...\n\n\"Water companies are ready to invest in an unprecedented overhaul of the country's water and sewage infrastructure. Ofwat now needs to let them get on with it.\"\n\nHow much could your water bills go up?\n\nThames Water has 16 million customers in London and the Thames Valley region in the South East. Its plans - now rejected - would've seen spending rise to \u00a319.8bn to update its infrastructure and reduce sewage spills. However, that would've also involved increasing customer bills by 44%.\n\nSouthern Water have already announced a 9% rise this year, adding an extra \u00a340 per year to customer bills. They blamed the increase on inflation and increased costs for energy, fuel and raw materials. However, they want a 91% increase in bills to \u00a3915 a year by 2030.\n\nThe chart below shows the average increase - or decrease - of customers' water bills in percentage terms.\n\nThe data below shows the draft proposals for the average bills customers will be charged by water and wastewater companies in England and Wales by 2029/30.

Increases will fund \u00a3100bn of spending over the period, which will include replacing ageing, leaking pipes and reducing sewage discharges into rivers and seas.\n\nHowever, the increases would come off the back of disastrous recent environmental records that sparked a nationwide scandal over pollution.

In May, Severn Trent hiked its dividend to shareholders after profits rose by a fifth last year, despite sewage spills by the company rising by a third in 2023. With increased sewage spills, the firms are now asking the taxpayer to help bail them out of their financial difficulties.\n\nThe bill rises also come in the wake of huge bonus payouts for water firm bosses. Liv Garfield, chief executive of Severn Trent received a \u00a33.2m pay packet for 2023, which includes salary, bonuses and shares. Over the past four years she has earned nearly \u00a313m.\n\nLast month Susan Davy, the chief executive of Pennon - which owns South West Water - saw her pay package jump 58% after picking up a \u00a3298,000 shares bonus despite seeing pollution incidents nearly double at the firm last year.\n\nDespite the controversy, Water UK chief executive David Henderson defended asking customers to pay for what he described as \"important\" investment in the water network.\n\nWhen asked how water companies can justify rising bills on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the head of the trade association for the water industry, said: \"We need to increase our water supply and if we don't make these investments we won't get it. Unfortunately the investment will paid for up front by the shareholders of the companies and then slowly recouped over time.\"\n\nWhat has Starmer said about water companies?\n\nLabour has already ruled out nationalising the water industry. In their manifesto, published during the general election campaign, the party said they want to end water companies \"self-monitoring\".\n\nLabour has said it will pursue criminal charges against water company executives responsible for persistent pollution. It also said in its manifesto that regulators would be given new powers to block bonuses against executives who pollute waterways.\n\nPrime minister Keir Starmer's official spokesman told reporters on Monday: \"The government has said in its manifesto that we will put failing water companies into special measures and they will have no choice but to clean up their act. We talked about giving regulators the power to block payment of bonuses to executives who pollute our waterways and impose automatic and severe fines on them for wrongdoing.\"\n\nRead more\n\nSpills

It said this week that it only has enough money to continue trading until the end of May 2025.\n\nBosses are scrambling to secure a major cash injection to keep it afloat, and have held talks with both existing shareholders and outside investors.\n\nBut chief executive Chris Weston said on Tuesday that the investment is \"dependent on (Thames) securing a final regulatory determination that is ... investable\".\n\nIf Thames does not succeed in getting the funding, it faces the prospect of being temporarily nationalised by the Government and being placed in a form of special administration, meaning the taxpayer would take on the costs of the heavily loss-making water giant.\n\nOfwat's ruling on Thursday is a draft decision and kicks off a lengthy period of negotiation until its final verdict in December.\n\nHowever, the regulator has rarely made major deviations between its draft and final rulings in previous years, meaning today's statement gives companies an indication of how lenient it is likely to be later on.\n\nDavid Black, chief executive of Ofwat said: \"Customers want to see radical change in the way water companies care for the environment.\n\n\"Our draft decisions on company plans approve a tripling of investment to make sustained improvement to customer service and the environment at a fair price for customers.\n\n\"These proposals aim to deliver a 44% reduction in spills from storm overflows compared to levels in 2021. We expect all companies to embrace innovation and go further and faster to reduce spills wherever possible.\n\n\"Today's announcement also increases the resilience of our water supplies to the impact of climate change and will reduce how much water is taken from rivers by enabling a range of long-term water supply projects, which includes plans for 9 reservoirs.\n\n\"Let me be very clear to water companies.

This works out at an increase of \u00a319 per year.\n\nOn average, companies had requested a \u00a3144 increase for ratepayers but Ofwat rejected the plan and has provisionally granted the smaller increase.\n\nSouthern Water has suffered one of the steepest cuts to its request, with its plea for a \u00a3306 hike cut to \u00a3183 by the regulator.\n\nOn investment, which is funded by bill increases, Ofwat said water groups can spend \u00a388bn, which is \u00a316bn lower than they requested.\n\nOfwat chief executive David Black said: \"Customers want to see radical change in the way water companies care for the environment.\n\n\"Our draft decisions on company plans approve a tripling of investment to make sustained improvement to customer service and the environment at a fair price for customers.\"\n\n\"Let me be very clear to water companies. We will be closely scrutinising the delivery of their plans and will hold them to account to deliver real improvements to the environment and for customers and on their investment programmes.\"\n\nOfwat has opened a consultation into its proposed bill rates, which closes on Aug 28. A final decision is expected in December.\n\nThames proposed plans in April to Ofwat to boost spending to \u00a319.8bn as it seeks to upgrade its infrastructure and cut spills of sewage, but that would be funded by a large hike in bills.\n\nThe company has said bills must rise to make the company \"investable\" and an attractive proposition for any investors.\n\nIts current shareholders have so far refused to put any more money into the group until its finances and Ofwat's decision become clear. They refused to inject \u00a3500m of capital into the company earlier this year due to the uncertainty.\n\nOfwat's decision is a draft determination meaning water companies and the regulator will continue negotiations until the final decision in December.\n\nThames Water chief executive Chris Weston said on Tuesday the draft determination was not the \"end of the road\".\n\n\"We would expect continued engagement with Ofwat between the draft determination and final determination to work out what that means for our revenue and what it means for customers in the period up to 2030,\" he said.\n\n\"There will be a huge amount of detail.

Thames said Ofwat's initial assessments of its business plan had the company \"uninvestible\".\n\nIf it ultimately fails to attract fresh funding, Thames' fraying finances will present Sir Keir Starmer's newly elected Labour Government with a significant industrial crisis.\n\nOfwat\u00b4s draft decision is a crunch moment for Thames Water which is in a perilous financial condition (Andrew

in previous years, meaning Thursday's statement will give all parties an indication of how lenient it is likely to be later on.\n\nThe draft decision comes against a backdrop of public anger over the water companies and their role in the degraded state of the country's rivers, lakes and coastal waters, which are facing a perfect storm of creaking water infrastructure, intensive farming, a growing population and climate change.\n\nNot a single river in England is considered to be in good overall health, and beauty spots including Windermere in the Lake District have been hit by sewage spills.\n\nFigures released earlier this year showed storm overflows - which release untreated wastewater into rivers and seas when there is heavy rain to prevent sewers becoming overwhelmed - dumped sewage into the environment for more than 3.6 million hours in 2023.\n\nThe releases are legal, but the environmental watchdog, the Office for Environmental Protection, is investigating the Environment Department (Defra), the Environment Agency and regulator Ofwat over possible failures in regulating sewer overflows.\n\nThey are concerned that discharges have been permitted more often than the \"exceptional circumstances\" allowed by law.\n\nWater utilities have also been hit by large fines for illegal pollution in recent years, with a record \u00a390 million handed to Southern Water in 2021 for 6,971 unpermitted sewage discharges.\n\nOther companies including Thames Water, Severn Trent, South West Water and Yorkshire Water have been handed fines that ran into the millions

Over the coming weeks and months, this Government will outline further steps to reform the water sector and restore our rivers, lakes and seas to good health.\"\n\nFor Thames Water, which is gripped by a funding crisis, Ofwat's draft decision could be crunch time.\n\nThe firm has 16 million customers in London and the Thames Valley region and its plans submitted to Ofwat propose raising its bills by 44% between now and 2030.\n\nThe average yearly bill for a Thames customer is \u00a3436 at the moment, but that would rise to \u00a3627 in five years under the proposals before factoring in inflation.\n\nThe firm said the bills hike will help fund \u00a319.8 billion of improvements to its network of drains, sewers and reservoirs.\n\nIt has also asked Ofwat to lower the amount it fines the water company for incidents such as sewage spills and leakages.\n\nThames warned on Tuesday that it has only enough money to last it until the end of May 2025 before it goes out of business.\n\nThe water firm is drowning in more than \u00a315 billion of debt, and said on Tuesday that it needs fresh investment in the coming months to keep it afloat.\n\nAlready, existing shareholders pulled the plug on \u00a3500 million worth of emergency funding in March.\n\nThames said Ofwat's initial assessments of its business plan had made the company \"uninvestable\".\n\nIf it ultimately fails to attract fresh funding, Thames' fraying finances will present Sir Keir Starmer's newly elected Labour Government with a significant industrial crisis.\n\nA blueprint codenamed Project Timber was being drawn up in Whitehall in the spring, according to reports, which could see the company effectively nationalised.\n\nOfwat's ruling on Thursday is only a draft decision, and kicks off a period of negotiation until its final verdict in December.\n\nBut the regulator has rarely made major deviations between its draft and final rulings in previous years, meaning Thursday's statement will give all parties an indication of how lenient it is likely to be later on.\n\nThe draft decision comes against a backdrop of public anger over the water companies and their role in the degraded state of the country's rivers, lakes and coastal waters, which are facing a perfect storm of creaking water infrastructure, intensive farming, a growing population and climate change.\n\nNot a single river in England is considered to be in good overall health, and beauty spots including Windermere in the Lake District have been hit by sewage spills.\n\nFigures released earlier this year showed storm overflows - which release untreated wastewater into rivers and seas when there is heavy rain to prevent sewers becoming overwhelmed - dumped sewage into the environment for more than 3.6 million hours in 2023.\n\nThe releases are legal, but environmental watchdog the Office for Environmental Protection is investigating the Environment Department (Defra), the Environment Agency and Ofwat over possible failures in regulating sewer overflows.\n\nIt is concerned that discharges have been permitted more often than the \"exceptional circumstances\" allowed by law.\n\nWater utilities have also been hit by large fines for illegal pollution in recent years, with a record \u00a390 million fine handed to Southern Water in 2021 for 6,971 unpermitted sewage discharges.\n\nOther companies including Thames Water, Severn Trent, South West Water and Yorkshire Water have been handed fines that ran into the millions for massive, damaging or repeated pollution incidents.",

Thames said Ofwat's initial assessments of its business plan had the company \"uninvestible\".\n\nIf it ultimately fails to attract fresh funding, Thames' fraying finances will present Sir Keir Starmer's newly elected Labour Government with a significant industrial crisis.\n\nA blueprint codenamed Project Timber was being drawn up in Whitehall in the spring, according to reports, which could see the company effectively nationalised.\n\nOfwat's ruling on Thursday is only a draft decision, and kicks off a period of negotiation until its final verdict in December.\n\nBut the regulator has rarely made major deviations between its draft and final rulings in previous years, meaning Thursday's statement will give all parties an indication of how lenient it is likely to be later on.\n\nThe draft decision comes against a backdrop of public anger over the water companies and their role in the degraded state of the country's rivers, lakes and coastal waters, which are facing a perfect storm of creaking water infrastructure, intensive farming, a growing population and climate change.\n\nNot a single river in England is considered to be in good overall health, and beauty spots including Windermere in the Lake District have been hit by sewage spills.\n\nFigures released earlier this year showed storm overflows - which release untreated wastewater into rivers and seas when there is heavy rain to prevent sewers becoming overwhelmed - dumped sewage into the environment for more than 3.6 million hours in 2023.\n\nThe releases are legal, but the environmental watchdog, the Office for Environmental Protection, is investigating the Environment Department (Defra), the Environment Agency and regulator Ofwat over possible failures in regulating sewer overflows.\n\nThey are concerned that discharges have been permitted more often than the \"exceptional circumstances\" allowed by law.\n\nWater utilities have also been hit by large fines for illegal pollution in recent years, with a record \u00a390 million handed to Southern Water in 2021 for 6,971 unpermitted sewage discharges.\n\nOther companies including Thames Water, Severn Trent, South West Water and Yorkshire Water have been handed fines that ran into the millions for massive, damaging or repeated pollution incidents.", "source": {"uri": "expressandstar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Express & Star"},

It said this week that it only has enough money to continue trading until the end of May 2025.\n\nRejected: Regulators have imposed a 'turnaround oversight regime' on Thames Water and opposed the company's planned 44% hike in consumer bills\n\nThe water warned that it could run out of money by next May if it is not allowed to put up bills by 59 per cent.\n\nThames Water, which has 16million customers across London and the Thames Valley, will have to 'fully re-evaluate' its current turnaround strategy under Ofwat's measures.\n\nIt will be made to publish a separate 'financial resilience plan', while Ofwat is also considering appointing a so-called independent monitor to report on the company's progress.\n\nThe independent monitor would have 'full access' to the company's financial information, Ofwat said on Thursday.\n\nThames will also have to provide a 'delivery action plan', outlining how it intends to improve its performance on sewage spills and leakage, which has been among the worst in the industry in recent years.\n\nThe watchdog also reduced Thames' planned investment in its services, including upgrading its ageing infrastructure, to \u00a316.9billion, down from the \u00a321.4billion the company had proposed.\n\nOfwat said the increase in customers' bills it outlined on Thursday gave Thames Water the opportunity to 'make a fair set of returns' and it was now up to the utility to secure the funding it needs to avoid collapse.\n\n'We think the determination that we've set provides Thames Water with a fair set of returns, it's now their job to go to investors and to seek to raise that funding,' Ofwat chief executive David Black told BBC radio.\n\nIn charge: Tim Weston is the chief executive of Thames Water\n\nTurbulence: Bosses are scrambling to secure a major cash injection to keep Thames Water afloat\n\nBosses are scrambling to secure a major cash injection to keep Thames Water afloat, and have held talks with both existing shareholders and external investors.\n\nBut chief executive Chris Weston said on Tuesday that the investment is 'dependent on [Thames Water] securing a final regulatory determination that is ... investable.'\n\nIf Thames Water does not succeed in getting the funding, it faces the prospect of being temporarily nationalised by the government and being placed in a form of special administration, meaning the taxpayer would take on the costs of the heavily loss-making water giant.\n\nOfwat's ruling on Thursday is a draft decision and kicks off a lengthy period of negotiations until its final verdict in December.\n\nBut, the regulator has rarely made major deviations between its draft and final rulings in previous years, meaning today's statement gives companies an indication of how lenient it is likely to be later on.\n\nDavid Black, chief executive of Ofwat said: 'Customers want to see radical change in the way water companies care for the environment.\n\n'Our draft decisions on company plans approve a tripling of investment to make sustained improvement to customer service and the environment at a fair price for customers.\n\n'These proposals aim to deliver a 44 per cent reduction in spills from storm overflows compared to levels in 2021. We expect all companies to embrace innovation and go further and faster to reduce spills wherever possible.\n\n'Today's announcement also increases the resilience of our water supplies to the impact of climate change and will reduce how much water is taken from rivers by enabling a range of long-term water supply projects, which includes plans for 9 reservoirs.\n\n'Let me be very clear to water companies. We will be closely scrutinising the delivery of their plans and will hold them to account to deliver real improvements to the environment and for customers and on their investment programmes.'\n\nDIY INVESTING PLATFORMSAJ BellAJ BellEasy investing and ready-made portfoliosLearn MoreLearn MoreHargreaves LansdownHargreaves LansdownFree fund dealing and investment ideasLearn MoreLearn Moreinteractive investorinteractive investorFlat-fee investing from \u00a34.99 per monthLearn MoreLearn MoreeToroeToroShare investing: 30+ million communityLearn MoreLearn MoreTrading 212Trading 212Free share dealing and no account feeLearn MoreLearn More\n\nAffiliate links: If you take out a product This is Money may earn a commission.

Details of the company's bonus payments were revealed as part of its full-year results. Mr Weston received \u00a3195,000 after his appointment in January. This took his total pay to \u00a3437,000 for the three months to the end of March.\n\nCurrently the group is engaging with potential investors and creditors to seek around \u00a33.25bn of fresh equity to improve its funding position, or faced a cliff edge at the end of next May. If these fundraising efforts fail the Government may be forced to step in.\n\nThames Water is seeking to push up customers' bills by an average of 59pc over the next five years under new business plans sent to regulators, which could see bills rise by an average of more than \u00a350 a month.\n\nOfwat, the water regulator, is due to issue a draft judgment on Thames' five-year business plan on Thursday.\n\nThames is the UK's largest water supplier, with 16 million customers in London and the Thames Valley region.\n\nIt currently has net debts of about \u00a315.3bn and it has come under fierce criticism for water leaks and sewage spillages. The firm's huge debts have led to speculation it could be taken over by the Government.\n\nOfwat had previously dismissed the company's original plan to invest \u00a318.7bn to fix leaks and sewage spills, with most of the cash coming from a proposed increase in customer bills.\n\nChief executive Chris Weston said: \"Our business plan focuses on our customers' priorities.\n\n\"As part of the usual ongoing discussions relating to PR24, we've now updated it to deliver more projects that will benefit the environment. We will continue to discuss this with our regulators and stakeholders.\"\n\nWho owns Thames Water?\n\nThames Water's shareholders include the Universities Superannuation Scheme, China's Sovereign Wealth Fund and Canadian pension fund Omers.\n\nThames Water announced last year that investors would inject \u00a33.25bn into the business, with \u00a3750m expected this year. However, in March shareholders pulled the plug on the planned investment.\n\nWhat is happening at Thames Water?\n\nThe company is at risk of renationalisation after it failed to secure hundreds of millions of pounds in survival funding.\n\nIn March shareholders refused to give the company a \u00a3500m lifeline, saying regulatory requirements made its business plan \"uninvestable\".\n\nThe announcement has raised new fears the Government could step in to rescue the heavily indebted firm from collapse.\n\nWhy did shareholders withdraw the cash injection?\n\nBritain's biggest water company had been expecting the half a billion pound payment by March 31 but shareholders withheld it, saying the company's business plan was \"uninvestable\".\n\nThe investors were unwilling to pump more money into the business after regulator Ofwat rejected Thames Waters' plans to increase bills substantially for its customers over the next five years. Unless new funding is secured, the water company could be placed into special administration by the Government.\n\nHow much debt is Thames Water in?\n\nThames Water is looking for emergency funding as it battles to service its \u00a315.3bn debt pile, up from \u00a313.9bn a year ago. It has come under increasing financial strain as interest rates have soared.\n\nAs part of a turnaround plan, the utility company had been lobbying Ofwat to let it increase bills by 40pc over a decade, pay dividends and receive lower fines to avoid temporary nationalisation by the Government.\n\nWater companies have faced widespread criticism for sewage dumping and leaks, with the regulator putting them under increasing pressure to increase investment and fix their ageing infrastructure.\n\nSir Keir Starmer has vowed to crack down on Britain's water suppliers, pledging to put failing companies into \"special measures\" if they do not \"clean up their act\" on sewage pollution.\n\nThe Government has previously said it is ready to take over Thames Water in the event of a failure. A bailout would cost an estimated \u00a35bn, much of which would likely be borne by the taxpayer.\n\nIf this happened, the company would likely be placed into a special administration regime, although there is currently no detail of what this could mean. This scheme was previously used to rescue energy supplier Bulb in 2021 before it was later sold to Octopus Energy.\n\nThe Government has so far refused to spell out what special measures would involve but Jonathan Reynolds, the Business Secretary, said prior to the general election that Labour would not want to see a nationalisation.\n\nHowever some believe that Thames Water could be renationalised permanently. It was privatised in 1989 when Margaret Thatcher sold off the publicly-owned water and sewage industry.\n\nBefore the election, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer appeared to rule out nationalisation if he becomes Prime Minister.\n\nAsked about the future of water companies in general following a string of scandals, he told the Reading Chronicle: \"I don't think nationalisation is the answer, but getting a grip of it is.\"\n\nUnder government regulations, water companies must provide service to customers even if in special administration\n\nHouseholds' water supplies will not be cut off, and they will be kept updated if there are any changes to their supplier.\n\nChris Weston, chief executive of Thames Water, said: \"We are going through a process and that process is wholly focused on bringing new equity into Thames Water. We will go to the market and we will look at a broad church of investors.\n\n\"Some of those investors may or may not be some of our existing shareholders. That process will stretch well into next year.\"\n\nIn an update to shareholders Thames said it had liquidity until the end of May 2025 totalling \u00a31.8bn, but faced a cliff edge unless fresh cash could be secured.\n\nCould water bills increase?\n\nThames Water said on Friday that discussions with Ofwat \"are ongoing\".\n\nThe regulator could decide to allow the utility firm to increase customers' bills in order to avert a taxpayer bailout.\n\nBills have already risen by an average 12.4pc for 2024-25, taking the typical annual payment to \u00a3471.", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Over the coming weeks and months, this Government will outline further steps to reform the water sector and restore our rivers, lakes and seas to good health.\"\n\nFor Thames Water, which is gripped by a funding crisis, Ofwat's draft decision on Thursday could be crunch time.\n\nThe firm has 16 million customers in London and the Thames Valley region and its plans submitted to Ofwat propose raising their bills by 44% between now and 2030.\n\nThe average yearly bill for a Thames customer is \u00a3436 at the moment, but that would rise to \u00a3627 in five years under its plans before factoring in inflation.\n\nThe bills hike will help it fund \u00a319.8 billion of improvements to its network of drains, sewers and reservoirs.\n\nIt has also asked Ofwat to lower the amount it fines the water company for incidents such as sewage spills and leakages.\n\nThames warned on Tuesday that it has only enough money to last it until the end of May 2025 before it goes out of business.\n\nThe water firm is drowning in more than \u00a315 billion of debt, and said on Tuesday that it needs fresh investment in the coming months to keep it afloat.\n\nAlready, existing shareholders pulled the plug on \u00a3500 million-worth of emergency funding in March. Thames said Ofwat's initial assessments of its business plan had made the company \"uninvestible\".\n\nIf it ultimately fails to attract fresh funding, Thames' fraying finances will present Sir Keir Starmer's newly elected Labour Government with a significant industrial crisis.\n\nA blueprint codenamed Project Timber was being drawn up in Whitehall in the spring, according to reports, which could

warns it will run out of cash in May 2025 amid scramble for funding", "body": "The company could fall into administration without new funds, as it braces for a key Ofwat draft decision on its business plans later this week.\n\nThames Water has warned that it will run out of money by the end of next May, as the heavily indebted company intensifies efforts to secure fresh funding.\n\nBritain's biggest water firm, which is creaking under a debt pile of more than \u00a315 billion, said on Tuesday that it had \u00a31.8 billion of cash reserves at the end of June, a fall from \u00a32.4 billion three months previously.\n\nThe firm said it is still looking for new funds needed to maintain and update its infrastructure, after investors pulled the plug on \u00a3500 million of emergency cash earlier this year.\n\nChief executive Chris Weston said Thames had taken \"informal soundings which have shown there is interest in the market\".\n\nHe added that the company will be looking at a \"broad church\" of potential investors which could include existing shareholders.\n\nIf it ultimately fails to attract fresh funding, Thames Water's fraying finances could present Sir Keir Starmer's newly elected Labour Government with a significant industrial crisis.\n\nA blueprint codenamed Project Timber was being drawn up in Whitehall in the spring, according to reports, which could see the company effectively nationalised.\n\nUnder the plans, the company would be placed in a form of special administration in the scenario that its parent company fails.\n\nMr Weston added that it is \"not in the interests\" of customers or investors for the company to fall into Government hands.\n\nCommunities minister Jim McMahon said on Tuesday morning: \"We recognise that, over the last 14 years, frankly, the water industry hasn't been regulated anywhere near as firmly as it should have been, and we haven't seen the investment to deal with the sewage scandal.\"\n\nHe said there is a need for reform and for regulation to be looked at, adding: \"The days of putting shareholder interest above the national interest, frankly, can't carry on and so we do need to look at that and Thames do need to look at their own house and get it in order.\"\n\nMr McMahon said there is \"no programme of nationalisation for the water industry\" when asked what the plan is if the company collapses.\n\nHe did however say there is \"no provision in law for a water company to stop providing water\", adding: \"We need to be very clear there is always a contingency in place.\"\n\nThames Water's financial update will be followed on Thursday by a draft verdict from Ofwat on water companies' five-year spending plans and bill increases to 2030.\n\nThat will kick off six months of negotiations with Ofwat, ahead of its final decision in December.\n\nThames Water, which has 16 million customers in London and the Thames Valley region, put forward plans in April that would see spending rise to \u00a319.8 billion to update its infrastructure and reduce sewage spills.\n\nHowever, that would also involve increasing customer bills by 44%, a figure which has prompted backlash from consumer groups.\n\nMeanwhile, the process of securing new cash is \"not expected to conclude\" until after Ofwat's final decision on Thames' business plan in December.\n\nAny increase in bills would be greeted with anger, after Thames Water and other water companies' disastrous recent environmental records sparked a nationwide scandal over pollution.\n\nThames said pollution incidents increased to 350, up on 331 last year, which it blamed on a rainier-than-expected year.\n\nThe number of \"serious pollutions\" decreased by 18%, Thames Water said.\n\nWhen questioned on the issue on Tuesday, Mr Weston said: \"You might not like the answer, but rain has a big impact on spills.\"\n\nIt comes amid reports that Sir Keir has been briefed that the poor state of Thames Water's physical infrastructure presents a \"critical risk\" to the country.\n\nFears about the company include its management of sites that provide drinking water and sewage treatment for London and the Thames Valley, The Guardian newspaper reported.\n\nThames Water said it spent \u00a32 billion on maintaining and updating its infrastructure last year.", "source": {"uri": "shropshirestar.com", "dataType":

If these fundraising efforts fail the Government may be forced to step in.\n\nThames Water is seeking to push up customers' bills by an average of 59pc over the next five years under new business plans sent to regulators, which could see bills rise by an average of more than \u00a350 a month.\n\nOfwat, the water regulator, is due to issue a draft judgment on Thames' five-year business plan on Thursday.\n\nThames is the UK's largest water supplier, with 16 million customers in London and the Thames Valley region.\n\nIt currently has net debts of about \u00a315.3bn and it has come under fierce criticism for water leaks and sewage spillages. The firm's huge debts have led to speculation it could be taken over by the Government.\n\nOfwat had previously dismissed the company's original plan to invest \u00a318.7bn to fix leaks and sewage spills, with most of the cash coming from a proposed increase in customer bills.\n\nChief executive Chris Weston said: \"Our business plan focuses on our customers' priorities.\n\n\"As part of the usual ongoing discussions relating to PR24, we've now updated it to deliver more projects that will benefit the environment. We will continue to discuss this with our regulators and stakeholders.\"\n\nThe company is at risk of renationalisation after it failed to secure hundreds of millions of pounds in survival funding.\n\nIn March shareholders refused to give the company a \u00a3500m lifeline, saying regulatory requirements made its business plan \"uninvestable\".\n\nThe announcement has raised new fears the Government could step in to rescue the heavily indebted firm from collapse.\n\nBritain's biggest water company had been expecting the half a billion pound payment by March 31 but shareholders withheld it, saying the company's business plan was \"uninvestable\".\n\nThe investors were unwilling to pump more money into the business after regulator Ofwat rejected Thames Waters' plans to increase bills substantially for its customers over the next five years. Unless new funding is secured, the water company could be placed into special administration by the Government.\n\nThames Water is looking for emergency funding as it battles to service its \u00a315.3bn debt pile, up from \u00a313.9bn a year ago. It has come under increasing financial strain as interest rates have soared.\n\nAs part of a turnaround plan, the utility company had been lobbying Ofwat to let it increase bills by 40pc over a decade, pay dividends and receive lower fines to avoid temporary nationalisation by the Government.\n\nWater companies have faced widespread criticism for sewage dumping and leaks, with the regulator putting them under increasing pressure to increase investment and fix their ageing infrastructure.\n\nSir Keir Starmer has vowed to crack down on Britain's water suppliers, pledging to put failing companies into \"special measures\" if they do not \"clean up their act\" on sewage pollution.\n\nThames Water's shareholders include the Universities Superannuation Scheme, China's Sovereign Wealth Fund and Canadian pension fund Omers.\n\nThames Water announced last year that investors would inject \u00a33.25bn into the business, with \u00a3750m expected this year. However, in March shareholders pulled the plug on the planned investment.\n\nThames Water provides water and sewage services to 16 million households - about a quarter of the UK population.\n\nThe Government has previously said it is ready to take over Thames Water in the event of a failure. A bailout would cost an estimated \u00a35bn, much of which would likely be borne by the taxpayer.\n\nIf this happened, the company would likely be placed into a special administration regime, although there is currently no detail of what this could mean. This scheme was previously used to rescue energy supplier Bulb in 2021 before it was later sold to Octopus Energy.\n\nThe Government has so far refused to spell out what special measures would involve but Jonathan Reynolds, the Business Secretary, said prior to the general election that Labour would not want to see a nationalisation.\n\nHowever some believe that Thames Water could be renationalised permanently. It was privatised in 1989 when Margaret Thatcher sold off the publicly-owned water and sewage industry.\n\nBefore the election, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer appeared to rule out nationalisation if he becomes Prime Minister.\n\nAsked about the future of water companies in general following a string of scandals, he told the Reading Chronicle: \"I don't think nationalisation is the answer, but getting a grip of it is.\"\n\nUnder government regulations, water companies must provide service to customers even if in special administration\n\nHouseholds' water supplies will not be cut off, and they will be kept updated if there are any changes to their supplier.\n\nChris Weston, chief executive of Thames Water, said: \"We are going through a process and that process is wholly focused on bringing new equity into Thames Water. We will go to the market and we will look at a broad church of investors.\n\n\"Some of those investors may or may not be some of our existing shareholders. That process will stretch well into next year.\"\n\nIn an update to shareholders Thames said it had liquidity until the end of May 2025 totalling \u00a31.8bn, but faced a cliff edge unless fresh cash could be secured.\n\nThames Water said on Friday that discussions with Ofwat \"are ongoing\".\n\nThe regulator could decide to allow the utility firm to increase customers' bills in order to avert a taxpayer bailout.\n\nBills have already risen by an average 12.4pc for 2024-25, taking the typical annual payment to \u00a3471.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

This represents a threefold hike on the 2020-2025 period.\n\nOfwat outlined that the average bill increase for water firms across the UK will be \u00a319 a year over five years - a total of \u00a394 - before taking into account the effects of inflation. Thames Water customers specifically will pay an extra \u00a399 by 2030.\n\nThe figure is significantly lower than the amount many water companies like Thames had requested as part of their business plans, which were submitted to Ofwat in the Spring. Southern Water wanted to increase their water bills by 91 per cent, while Thames had proposed a hike of 44 per cent, or \u00a3191.\n\nWater firms like Thames, which earlier this week warned it had 11 months' worth of capital left, have argued in the run-up to the decision that a significant hike was needed to customer bills if they were to be able to afford the many necessary infrastructure upgrades required to stem pollution and leaks.\n\nBut a rise would have left many of their customers struggling to pay their bills even more, with research having shown one in five families already struggle to pay their bills.\n\nOfwat says the plans will help reduce the number of spill from storm overflows by 44 per cent relative to 2021 levels, by upgrading 2,500 overflows.\n\nIt will also allocate \u00a36bn to make improvements at over 1500 wastewater treatment works and set eight new performance targets.\n\nDavid Black, chief executive of Ofwat said: \"Customers want to see radical change in the way water companies care for the environment.\n\n\"Our draft decisions on company plans approve a tripling of investment to make sustained improvement to customer service and the environment at a fair price for customers.\n\n\"These proposals aim to deliver a 44% reduction in spills from storm overflows compared to levels in 2021. We expect all companies to embrace innovation and go further and faster to reduce spills wherever possible.\n\n\"Today's announcement also increases the resilience of our water supplies to the impact of climate change and will reduce how much water is taken from rivers by enabling a range of long-term water supply projects, which includes plans for 9 reservoirs. \"", "source": {"uri": "cityam.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CityAM"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ali_lyon@cityam.com", "name": "Ali Lyon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofwat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ofwat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Water", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thames Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Thames", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "River Thames"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sewage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Water", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southern Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Water industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Effects of climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reservoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Water supply"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage_treatment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sewage treatment"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Sanitary_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Sanitary Engineering", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Water_Parks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Water Parks", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://www.cityam.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Thames-Water-1200x800-1.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717113", "eventUri": "eng-9717113", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Thames said Ofwat's initial assessments of its business plan had the company \"uninvestible\".\n\nIf it ultimately fails to attract fresh funding, Thames' fraying finances will present Sir Keir Starmer's newly elected Labour Government with a significant industrial crisis.\n\nA blueprint codenamed Project Timber was being drawn up in Whitehall in the spring, according to reports, which could see the company effectively nationalised.\n\nOfwat's ruling on Thursday is only a draft decision, and kicks off a period of negotiation until its final verdict in December.\n\nBut the regulator has rarely made major deviations between its draft and final rulings in previous years, meaning Thursday's statement will give all parties an indication of how lenient it is likely to be later on.\n\nThe draft decision comes against a backdrop of public anger over the water companies and their role in the degraded state of the country's rivers, lakes and coastal waters, which are facing a perfect storm of creaking water infrastructure, intensive farming, a growing population and climate change.\n\nNot a single river in England is considered to be in good overall health, and beauty spots including Windermere in the Lake District have been hit by sewage spills.\n\nFigures released earlier this year showed storm overflows - which release untreated wastewater into rivers and seas when there is heavy rain to prevent sewers becoming overwhelmed - dumped sewage into the environment for more than 3.6 million hours in 2023.\n\nThe releases are legal, but the environmental watchdog, the Office for Environmental Protection, is investigating the Environment Department (Defra), the Environment Agency and regulator Ofwat over possible failures in regulating sewer overflows.\n\nThey are concerned that discharges have been permitted more often than the \"exceptional circumstances\" allowed by law.\n\nWater utilities have also been hit by large fines for illegal pollution in recent years, with a record \u00a390 million handed to Southern Water in 2021 for 6,971 unpermitted sewage discharges.\n\nOther companies including Thames Water, Severn Trent, South West Water and Yorkshire Water have been handed fines that ran into the millions for massive, damaging or repeated pollution incidents.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"},

Over the coming weeks and months, this Government will outline further steps to reform the water sector and restore our rivers, lakes and seas to good health.\"\n\nFor Thames Water, which is gripped by a funding crisis, Ofwat's draft decision on Thursday could be crunch time.\n\nThe firm has 16 million customers in London and the Thames Valley region and its plans submitted to Ofwat propose raising their bills by 44% between now and 2030.\n\nThe average yearly bill for a Thames customer is \u00a3436 at the moment, but that would rise to \u00a3627 in five years under its plans before factoring in inflation.\n\nThe bills hike will help it fund \u00a319.8 billion of improvements to its network of drains, sewers and reservoirs.\n\nIt has also asked Ofwat to lower the amount it fines the water company for incidents such as sewage spills and leakages.\n\nThames warned on Tuesday that it has only enough money to last it until the end of May 2025 before it goes out of business.\n\nThe water firm is drowning in more than \u00a315 billion of debt, and said on Tuesday that it needs fresh investment in the coming months to keep it afloat.\n\nAlready, existing shareholders pulled the plug on \u00a3500 million-worth of emergency funding in March. Thames said Ofwat's initial assessments of its business plan had made the company \"uninvestible\".\n\nIf it ultimately fails to attract fresh funding, Thames' fraying finances will present Sir Keir Starmer's newly elected Labour Government with a significant industrial crisis.\n\nA blueprint codenamed Project Timber was being drawn up in Whitehall in the spring, according to reports, which could see the company effectively nationalised.\n\nOfwat's ruling on Thursday is only a draft decision, and kicks off a period of negotiation until its final verdict in December.\n\nBut the regulator has rarely made major deviations between its draft and final rulings in previous years, meaning Thursday's statement will give all parties an indication of how lenient it is likely to be later on.\n\nThe draft decision comes against a backdrop of public anger over the water companies and their role in the degraded state of the country's rivers, lakes and coastal waters, which are facing a perfect storm of creaking water infrastructure, intensive farming, a growing population and climate change.\n\nNot a single river in England is considered to be in good overall health, and beauty spots including Windermere in the Lake District have been hit by sewage spills.\n\nFigures released earlier this year showed storm overflows - which release untreated wastewater into rivers and seas when there is heavy rain to prevent sewers becoming overwhelmed - dumped sewage into the environment for more than 3.6 million hours in 2023.\n\nThe releases are legal, but the environmental watchdog, the Office for Environmental Protection, is investigating the Environment Department (Defra), the Environment Agency and regulator Ofwat over possible failures in regulating sewer overflows.\n\nThey are concerned that discharges have been permitted more often than the \"exceptional circumstances\" allowed by law.\n\nWater utilities have also been hit by large fines for illegal pollution in recent years, with a record \u00a390 million handed to Southern Water in 2021 for 6,971 unpermitted sewage discharges.\n\nOther companies including Thames Water, Severn Trent, South West Water and Yorkshire

will run out of money by the end of next May, as the heavily indebted company intensifies efforts to secure fresh funding.\n\nBritain's biggest water firm, which is creaking under a debt pile of more than \u00a315 billion, said on Tuesday that it had \u00a31.8 billion of cash reserves at the end of June, a fall from \u00a32.4 billion three months previously.\n\nThe firm said it is still looking for new funds needed to maintain and update its infrastructure, after investors pulled the plug on \u00a3500 million of emergency cash earlier this year.\n\nChief executive Chris Weston said Thames had taken \"informal soundings which have shown there is interest in the market\".\n\nHe added that the company will be looking at a \"broad church\" of potential investors which could include existing shareholders.\n\nIf it ultimately fails to attract fresh funding, Thames Water's fraying finances could present Sir Keir Starmer's newly elected Labour Government with a significant industrial crisis.\n\nA blueprint codenamed Project Timber was being drawn up in Whitehall in the spring, according to reports, which could see the company effectively nationalised.\n\nUnder the plans, the company would be placed in a form of special administration in the scenario that its parent company fails.\n\nMr Weston added that it is \"not in the interests\" of customers or investors for the company to fall into Government hands.\n\nCommunities minister Jim McMahon said on Tuesday morning: \"We recognise that, over the last 14 years, frankly, the water industry hasn't been regulated anywhere near as firmly as it should have been, and we haven't seen the investment to deal with the sewage scandal.\"\n\nHe said there is a need for reform and for regulation to be looked at, adding: \"The days of putting shareholder interest above the national interest, frankly, can't carry on and so we do need to look at that and Thames do need to look at their own house and get it in order.\"\n\nMr McMahon said there is \"no programme of nationalisation for the water industry\" when asked what the plan is if the company collapses.\n\nHe did however say there is \"no provision in law for a water company to stop providing water\", adding: \"We need to be very clear there is always a contingency in place.\"\n\nThames Water's financial update will be followed on Thursday by a draft verdict from Ofwat on water companies' five-year spending plans and bill increases to 2030.\n\nThat will kick off six months of negotiations with Ofwat, ahead of its final decision in December.\n\nThames Water, which has 16 million customers in London and the Thames Valley region, put forward plans in April that would see spending rise to \u00a319.8 billion to update its infrastructure and reduce sewage spills.\n\nHowever, that would also involve increasing customer bills by 44%, a figure which has prompted backlash from consumer groups.\n\nMeanwhile, the process of securing new cash is \"not expected to conclude\" until after Ofwat's final decision on Thames' business plan in December.\n\nAny increase in bills would be greeted with anger, after Thames Water and other water companies' disastrous recent environmental records sparked a nationwide scandal over pollution.\n\nThames said pollution incidents increased to 350, up on 331 last year, which it blamed on a rainier-than-expected year.\n\nThe number of \"serious pollutions\" decreased by 18%, Thames Water said.\n\nWhen questioned on the issue on Tuesday, Mr Weston said: \"You might not like the answer, but rain has a big impact on spills.\"\n\nIt comes amid reports that Sir Keir has been briefed that the poor state of Thames Water's physical infrastructure presents a \"critical risk\" to the country.\n\nFears about the company include its management of sites that provide drinking water and sewage treatment for London and the Thames Valley, The Guardian newspaper reported.\n\nThames Water said it spent \u00a32 billion on maintaining and updating its infrastructure last year.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

They had wanted to raise bills by an average of 33%, to invest 105 billion pounds.\n\nBritain's water industry has been in the firing line over the amount of sewage dumped in its waterways, with critics saying the companies have under-invested for decades while taking out billions of pounds in dividends and paying large bonuses to executives.\n\nOfwat boss David Black told Times Radio the system needs sustained improvements \"but it does need to be done in a way that puts the minimum ask on customers that's possible.\"\n\nHe said the plan would cut sewage spills by 44% by 2030.\n\nIndustry body Water UK slammed Ofwat's proposals, accusing it of failing to tackle crumbling pipes and sewage spills.\n\n\"For far too long, Ofwat has failed to be realistic about the levels of investment needed and what it will take to deliver and maintain necessary infrastructure,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nThames Water, at the centre of the debate about a water industry which was privatized in 1989, wanted to hike bills by a total of 191 pounds over five years, but Ofwat said it would allow a rise of 99 pounds.\n\nThe company said its original plan had been \"ambitious, deliverable, financeable and investible.\" It will now provide more evidence before the regulator's final decision in December.\n\nStruggling under 15 billion pounds of debt, Thames said on Tuesday it would run out of money next year if it did not raise 3.25 billion pounds of equity.\n\nEnvironment minister Steve Reed, appointed after Britain's July 4 election, ordered Ofwat to ensure new funding was ringfenced and not spent on bonuses or dividends.\n\nReed, who will meet water bosses later on Thursday, said he would outline steps in the next months to reform the sector and restore British \"rivers, lakes and seas to good health.\"\n\nThe crisis poses a challenge for new Prime Minister Keir Starmer who wants to boost private investment in Britain, with investors looking at water as a test case.\n\nOfwat set the allowed rate of return paid to investors of water companies at 3.72%, indexed to inflation, saying that would be adequate to attract investment.\n\nIt imposed a new \"turnaround oversight regime\" on Thames, requiring it to provide regular updates on progress.\n\nOfwat's Black told reporters that in time, Thames Water could consider breaking itself up or floating on public markets, but said neither was an immediate solution.\n\nHours before Ofwat's announcement, credit rating firm S&P Global warned it could downgrade Thames' Class A and B debt to 'junk' ratings, making them uninvestable for big pension funds.\n\nOfwat will publish its final decision on bills and investment on Dec. 19.

Over the coming weeks and months, this Government will outline further steps to reform the water sector and restore our rivers, lakes and seas to good health.\"\n\nThe firm has 16 million customers in London and the Thames Valley region and its plans submitted to Ofwat propose raising their bills by 44% between now and 2030.\n\nThe average yearly bill for a Thames customer is \u00a3436 at the moment, but that would rise to \u00a3627 in five years under its plans before factoring in inflation.\n\nThe bills hike will help it fund \u00a319.8 billion of improvements to its network of drains, sewers and reservoirs.\n\nIt has also asked Ofwat to lower the amount it fines the water company for incidents such as sewage spills and leakages.\n\nThames warned on Tuesday that it has only enough money to last it until the end of May 2025 before it goes out of business.\n\nThe water firm is drowning in more than \u00a315 billion of debt, and said on Tuesday that it needs fresh investment in the coming months to keep it afloat.\n\nAlready, existing shareholders pulled the plug on \u00a3500 million-worth of emergency funding in March. Thames said Ofwat's initial assessments of its business plan had made the company \"uninvestible\".\n\nIf it ultimately fails to attract fresh funding, Thames' fraying finances will present Sir Keir Starmer's newly elected Labour Government with a significant industrial crisis.\n\nOfwat's ruling on Thursday is only a draft decision, and kicks off a period of negotiation until its final verdict in December.\n\nBut the regulator has rarely made major deviations between its draft and final rulings in previous years, meaning Thursday's statement will give all parties an indication of how lenient it is likely to be later on.\n\nThe draft decision comes against a backdrop of public anger over the water companies and their role in the degraded state of the country's rivers, lakes and coastal waters, which are facing a perfect storm of creaking water infrastructure, intensive farming, a growing population and climate change.\n\nNot a single river in England is considered to be in good overall health, and beauty spots including Windermere in the Lake District have been hit by sewage spills.\n\nFigures released earlier this year showed storm overflows - which release untreated wastewater into rivers and seas when there is heavy rain to prevent sewers becoming overwhelmed - dumped sewage into the environment for more than 3.6 million hours in 2023.\n\nThe releases are legal, but the environmental watchdog, the Office for Environmental Protection, is investigating the Environment Department (Defra), the Environment Agency and regulator Ofwat over possible failures in regulating sewer overflows.\n\nThey are concerned that discharges have been permitted more often than the \"exceptional circumstances\" allowed by law.\n\nWater utilities have also been hit by large fines for illegal pollution in recent years, with a record \u00a390 million handed to Southern Water in 2021 for 6,971 unpermitted sewage discharges.\n\nOther companies including Thames Water, Severn Trent, South West Water and Yorkshire Water have been handed fines that ran into the millions for massive, damaging or repeated pollution incidents.", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com",

funding.\n\nBritain's biggest water firm, which is creaking under a debt pile of more than \u00a315 billion, said on Tuesday that it had \u00a31.8 billion of cash reserves at the end of June, a fall from \u00a32.4 billion three months previously.\n\nThe firm said it is still looking for new funds needed to maintain and update its infrastructure, after investors pulled the plug on \u00a3500 million of emergency cash earlier this year.\n\nThe days of putting shareholder interest above the national interest, frankly, can't carry on and so we do need to look at that and Thames do need to look at their own house and get it in order Jim McMahon, communities minister\n\nChief executive Chris Weston said Thames had taken \"informal soundings which have shown there is interest in the market\".\n\nHe added that the company will be looking at a \"broad church\" of potential investors which could include existing shareholders.\n\nIf it ultimately fails to attract fresh funding, Thames Water's fraying finances could present Sir Keir Starmer's newly elected Labour Government with a significant industrial crisis.\n\nThames Water is Britain\u00b4s biggest water firm (Rui Vieira/PA)\n\nA blueprint codenamed Project Timber was being drawn up in Whitehall in the spring, according to reports, which could see the company effectively nationalised.\n\nUnder the plans, the company would be placed in a form of special administration in the scenario that its parent company fails.\n\nMr Weston added that it is \"not in the interests\" of customers or investors for the company to fall into Government hands.\n\nCommunities minister Jim McMahon said on Tuesday morning: \"We recognise that, over the last 14 years, frankly, the water industry hasn't been regulated anywhere near as firmly as it should have been, and we haven't seen the investment to deal with the sewage scandal.\"\n\nHe said there is a need for reform and for regulation to be looked at, adding: \"The days of putting shareholder interest above the national interest, frankly, can't carry on and so we do need to look at that and Thames do need to look at their own house and get it in order.\"\n\n350\n\nNumber of pollution incidents, up from 331 last year (Thames Water)\n\nMr McMahon said there is \"no programme of nationalisation for the water industry\" when asked what the plan is if the company collapses.\n\nHe did however say there is \"no provision in law for a water company to stop providing water\", adding: \"We need to be very clear there is always a contingency in place.\"\n\nThames Water's financial update will be followed on Thursday by a draft verdict from Ofwat on water companies' five-year spending plans and bill increases to 2030.\n\nThat will kick off six months of negotiations with Ofwat, ahead of its final decision in December.\n\nThames Water, which has 16 million customers in London and the Thames Valley region, put forward plans in April that would see spending rise to \u00a319.8 billion to update its infrastructure and reduce sewage spills.\n\nHowever, that would also involve increasing customer bills by 44%, a figure which has prompted backlash from consumer groups.\n\nMeanwhile, the process of securing new cash is \"not expected to conclude\" until after Ofwat's final decision on Thames' business plan in December.\n\nYou might not like the answer, but rain has a big impact on spills Chris Weston, Thames Water\n\nAny increase in bills would be greeted with anger, after Thames Water and other water companies' disastrous recent environmental records sparked a nationwide scandal over pollution.\n\nThames said pollution incidents increased to 350, up on 331 last year, which it blamed on a rainier-than-expected year.\n\nThe number of \"serious pollutions\" decreased by 18%, Thames Water said.\n\nWhen questioned on the issue on Tuesday, Mr Weston said: \"You might not like the answer, but rain has a big impact on spills.\"\n\nIt comes amid reports that Sir Keir has been briefed that the poor state of Thames Water's physical infrastructure presents a \"critical risk\" to the country.\n\nFears about the company include its management of sites that provide drinking water and sewage treatment for London and the Thames Valley, The Guardian newspaper reported.\n\nThames Water said it spent \u00a32 billion on

An independent monitor could also be appointed to ensure the company remains financially stable.\n\nThames had requested a bill rise of \u00a3191 from \u00a3436 to \u00a3627 but the regulator said the company should be only allowed a \u00a399 rise.\n\nThe company is facing a funding crisis after warning on Tuesday that it will run out of cash by May 2025, risking a collapse into special administration under the new Labour government.\n\nIt is struggling under \u00a315bn of debts and has \u00a31.85bn of cash to see it through to next spring.\n\nCustomer bills are set to rise by \u00a394 over the next five years on average, which is a third less than the bill increase requested by Britain's 16 water companies. This works out at an increase of \u00a319 per year.\n\nOn average, companies had requested a \u00a3144 increase for ratepayers but Ofwat rejected the plan and has provisionally granted the smaller increase.\n\nSouthern Water has suffered one of the steepest cuts to its request, with its plea for a \u00a3306 hike cut to \u00a3183 by the regulator.\n\nOn investment, which is funded by bill increases, Ofwat said water groups can spend \u00a388bn, which is \u00a316bn lower than they requested.\n\nOfwat chief executive David Black said: \"Customers want to see radical change in the way water companies care for the environment.\n\n\"Our draft decisions on company plans approve a tripling of investment to make sustained improvement to customer service and the environment at a fair price for customers.\"\n\n\"Let me be very clear to water companies. We will be closely scrutinising the delivery of their plans and will hold them to account to deliver real improvements to the environment and for customers and on their investment programmes.\"\n\nOfwat has opened a consultation into its proposed bill rates, which closes on Aug 28. A final decision is expected in December.\n\nThames proposed plans in April to Ofwat to boost spending to \u00a319.8bn as it seeks to upgrade its infrastructure and cut spills of sewage, but that would be funded by a large hike in bills.\n\nThe company has said bills must rise to make the company \"investable\" and an attractive proposition for any investors.\n\nIts current shareholders have so far refused to put any more money into the group until its finances and Ofwat's decision become clear. They refused to inject \u00a3500m of capital into the company earlier this year due to the uncertainty.\n\nOfwat's decision is a draft determination meaning water companies and the regulator will continue negotiations until the final decision in December.\n\nThames Water chief executive Chris Weston said on Tuesday the draft determination was not the \"end of the road\".\n\n\"We would expect continued engagement with Ofwat between the draft determination and final determination to work out what that means for our revenue and what it means for customers in the period up to 2030,\" he said.\n\n\"There will be a huge amount of detail. It is going to take us a while to unpack that and understand exactly what it means for us.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

of cash reserves at the end of June, a fall from \u00a32.4 billion three months previously.\n\nThe firm said it is still looking for new funds needed to maintain and update its infrastructure, after investors pulled the plug on \u00a3500 million of emergency cash earlier this year.\n\nChief executive Chris Weston said Thames had taken \"informal soundings which have shown there is interest in the market\".\n\nHe added that the company will be looking at a \"broad church\" of potential investors which could include existing shareholders.\n\nIf it ultimately fails to attract fresh funding, Thames Water's fraying finances could present Sir Keir Starmer's newly elected Labour Government with a significant industrial crisis.\n\nA blueprint codenamed Project Timber was being drawn up in Whitehall in the spring, according to reports, which could see the company effectively nationalised.\n\nUnder the plans, the company would be placed in a form of special administration in the scenario that its parent company fails.\n\nMr Weston added that it is \"not in the interests\" of customers or investors for the company to fall into Government hands.\n\nCommunities minister Jim McMahon said on Tuesday morning: \"We recognise that, over the last 14 years, frankly, the water industry hasn't been regulated anywhere near as firmly as it should have been, and we haven't seen the investment to deal with the sewage scandal.\"\n\nHe said there is a need for reform and for regulation to be looked at, adding: \"The days of putting shareholder interest above the national interest, frankly, can't carry on and so we do need to look at that and Thames do need to look at their own house and get it in order.\"\n\nMr McMahon said there is \"no programme of nationalisation for the water industry\" when asked what the plan is if the company collapses.\n\nHe did however say there is \"no provision in law for a water company to stop providing water\", adding: \"We need to be very clear there is always a contingency in place.\"\n\nThames Water's financial update will be followed on Thursday by a draft verdict from Ofwat on water companies' five-year spending plans and bill increases to 2030.\n\nThat will kick off six months of negotiations with Ofwat, ahead of its final decision in December.\n\nThames Water, which has 16 million customers in London and the Thames Valley region, put forward plans in April that would see spending rise to \u00a319.8 billion to update its infrastructure and reduce sewage spills.\n\nHowever, that would also involve increasing customer bills by 44%, a figure which has prompted backlash from consumer groups.\n\nMeanwhile, the process of securing new cash is \"not expected to conclude\" until after Ofwat's final decision on Thames' business plan in December.\n\nAny increase in bills would be greeted with anger, after Thames Water and other water companies' disastrous recent environmental records sparked a nationwide scandal over pollution.\n\nThames said pollution incidents increased to 350, up on 331 last year, which it blamed on a rainier-than-expected year.\n\nThe number of \"serious pollutions\" decreased by 18%, Thames Water said.\n\nWhen questioned on the issue on Tuesday, Mr Weston said: \"You might not like the answer, but rain has a big impact on spills.\"\n\nIt comes amid reports that Sir Keir has been briefed that the poor state of Thames Water's physical infrastructure presents a \"critical risk\" to the country.\n\nFears about the company include its management of sites that provide drinking water and sewage treatment for London and the Thames Valley, The Guardian newspaper reported.\n\nThames Water said it spent \u00a32 billion on maintaining and updating its infrastructure last year.\n\nThe Prime

will run out of cash in May 2025 amid scramble for funding", "body": "Thames Water has warned that it will run out of money by the end of next May, as the heavily indebted company intensifies efforts to secure fresh funding.\n\nBritain's biggest water firm, which is creaking under a debt pile of more than \u00a315 billion, said on Tuesday that it had \u00a31.8 billion of cash reserves at the end of June, a fall from \u00a32.4 billion three months previously.\n\nThe firm said it is still looking for new funds needed to maintain and update its infrastructure, after investors pulled the plug on \u00a3500 million of emergency cash earlier this year.\n\nThe days of putting shareholder interest above the national interest, frankly, can't carry on and so we do need to look at that and Thames do need to look at their own house and get it in order\n\nChief executive Chris Weston said Thames had taken \"informal soundings which have shown there is interest in the market\".\n\nHe added that the company will be looking at a \"broad church\" of potential investors which could include existing shareholders.\n\nIf it ultimately fails to attract fresh funding, Thames Water's fraying finances could present Sir Keir Starmer's newly elected Labour Government with a significant industrial crisis.\n\nA blueprint codenamed Project Timber was being drawn up in Whitehall in the spring, according to reports, which could see the company effectively nationalised.\n\nUnder the plans, the company would be placed in a form of special administration in the scenario that its parent company fails.\n\nMr Weston added that it is \"not in the interests\" of customers or investors for the company to fall into Government hands.\n\nCommunities minister Jim McMahon said on Tuesday morning: \"We recognise that, over the last 14 years, frankly, the water industry hasn't been regulated anywhere near as firmly as it should have been, and we haven't seen the investment to deal with the sewage scandal.\"\n\nHe said there is a need for reform and for regulation to be looked at, adding: \"The days of putting shareholder interest above the national interest, frankly, can't carry on and so we do need to look at that and Thames do need to look at their own house and get it in order.\"\n\nMr McMahon said there is \"no programme of nationalisation for the water industry\" when asked what the plan is if the company collapses.\n\nHe did however say there is \"no provision in law for a water company to stop providing water\", adding: \"We need to be very clear there is always a contingency in place.\"\n\nThames Water's financial update will be followed on Thursday by a draft verdict from Ofwat on water companies' five-year spending plans and bill increases to 2030.\n\nThat will kick off six months of negotiations with Ofwat, ahead of its final decision in December.\n\nThames Water, which has 16 million customers in London and the Thames Valley region, put forward plans in April that would see spending rise to \u00a319.8 billion to update its infrastructure and reduce sewage spills.\n\nHowever, that would also involve increasing customer bills by 44%, a figure which has prompted backlash from consumer groups.\n\nMeanwhile, the process of securing new cash is \"not expected to conclude\" until after Ofwat's final decision on Thames' business plan in December.\n\nYou might not like the answer, but rain has a big impact on spills\n\nAny increase in bills would be greeted with anger, after Thames Water and other water companies' disastrous recent environmental records sparked a nationwide scandal over pollution.\n\nThames said pollution incidents increased to 350, up on 331 last year, which it blamed on a rainier-than-expected year.\n\nThe number of \"serious pollutions\" decreased by 18%, Thames Water said.\n\nWhen questioned on the issue on Tuesday, Mr Weston said: \"You might not like the answer, but rain has a big impact on spills.\"\n\nIt comes amid reports that Sir Keir has been briefed that the poor state of Thames Water's physical infrastructure presents a \"critical risk\" to the country.\n\nFears about the company include its management of sites that provide drinking water and sewage treatment for London and the Thames Valley, The Guardian newspaper reported.\n\nThames Water said it spent \u00a32 billion on maintaining and updating its infrastructure last year.\n\nThe Prime Minister's official spokesman told reporters on Monday: \"The Government has said in its manifesto that we will put failing water companies into special measures and they will have no choice but to clean up their act.\n\n\"We talked about giving regulators the power to block payment of bonuses to executives who pollute our waterways and impose automatic and severe fines on them for wrongdoing.\"", "source": {"uri": "kentonline.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Kent Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

of cash reserves at the end of June, a fall from \u00a32.4 billion three months previously.\n\nThe firm said it is still looking for new funds needed to maintain and update its infrastructure, after investors pulled the plug on \u00a3500 million of emergency cash earlier this year.\n\nChief executive Chris Weston said Thames had taken \"informal soundings which have shown there is interest in the market\".\n\nHe added that the company will be looking at a \"broad church\" of potential investors which could include existing shareholders.\n\nIf it ultimately fails to attract fresh funding, Thames Water's fraying finances could present Sir Keir Starmer's newly elected Labour Government with a significant industrial crisis.\n\nA blueprint codenamed Project Timber was being drawn up in Whitehall in the spring, according to reports, which could see the company effectively nationalised.\n\nUnder the plans, the company would be placed in a form of special administration in the scenario that its parent company fails.\n\nMr Weston added that it is \"not in the interests\" of customers or investors for the company to fall into Government hands.\n\nCommunities minister Jim McMahon said on Tuesday morning: \"We recognise that, over the last 14 years, frankly, the water industry hasn't been regulated anywhere near as firmly as it should have been, and we haven't seen the investment to deal with the sewage scandal.\"\n\nHe said there is a need for reform and for regulation to be looked at, adding: \"The days of putting shareholder interest above the national interest, frankly, can't carry on and so we do need to look at that and Thames do need to look at their own house and get it in order.\"\n\nMr McMahon said there is \"no programme of nationalisation for the water industry\" when asked what the plan is if the company collapses.\n\nHe did however say there is \"no provision in law for a water company to stop providing water\", adding: \"We need to be very clear there is always a contingency in place.\"\n\nThames Water's financial update will be followed on Thursday by a draft verdict from Ofwat on water companies' five-year spending plans and bill increases to 2030.\n\nThat will kick off six months of negotiations with Ofwat, ahead of its final decision in December.\n\nThames Water, which has 16 million customers in London and the Thames Valley region, put forward plans in April that would see spending rise to \u00a319.8 billion to update its infrastructure and reduce sewage spills.\n\nHowever, that would also involve increasing customer bills by 44%, a figure which has prompted backlash from consumer groups.\n\nMeanwhile, the process of securing new cash is \"not expected to conclude\" until after Ofwat's final decision on Thames' business plan in December.\n\nAny increase in bills would be greeted with anger, after Thames Water and other water companies' disastrous recent environmental records sparked a nationwide scandal over pollution.\n\nThames said pollution incidents increased to 350, up on 331 last year, which it blamed on a rainier-than-expected year.\n\nThe number of \"serious pollutions\" decreased by 18%, Thames Water said.\n\nWhen questioned on the issue on Tuesday, Mr Weston said: \"You might not like the answer, but rain has a big impact on spills.\"\n\nIt comes amid reports that Sir Keir has been briefed that the poor state of Thames Water's physical infrastructure presents a \"critical risk\" to the country.\n\nFears about the company include its management of sites that provide drinking water and sewage treatment for London and the Thames Valley, The Guardian newspaper reported.\n\nThames Water said it spent \u00a32 billion on maintaining and updating its infrastructure last year.", "source":

It is the first time a water company has faced such measures.\n\nThe regulator made the announcement as it published its draft review on English and Welsh water companies' business plans which showed bills will rise by \u00a394 on average in England and Wales over the next five years. The plans proposed sums which companies intend to charge customers between 2025 and 2030.\n\nThe review said customers of Thames Water, which is Britain's biggest water company, will face a 22% increase in their bills over the next five years.\n\nOfwat said Thames would be allowed to increase bills by \u00a399 to \u00a3535, \u00a392 less than the company had proposed. Thames, which serves 16 million customers across London and the south-east, had asked the regulator to raise bills by 44% over the next five years.\n\nThe price review is seen as crucial for the future of Thames Water, which is creaking under \u00a315.2bn of debt. The company said this week that, after the review, it would approach potential investors this autumn, before Ofwat's final verdict in December.\n\nOver the next five years, Thames has been tasked with reduce sewage spills by 64%, cutting leaks by 19% and reducing supply interruptions by two-thirds.\n\nThe regulator said: \"Thames Water faces significant issues, and as it seeks to tackle them, our draft determinations will support a major investment programme but also subject the company to new, heightened regulatory measures.\"\n\nAs a result of being put into the regime, Thames will have to provide a \"delivery action plan\" and regularly report on the progress of its spending programme. It will also have to provide a \"financial resilience plan\" and could be scrutinised by an independent monitor, who would be given full access to company information.\n\nIn order to exit the regime, the company could be limited in the amount of debt it can take on, separate the business into two or more companies or list the business on the stock exchange to secure extra equity.\n\nThames revised an original \u00a318.7bn spending plan submitted in October 2023 up to \u00a319.8bn.

We will get a grip of that.\"\n\nThe regulator said water firms had proposed increases averaging \u00a3144 over five years.\n\nFor example, Thames Water's planned rise of \u00a3191 by 2030 has been reduced to \u00a399, while Severn Trent's proposed increase of \u00a3144 has been cut to \u00a393.\n\nThere are significant variations in price changes between suppliers.\n\nUnder the plans, Southern Water customers will face a \u00a3183 increase over five years, while Dwr Cymru customers' bills will go up by \u00a3137 and Yorkshire Water customers will pay \u00a3107 more.\n\nAt the other end of the scale, Affinity customers will see just an \u00a311 rise, while SES customers' bills will fall by \u00a334 on the previous five years.\n\nOfwat chief executive David Black said: \"Customers want to see radical change in the way water companies care for the environment. Our draft decisions on company plans approve a tripling of investment to make sustained improvement to customer service and the environment at a fair price for customers.\n\n\"These proposals aim to deliver a 44% reduction in spills from storm overflows compared to levels in 2021. We expect all companies to embrace innovation and go further and faster to reduce spills wherever possible.\n\n\"Today's announcement also increases the resilience of our water supplies to the impact of climate change and will reduce how much water is taken from rivers by enabling a range of long-term water supply projects, which includes plans for nine reservoirs.\n\n\"Let me be very clear to water companies - we will be closely scrutinising the delivery of their plans and will hold them to account to deliver real improvements to the environment and for customers and on their investment programmes.\"\n\nA Water UK spokesman said: \"Today's announcement is the biggest ever cut in investment by Ofwat. If it doesn't put this right Ofwat will be repeating the mistakes of the past. As a direct result, more housing will be blocked, the recovery of our rivers will be slower and we will fail to deal with the water shortages we know are coming.\n\n\"Water companies proposed to invest \u00a3105 billion because it is the minimum needed to meet the legitimate concerns we've heard from the public about our environment and our economy.\n\n\"Ofwat is right to want to ensure customers receive value for money and that is why protections are in place to ensure customers only pay for projects that are new, necessary and value for money.\n\n\"But for far too long Ofwat has failed to be realistic about the levels of investment needed and what it will take to deliver and maintain necessary infrastructure. We cannot allow this pattern to repeat itself.\n\n\"Water companies are ready to invest in an unprecedented overhaul of the country's water and sewage infrastructure. Ofwat now needs to let them get on with it.\"\n\nMike Keil, chief executive of the Consumer Council for Water (CCW), said: \"Millions of people will feel upset and anxious at the prospect of these water bill rises and question the fairness of them given some water companies' track record of failure and poor service.\n\n\"Customers understand investment is urgently needed but they need reassurance that every pound of their money is going to be well spent.\n\n\"Trust in water companies has never been lower and that won't change until people see and experience a difference - whether that's having the confidence to swim at their favourite beach or receiving help if they are struggling to pay their bill.\n\n\"We estimate about two million households in England and Wales currently cannot afford their water bill and, while the increase in financial assistance is welcome, it falls short of what is needed.\n\n\"Over the summer we'll be carrying out research with customers of every water company to gauge whether they feel the regulator's proposals are affordable and deliver what people want.

despite growing debt and surge in sewage spills", "body": "Thames Water's chief executive has defended his bonus package despite the company's growing debt and increase in sewage spills.\n\nChris Weston said his bonus was based \"purely on performance\" and claimed rewards for senior staff members are needed \"to be able to attract the right talent\".\n\nBritain's biggest water firm was responsible for 16,990 sewage discharges last year compared to 8,015 in 2022 while serious pollution incidents rose from 331 to 350 in that time.\n\nIt also comes as the company warned on Tuesday that it will run out of money by the end of next May due to their increasing debt and falling cash reserves, with their efforts to secure fresh funding intensifying.\n\nThames Water's bonus payments were revealed in its full-year results on Thursday and showed that Mr Weston received \u00a3195,000 following his appointment in January, taking his total pay to \u00a3437,000 for the three months to the end of March.\n\nAlastair Cochran, Thames Water's chief financial officer, was given a \u00a3446,000 bonus, after previously stepping in as the company's interim co-chief executive.\n\nWhen asked about executives bonuses on Tuesday, Mr Weston said: \"You need to be able to attract the right talent, the best talent to that company and going hand in glove with that is an appropriate remuneration package.\"\n\nThames Water is creaking under a debt pile of more than \u00a315 billion and said on Tuesday that it had \u00a31.8 billion of cash reserves at the end of June, a fall from \u00a32.4 billion three months previously.\n\nThe firm said it is still looking for new funds needed to maintain and update its infrastructure, after investors pulled the plug on \u00a3500 million of emergency cash earlier this year.\n\nMr Weston said Thames had taken \"informal soundings which have shown there is interest in the market\".\n\nHe added that the company will be looking at a \"broad church\" of potential investors which could include existing shareholders.\n\nIf it ultimately fails to attract fresh funding, Thames Water's fraying finances could present Sir Keir Starmer's newly elected Labour Government with a significant industrial crisis.\n\nA blueprint codenamed Project Timber was being drawn up in Whitehall in the spring, according to reports, which could see the company effectively nationalised.\n\nUnder the plans, the company would be placed in a form of special administration in the scenario that its parent company fails.\n\nMr Weston added that it is \"not in the interests\" of customers or investors for the company to fall into Government hands.\n\nCommunities minister Jim McMahon said on Tuesday morning: \"We recognise that, over the last 14 years, frankly, the water industry hasn't been regulated anywhere near as firmly as it should have been, and we haven't seen the investment to deal with the sewage scandal.\"\n\nHe said there is a need for reform and for regulation to be looked at, adding: \"The days of putting shareholder interest above the national interest, frankly, can't carry on and so we do need to look at that and Thames do need to look at their own house and get it in order.\"\n\nMr McMahon said there is \"no programme of nationalisation for the water industry\" when asked what the plan is if the company collapses.\n\nHe did however say there is \"no provision in law for a water company to stop providing water\", adding: \"We need to be very clear there is always a contingency in place.\"\n\nThames Water's financial update will be followed on Thursday by a draft verdict from Ofwat on water companies' five-year spending plans and bill increases to 2030.\n\nThat will kick off six months of negotiations with Ofwat, ahead of its final decision in December.\n\nThames Water, which has 16 million customers in London and the Thames Valley region, put forward plans in April that would see spending rise to \u00a319.8 billion to update its infrastructure and reduce sewage spills.\n\nHowever, that would also involve increasing customer bills by 44 per cent, a figure which has prompted backlash from consumer groups.\n\nMeanwhile, the process of securing new cash is \"not expected to conclude\" until after Ofwat's final decision on Thames' business plan in December.\n\nRead More: Jeremy Hunt says he's 'very cross' at Thames water asking for bill payers to 'bail them out' with bill rises\n\nRead More: Thames water set to hike your water bills by 44% as it battles to survive under billions of pounds of debt\n\nAny increase in bills would be greeted with anger, after Thames Water and other water companies' disastrous recent environmental records sparked a nationwide scandal over pollution.\n\nThames said pollution incidents increased to 350, up on 331 last year, which it blamed on a rainier-than-expected year.\n\nThe number of \"serious pollutions\" decreased by 18 per cent, Thames Water said.\n\nWhen questioned on the issue on Tuesday, Mr Weston said: \"You might not like the answer, but rain has a big impact on spills.\"\n\nIt comes amid reports that Sir Keir has been briefed that the poor state of Thames Water's physical infrastructure presents a \"critical risk\" to the country.\n\nFears about the company include its management of sites that provide drinking water and sewage treatment for London and the Thames Valley, The Guardian newspaper reported.\n\nThames Water said it spent \u00a32 billion on maintaining and updating its infrastructure last year.\n\nThe Prime Minister's official spokesman told reporters on Monday: \"The Government has said in its manifesto that we will put failing water companies into special measures and they will have no choice but to clean up their act.\n\n\"We talked about giving regulators the power to block payment of bonuses to executives who pollute our waterways and impose automatic and severe fines on them for wrongdoing.\"", "source": {"uri": "lbc.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "LBC"}, "authors": [{"uri": "will_conroy@lbc.co.uk", "name": "Will Conroy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}],

We will get a grip of that.\"\n\nThe regulator said water firms had proposed increases averaging \u00a3144 over five years.\n\nFor example, Thames Water's planned rise of \u00a3191 by 2030 has been reduced to \u00a399, while Severn Trent's proposed increase of \u00a3144 has been cut to \u00a393.\n\nThere are significant variations in price changes between suppliers.\n\nUnder the plans, Southern Water customers will face a \u00a3183 increase over five years, while Dwr Cymru customers' bills will go up by \u00a3137 and Yorkshire Water customers will pay \u00a3107 more.\n\nAt the other end of the scale, Affinity customers will see just an \u00a311 rise, while SES customers' bills will fall by \u00a334 on the previous five years.\n\nOfwat chief executive David Black said: \"Customers want to see radical change in the way water companies care for the environment. Our draft decisions on company plans approve a tripling of investment to make sustained improvement to customer service and the environment at a fair price for customers.\n\n\"These proposals aim to deliver a 44% reduction in spills from storm overflows compared to levels in 2021. We expect all companies to embrace innovation and go further and faster to reduce spills wherever possible.\n\n\"Today's announcement also increases the resilience of our water supplies to the impact of climate change and will reduce how much water is taken from rivers by enabling a range of long-term water supply projects, which includes plans for nine reservoirs.\n\n\"Let me be very clear to water companies - we will be closely scrutinising the delivery of their plans and will hold them to account to deliver real improvements to the environment and for customers and on their investment programmes.\"\n\nA Water UK spokesman said: \"Today's announcement is the biggest ever cut in investment by Ofwat. If it doesn't put this right Ofwat will be repeating the mistakes of the past. As a direct result, more housing will be blocked, the recovery of our rivers will be slower and we will fail to deal with the water shortages we know are coming.\n\n\"Water companies proposed to invest \u00a3105 billion because it is the minimum needed to meet the legitimate concerns we've heard from the public about our environment and our economy.\n\n\"Ofwat is right to want to ensure customers receive value for money and that is why protections are in place to ensure customers only pay for projects that are new, necessary and value for money.\n\n\"But for far too long Ofwat has failed to be realistic about the levels of investment needed and what it will take to deliver and maintain necessary infrastructure. We cannot allow this pattern to repeat itself.\n\n\"Water companies are ready to invest in an unprecedented overhaul of the country's water and sewage infrastructure. Ofwat now needs to let them get on with it.\"\n\nMike Keil, chief executive of the Consumer Council for Water (CCW), said: \"Millions of people will feel upset and anxious at the prospect of these water bill rises and question the fairness of them given some water companies' track record of failure and poor service.\n\n\"Customers understand investment is urgently needed but they need reassurance that every pound of their money is going to be well spent.\n\n\"Trust in water companies has never been lower and that won't change until people see and experience a difference - whether that's having the confidence to swim at their favourite beach or receiving help if they are struggling to pay their bill.\n\n\"We estimate about two million households in England and Wales currently cannot afford their water bill and, while the increase in financial assistance is welcome, it falls short of what is needed.\n\n\"Over the summer we'll be carrying out research with customers of every water company to gauge whether they feel the regulator's proposals are affordable and deliver what people want. We expect Ofwat to listen and act on what customers tell us.\"\n\nThe proposals are part of the 2024 Price Review (PR24) and cover the period from 1 April 2025 to 31 March 2030, ahead of a final decision at the end of the year.\n\nOfwat said the average 21% bill increase, around \u00a319 per year, follows firms' proposals to increase their total spending by \u00a329 billion, split between a \u00a35 billion increase in the core costs for running their business and a \u00a324 billion rise in spending to meet requirements set by governments and for other environmental improvements.\n\nOfwat said its scrutiny of companies' cost proposals, to ensure they deliver efficiently, has led to a \u00a316 billion reduction.\n\nHowever the proposed bill increases come amid public fury around firms' polluting of waterways with sewage spills as they continue to hand dividends to shareholders, and bonuses to executives - something which Labour has pledged to clamp down on.\n\nSewage spills into England's rivers and seas more than doubled in 2023.\n\nAccording to the Environment Agency, there were 3.6 million hours of spills last year - equal to about 400 years - compared with 1.75 million hours in 2022.\n\nThe large amount of water lost to leaks in the system also raises widespread concerns, particularly in dry periods when consumers face hosepipe bans.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "josie_clarke@aol.co.uk", "name": "Josie Clarke", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofwat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ofwat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Reeves", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rachel Reeves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Water industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor of the Exchequer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Reed_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Reed (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Water", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thames Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England and Wales"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sewage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Effects of climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Water", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southern Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Severn", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "River Severn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_scarcity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Water scarcity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkshire_Water", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yorkshire Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reservoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Water supply"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Council_for_Water", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumer Council for Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Environment Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "wgt": 39}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Sanitary_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Sanitary Engineering", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Water_Parks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Water Parks", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/pTKuCQvSvfBTNT4UXChE2g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_press_association_news_966/7bff008a253a942e5b2091def17659ea", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717113", "eventUri": "eng-9717113", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

They are currently seeking new funds to maintain and update their infrastructure, following the withdrawal of \u00a3500million in emergency funds by investors earlier this year.\n\nChris Weston, the Chief Executive Officer, said that Thames had taken \"informal soundings which have shown there is interest in the market\". His intentions for the company are to seek a \"broad church\" of investors, which could possibly include existing shareholders. If Thames Water fails to secure additional funding, this could pose a significant industrial crisis for Sir Keir Starmer's recently elected Labour Government.\n\nWhitehall was reportedly working on a plan named Project Timber during spring, that could result in the company effectively being nationalised.

Thames Water, serving 16 million customers across London and the Thames Valley, has pitched a plan in April to hike spending to \u00a319.8 billion to modernise infrastructure and cut down on sewage leaks.\n\nYet, this proposal comes with a 44% increase in customer bills, sparking outrage among consumer advocacy groups. The quest for fresh funding is \"not expected to conclude\" until after Ofwat's final verdict on Thames' business strategy in December. Any potential hike in bills would likely spark outrage, especially given Thames Water and other water firms' abysmal environmental track records, which have ignited a national outcry over pollution issues.\n\nThames Water has admitted to an increase in pollution incidents, with figures rising to 350 from 331 the previous year, attributing the spike to an unexpectedly wet year. However, the company has reported an 18% reduction in \"serious pollutions\" according to Thames Water.\n\nDuring a grilling on the matter this Tuesday, Mr Weston remarked: \"You might not like the answer, but rain has a big impact on spills.\" This news emerges alongside reports that Sir Keir Starmer has received briefings warning of the dire condition of Thames Water's infrastructure, posing a \"critical risk\" to the nation.\n\nConcerns about the firm encompass its management of facilities that supply drinking water and sewage services to London and the Thames Valley, as reported by The Guardian. In response to these challenges, Thames Water says it invested \u00a32billion last year in maintaining and upgrading its infrastructure.\n\nOn Monday, the Prime Minister's official spokesperson declared: \"The Government has said in its manifesto that we will put failing water companies into special measures and they will have no choice but to clean up their act.\" Further government discussions have centred on empowering regulators to halt bonus payments to executives responsible for polluting waterways and to impose automatic, substantial penalties for such infractions.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lawrence_matheson@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Lawrence Matheson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "alex_daniel@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Alex Daniel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Water", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thames Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Water industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Thames", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "River Thames"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitehall", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Whitehall"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumber", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lumber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nationalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sewage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofwat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ofwat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_ownership", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State ownership"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thames Valley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocacy_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advocacy group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifesto", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manifesto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_water", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drinking water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/article33199322.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_thames-water-is-britains-biggest-water-firm-rui-vieirapa.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717113", "eventUri": "eng-9717113", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

the end of June, a fall from \u00a32.4 billion three months previously.\n\nThe firm said it is still looking for new funds needed to maintain and update its infrastructure, after investors pulled the plug on \u00a3500 million of emergency cash earlier this year.\n\nHe added that the company will be looking at a \"broad church\" of potential investors which could include existing

company would be placed in a form of special administration in the scenario that its parent company fails.\n\nMr Weston added that it is \"not in the interests\" of customers or investors for the company to fall into Government hands.\n\nCommunities minister Jim McMahon said on Tuesday morning: \"We recognise that, over the last 14 years, frankly, the water industry hasn't been regulated anywhere near as firmly as it should have been, and we haven't seen the investment to deal with the sewage scandal.\"\n\nHe said there is a need for reform and for regulation to be looked at, adding: \"The days of putting shareholder interest above the national interest, frankly, can't carry on and so we do need to look at that and Thames do need to look at their own house and get it in order.\"\n\nHe did however say there is \"no provision in law for a water company to stop providing water\", adding: \"We need to be very clear there is always a contingency in place.\"\n\nThames Water's financial update will be followed on Thursday by a draft verdict from Ofwat on water companies' five-year spending plans and bill increases to 2030.\n\nThat will kick off six months of negotiations with Ofwat, ahead of its final decision in December.\n\nThames Water, which has 16 million customers in London and the Thames Valley region, put forward plans in April that would see spending rise to \u00a319.8 billion to update its infrastructure and reduce sewage spills.\n\nHowever, that would also involve increasing customer bills by 44%, a figure which has prompted backlash from consumer groups.\n\nMeanwhile, the process of securing new cash is \"not expected to conclude\" until after Ofwat's final decision on Thames' business plan in December.\n\nThames said pollution incidents increased to 350, up on 331 last year, which it blamed on a rainier-than-expected year.\n\nThe number of \"serious pollutions\" decreased by 18%, Thames Water said.\n\nWhen questioned on the

"body": "Troubled utility firm Thames Water has warned it is months away from bankruptcy.\n\nThe company has said a debt pile of more than \u00a315 billion will soon lead to it bleeding its cash reserve of \u00a31.8 billion dry by next May, which has already fallen from \u00a32.4 billion in just three months.\n\nThe firm said it is still looking for new funds needed to maintain and update its infrastructure after investors pulled the plug on \u00a3500 million of emergency cash earlier this year.\n\nChief executive Chris Weston said Thames had taken \"informal soundings which have shown there is interest in the market\".\n\nHe added that the company will be looking at a \"broad church\" of potential investors which could include existing shareholders.\n\nIf it fails to attract fresh funding, Thames Water's fraying finances could present Sir Keir Starmer's newly elected Labour Government with a significant industrial crisis.\n\nA blueprint codenamed Project Timber was being drawn up in Whitehall in the spring, according to reports, which could see the company effectively nationalised.\n\nUnder the plans, the company would be placed in a form of special administration in the scenario that its parent company fails.\n\nCommunities minister Jim McMahon said on Tuesday morning: \"We recognise that, over the last 14 years, frankly, the water industry hasn't been regulated anywhere near as firmly as it should have been, and we haven't seen the investment to deal with the sewage scandal.\"\n\nHe said there is a need for reform and for regulation to be looked at, adding: \"The days of putting shareholder interest above the national interest, frankly, can't carry on and so we do need to look at that and Thames do need to look at their own house and get it in order.\"\n\nMr McMahon said there is \"no programme of nationalisation for the water industry\" when asked what the plan is if the company collapses.\n\nThames Water's financial update will be followed on Thursday by a draft verdict from Ofwat on water companies' five-year spending plans and bill increases to 2030.\n\nThat will kick off six months of negotiations with Ofwat, ahead of its final decision in December.\n\nThames Water, which has 16 million customers in London and the Thames Valley region, put forward plans in April that would see spending rise to \u00a319.8 billion to update its infrastructure and reduce sewage spills.\n\nBut that would also involve increasing customer bills by 44 per cent, a figure which has prompted backlash from consumer groups.\n\nMeanwhile, the process of securing new cash is \"not expected to conclude\" until after Ofwat's final decision on Thames' business plan in December.\n\nAny increase in bills would be greeted with anger after Thames Water and other water companies' disastrous recent environmental records sparked a nationwide scandal over pollution.\n\nThames said pollution incidents increased to 350, up on 331 last year, which it blamed on a rainier-than-expected year.\n\nThe number of \"serious pollutions\" decreased by 18 per cent, Thames Water said.\n\nWhen questioned on the issue on Tuesday, Mr Weston said: \"You might not like the answer, but rain has a big impact on spills.\"\n\nIt comes amid reports that Sir Keir has been briefed that the poor state of Thames Water's physical infrastructure presents a \"critical risk\" to the country.\n\nThe Prime Minister's official spokesman told reporters on Monday: \"The Government has said in its manifesto that we will put failing water companies into special measures and they will have no choice but to clean up their act.\n\n\"We talked about giving regulators the power to block payment of bonuses to executives who pollute our waterways and impose automatic and severe fines on them for wrongdoing.", "source": {"uri": "swindonadvertiser.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Adver Sport Desk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The regulator stated that water companies had proposed increases averaging \u00a3144 over five years.\n\nFor instance, Thames Water's proposed increase of \u00a3191 by 2030 has been reduced to \u00a399, while Severn Trent's proposed rise of \u00a3144 has been cut to \u00a393.\n\nMike Keil, chief executive of the Consumer Council for Water (CCW), said: \"Millions of people will feel upset and anxious at the prospect of these water bill rises and question the fairness of them given some water companies' track record of failure and poor service.\n\n\"Customers understand investment is urgently needed but they need reassurance that every pound of their money is going to be well spent.\"\n\nThere are notable differences in price changes among the firms, so how much your bill could rise depends on where you live. Here is everything you need to know.\n\nMost people in England and Wales receive their water from one of 17 companies and have their wastewater managed by one of 11 companies. Households cannot choose their supplier; it depends on their location.\n\nThe water regulator Ofwat determines the service levels and costs to maintain efficient services through five-year \"price reviews.\" Each water company creates a five-year plan for services and household bills.\n\nWhile Ofwat sets limits, water and sewerage companies in England and Wales ultimately decide household charges. As a result, bills vary regionally, with factors like inflation, company performance and household income affecting individual payments.\n\nOfwat's proposals are part of the 2024 Price Review (PR24) and cover the period from 1 April 2025 to 31 March 2030, ahead of a final decision at the end of the year.\n\nOfwat said that water bills will go up by an average of 21%, or about \u00a319 per year. The increase comes after water companies proposed to spend an extra \u00a329 billion, split between \u00a35 billion for their basic running costs and \u00a324 billion more for meeting government requirements and making environmental improvements.\n\nOfwat reviewed these spending plans to make sure they are efficient, and reduced the proposed spending by \u00a316 billion.\n\nThe proposed bill increases come amid public fury around firms' rampant polluting of waterways with sewage spills as they continue to hand dividends to shareholders, and bonuses to executives - something which the new Labour government has pledged to clamp down on.\n\nSewage spills into England's rivers and seas more than doubled in 2023. According to the Environment Agency, there were 3.6 million hours of spills last year - equal to about 400 years - compared with 1.75 million hours in 2022.\n\nThe large amount of water lost to leaks in the system also raises widespread concerns, particularly in dry periods when consumers face hosepipe bans.\n\nThe Greens have joined the Liberal Democrats in condemning price increases from water companies after the regulator announced customer bills would rise over the next five years. MP Sian Berry called on Keir Starmer to \"show real leadership\" and put all firms into public hands.\n\n\"The provision of such a basic human right should not be based on profit,\" she said. \"The idea that water companies will hike bills while so many people are struggling to get to the end of the month is horrific.\n\nShe added: \"Meanwhile, some companies, like Thames Water, are still paying shareholder dividends, which is deplorable.\"\n\nThere are significant variations in price changes between firms. Under the plans, Southern Water customers will face a \u00a3183 increase over five years, while Dwr Cymru customers' bills will go up by \u00a3137 and Yorkshire Water customers will pay \u00a3107 more.\n\nAt the other end of the scale, Affinity customers will see just an \u00a311 rise, while SES customers' bills will fall by \u00a334 on the previous five years.\n\nOfwat chief executive David Black said: \"Let me be very clear to water companies - we will be closely scrutinising the delivery of their plans and will hold them to account to deliver real improvements to the environment and for customers and on their investment programmes.\"\n\nTo find your local water provider, check your latest water bill, which will typically list the name of your water provider - look for company logos or contact information.\n\nYou can also visit the Consumer Council for Water (CCW) website, which provides a tool to help you identify your water provider based on your postcode.\n\nThe Ofwat website also lists all water companies operating in England and Wales - look for the \"Find your water company\" section.\n\nIf you're still having no luck, your local council or authority can also provide information about your local water supplier.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_nelson@thestar.co.uk", "name": "Alex Nelson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofwat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ofwat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Water industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England and Wales"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Water", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thames Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Severn", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "River Severn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Council_for_Water", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer Council for Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewerage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sewerage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wastewater", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wastewater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sewage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Democrats_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberal Democrats (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Water", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southern Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Party_of_England_and_Wales", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Green Party of England and Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Environment Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkshire_Water", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yorkshire Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "wgt": 46}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Sanitary_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Sanitary Engineering", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Water_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Water Basketball", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Water_Parks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Water Parks", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://www.thestar.co.uk/jpim-static/image/2024/07/11/9/43/GettyImages-1519932122.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75&crop=3:2,smart&trim=", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717113", "eventUri": "eng-9717113", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Thames Water, the country's largest water company, asked for a 44% increase.\n\nOfwat published its initial draft ruling on the plans on Thursday. Most firms were told they would not be allowed to raise bills by as much as they asked.\n\nThe average rise proposed by Ofwat is 21%, about a third less than the average increase requested by companies.\n\n- What's the damage?\n\nWater firms wanted to raise bills by \u00a3144 on average over the next five years, but Ofwat has cut that.\n\nFor example, Thames Water planned a rise of \u00a3191 by 2030, but that has been reduced to \u00a399.\n\nThere are significant variations in price changes between firms.\n\nUnder the plans, Southern Water customers will face a \u00a3183 increase over five years, while Dwr Cymru customers' bills will go up by \u00a3137.\n\nAt the other end of the scale, Affinity customers will see just an \u00a311 rise, while SES customers' bills will fall by \u00a334 on the previous five years.\n\n- Why do they want to raise bills so much?\n\nWater firms face serious problems with their drains, reservoirs and sewers, leading to vast amounts of pollution spilling into rivers and waterways.\n\nThat means firms need to spend billions on upgrading their systems, as well as turn a profit so they can keep getting more investment from shareholders.\n\nTo make matters worse, many face huge debt piles. The 10 biggest water companies have about \u00a360 billion of combined debt.\n\nMike Keil, chief executive of the Consumer Council for Water (CCW), said: \"Millions of people will feel upset and anxious at the prospect of these water bill rises and question the fairness of them given some water companies' track record of failure and poor service.\"\n\n- Why are people angry?\n\nCritics say firms have chronically underinvested in their infrastructure since they were privatised in 1989, while paying out huge shareholder dividends.\n\nIn the 30 years since water firms moved into private hands, not a single major reservoir has been built in England and Wales.\n\nSarah Bentley, Thames Water's previous chief executive, admitted before she resigned that it had been \"hollowed out\" by \"decades of underinvestment\".\n\nNew rules were introduced last year to ensure that water companies do not pay dividends unless they are judged to have delivered for customers and the environment.\n\nMr Keil continued: \"Trust in water companies has never been lower and that won't change until people see and experience a difference, whether that's having the confidence to swim at their favourite beach or receiving help if they are struggling to pay their bill.\"\n\n- Is anyone trying to fix it?\n\nChancellor Rachel Reeves said the Government will \"get a grip\" on the sector.\n\nMr Reed said he would meet representatives from all 16 water companies from across England and Wales on Thursday.\n\nHe said he has written to Ofwat to ask them to make sure funding for vital infrastructure investment is ringfenced and can only be spent on upgrades benefiting customers and the environment.\n\nHe also said that consumers will gain \"new powers to hold water company bosses to account\" through so-called customer panels.\n\nHe said: \"This unacceptable destruction of our waterways should never have been allowed, but change has now begun so it can never happen again.\"\n\n- What happens next?\n\nOfwat's ruling is only a draft decision, and begins a period of negotiation until its final verdict in December.\n\nBut the regulator has rarely made major deviations from its draft and final rulings in previous years.\n\nThat means Thursday's statement gives all parties a rough indication of what the final decision on bills will look like.\n\nIf companies still do not accept Ofwat's final ruling in December, they can appeal to the Competition and Markets Authority.\n\nOfwat chief executive David Black said: \"Let me be very clear to water companies, we will be closely scrutinising the delivery of their plans and will hold them to account to deliver real improvements to the environment and for customers and on their investment

"Ofwat in showdown with water bosses over 'the biggest ever cut in investment'", "body": "Water regulator Ofwat is bracing for a showdown with Britain's water bosses over austere draft determination proposals published today.\n\nOfwat, in its five-yearly review of consumer bill prices and investment spending, gave UK water companies permission to raise bills by just 21% by 2030.\n\nThough great news for consumers, this falls far below water firms' wishes, sparking fears of a shortfall in much-needed spending on infrastructure.\n\nIn comments published by the BBC, David Henderson, chief executive of industry group Water UK, said Ofwat has \"got this wrong\".\n\n\"This is an unrealistic and unfair decision from Ofwat, and our economy and environment will pay the price,\" he added.\n\nAnother spokesperson for Water UK called it \"the biggest ever cut in investment,\" which is the complete opposite of Ofwat boss David Black's declaration that the plans represent the \"biggest ever\" investment in the water sector.\n\nAs for the water firms themselves, most are still digesting Ofwat's proposals.\n\nThames Water to respond\n\nThames Water said: \"As part of its draft determination, Ofwat has asked us to look again at our turnaround plan, and is seeking enhanced oversight of our delivery against it.\n\n\"We are in any case taking stock of our turnaround plan under our new leadership and reflecting on our progress to date.\n\n\"We will consider all of Ofwat's proposals as we go through this process.\"\n\nOfwat was particularly severe on crisis-struck Thames Water, allowing the London water supplier to raise bills by barely half of what it wanted.\n\nThe regulator expects Thames Water to deliver a 19% reduction in leakage, an 18% reduction in phosphorus and a full 50% reduction in pollution incidents from average 2020-23 levels.\n\nIt wouldn't be the first time that Thames Water contested a draft declaration.\n\nWhen the regulator rejected its 2019 investment and pricing plans, Thames Water warned that \"substantially reduced returns... would render the business unfinanceable\".\n\n\"In turn, this would have serious adverse consequences for our customers and the environment,\" the company added.\n\nThames Water intends to publish its draft determination response after it has been submitted to Ofwat.\n\nSevern Trent jubilant\n\nSouth West Water owner Pennon Group PLC (LSE:PNN, OTC:PEGRY) said it \"will now review both draft packages proposed by Ofwat\", a similar line forwarded by United Utilities Group PLC (LSE:UU.).\n\nSevern Trent, on the other hand, responded to Ofwat's draft determination with jubilation, given that all 13 of its business proposals got the green light.\n\n\"It is pleasing that, in its assessment, Ofwat agreed that Severn Trent has set an ambitious level of performance for the period ahead, as we work towards delivering the best possible service for our customers,\" Severn Trent said in a statement.\n\nAll water firms have until 28 August to come back to Ofwat with revised proposals.", "source": {"uri": "proactiveinvestors.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Proactiveinvestors UK"},

It said this week that it only has enough money to continue trading until the end of May 2025.\n\nBosses are scrambling to secure a major cash injection to keep it afloat, and have held talks with both existing shareholders and outside investors.\n\nBut chief executive Chris Weston said on Tuesday that the investment is \"dependent on (Thames) securing a final regulatory determination that is ... investable\".\n\nIf Thames does not succeed in getting the funding, it faces the prospect of being temporarily nationalised by the Government and being placed in a form of special administration, meaning the taxpayer would take on the costs of the heavily loss-making water giant.\n\nOfwat's ruling on Thursday is a draft decision and kicks off a lengthy period of negotiation until its final verdict in December.\n\nHowever, the regulator has rarely made major deviations between its draft and final rulings in previous years, meaning today's statement gives companies an indication of how lenient it is likely to be later on.\n\n\"Our draft decisions on company plans approve a tripling of investment to make sustained improvement to customer service and the environment at a fair price for customers.\n\n\"These proposals aim to deliver a 44% reduction in spills from storm overflows compared to levels in 2021. We expect all companies to embrace innovation and go further and faster to reduce spills wherever possible.\n\n\"Let me be very clear to water companies. We will be closely scrutinising the delivery of their plans and will hold them to account to deliver real improvements to the environment and for customers and on their investment programmes.\"", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jersey Evening Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Thames", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "River Thames"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofwat", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ofwat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Water", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thames Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thames Valley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England and Wales"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Weston", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Weston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sewage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Water industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nationalization"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Cash_Flow", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Cash Flow", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://d3gvyx4eg3tne0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Img38570950.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717113", "eventUri": "eng-9717113", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

unlikely to raise fresh funds before December.\n\nThe water company, which is creaking under a debt pile of more than \u00a315 billion, said it paid the dividends to help fund two of its holding companies, Kemble Eurobond and Thames Water Limited, which are in financial trouble.\n\nThe dividends come after water industry regulator Ofwat had already said it is \"minded\" to take action against Thames Water for a smaller \u00a337.5 million dividend payment in October 2023.\n\n350\n\nNumber of pollution incidents (Thames Water)\n\nUnder new rules introduced last year, water companies with poor financial and environmental records are not allowed to pay dividends.\n\nThames Water paid a total of \u00a3196 million in dividends last year.\n\nThe firm said it is still looking for fresh funding needed to maintain and update its infrastructure, after investors pulled the plug on \u00a3500 million of emergency cash earlier this year.\n\nThames Water is the UK\u00b4s largest water company (Alamy/PA)\n\nIt said it has \u00a31.8 billion of liquidity, enough to fund its operations until the end of May next year, but that it needs new investment.\n\nThames Water said profit increased to \u00a375.4 million for the year ending March 31, up on a \u00a330 million loss the year before.\n\nRevenue increased 11% to \u00a32.5 billion.\n\nPollution incidents increased to 350, up on 331 last year, which it blamed on a rainier-than-expected year.\n\nThe number of \"serious pollutions\" decreased by 18%, Thames Water said.\n\nIt said it spent \u00a32 billion on maintaining and updating its infrastructure last year.\n\nChief financial officer Alastair Cochran said the dividend payments were to help it make \"top-up payments\" to its pension schemes.\n\nHe added that the dividends are \"entirely consistent with normal practice\".\n\nThe company's financial update will be followed on Thursday by a draft verdict from Ofwat on water companies' five-year spending plans and bill increases to 2030.\n\nThat will kick off six months of negotiations with Ofwat, ahead of its final decision in December.\n\nThe utility giant, which has 16 million customers in London and the Thames Valley region, put forward plans in April that would see spending rise to \u00a319.8 billion, with the extra being used for environmental projects.\n\nHowever, that would also involve increasing customer bills by 44%, a figure which has prompted backlash from consumer groups.\n\nMeanwhile, the process of securing new cash is \"not expected to conclude\" until after Ofwat's final decision.\n\nI think there should be a solution that falls short of that Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds before the election\n\nChief executive Chris Weston said Thames had taken \"informal soundings which have shown there is interest in the market\".\n\nHe added that the company will be looking at a \"broad church\" of potential investors which could include existing shareholders.\n\nIf it ultimately fails to attract fresh funding, Thames Water's fraying finances could present Sir Keir Starmer's newly elected Labour Government with a significant industrial crisis.\n\nA blueprint codenamed Project Timber was being drawn up in Whitehall in the spring, according to reports, which could see the company effectively nationalised.\n\nUnder the plans, the company would be placed in a form of special administration in the scenario that its parent company fails.\n\nMr Weston added that it is \"not in the interests\" of customers or investors for the company to fall into Government hands.\n\nBusiness Secretary Jonathan Reynolds signalled during a pre-election Bloomberg debate that he \"wouldn't want to see a nationalisation\" of Thames Water.\n\nSpeaking at the Bloomberg debate about Thames Water, Mr Reynolds said: \"I think there should be a solution that falls short of that.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"},

They have also faced criticism for handing out billions of pounds in shareholder dividends and bonuses for bosses over recent decades, while also overseeing a dearth of investment in upgrades to water and sewage infrastructure.\n\nOfwat said its proposals unveiled today would result in a three-fold increase in investment in customer service and environmental upgrades by the water industry, compared to the previous five-year price review period.\n\nUnder the regulator's proposals, companies would be expected to invest \u00a310bn to tackle storm overflows, with a target to reduce sewage spills by 44 per cent on levels recorded in 2021.\n\nThey would also be expected to deliver \u00a317bn of new water assets, including plans for nine new reservoirs to boost the sector's resilience to climate change and ensure security of water supply. No new reservoirs have been built in the UK since 1990, despite population growth and increasing pressure on water resources from worsening climate change.\n\nDavid Black, chief executive of Ofwat, said the price review marked a major step up in investment by the water sector, and would also help the sector prepare for the escalating impacts of climate change on water resources. \"Customers want to see radical change in the way water companies care for the environment,\" he said. \"Our draft decisions on company plans approve a tripling of investment to make sustained improvement to customer service and the environment at a fair price for customers.\n\n\"Today's announcement also increases the resilience of our water supplies to the impact of climate change and will reduce how much water is taken from rivers by enabling a range of long-term water supply projects, which includes plans for nine reservoirs.\"\n\nHowever, Ofwat has approved only a third of the increases in consumer bills requested by water companies in submissions to the regulator last October, which has stoked criticism from the industry today. Water firms had argued greater increases in bills were needed to bolster Britain's creaking water infrastructure.\n\nIn their initial submissions to Ofwat, water companies proposed increasing their expenditure over the period between 2025 and 2030 to \u00a329bn, with \u00a35bn set aside for business operations and \u00a324bn for environmental improvements.\n\nBut after scrutinising these proposals, Ofwat has agreed to allow firms to only raise a further \u00a316bn through bills, arguing much of the additional expenditure requested by water companies had been \"insufficiently justified, inefficient or for activity companies had already funded\".\n\nThe water regulator has also attached a \"claw back guarantee\" to all investment which would ensure money not spent by water companies on upgrades would be returned to customers, Ofwat said.\n\nThe measure comes after Environment Secretary Steve Reed wrote to Ofwat to demand that infrastructure investment by water companies was \"ringfenced\" and could only be spent in upgrades benefiting customers and the environment.\n\nBlack said it would now be \"closely scrutinising\" water company delivery plans in order to \"hold [firms] to account to deliver real improvements to the environment and for customers and on their investment programmes\".\n\nAlan Lovell, chair of the Environment Agency, said Ofwat's investment plan marked \"a significant step forward in delivering the investment needed to protect rivers and seas, boost water supplies and improve resilience to flooding\".\n\n\"It will deliver four times more investment in clean and plentiful water than the previous five-year period,\" he said. \"The critical issue now is delivery.\"\n\nHowever, trade body Water UK slammed Ofwat's proposals today for failing to allow firms to raise enough funding to support requisite upgrades to infrastructure, arguing they risked undermining efforts to stop sewage spills into the UK's waterways.\n\nUnder Ofwat's plans, Thames Water's request for an increase of \u00a3191 to customer bills by 2030 has been reduced to \u00a399 and Severn Trent's proposed increase of \u00a3144 has been reduced to \u00a393, for example.\n\n\"Today's announcement is the biggest ever cut in investment by Ofwat,\" a Water UK spokesperson said. \"If it doesn't put this right Ofwat will be repeating the mistakes of the past. As a direct result, more housing will be blocked, the recovery of our rivers will be slower, and we will fail to deal with the water shortages we know are coming.\n\n\"Water companies proposed to invest \u00a3105bn because it is the minimum needed to meet the legitimate concerns we've heard from the public about our environment and our economy.\"\n\nThe price review came as the new Labour government today announced a series of new measures to crackdown on sewage spills and ramp up investment in environmental improvements.\n\nUnder the changes announced by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) this morning, citizens are to be given new powers to hold water company bosses to account through \"customer panels\" which would be able to summon water company board members.\n\nDefra has also said it plans to double the amount of compensation customers are legally entitled to when key standards are not met, with payments set to be triggered by a wider set of circumstances including boil water notices.\n\nIn a meeting with water company bosses this morning, Environment Secretary Steve Reed said he expected them to change their \"articles of association\" to make the interests of customers and the environment \"a primary objective\".\n\n\"We will never look the other way while water companies pump sewage into our rivers, lakes and seas,\" Reed said. \"This unacceptable destruction of our waterways should never have been allowed, but change has now begun so it can never happen again.\"\n\nHe added that the government would outline further steps to reform the water sector and protect waterways \"over the coming weeks and months\" noting that \"change will take time\".\n\nReed said the rise in water bills confirmed by Ofwat today were \"the result of years of failure\".\n\n\"The new government will force water companies to tackle illegal sewage dumping into our rivers, lakes and seas,\" he said. \"Firm action should have been taken much earlier to ensure money was spent on fixing the sewage system, not syphoned off for bonuses and dividends.\u202f\u202fThe decisive steps set out today mean this will never be allowed to happen again.\n\n\"After meetings with water bosses this afternoon, they have now signed up to my initial package of reforms as we work towards cleaning up our water, prioritising the interests of water customers and the environment, and fixing our broken sewage system.\"\n\nEnvironmental groups today welcomed the government's decision to intervene in the sector, arguing that Ofwat's latest proposals did not go far enough to force water companies to protect customers or tackle the sewage crisis.\n\n\"While Ofwat still seem to be trying to strike a balance between cooperating with blackmail and not triggering significant change, it's encouraging to see the government stepping into the fray and acknowledging that political choices need making as well as the need to hold water companies to account,\" said Greenpeace policy director Dr Doug Parr.\n\n\"It's now glaringly obvious that these water firms will continue to demand dividends and bonuses for continuing to not do their job for as long as they are allowed to do so. The regulator can't solve this without full government backing for a more interventionist approach, and so while Labour are right to promise a clampdown on profiteering, if they want to deliver real change in the sector and rein in serial polluters, they need to go further.\"\n\nPaul De Zlyva, senior sustainability analyst at Friends of the Earth, said the price hikes proposed by Ofwat were \"considerable\" and would be met by resistance by the public given low regard for water companies.\n\n\"People are willing to pay for essential bill rises when they get good service and real action to prevent pollution, but not to reward ongoing failure,\" he said. \"It's good to hear the new Environment Secretary Steve Reed saying he'll \"never look the other way\" and make changes in water company governance, but tough talk won't wash without greater funding for the Environment Agency and putting a Green Duty on Ofwat alongside its economic focus,\" he said. \"It's now up to the new government to set a better standard by imposing tougher sanctions on irresponsible water companies and enshrining the right to a healthy environment law.\"\n\nYou can now sign up to attend the fifth

Thames Water, the country's largest water company, asked for a 44% increase.\n\nOfwat published its initial draft ruling on the plans on Thursday. Most firms were told they would not be allowed to raise bills by as much as they asked.\n\nThe average rise proposed by Ofwat is 21%, about a third less than the average increase requested by companies.\n\n- What's the damage?\n\nWater firms wanted to raise bills by \u00a3144 on average over the next five years, but Ofwat has cut that.\n\nFor example, Thames Water planned a rise of \u00a3191 by 2030, but that has been reduced to \u00a399.\n\nThere are significant variations in price changes between firms.\n\nUnder the plans, Southern Water customers will face a \u00a3183 increase over five years, while Dwr Cymru customers' bills will go up by \u00a3137.\n\nAt the other end of the scale, Affinity customers will see just an \u00a311 rise, while SES customers' bills will fall by \u00a334 on the previous five years.\n\n- Why do they want to raise bills so much?\n\nWater firms face serious problems with their drains, reservoirs and sewers, leading to vast amounts of pollution spilling into rivers and waterways.\n\nThat means firms need to spend billions on upgrading their systems, as well as turn a profit so they can keep getting more investment from shareholders.\n\nTo make matters worse, many face huge debt piles. The 10 biggest water companies have about \u00a360 billion of combined debt.\n\nMike Keil, chief executive of the Consumer Council for Water (CCW), said: \"Millions of people will feel upset and anxious at the prospect of these water bill rises and question the fairness of them given some water companies' track record of failure and poor service.\"\n\n- Why are people angry?\n\nCritics say firms have chronically underinvested in their infrastructure since they were privatised in 1989, while paying out huge shareholder dividends.\n\nIn the 30 years since water firms moved into private hands, not a single major reservoir has been built in England and Wales.\n\nSarah Bentley, Thames Water's previous chief executive, admitted before she resigned that it had been \"hollowed out\" by \"decades of underinvestment\".\n\nNew rules were introduced last year to ensure that water companies do not pay dividends unless they are judged to have delivered for customers and the environment.\n\nMr Keil continued: \"Trust in water companies has never been lower and that won't change until people see and experience a difference, whether that's having the confidence to swim at their favourite beach or receiving help if they are struggling to pay their bill.\"\n\n- Is anyone trying to fix it?\n\nChancellor Rachel Reeves said the Government will \"get a grip\" on the sector.\n\nMr Reed said he would meet representatives from all 16 water companies from across England and Wales on Thursday.\n\nHe said he has written to Ofwat to ask them to make sure funding for vital infrastructure investment is ringfenced and can only be spent on upgrades benefiting customers and the environment.\n\nHe also said that consumers will gain \"new powers to hold water company bosses to account\" through so-called customer panels.\n\nHe said: \"This unacceptable destruction of our waterways should never have been allowed, but change has now begun so it can never happen again.\"\n\n- What happens next?\n\nOfwat's ruling is only a draft decision, and begins a period of negotiation until its final verdict in December.\n\nBut the regulator has rarely made major deviations from its draft and final rulings in previous years.\n\nThat means Thursday's statement gives all parties a rough indication of what the final decision on bills will look like.\n\nIf companies still do not accept Ofwat's final ruling in December, they can appeal to the Competition and Markets Authority.\n\nOfwat chief executive David Black said: \"Let me be very clear to water companies, we will be closely scrutinising the delivery of their plans and will hold them to account to deliver real improvements to the environment and for customers and on their investment programmes.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

He told Ofwat to ensure funding for infrastructure investment was ringfenced and not spent on bonuses or dividends.\n\n\"Today I have announced significant steps to clean up the water industry to cut sewage pollution, protect customers and attract investment to upgrade its crumbling infrastructure,\" Reed said on Thursday.\n\nHe said the government would outline further steps in the next months to reform the water sector and restore British \"rivers, lakes and seas to good health.\"\n\nIt is a balancing act to clean up Britain's bodies of water, avoid soaring bills and keep investors onside.\n\nNew Prime Minister Keir Starmer wants to boost private investment into infrastructure, and investors will be looking at water as a test case.\n\nOfwat set the allowed rate of return paid to investors of water companies at 3.72%.\n\nUnder the regulator's proposals, Black told BBC radio Thames Water would be able to attract investment and \"it's now their job to go to investors and to seek to raise that funding.\"\n\nHours before Ofwat's announcement, credit rating firm S&P Global warned it could downgrade Thames' Class A and B debt to 'junk' ratings, making them uninvestible for big pension funds.\n\nOfwat is due to publish its final decision on future bills and investment on Dec. 19. The companies can refer their case to Britain's Competition and Markets Authority if they cannot reach agreement with Ofwat.", "source": {"uri": "swissinfo.ch", "dataType": "news", "title": "SWI swissinfo.ch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "swi_swissinfo_ch@swissinfo.ch", "name": "Swi Swissinfo.Ch", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofwat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ofwat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Water industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sewage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Water", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thames Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_Radio", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Times Radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Reed_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Reed (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Privatization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_and_Markets_Authority", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Competition and Markets Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radio", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC Radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_of_return", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rate of return"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_rating", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit rating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pension fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Thames", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "River Thames"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://www.swissinfo.ch/content/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2024/07/c45c2a55582c6a5d5843ff57ae21c884-83441356.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717113", "eventUri": "eng-9717113", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 2195, "textEnd": 2201}, {"amb": false, "date": "-12-19", "textStart": 3526, "textEnd": 3533}], "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

There will then be several months of negotiations before a final ruling in December.\n\nThames said it would be talking to potential investors and lenders following Ofwat's draft ruling, but it added this was not expected to be concluded until after the regulator's final decision.\n\nAn earlier plan put forward by the company was rejected by the regulator, which led to questions over the firm's future as shareholders at Thames' parent firm, Kemble Water, subsequently withdrew a proposed cash injection into the company.\n\nAs well as its financial woes, Thames has also come in for steady criticism for the number of sewage discharges and water leaks affecting its customers.\n\nMr Weston, who joined Thames in January, said the company's performance in this area was \"not where it should be or where we want it to be\".\n\nThe number of sewage discharges rose to 16,990 last year from 8,015, which was put down to \"prolonged heavy rainfall\".\n\nThe 40% increase in rain from the previous year also led to a rise in the number of reportable pollution events to 350 from 331.\n\nHowever, Thames said it had reduced leakages by 7% to its lowest ever level.\n\nThames' results showed that it paid two dividends worth a total of \u00a3158.3m to two of its holding companies in March this year.\n\nThe payments could be controversial given that Ofwat introduced new rules last year forbidding water companies from paying dividends if it risked harming their financial resilience.\n\nThe regulator has already said it is \"minded\" to take action against Thames over a \u00a337.5m dividend payment it made in October last year.\n\nHowever, the company's chief financial officer Alastair Cochran said the dividend payments were for top-up payments to pension schemes, adding they were \"entirely consistent with normal practice\".\n\nIn March this year, Mr Weston said it was \"eventually possible\" that the firm could be nationalised.\n\nIn Thames' latest results, he said: \"I continue to believe that a market-led solution that increases financial resilience is in the best interests of all stakeholders.\"\n\nHowever, he added this was \"dependent on securing a final regulatory determination that is deliverable, financeable and investable, as well as affordable for our customers\".\n\nBefore the election, Labour's Jonathan Reynolds, now the Business Secretary, said he \"wouldn't want to see a nationalisation\".\n\nIf Thames does come under government control, there has been speculation it would be put into a Special Administration Regime, which would see financial consultants run the company on the government's behalf.\n\nA precedent for this was set in 2021 when energy company Bulb went bust and was placed under special administration.\n\nRegardless of what happens to Thames, water suppliers to its customers will continue as normal.", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

\u00a3158m dividend in March amid scramble for fresh funding", "body": "The water company, which is creaking under a debt pile of more than \u00a315 billion, said it paid the dividends to help fund two of its holding companies, Kemble Eurobond and Thames Water Limited, which are in financial trouble.\n\nThe dividends come after water industry regulator Ofwat had already said it is \"minded\" to take action against Thames Water for a smaller \u00a337.5 million dividend payment in October 2023.\n\nUnder new rules introduced last year, water companies with poor financial and environmental records are not allowed to pay dividends.\n\nThames Water paid a total of \u00a3196 million in dividends last year.\n\nThe firm said it is still looking for fresh funding needed to maintain and update its infrastructure, after investors pulled the plug on \u00a3500 million of emergency cash earlier this year.\n\nIt said it has \u00a31.8 billion of liquidity, enough to fund its operations until the end of May next year, but that it needs new investment.\n\nThames Water said profit increased to \u00a375.4 million for the year ending March 31, up on a \u00a330 million loss the year before.\n\nRevenue increased 11% to \u00a32.5 billion.\n\nPollution incidents increased to 350, up on 331 last year, which it blamed on a rainier-than-expected year.\n\nThe number of \"serious pollutions\" decreased by 18%, Thames Water said.\n\nIt said it spent \u00a32 billion on maintaining and updating its infrastructure last year.\n\nChief financial officer Alastair Cochran said the dividend payments were to help it make \"top-up payments\" to its pension schemes.\n\nHe added that the dividends are \"entirely consistent with normal practice\".\n\nThe company's financial update will be followed on Thursday by a draft verdict from Ofwat on water companies' five-year spending plans and bill increases to 2030.\n\nThat will kick off six months of negotiations with Ofwat, ahead of its final decision in December.\n\nThe utility giant, which has 16 million customers in London and the Thames Valley region, put forward plans in April that would see spending rise to \u00a319.8 billion, with the extra being used for environmental projects.\n\nHowever, that would also involve increasing customer bills by 44%, a figure which has prompted backlash from consumer groups.\n\nMeanwhile, the process of securing new cash is \"not expected to conclude\" until after Ofwat's final decision.\n\nChief executive Chris Weston said Thames had taken \"informal soundings which have shown there is interest in the market\".\n\nHe added that the company will be looking at a \"broad church\" of potential investors which could include existing shareholders.\n\nIf it ultimately fails to attract fresh funding, Thames Water's fraying finances could present Sir Keir Starmer's newly elected Labour Government with a significant industrial crisis.\n\nA blueprint codenamed Project Timber was being drawn up in Whitehall in the spring, according to reports, which could see the company effectively nationalised.\n\nUnder the plans, the company would be placed in a form of special administration in the scenario that its parent company fails.\n\nMr Weston added that it is \"not in the interests\" of customers or investors for the company to fall into Government hands.\n\nBusiness Secretary Jonathan Reynolds signalled during a pre-election Bloomberg debate that he \"wouldn't want to see a nationalisation\" of Thames Water.\n\nSpeaking at the Bloomberg debate about Thames Water, Mr Reynolds said: \"I think there should be a solution that falls short of that.\"", "source": {"uri": "bucksfreepress.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bucks Free Press"},

We will get a grip of that.\"\n\nThe regulator said water firms had proposed increases averaging \u00a3144 over five years.\n\nFor example, Thames Water's planned rise of \u00a3191 by 2030 has been reduced to \u00a399, while Severn Trent's proposed increase of \u00a3144 has been cut to \u00a393.\n\nThere are significant variations in price changes between suppliers.\n\nUnder the plans, Southern Water customers will face a \u00a3183 increase over five years, while Dwr Cymru customers' bills will go up by \u00a3137 and Yorkshire Water customers will pay \u00a3107 more.\n\nAt the other end of the scale, Affinity customers will see just an \u00a311 rise, while SES customers' bills will fall by \u00a334 on the previous five years.\n\n\"These proposals aim to deliver a 44% reduction in spills from storm overflows compared to levels in 2021. We expect all companies to embrace innovation and go further and faster to reduce spills wherever possible.\n\n\"Today's announcement also increases the resilience of our water supplies to the impact of climate change and will reduce how much water is taken from rivers by enabling a range of long-term water supply projects, which includes plans for nine reservoirs.\n\n\"Let me be very clear to water companies - we will be closely scrutinising the delivery of their plans and will hold them to account to deliver real improvements to the environment and for customers and on their investment programmes.\"\n\nA Water UK spokesman said: \"Today's announcement is the biggest ever cut in investment by Ofwat. If it doesn't put this right Ofwat will be repeating the mistakes of the past. As a direct result, more housing will be blocked, the recovery of our rivers will be slower and we will fail to deal with the water shortages we know are coming.\n\n\"Water companies proposed to invest \u00a3105 billion because it is the minimum needed to meet the legitimate concerns we've heard from the public about our environment and our economy.\n\n\"Ofwat is right to want to ensure customers receive value for money and that is why protections are in place to ensure customers only pay for projects that are new, necessary and value for money.\n\n\"But for far too long Ofwat has failed to be realistic about the levels of investment needed and what it will take to deliver and maintain necessary infrastructure. We cannot allow this pattern to repeat itself.\n\n\"Water companies are ready to invest in an unprecedented overhaul of the country's water and sewage infrastructure. Ofwat now needs to let them get on with it.\"\n\n\"Customers understand investment is urgently needed but they need reassurance that every pound of their money is going to be well spent.\n\n\"Trust in water companies has never been lower and that won't change until people see and experience a difference - whether that's having the confidence to swim at their favourite beach or receiving help if they are struggling to pay their bill.\n\n\"We estimate about two million households in England and Wales currently cannot afford their water bill and, while the increase in financial assistance is welcome, it falls short of what is needed.\n\n\"Over the summer we'll be carrying out research with customers of every water company to gauge whether they feel the regulator's proposals are affordable and deliver what people want. We expect Ofwat to listen and act on what customers tell us.\"\n\nThe proposals are part of the 2024 Price Review (PR24) and cover the period from 1 April 2025 to 31 March 2030, ahead of a final decision at the end of the year.\n\nOfwat said the average 21% bill increase, around \u00a319 per year, follows firms' proposals to increase their total spending by \u00a329 billion, split between a \u00a35 billion increase in the core costs for running their business and a \u00a324 billion rise in spending to meet requirements set by governments and for other environmental improvements.\n\nOfwat said its scrutiny of companies' cost proposals, to ensure they deliver efficiently, has led to a \u00a316 billion reduction.\n\nHowever the proposed bill increases come amid public fury around firms' polluting of waterways with sewage spills as they continue to hand dividends to shareholders, and bonuses to executives - something which Labour has pledged to clamp down on.\n\nSewage spills into England's rivers and seas more than doubled in 2023.\n\nThe large amount of water lost to leaks in the system also raises widespread concerns, particularly in dry periods when consumers face hosepipe bans.", "source": {"uri": "guernseypress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Guernsey Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofwat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ofwat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Reeves", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rachel Reeves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Water industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Water", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thames Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Severn", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "River Severn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England and Wales"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sewage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor of the Exchequer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Effects of climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_resilience", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Climate resilience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Water", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southern Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_scarcity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Water scarcity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkshire_Water", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yorkshire Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reservoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Water supply"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Philanthropy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://www.guernseypress.com/resizer/1OxLR4h_GupmRHOGP-NHvvpqXNw=/1200x900/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/mna/UTTMTWEIGFEUTI2GDAHNM7HQIU.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717113", "eventUri": "eng-9717113", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

They had wanted to raise bills by an average of 33 per cent, to invest \u00a3105 billion.\n\nBritain's water industry has been in the firing line over the amount of sewage dumped in its waterways, with critics saying the companies have under-invested for decades while taking out billions of pounds in dividends and paying large bonuses to executives.\n\nOfwat boss David Black told Times Radio the system needs sustained improvements \"but it does need to be done in a way that puts the minimum ask on customers that's possible\".

Water companies will respond to the decision and a final ruling will be made by the regulator in December, with the new bills to kick in in April next year.\n\nCampaign groups have expressed fury at the prospect of huge bill hikes for customers and said Ofwat should force companies and their investors to pay for upgrades.\n\nBut Ofwat faces a standoff with investors over the bill hikes. In March, Thames Water's investors pulled the plug on \u00a3500m of emergency funding as it argued the regulator was making the firm \"uninvestable\".\n\nMr Reed has outlined four policies the Government would introduce \"to clean up the water industry to cut sewage pollution, protect customers and attract investment to upgrade its crumbling infrastructure\".\n\nThis includes plans to write to Ofwat to ask them to make sure funding for infrastructure investment is ring fenced and cannot be spent on bonuses, dividends or salary increases. This will include infrastructure investments to prevent sewage spills, among other things.\n\nAny promised infrastructure funding that is not spent on upgrades should be refunded to customers, he said.\n\nWater companies have been heavily criticised in the past for failing to spend money on their infrastructure, while paying large dividends to their investors.\n\nIn its most recent performance report for the sector, Ofwat found water companies had failed to spend \u00a3587m set aside for improving their assets between 2020 to 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, water companies in England paid \u00a32.5bn in dividends in the two financial years since 2021, analysis by the Financial Times found.\n\nWater companies are already forced to return money to customers if they fail to meet separate targets related to things such as environmental performance and leakages.\n\nLast year, 11 of the 16 water companies in England and Wales were forced to give money back to customers. This is done via deductions to bills in the following year rather than cash back.\n\nHowever, water bills have continued to rise despite firms being penalised, for example in the 2023/4 financial year, bills increased by an average of 7.5 per cent despite water companies being penalised for missing targets.\n\nIt is understood that it will be up to Ofwat to decide how exactly customers will be refunded if water companies do not spend their allocated infrastructure funding. Ofwat is an independent body but takes policy direction from ministers within the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.\n\nAlongside restricting infrastructure spending, the Government will consult on doubling the amount of compensation customers will receive when their basic water services are affected. Depending on the circumstances, customers are typically entitled to \u00a320 in compensation if their water supply is disrupted for 24 hours, followed by \u00a310 for each additional day.\n\nMinisters will also look to expand the circumstances under which customers receive compensation to include 'Boil Water Notices', which are issued when there are contamination concerns over drinking water in a region.\n\nThe move is likely in response to the recent parasite outbreak in Devon that saw over 100 people reporting a diarrhoea-type illness and around 16,000 homes and businesses being ordered to boil their water, with some homes affected for almost two months. South West Water was forced to pay out around \u00a33.5million to affected customers.\n\nMr Reed will also order water companies to change their governing rules to make the interests of customers and the environment a primary objective.\n\nNew customer panels will be introduced with the power to summon board members and hold water executives to account, the Secretary of State said.\n\nHowever, Mr Reed stressed that change will \"take time\" to improve Britain's waterways and said the Government will outline further steps over \"the coming weeks and months\".\n\nIt's currently unclear when Labour will set in motion the other policies in its manifesto, including bringing criminal charges against water executives that break the law and introducing automatic and severe fines for polluting firms.\n\nIt is possible that more detail will be provided in the King's Speech, which is scheduled for next week.\n\nWhile Labour's proposals are likely to be welcomed by campaigners, the Government is yet to commit to some of the other changes groups have been calling for to end the sewage crisis and restore our waterways.\n\nDuring the general election campaign, published a manifesto, backed by over 20 leading environmental groups, that set out five key pledges the new Government must commit to to Save Britain's Rivers.\n\nWhile Labour has committed to some of these policies, it is yet to commit to wider changes, including more drastic reform of the regulatory system and a boost in funding for the Environment Agency, which polices sewage spills. It's also unclear how farmers will be funded to help them manage their land in a nature-friendly manner.\n\nWhat says: Within its first six months in power, the next government must publish a roadmap on how the UK is going to achieve its legal target of 77 per cent of rivers being in good ecological health by 2027. This must include increased funding for the Environment Agency.\n\nWhat Labour says: Labour's manifesto contains no mention of the legal target or of increased funding for the Environment Agency.\n\nWhat says: Untreated sewage will not cause damage to high-priority sites (which are\u202fbathing spots, protected nature sites, National Parks and chalk streams) by 2030. Water companies who fail to meet this target will be prosecuted.\n\nWhat Labour says: Labour has said it will pursue criminal charges against the executives of water companies responsible for persistent pollution, but currently has no plans to toughen sewage spill targets beyond what has been set by the current government. Water companies will be forced to amend their governing rules to make the interests of customers and the environment a primary objective.\n\nWhat says: The next government must publish a plan to reform the regulation of water companies, including tougher powers for Ofwat to restrict dividends and bonuses for underperforming water companies. A \"green duty\" will be placed on Ofwat, which will force the regulator to place greater emphasis on the environment when making decisions over water companies' business plans.\n\nWhat Labour says: The party will give regulators new powers to block the payment of bonuses and bring criminal charges against executives who pollute waterways and will impose automatic and severe fines for wrongdoing. Ofwat will also be asked to ensure customers are refunded if infrastructure money is not spent so that it cannot be diverted to pay for bonuses or dividends. Labour has not committed to a 'green duty' for Ofwat.\n\nWhat says: 100 clean bathing spots must be created in England by the end of the parliament and the Environment Agency must start monitoring water quality throughout the year at these sites.\n\nWhat Labour says: The party has made no reference to bathing spots in its manifesto.\n\nWhat says: Within its first year in power, the next government will strengthen its Environmental Land Management scheme so farmers are given more grants, support and advice to undertake activities that will improve water quality.\n\nWhat Labour says: Labour says it will ensure \"environment land management schemes work for farmers and nature\", but is yet to provide more detail on what that will entail. There is no mention of the agricultural budget in Labour's manifesto.\n\nThe new Government has not yet indicated how it plans to deal with Thames Water, which warned on Tuesday that it would run out of money in May next year if it does not receive a new cash injection from investors.\n\nA source close to Mr Reed said on Wednesday that it was \"a matter for the independent regulator [Ofwat] to work with Thames to ensure it is financially stable\".\n\nThe company's investors have refused to pump more money into the firm as they argue a tougher regulatory environment has made the company \"uninvestable\".\n\nOfwat has confirmed it is investigating the six figure bonuses paid to executives at Thames Water last year to determine whether they complied with tougher new rules on the pay for bosses of firms that missed environmental targets.\n\nSome will be disappointed that the new Labour Government is not using the crisis as a reason to renationalise water firms, but the Chancellor Rachel Reeves has previously made clear this option is not on the table.\n\nA number of Labour MPs and unions, including GMB and Unison, have called for water companies to be renationalised. The Green Party, which achieved its best-ever performance in last week's election, included a plan in its manifesto to take water companies back into public ownership.", "source": {"uri":

Sewage outflows have become the centre of public concern, the millions of litres of waste pouring into waterways a metaphor for an industry from which billions has been extracted in dividends and executive bonuses while debt has piled up.\n\nThe political salience of sewage made water an election issue in a swathe of formerly solid Conservative seats in the Thames Valley and south of England that elected Liberal Democrats and Labour MPs last week.\n\nThe investment climate has been transformed too.\n\nThe era of low interest rates and cheap money is long gone too, making it more expensive to borrow and returns less competitive, particularly if investments come with intense political and public scrutiny.\n\nThe challenge is most acute Thames Water, up to its neck in debt, burning through cash and struggling to replace \u00a33.5bn of new equity promised by shareholders who have now declared they are out.\n\nHaving warned earlier this week that it will run out of money within a year, it will now go to the markets with the prospect of raising half the customer revenue it says it needs.\n\nThames wanted to increase bills by 44% and permission to spend a total of \u00a321bn over five years, including operating expenses and investment. Ofwat has met them halfway on bills, allowing a 21% hike, but cut the total expenditure by a quarter to \u00a316.9bn, and offered a damning assessment of the company's plans.\n\nThe regulator judges its proposals to cut leaks and pollution incidents as \"inadequate\", has made \"significant interventions\" in Thames' business plan as it \"did not meet minimum standards\" and warned the company faces \"deep operational and financial resilience challenges\".\n\nNotably Ofwat suggests one measure Thames could take to restore order would be breaking the company into two entities. Separating the company into London and Thames Valley operations, or into waste and water divisions, has been suggested should the company fall into administration.\n\nRead more:\n\nThames Water pins survival hopes on Ofwat's shoulders\n\nWhy water firms argue that higher bills are essential\n\nThat now looks an increasingly likely end game.\n\nThames Water is far from alone in having failings. The entire industry has proved far more efficient at removing money from the water system than sewage. But having set itself until the turn of the year to find fresh investment it is spiralling closer to the plughole.\n\nBritain's biggest water company is up the proverbial creek and Ofwat may just have removed the paddle.", "source": {"uri": "news.sky.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sky News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Water industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofwat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ofwat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Privatization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sewage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Democrats_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liberal Democrats (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Water", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thames Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southern England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thames Valley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterway", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Waterway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drought", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Thames", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "River Thames"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paddle_steamer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paddle steamer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/24/03/1600x900/skynews-shrivenham-oxfordshire_6489534.jpg?20240313210517", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717113", "eventUri": "eng-9717113", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

He told Ofwat to ensure funding for infrastructure investment was ringfenced and not spent on bonuses or dividends.\n\n\"Today I have announced significant steps to clean up the water industry to cut sewage pollution, protect customers and attract investment to upgrade its crumbling infrastructure,\" Reed said on Thursday.\n\nHe said the government would outline further steps in the next months to reform the water sector and restore British \"rivers, lakes and seas to good health.\"\n\nIt is a balancing act to clean up Britain's bodies of water, avoid soaring bills and keep investors onside.\n\nNew Prime Minister Keir Starmer wants to boost private investment into infrastructure, and investors will be looking at water as a test case.\n\nOfwat set the allowed rate of return paid to investors of water companies at 3.72%.\n\nUnder the regulator's proposals, Black told BBC radio Thames Water would be able to attract investment and \"it's now their job to go to investors and to seek to raise that funding.\"\n\nHours before Ofwat's announcement, credit rating firm S&amp;P Global warned it could downgrade Thames' Class A and B debt to 'junk' ratings, making them uninvestible for big pension funds.\n\nOfwat is due to publish its final decision on future bills and investment on Dec. 19.

Profits jumped 21% driven by higher revenues and \"cost discipline\".\n\nRelated: Poor state of Thames Water a 'critical risk' to UK, Starmer and Reeves told\n\nThames has \u00a315.2bn of debt, up \u00a31.3bn on the previous year, the bulk of which could be added to the public purse if the government stepped in to renationalise the troubled company. The Guardian revealed in April a contingency plan was being drawn up in Whitehall to renationalise Britain's biggest water company if it collapses.\n\nThames said it was \"reasonable\" to assume it would have sufficient resources to continue operating until at least April 2025, but there were \"material uncertainties\". These included not securing commitments for future funding, a downgrade to its credit rating or a failure to meet its legal obligations, which could trigger a default on its debts.\n\nThe situation is so severe that the new prime minister, Keir Starmer, and chancellor, Rachel Reeves, have been briefed by Whitehall officials that the poor state of Thames presents a \"critical risk\" to the country during their first few days in office.\n\nChris Weston, the chief executive of Thames who joined in January, said the company could still find a solution in the financial markets without need for government intervention, depending on decisions by its regulator, Ofwat.\n\nHe added that a temporary nationalisation \"is something that is not in the interests of any of our stakeholders or the UK taxpayer.\n\n\"I can't put any probability on whether it will or won't happen, but it is a long way off if it were to happen. There is a lot more that we can do ... to make sure that does not happen.\"\n\nWeston said \"it is extremely early days\", but the company has been in touch with the new government and would have discussions \"as appropriate\" in the near future.\n\nOn Thursday, Ofwat will give its first view on five-year business plans submitted by English and Welsh water companies, including Thames, last year.\n\nThames intended to contact potential investors after Ofwat's documents had been published. Weston said a \"broach church\" of investors would be approached, with a formal process beginning in autumn and expected to stretch into 2025.\n\nThe Ofwat review will indicate by how much Thames will be allowed to raise bills - which the company wants to increase by 59% - and whether its \u00a319.7bn investment plan, intended in part to fix leaky pipes and prevent sewage spills, will be approved.\n\nThe company, which serves 16 million customers in the London and Thames valley regions, said it was working on the basis that an injection of new equity was \"possible\" but \"should no longer be assumed\".\n\nThe number of pollution incidents increased to 350 last year, up on 331 in 2022, which Thames said was driven by a deluge of higher than average rainfall. \"It is a volume that our networks were never designed to cope with,\" Weston said.\n\nThe slow-burn crisis at Thames Water stepped up in March, when it said shareholders - which include the pension funds USS and Omers - had U-turned on \u00a3500m of promised funding, claiming Ofwat had made the company \"uninvestable\". Its parent company, Kemble, defaulted on its debt in April.\n\nThe Guardian has since revealed that Thames's board approved a \u00a3150m dividend just hours before the announcement and Ofwat is studying the payout.\n\nGary Carter, a national officer at the GMB union, said: \"Thames operating profits have improved so now is the time for its shareholders to back the company the equity required to cut leakage and sewage spills.\n\n\"The shareholders are starving Thames of the cash required to keep ageing assets going.\"\n\nPaul de Zylva, the senior sustainability analyst at Friends of the Earth, said:\n\n\"Proper regulation means Ofwat must make Thames Water and other water companies pay for the clean-up needed without passing on higher bills to us. It also means proper fines for polluting and an end to water bosses getting high pay and bonuses for failure.\"\n\nThames's annual report showed Weston picked up \u00a3437,000 for his first few months in the job, including a \u00a3195,000 bonus. His predecessor, Sarah Bentley - who resigned abruptly in June 2023 - received \u00a3436,429 during her notice period.", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

There will then be several months of negotiations before a final ruling in December.\n\nThames said it would be talking to potential investors and lenders following Ofwat's draft ruling, but it added this was not expected to be concluded until after the regulator's final decision.\n\nAn earlier plan put forward by the company was rejected by the regulator, which led to questions over the firm's future as shareholders at Thames' parent firm, Kemble Water, subsequently withdrew a proposed cash injection into the company.\n\nAs well as its financial woes, Thames has also come in for steady criticism for the number of sewage discharges and water leaks affecting its customers.\n\nMr Weston, who joined Thames in January, said the company's performance in this area was \"not where it should be or where we want it to be\".\n\nThe number of sewage discharges rose to 16,990 last year from 8,015, which was put down to \"prolonged heavy rainfall\".\n\nThe 40% increase in rain from the previous year also led to a rise in the number of reportable pollution events to 350 from 331.\n\nHowever, Thames said it had reduced leakages by 7% to its lowest ever level.\n\nMarlene Lawrence is founder of swimming group, the Teddington Bluetits, in south-west London.\n\nShe says the group is concerned about water pollution in the River Thames and \"swim mindfully\".\n\n\"I check [the water quality] daily,\" she told BBC Breakfast.\n\nThe river is used by many different water groups, such as canoe clubs, which is why the quality of the water is so important, she says.\n\n\"People send their children to learn to row and to canoe and they won't if they know the river quality is bad. This is so important.\"\n\nThames' results showed that it paid two dividends worth a total of \u00a3158.3m to two of its holding companies in March this year.\n\nHowever, the company's chief financial officer, Alastair Cochran, said the payments were for top-up payments to pension schemes, adding they were \"entirely consistent with normal practice\".\n\nIn March this year, Mr Weston said it was \"eventually possible\" that the firm could be nationalised.\n\nIn Thames' latest results, he said: \"I continue to believe that a market-led solution that increases financial resilience is in the best interests of all stakeholders.\"\n\nHowever, he added this was \"dependent on securing a final regulatory determination that is deliverable, financeable and investable, as well as affordable for our customers\".\n\nCommunities Minister Jim McMahon said on Tuesday there was \"no programme of nationalisation for the water industry\".\n\nHowever, he added there was \"no provision in law for a water company to stop providing water\".\n\n\"We need to be very clear there is always a contingency in place.\"\n\nMr McMahon added: \"The days of putting shareholder interest above the national interest, frankly, can't carry on and so we do need to look at that and Thames do need to look at their own house and get it in order.\"\n\nIf Thames does come under government control, there has been speculation it would be put into a Special Administration Regime, which would see financial consultants run the company on the government's behalf.\n\nA precedent for this was set in 2021 when energy company Bulb went bust and was placed under special administration.\n\nRegardless of what happens to Thames, water suppliers to its customers will continue as normal.\n\nIf you have any stories or

The dividends come after water industry regulator Ofwat had already said it is \"minded\" to take action against Thames Water for a smaller \u00a337.5million dividend payment in October 2023.\n\nUnder new rules introduced last year, water companies with poor financial and environmental records are not allowed to pay dividends. Thames Water paid a total of \u00a3196million in dividends last year. The firm said it is still looking for fresh funding needed to maintain and update its infrastructure, after investors pulled the plug on \u00a3500million of emergency cash earlier this year.\n\nIt said it has \u00a31.8billion of liquidity, enough to fund its operations until the end of May next year, but that it needs new investment. Thames Water said profit increased to \u00a375.4million for the year ending March 31, up on a \u00a330million loss the year before. Revenue increased 11% to \u00a32.5billion. Pollution incidents increased to 350, up on 331 last year, which it blamed on a rainier-than-expected year.\n\nHowever, the number of \"serious pollutions\" decreased by 18%, Thames Water said. Thames Water splashed out \u00a32billion last year on maintaining and updating its infrastructure. Alastair Cochran, the company's chief financial officer, explained that the dividend payments were necessary for \"top-up payments\" to its pension schemes.\n\nHe further justified the move, stating that the dividends are \"entirely consistent with normal practice\". The firm is bracing for a draft verdict from Ofwat this Thursday on water companies' five-year spending plans and potential bill hikes up to 2030.\n\nThis will trigger six months of intense negotiations with Ofwat before the final decision lands in December. With 16 million customers across London and the Thames Valley, Thames Water proposed a plan in April to ramp up spending to \u00a319.8billion, earmarking the additional funds for environmental initiatives.\n\nYet, this ambitious plan comes with a proposed 44% hike in customer bills, sparking outrage among consumer advocacy groups. In the meantime, Thames Water's quest for new investment is unlikely to wrap up before Ofwat's conclusive ruling.\n\nChris Weston, the chief executive, revealed that initial market soundings have indicated investor interest. Weston noted that the search for investors would encompass a \"broad church\", potentially including current shareholders.\n\nShould Thames Water fail to secure the needed investment, it could leave Sir Keir Starmer's newly elected Labour Government grappling with a major industrial crisis, given the utility's deteriorating finances. According to reports, a scheme known as Project Timber was being formulated in Whitehall in the spring. This could result in the effective nationalisation of the company if its parent company collapses.\n\nMr Weston expressed that it is \"not in the interests\" of consumers or investors for the government to take over the company. During a pre-election debate on Bloomberg, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds indicated that he \"wouldn't want to see a nationalisation\" of Thames Water. In the same debate, Mr Reynolds asserted: \"I think there should be a solution that falls short of that.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lawrence_matheson@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Lawrence Matheson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "alex_daniel@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Alex Daniel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Water", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thames Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Water industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofwat", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ofwat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pension"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Business_and_Trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secretary of State for Business and Trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thames Valley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitehall", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Whitehall"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocacy_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advocacy group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nationalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Cash_Flow", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Cash Flow", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/money/article33198506.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_thames-water-is-the-uks-largest-water-company-alamypa.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717113", "eventUri": "eng-9717113", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-03-31", "textStart": 1176, "textEnd": 1184}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Such a price spike may have been avoided by the government and Ofwat backing smaller rises in the past decade. Instead bills stayed flat or fell in real terms.\n\nThe decision comes as Steve Reed, the new environment secretary, called in the bosses of 16 water firms for a meeting on Thursday to discuss four immediate reforms to the sector.\n\nChief executives will be told their companies need to change their articles of association to put the environment and customers at the heart of objectives. Companies will also need to give new powers to \"customer panels\" to allow them to summon board members for questioning.\n\nReed has written to Ofwat asking it to ensure funding for infrastructure to clean up rivers and deliver new water supplies is ring-fenced, to avoid money being spent on bonuses, dividends and salary increases. Unspent cash will be returned to customers, Reed will promise.\n\nFinally, compensation will be doubled for households facing issues such as water outages. Eligibility for compensation will also be widened, making payouts for \"boil water notices\" -- such as the one issued recently by South West Water -- a statutory requirement rather than voluntary.\n\n\"The previous government turned a blind eye as water bosses pocketed millions in bonuses while pumping record levels of sewage into our rivers, lakes and seas,\" Reed said.\n\n\"We will never look the other way while water companies sewage into our rivers, lakes and seas. This unacceptable destruction of our waterways should never have been allowed, but change has now begun so it can never happen again.\"\n\nLabour is pinning the blame for the state of Britain's rivers and seas -- and therefore the need for big water bill increases -- on the Conservatives.\n\n\"This is a result of 14 years of failure under the Conservatives who essentially weakened regulation, allowing water companies to pump record levels of sewage out, while also letting our infrastructure crumble,\" a source close to Reed said.\n\nReed is expected to discuss a \"reset\" in relations with water bosses, to work in partnership and bring in private sector investments to upgrade infrastructure.\n\nAmong the chief executives is Chris Weston of the heavily indebted Thames Water, which has investment plans that would raise bills by 44 per cent. This week the firm warned an unfavourable settlement with Ofwat could trigger defaults with lending banks.\n\nLabour has no appetite for nationalising Thames Water, the UK's biggest water company, but could appoint special administrators in the event of the business collapsing.\n\nSouth East Water, which supplies water to 2.3 million customers, said this week that it requirec a cash injection to stay afloat. The company's \u00a31.9 billion investment plan would raise water bills by 22 per cent.\n\nReed's initial four reforms are only the first steps he is planning to get tough with the water sector. He also has to work with Ofwat in the coming months to establish the rules for a flagship ban on bonuses for bosses of egregiously polluting water firms.\n\nThursday's decision on water company investments is a draft one, with the final verdict coming from Ofwat before Christmas and taking effect in April. If companies are unhappy with their settlements -- such as claiming the regulator has curbed their spending plans too much -- they could launch legal challenges via the Competition and Markets Authority this year.\n\nNone of Ofwat's provisional bill increases include inflation. When estimates of future inflation are included, the Consumer Council For Water expects Thames Water customers to be paying 59 per cent more in 2030, and Southern Water households 91 per cent more.\n\nNick Measham, the chief executive officer at the charity WildFish, said that polluted rivers were a \"grim reality\" that needed tackling. \"For far too long, water companies' investors and bosses have reaped the rewards of failed regulation. Now we all need to pay the price -- through increased bills or taxation,\" he said.\n\nOfwat is also setting eight new performance targets for water companies on Thursday. They include cutting sewage spills from outfalls, improving biodiversity and enhancing bathing water quality. Firms will be financially rewarded or penalised against the goals.\n\nThe industry body Water UK said: \"This is a critical time for the water industry and we have shown we are ready for change.\"\n\nA Conservative Party spokesman said: \"Now in government, and realising their sums simply don't add up, Labour have clearly reverted to the same old blame game.\"", "source": {"uri":

as liquidity falls further", "body": "The UK's largest water company Thames Water could see its cash run dry by the end of next May, it was revealed on Tuesday.\n\nDespite holding \u00a32.4bn in liquidity at the end of March, that figure had dropped to \u00a31.8bn by the end of June, Sky News reported.\n\nThe privately-held company had struggled to secure new investment after shareholders withdrew a promised \u00a3500m amid disputes with industry regulator Ofwat.\n\nThames Water's board acknowledged that while equity might be received by March next year, it could not rely on that for its financial planning.\n\nAs a result, Thames Water was now required to prepare a \"remedial plan\" for lenders due to non-compliance with certain financial tests, complicating its operations related to incurring debt and making payments.\n\nThe company, which is saddled with over \u00a315bn in debt, paid two dividends totalling \u00a3158.3m in March, potentially leading to further penalties from Ofwat.\n\nDespite its underlying financial woes, Thames Water reported a profit of \u00a375m for the financial year, with incidents of serious pollution down 18% year-on-year.\n\nHowever, its future remained uncertain as the company was seeking approval from Ofwat for a substantial increase in customer bills by up to 44% over the next five years, in exchange for nearly \u00a322bn in infrastructure investments.\n\nOfwat previously rejected a 40% hike in bills, leading to the withdrawal of promised investment and forcing Thames Water to look for new investors.\n\nThe regulator was set to make a final decision on the company's business plans by December.\n\nChief executive officer Chris Weston indicated that while the prospect of special administration was not imminent, the company's financial stability was heavily dependent on Ofwat's upcoming rulings.\n\nThe special administration process would place the company under temporary public ownership to ensure continuity of services while long-term solutions were devised.\n\nThames Water has faced massive criticism in recent years for prioritising shareholder returns over infrastructure investment, and for lagging in meeting performance targets for leaks and sewage discharges.\n\nThe company was also bracing for a potential \u00a340m penalty from Ofwat over a controversial \u00a337.5m payout to its owners last autumn, which violated regulatory rules against rewarding shareholders during periods of poor performance.", "source": {"uri": "sharecast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BOLSAMANIA"}, "authors":

However, the increases vary by region, with Southern Water's rising by \u00a3183, an increase of 44 per cent, Thames customers will see an increase of \u00a399 or 23 per cent and Anglian \u00a366 or 13 per cent.\n\nThe regulator said water firms proposed increases averaging \u00a3144 over five years. For example, Thames Water's proposed increase of \u00a3191 by 2030 has been reduced to \u00a399, while Severn Trent's proposed rise of \u00a3144 has been cut to \u00a393.\n\nThe proposed bill increases come amid public fury around firms' rampant polluting of waterways with sewage spills as they continue to hand dividends to shareholders, and bonuses to executives - something which Labour has pledged to clamp down on. Sewage spills into England's rivers and seas more than doubled in 2023.\n\nThe environment secretary, Steve Reed, has called in the bosses of 16 water firms to outline reforms aimed at ending the crisis in the sector. The government will ensure funding for investment in infrastructure is ringfenced to ensure it is only spent on upgrades that benefit customers and the environment.\n\nWater companies will also be forced to amend their articles of association to place customers and the environment at the heart of their objectives. Mr Reed will also instruct Ofwat to give consumers more power, setting up \"customer panels\" through which they can summon water bosses to answer questions. And the government will more than double the amount of compensation those whose services are interrupted are eligible for.\n\nMr Reed said: \"We will never look the other way while water companies pump sewage into our rivers, lakes and seas.\n\n\"This unacceptable destruction of our waterways should never have been allowed, but change has now begun so it can never happen again.\n\n\"Today I have announced significant steps to clean up the water industry to cut sewage pollution, protect customers and attract investment to upgrade its crumbling infrastructure.\n\n\"That change will take time. Over the coming weeks and months, this Government will outline further steps to reform the water sector and restore our rivers, lakes and seas to good health.\"\n\nOfwat's proposed bill rises can be challenged by the water firms, with a final determination due at the end of the year. The regulaor's propsoals follow firms' suggestion to increase their total spending by \u00a329 billion, split between a \u00a35 billion increase in the core costs for running their business and a \u00a324 billion rise in spending to meet requirements set by governments and for other environmental improvements.\n\nOfwat chief executive David Black said: \"Customers want to see radical change in the way water companies care for the environment. Our draft decisions on company plans approve a tripling of investment to make sustained improvement to customer service and the environment at a fair price for customers.\n\n\"These proposals aim to deliver a 44 per cent reduction in spills from storm overflows compared to levels in 2021. We expect all companies to embrace innovation and go further and faster to reduce spills wherever possible.\n\n\"Today's announcement also increases the resilience of our water supplies to the impact of climate change and will reduce how much water is taken from rivers by enabling a range of long-term water supply projects, which includes plans for nine reservoirs.\n\n\"Let me be very clear to water companies - we will be closely scrutinising the delivery of their plans and will hold them to account to deliver real improvements to the environment and for customers and on their investment programmes.\"\n\nMike Keil, chief executive of the Consumer Council for Water (CCW), said: \"Millions of people will feel upset and anxious at the prospect of these water bill rises and question the fairness of them given some water companies' track record of failure and poor service.\n\n\"Customers understand investment is urgently needed but they need reassurance that every pound of their money is going to be well spent.\n\n\"Trust in water companies has never been lower and that won't change until people see and experience a difference - whether that's having the confidence to swim at their favourite beach or receiving help if they are struggling to pay their bill.\n\n\"We estimate about two million households in England and Wales currently cannot afford their water bill and, while the increase in financial assistance is welcome, it falls short of what is needed.\n\n\"Over the summer we'll be carrying out research with customers of every water company to gauge whether they feel the regulator's proposals are affordable and deliver what people want. We expect Ofwat to listen and act on what customers tell us.\"\n\nThe proposals are part of the 2024 Price Review (PR24) and cover the period from 1 April 2025 to 31 March 2030, ahead of a final decision at the end of the year.\n\nOfwat said its scrutiny of companies' cost proposals, to ensure they deliver efficiently, had led to a \u00a316 billion reduction.\n\nAccording to the Environment Agency, there were 3.6 million hours of spills last year - equal to about 400 years - compared with 1.75 million hours in 2022.\n\nThe large amount of water lost to leaks in the system also raises widespread concerns, particularly in dry periods when consumers face hosepipe bans.", "source": {"uri": "ca.style.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Reed_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steve Reed (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofwat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ofwat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Water industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sewage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterway", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Waterway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Water", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thames Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Severn", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "River Severn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Environment,_Food_and_Rural_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Old English"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England and Wales"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Thames", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "River Thames"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Effects of climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Council_for_Water", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumer Council for Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Environment Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reservoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Water supply"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "wgt": 39}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Sanitary_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Sanitary Engineering", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Water_Parks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Water Parks", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/9fb46882292a80bf1b3271776894a457", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717113", "eventUri": "eng-9717113", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

We expect all companies to embrace innovation and go further and faster to reduce spills wherever possible. Today's announcement also increases the resilience of our water supplies to the impact of climate change and will reduce how much water is taken from rivers by enabling a range of long-term water supply projects, which includes plans for nine reservoirs. Let me be very clear to water companies - we will be closely scrutinising the delivery of their plans and will hold them to account to deliver real improvements to the environment and for customers and on their investment programmes.\"\n\nA Water UK spokesman said: \"Today's announcement is the biggest ever cut in investment by Ofwat. If it doesn't put this right Ofwat will be repeating the mistakes of the past. As a direct result more housing will be blocked, the recovery of our rivers will be slower, and we will fail to deal with the water shortages we know are coming.\n\n\"Water companies proposed to invest \u00a3105bn because it is the minimum needed to meet the legitimate concerns we've heard from the public about our environment and our economy. Ofwat is right to want to ensure customers receive value for money and that is why protections are in place to ensure customers only pay for projects that are new, necessary, and value for money.\n\n\"But for far too long Ofwat has failed to be realistic about the levels of investment needed and what it will take to deliver and maintain necessary infrastructure. We cannot allow this pattern to repeat itself. Water companies are ready to invest in an unprecedented overhaul of the country's water and sewage infrastructure. Ofwat now needs to let them get on with it.\"\n\nMike Keil, chief executive of the Consumer Council for Water (CCW), said: \"Millions of people will feel upset and anxious at the prospect of these water bill rises and question the fairness of them given some water companies' track record of failure and poor service. Customers understand investment is urgently needed but they need reassurance that every pound of their money is going to be well spent. Trust in water companies has never been lower and that won't change until people see and experience a difference - whether that's having the confidence to swim at their favourite beach or receiving help if they are struggling to pay their bill.\n\n\"We estimate about two million households in England and Wales currently cannot afford their water bill and, while the increase in financial assistance is welcome, it falls short of what is needed. Over the summer we'll be carrying out research with customers of every water company to gauge whether they feel the regulator's proposals are affordable and deliver what people want. We expect Ofwat to listen and act on what customers tell us.\"\n\nSign up now for the latest news on the NorthWalesLive WhatsApp community.\n\nSee what's happening in your area:", "source": {"uri":

The regulation around it will have to be looked at, and we have to see more investment going forward,\" he told the BBC. \"Thames really do need to look at their own house and get it in order.\"\n\nRegulator Ofwat will make an initial decision on how much Britain's water companies can raise bills on Thursday, before a final ruling on Dec. 19.\n\nCEO Weston, who is seven months into the job, needs the regulator to allow it to raise customer bills by 40 per cent, excluding inflation, over 2025-30 to pay for infrastructure improvements.\n\nThames' ability to raise new equity and debt will depend on Ofwat's decision. It needs equity of \u00a33.25-billion over the next five years and said formal talks would begin in autumn.\n\n\"It won't conclude until the beginning of next year at the earliest,\" Weston said, adding there was \"interest\" in the market.\n\nA \"supportive determination\" from Ofwat would be helpful but Weston did not expect the next few months to be straightforward.\n\n\"Draft determination, as I said, is a point in time. We will continue to work with Ofwat over the coming months to make our case again,\" he said.\n\nThe government wants Ofwat to ensure consumers get value for money. But Thames Water argues investors need to make returns in upgrading infrastructure which is more than 100 years old to cope with a growing population and climate change.\n\nThe company is struggling with \u00a315-billion ($19.21-billion) of debt.

Mr Reed will then meet executives in Whitehall to lay out his plans.\n\nThe amount of compensation to be paid to customers for water outages and other problems will be doubled to around \u00a350 under the proposals. The trigger for compensation will also be widened to include so-called \"boil notices\" when water is unsafe to drink.\n\nNew \"customer panels\" will be rolled out to help bill payers hold company bosses to account, and companies will be forced to change their articles of association to make the interests of customers and the environment a primary objective.\n\nMr Reed said: \"We will never look the other way while water companies pump sewage into our rivers, lakes and seas.\n\n\"This unacceptable destruction of our waterways should never have been allowed, but change has now begun so it can never happen again.\n\n\"Today I have announced significant steps to clean up the water industry, to cut sewage pollution, protect customers and attract investment to upgrade its crumbling infrastructure.\n\n\"That change will take time.

Ofwat could accept the proposals, or only allow companies to increase prices by a smaller amount.\n\nSouthern Water, which supplies customers in Hampshire, Sussex and Kent, is proposing the steepest increase with a rise of 73pc.\n\nIf approved, this would increase annual bills from \u00a3420 to \u00a3726, leaving Southern with the highest bills in the country.\n\nSouthern Water is majority-owned by Macquarie, Australian investment bank, which has come under fire for its previous role running Thames Water.\n\nIt has said bills must go up to fund new investment amid problems linked to water scarcity and climate change.\n\nThe regulator's draft determination sets limits on how much companies can charge customers, which impacts their investment between 2025 and 2030.\n\nWater companies say they need to increase bills in order to spend \u00a3100bn in upgrading leaky pipes and crumbling sewers.\n\nThames Water, Britain's largest water company with 16 million customers, wants bills to rise by 44pc to \u00a3627 per year.\n\nThe embattled company is facing a funding crisis with only enough cash to keep it going until May 2025.\n\nWithout an increase in bills to make it \"investable\", Thames said it could run out of money and face a special administration under the new Labour government.\n\nSouth Staffs Water, which supplies drinking water to 1.3 million in the West Midlands and South Staffordshire, is proposing the lowest increase of 12.5pc. Bills would reach \u00a3181 per year under the proposal.\n\nLabour is attempting to avoid the collapse of Thames in a crucial early test of its competence.\n\nOfwat's decision on Thursday is a preliminary ruling with a final verdict due in December before the bill rises take effect in April 2025.\n\nWater companies unhappy with the outcome can pursue a legal challenge at the Competition and Markets Authority, further prolonging the process.", "source": {"uri": "uk.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

There are huge concerns about the illegal dumping on waterways.'\n\nReacting to the announcement by Ofwat, Giles Bristow, chief executive of Surfers Against Sewage, said: 'The General Election campaign made clear that the public is fed up with those in power turning a blind eye to the sewage scandal.\n\n'Unfortunately today's announcement, in which Ofwat accepts that we will all have to swim and surf in sewage way beyond 2030, does nothing to change that.\n\n'Signing off on the continuation of at least 200,000 sewage discharges a year is simply unacceptable and a sign that the regulator still doesn't comprehend the scale of public fury on this issue.'\n\nHe called for the new Labour Government to launch a public inquiry as the only way to 'help us understand how we got here and how we can dig our way out'.\n\nPaul de Zylva, from Friends of the Earth, said the decision on bills and investment 'yet again proves that our current form of water privatisation is not fit for purpose'.\n\n'It sees water companies pile pressure on Ofwat to allow them to hike customers' bills to subsidise long-overdue investment in our crumbling sewage infrastructure which might cut or prevent some, but by no means all, pollution.'\n\nWhile he said Ofwat's draft determination shows it is not pandering to everything water companies want, many will still see the increase in bills as 'unfair'.\n\nMike Keil, chief executive of the Consumer Council for Water (CCW), said: 'Millions of people will feel upset and anxious at the prospect of these water bill rises and question the fairness of them given some water companies' track record of failure and poor service.\n\n'Customers understand investment is urgently needed but they need reassurance that every pound of their money is going to be well spent.\n\n'Trust in water companies has never been lower and that won't change until people see and experience a difference - whether that's having the confidence to swim at their favourite beach or receiving help if they are struggling to pay their bill.\n\n'We estimate about two million households in England and Wales currently cannot afford their water bill and, while the increase in financial assistance is welcome, it falls short of what is needed.\n\n'Over the summer we'll be carrying out research with customers of every water company to gauge whether they feel the regulator's proposals are affordable and deliver what people want. We expect Ofwat to listen and act on what customers tell us.'\n\nOfwat chief executive David Black said: 'Customers want to see radical change in the way water companies care for the environment.\n\nIn 2023, there 3.6 million hours of sewage spills in England's rivers and seas (pictured: Thames Water discharging sewage into the River Misbourne)\n\n'Our draft decisions on company plans approve a tripling of investment to make sustained improvement to customer service and the environment at a fair price for customers.\n\n'These proposals aim to deliver a 44 per cent reduction in spills from storm overflows compared to levels in 2021.\n\n'We expect all companies to embrace innovation and go further and faster to reduce spills wherever possible.\n\n'Today's announcement also increases the resilience of our water supplies to the impact of climate change and will reduce how much water is taken from rivers by enabling a range of long-term water supply projects, which includes plans for nine reservoirs.\n\n'Let me be very clear to water companies - we will be closely scrutinising the delivery of their plans and will hold them to account to deliver real improvements to the environment and for customers and on their investment programmes.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

However, the increases vary by region, with Southern Water's rising by \u00a3183, an increase of 44 per cent, Thames customers will see an increase of \u00a399 or 23 per cent and Anglian \u00a366 or 13 per cent.\n\nThe regulator said water firms proposed increases averaging \u00a3144 over five years. For example, Thames Water's proposed increase of \u00a3191 by 2030 has been reduced to \u00a399, while Severn Trent's proposed rise of \u00a3144 has been cut to \u00a393.\n\nfollows firms' proposals to increase their total spending by \u00a329 billion, split between a \u00a35 billion increase in the core costs for running their business and a \u00a324 billion rise in spending to meet requirements set by governments and for other environmental improvements.\n\nOfwat's proposed bill rises can be challenged by the water firms, with a final determination due at the end of the year.\n\nOfwat chief executive David Black said: \"Customers want to see radical change in the way water companies care for the environment. Our draft decisions on company plans approve a tripling of investment to make sustained improvement to customer service and the environment at a fair price for customers.\n\n\"These proposals aim to deliver a 44 per cent reduction in spills from storm overflows compared to levels in 2021. We expect all companies to embrace innovation and go further and faster to reduce spills wherever possible.\n\n\"Today's announcement also increases the resilience of our water supplies to the impact of climate change and will reduce how much water is taken from rivers by enabling a range of long-term water supply projects, which includes plans for nine reservoirs.\n\n\"Let me be very clear to water companies - we will be closely scrutinising the delivery of their plans and will hold them to account to deliver real improvements to the environment and for customers and on their investment programmes.\"\n\nMike Keil, chief executive of the Consumer Council for Water (CCW), said: \"Millions of people will feel upset and anxious at the prospect of these water bill rises and question the fairness of them given some water companies' track record of failure and poor service.\n\n\"Customers understand investment is urgently needed but they need reassurance that every pound of their money is going to be well spent.\n\n\"Trust in water companies has never been lower and that won't change until people see and experience a difference - whether that's having the confidence to swim at their favourite beach or receiving help if they are struggling to pay their bill.\n\n\"We estimate about two million households in England and Wales currently cannot afford their water bill and, while the increase in financial assistance is welcome, it falls short of what is needed.\n\n\"Over the summer we'll be carrying out research with customers of every water company to gauge whether they feel the regulator's proposals are affordable and deliver what people want. We expect Ofwat to listen and act on what customers tell us.\"\n\nThe proposals are part of the 2024 Price Review (PR24) and cover the period from 1 April 2025 to 31 March 2030, ahead of a final decision at the end of the year.\n\nOfwat said its scrutiny of companies' cost proposals, to ensure they deliver efficiently, had led to a \u00a316 billion reduction.\n\nHowever the proposed bill increases come amid public fury around firms' rampant polluting of waterways with sewage spills as they continue to hand dividends to shareholders, and bonuses to executives - something which Labour has pledged to clamp down on.\n\nSewage spills into England's rivers and seas more than doubled in 2023.\n\nAccording to the Environment Agency, there were 3.6 million hours of spills last year - equal to about 400 years - compared with 1.75 million hours in 2022.\n\nThe large amount of water lost to leaks in the system also raises widespread concerns, particularly in dry periods when consumers face hosepipe bans.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofwat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ofwat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Water industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angles_(tribe)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Angles (tribe)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Water", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thames Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Severn", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "River Severn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Thames", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "River Thames"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Effects of climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Council_for_Water", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer Council for Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reservoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Water supply"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterway", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Waterway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Environment Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England and Wales"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sewage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling/Water_Wells_and_Pumps", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling/Water Wells and Pumps", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/08/25/15/3_2.png?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717113", "eventUri": "eng-9717113", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

Our draft decisions on company plans approve a tripling of investment to make sustained improvement to customer service and the environment at a fair price for customers.\n\n\"These proposals aim to deliver a 44% reduction in spills from storm overflows compared to levels in 2021. We expect all companies to embrace innovation and go further and faster to reduce spills wherever possible.\n\n\"Today's announcement also increases the resilience of our water supplies to the impact of climate change and will reduce how much water is taken from rivers by enabling a range of long-term water supply projects, which includes plans for nine reservoirs.\n\n\"Let me be very clear to water companies - we will be closely scrutinising the delivery of their plans and will hold them to account to deliver real improvements to the environment and for customers and on their investment programmes.\"\n\nMike Keil, chief executive of the Consumer Council for Water (CCW), said: \"Millions of people will feel upset and anxious at the prospect of these water bill rises and question the fairness of them given some water companies' track record of failure and poor service.\n\n\"Customers understand investment is urgently needed but they need reassurance that every pound of their money is going to be well spent.\n\n\"Trust in water companies has never been lower and that won't change until people see and experience a difference - whether that's having the confidence to swim at their favourite beach or receiving help if they are struggling to pay their bill.\n\n\"We estimate about two million households in England and Wales currently cannot afford their water bill and, while the increase in financial assistance is welcome, it falls short of what is needed.\n\n\"Over the summer we'll be carrying out research with customers of every water company to gauge whether they feel the regulator's proposals are affordable and deliver what people want. We expect Ofwat to listen and act on what customers tell us.\"\n\nThe proposals are part of the 2024 Price Review (PR24) and cover the period from 1 April 2025 to 31 March 2030, ahead of a final decision at the end of the year.\n\nOfwat said the average 21% bill increase, around \u00a319 per year, follows firms' proposals to increase their total spending by \u00a329 billion, split between a \u00a35 billion increase in the core costs for running their business and a \u00a324 billion rise in spending to meet requirements set by governments and for other environmental improvements.\n\nOfwat said its scrutiny of companies' cost proposals, to ensure they deliver efficiently, had led to a \u00a316 billion reduction.\n\nHowever the proposed bill increases come amid public fury around firms' rampant polluting of waterways with sewage spills as they continue to hand dividends to shareholders, and bonuses to executives - something which Labour has pledged to clamp down on.\n\nSewage spills into England's rivers and seas more than doubled in 2023.\n\nAccording to the Environment Agency, there were 3.6 million hours of spills last year - equal to about 400 years - compared with 1.75 million hours in 2022.\n\nThe large amount of water lost to leaks in the system also raises widespread concerns, particularly in dry periods when consumers face hosepipe bans.", "source": {"uri": "news.stv.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "STV News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pa_media@news.stv.tv", "name": "Pa Media", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofwat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ofwat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Water industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England and Wales"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Water", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southern Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Water", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thames Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Severn", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "River Severn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkshire_Water", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yorkshire Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Effects of climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Council_for_Water", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer Council for Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reservoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Water supply"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Environment Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sewage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling/Water_Wells_and_Pumps", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling/Water Wells and Pumps", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://news.stv.tv/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/9a99eeb7b4700ad6383c73bb06256ddc-1720684255-social-default.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717113", "eventUri": "eng-9717113", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Investors earlier this year pulled the plug on \u00a3500m of emergency funding, with the company's largest shareholder - a Canadian pension fund - later writing down the value of its stake to zero.\n\nWhitehall officials are understood to have briefed Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Chancellor Rachel Reeves within hours of their election victory last week that the plight of Thames Water represents a \"critical risk\" to the country and is one of the most urgent problems facing the new Labour government.\n\nChris Weston, a former British Gas executive who was brought in as the latest chief executive at Thames Water in January, warned that the utility only has enough money to fund its operations until next May and urged Ofwat to take steps to make the company \"investable\" for the private sector.\n\nThe industry regulator will announce on Thursday whether it will allow Thames Water to proceed with a five-year business plan which promises a renewed investment programme in return for raising average household bills by 59 per cent between 2025 and 2030. Such an increase would represent an average annual bill of \u00a3759 for each of Thames's 16 million customers across London and the Thames Valley.\n\nAnnouncing the company's annual results, Mr Weston said: \"We are dependent on securing a final regulatory determination that is deliverable, financeable and investable, as well as affordable for our customers.\"\n\nThe plea came as it emerged that Mr Weston will take a bonus of \u00a3195,00 for his work with Thames Water until March, taking his pay for the period to \u00a3437,000. Alastair Cochran, the company's chief financial officer, received a bonus of \u00a3446,000 as part of a total remuneration of \u00a31.33m - a figure which also reflected his role as a co-CEO for part of last year.\n\nIt can be revealed by that Ofwat is examining the bonus payments to see whether they comply with new rules designed to block \"inappropriate\" pay awards. The regulator recently tightened rules on executive pay to allow it from next year to claw back bonuses which are judged to have been funded from customer revenues and made despite missed environmental or performance targets.\n\nAn Ofwat spokesperson said it was \"looking into\" the executive payments and would respond \"if necessary using our new powers to protect customers\".\n\nCampaigners reacted angrily to the latest evidence of Thames Water's struggles after the company said it had seen a six per cent rise in pollution incidents to 350 - a situation which the utility said was due to unusually heavy rainfall. The company said high rainfall was also responsible for the more-than-doubling last year of sewage discharges from its network to 16,990 from 8,015.\n\nThe utility also said it had recorded its lowest ever leakage rate of 570.4 megalitres a day, a figure which nonetheless represented the loss of the equivalent of 228 Olympic swimming pools every 24 hours or a 23 per cent loss of total daily supply.\n\nAsh Smith, of Windrush Against Sewage Pollution, told : \"Thames Water is in its precarious financial state due to the actions of a long line of overpaid CEOs who have overseen the destruction of a properly funded company that has been used as a cash machine for shareholders.\n\n\"Now the company is trying to use its debt mountain to blackmail the government into bailing it out and it wants to keep extracting cash from captive billpayers.\"\n\nPaul de Zylva, a senior analyst at Friends of the Earth, said: \"It's staggering that the company is still counting on weak regulation to allow it to survive by pushing its problems onto its customers. The regulator must end this licence for water companies to profit from pollution, while wildlife and our health is put at risk.\"\n\nIt is understood Thames Water believes the bonus payments to its senior executives are justified in order for it to attract the right personnel. The company said its bonuses were based on meeting performance goals in areas including leakages, pollution and customer complaints.\n\nMr Weston insisted that any temporary nationalisation was \"a long way off\" and was \"not in the interests in any of our stakeholders of the UK taxpayer\".\n\nHe added that company had taken \"informal soundings\" which indicated there may be interest from a \"broad church\" of new and existing investors. It was revealed by in May that among the potential sources of funds that might be approached to keep Thames Water in private hands were the sovereign wealth funds of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.\n\nHowever, if it ultimately fails to attract fresh funding, the water giant's fraying finances could present Starmer with a significant industrial crisis. A blueprint codenamed Project Timber was drawn up in Whitehall in the spring, which could see the company effectively nationalised.\n\nUnder the plans, the company would be placed in a form of special administration in the scenario that its parent company fails.\n\nLabour has insisted it will put water companies under new \"special measures\" including stricter control of bonuses and automatic fines.\n\nA party source said: \"We are in this situation because of 14 years of Conservative incompetence. It is a matter for the independent regulator to work with Thames to ensure it is financially stable. The election of this Labour Government is a reset moment for the water industry. Over the coming weeks and months, this government will outline its first steps to reform the water sector.\"", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors":

The upgrades, which were promised in 2018, are being paid for by customers as part of a five-year spending round to 2025 but will not be delivered within that timeframe.\n\nMeanwhile, Thames Water awaits a crucial decision on Thursday from the regulator Ofwat on the company's new five-year business plan. Thames wants to increase customer bills 59% by 2030 to pay for record investment of \u00a319.8bn to tackle sewage pollution, leaks and water shortages after decades in which the company has sweated assets and underinvested.\n\nThe company is asking the regulator to allow the late projects to be rolled over into the new spending round, known as PR24.\n\nAsh Smith, the founder of the campaign group Windrush Against Sewage Pollution, said customers had already paid for the projects to upgrade ageing sewage treatment works, and were being asked to pay again.\n\n\"Thames Water failed to deliver around 108 schemes that were funded in the last spending cycle and we question whether that a deliberate act to keep it financially afloat. A proper investigation into this company is long, long overdue.\"\n\nSmith added: \"It has broken our sewerage infrastructure while extracting cash, right under the noses of regulators and the government.\"\n\nIndustrywide, water companies are seeking to increase customer bills by up to 91% to pay record investment of \u00a396bn. The new environment secretary, Steve Reed, has summoned water company chiefs to a meeting on Thursday after the Ofwat decision on the PR24 business plans.\n\nAs well as bill increases, Thames wants the regulator to agree to issue it with lower fines for pollution. Thames also wants Ofwat to increase a 3% limit on capital returns in order to attract vital investment as the company struggles to stay afloat with debts of more than \u00a315bn. Thames has said average annual customer bills would be \u00a3608 by 2030.\n\nDetails of the failure to deliver the 108 upgrade projects on sewage treatment works across the network are contained in a deeply buried appendix to the PR24 business plan being considered by Ofwat.\n\nThe improvements to the treatment works were intended to fulfil a company target to reduce pollution to zero by 2025. But this week, Thames said sewage pollution had increased by 6% in the past year to 350 events, breaching its legal pollution target and mostly caused by delays to the upgrading of its sewage treatment works.\n\nThe 108 schemes included upgrades to stop sewage pollution into internationally significant chalk streams in the Cotswolds, where the headwaters of the River Thames rise.\n\nThe survival of Thames Water, which provides drinking water and sewerage services for 15 million customers, is to a large extent dependent on the decision on Thursday by Ofwat.\n\nThames is seeking new investors for fresh funds. The company said it would run out of money by next June without a cash injection, raising fears over its potential collapse.\n\nIts chief executive, Chris Weston, this week blamed last year's increase in pollution on a 40% rise in rainfall in 2023, saying the ageing treatment works could not cope.\n\nBut under the Climate Change Act 2008, all water companies were legally obliged to take appropriate action to adapt to the future impacts of climate breakdown, and to provide regular updates on their progress. Thames was first ordered to assess the impact of climate change on its longer term resilience in 2011.\n\nThe company has blamed the failure to deliver the 108 schemes on macroeconomic events including Covid-19 and the rise in inflation. Thames said supply chain problems were a reason for the delays, as well as pressure from the Environment Agency to force the company to create more storm tank capacity.\n\nIt said: \"We have faced financial and delivery-related constraints which means that a number of schemes will be delivered late.\"\n\nThe company said in its annual report this week: \"After decades of underinvestment, it will take time to restore asset health to the level we expect and require.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

However, the regulator said water firms proposed increases averaging \u00a3144 over the same period. For example, Thames Water's proposed increase of \u00a3191 by 2030 has been reduced to \u00a399, while Severn Trent's proposed rise of \u00a3144 has been cut to \u00a393.\n\nBut there are significant variations in price changes between firms. Under the plans, Southern Water customers will face a \u00a3183 increase over five years, while Dwr Cymru customers' bills will go up by \u00a3137 and Yorkshire Water customers will pay \u00a3107 more.\n\nRead more: See footage as killer driver driver tells police 'mistakes happen...

Our draft decisions on company plans approve a tripling of investment to make sustained improvement to customer service and the environment at a fair price for customers.\n\n\"These proposals aim to deliver a 44% reduction in spills from storm overflows compared to levels in 2021. We expect all companies to embrace innovation and go further and faster to reduce spills wherever possible.\n\n\"Today's announcement also increases the resilience of our water supplies to the impact of climate change and will reduce how much water is taken from rivers by enabling a range of long-term water supply projects, which includes plans for nine reservoirs.\n\n\"Let me be very clear to water companies - we will be closely scrutinising the delivery of their plans and will hold them to account to deliver real improvements to the environment and for customers and on their investment programmes.\"\n\nMike Keil, chief executive of the Consumer Council for Water (CCW), said: \"Millions of people will feel upset and anxious at the prospect of these water bill rises and question the fairness of them given some water companies' track record of failure and poor service.\n\n\"Customers understand investment is urgently needed but they need reassurance that every pound of their money is going to be well spent.\n\n\"Trust in water companies has never been lower and that won't change until people see and experience a difference - whether that's having the confidence to swim at their favourite beach or receiving help if they are struggling to pay their bill.\n\n\"We estimate about two million households in England and Wales currently cannot afford their water bill and, while the increase in financial assistance is welcome, it falls short of what is needed.\n\n\"Over the summer we'll be carrying out research with customers of every water company to gauge whether they feel the regulator's proposals are affordable and deliver what people want. We expect Ofwat to listen and act on what customers tell us.\"\n\nThe proposals are part of the 2024 Price Review (PR24) and cover the period from 1 April 2025 to 31 March 2030, ahead of a final decision at the end of the year.\n\nOfwat said the average 21% bill increase, around \u00a319 per year, follows firms' proposals to increase their total spending by \u00a329 billion, split between a \u00a35 billion increase in the core costs for running their business and a \u00a324 billion rise in spending to meet requirements set by governments and for other environmental improvements.\n\nOfwat said its scrutiny of companies' cost proposals, to ensure they deliver efficiently, had led to a \u00a316 billion reduction.\n\nHowever the proposed bill increases come amid public fury around firms' rampant polluting of waterways with sewage spills as they continue to hand dividends to shareholders, and bonuses to executives - something which Labour has pledged to clamp down on.\n\nSewage spills into England's rivers and seas more than doubled in 2023.\n\nAccording to the Environment Agency, there were 3.6 million hours of spills last year - equal to about 400 years - compared with 1.75 million hours in 2022. The large amount of water lost to leaks in the system also raises widespread concerns, particularly in dry periods when consumers face hosepipe bans.", "source": {"uri": "chroniclelive.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chronicle Live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nicole_goodwin@chroniclelive.co.uk", "name": "Nicole Goodwin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofwat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ofwat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Water industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Water", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southern Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Water", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thames Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Severn", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "River Severn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkshire_Water", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yorkshire Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England and Wales"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Effects of climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Council_for_Water", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer Council for Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reservoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Water supply"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterway", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Waterway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Environment Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sewage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://i2-prod.gazettelive.co.uk/incoming/article23153436.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Water-bills.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717113", "eventUri": "eng-9717113", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

Thames Water called the study \"alarmist\".\n\nThames Water, the country's biggest water monopoly company, confirmed this week that it had paid two fresh dividends worth \u00a3158.3m in March. Ofwat was already considering action against the firm for a \u00a337.5m dividend payment in October 2023.\n\nThe company's chief executive, Chris Weston, also defended his \u00a3195,000 bonus package this week, saying executives need to be rewarded \"to attract the right talent\".\n\nOfwat has confirmed today that Thames Water has been placed into special measures, meaning it will come under increased scrutiny and be forced to \"fully re-evaluate\" its current strategy to turn around the company.\n\nThe regulator has said it will have \"full access\" to Thames Water's financial information and the firm will need to release a \"financial resilience plan\".\n\nOfwat's price review was originally due to be published in June, but publication was delayed until today as a result of the general election.\n\nThe new Labour government has said it has no plans to nationalise water companies, although MPs on the party's left have urged the leadership to back the idea.\n\nPoliticsHome Newsletters", "source": {"uri": "politicshome.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Politics Home"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofwat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ofwat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sewage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Gardiner", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Barry Gardiner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Water", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thames Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backbencher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Backbencher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_committee_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Select committee (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment,_Food_and_Rural_Affairs_Select_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beaver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eccles,_Greater_Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eccles, Greater Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Eccles, Greater Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterway", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Waterway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Water industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitby", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Whitby"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Whitby"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nationalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Escherichia coli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Thames", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "River Thames"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://res.cloudinary.com/dyw8mv3b0/image/upload/q_85,w_1200,h_1200,c_limit/v1/news/2024_07/2XFF2AF_woptta.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717113", "eventUri": "eng-9717113", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Shit, Thames Water Failed To Complete 108 Upgrades Paid For By Customers", "body": "Thames Water has failed to complete more than 100 upgrades to ageing sewage treatment works to meet legal pollution limits, the Guardian can reveal. The schemes costing \u00a31.1bn were supposed to cut pollution into rivers by increasing the capacity at sewage works, adding phosphorus removal to the treatment process, and installing new storm tanks. The upgrades, which were promised in 2018, are being paid for by customers as part of a five-year spending round to 2025 but will not be delivered within that timeframe.\n\nMeanwhile, Thames Water awaits a crucial decision on Thursday from the regulator Ofwat on the company's new five-year business plan. Thames wants to increase customer bills 59% by 2030 to pay for record investment of \u00a319.8bn to tackle sewage pollution, leaks and water shortages after decades in which the company has sweated assets and underinvested. The company is asking the regulator to allow the late projects to be rolled over into the new spending round, known as PR24.\n\nAsh Smith, the founder of the campaign group Windrush Against Sewage Pollution, said customers had already paid for the projects to upgrade ageing sewage treatment works, and were being asked to pay again. \"Thames Water failed to deliver around 108 schemes that were funded in the last spending cycle and we question whether that a deliberate act to keep it financially afloat. A proper investigation into this company is long, long overdue.\" Smith added: \"It has broken our sewerage infrastructure while extracting cash, right under the noses of regulators and the government.\"\n\nIndustrywide, water companies are seeking to increase customer bills by up to 91% to pay record investment of \u00a396bn. The new environment secretary, Steve Reed, has summoned water company chiefs to a meeting on Thursday after the Ofwat decision on the PR24 business plans. As well as bill increases, Thames wants the regulator to agree to issue it with lower fines for pollution. Thames also wants Ofwat to increase a 3% limit on capital returns in order to attract vital investment as the company struggles to stay afloat with debts of more than \u00a315bn. Thames has said average annual customer bills would be \u00a3608 by 2030.\n\nEDIT\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jul/10/thames-water-fails-to-complete-108-upgrades-ageing-sewage-works-legal-pollution-limits", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Water", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thames Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage_treatment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sewage treatment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofwat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ofwat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phosphorus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_scarcity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Water scarcity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sewage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Thames", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "River Thames"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Reed_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Reed (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Environment,_Food_and_Rural_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewerage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sewerage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Water industry"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Cash_Flow", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Cash Flow", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling/Water_Wells_and_Pumps", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling/Water Wells and Pumps", "wgt": 100}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717113", "eventUri": "eng-9717113", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Profits jumped 21% driven by higher revenues and \"cost discipline\".\n\nRelated: Poor state of Thames Water a 'critical risk' to UK, Starmer and Reeves told\n\nThames has \u00a315.2bn of debt, up \u00a31.3bn on the previous year, the bulk of which could be added to the public purse if the government stepped in to renationalise the troubled company. The Guardian revealed in April a contingency plan, codenamed Project Timber, was being drawn up in Whitehall to renationalise Britain's biggest water company if it collapses.\n\nThames said it was \"reasonable\" to assume it would have sufficient resources to continue operating until at least April 2025, but there were \"material uncertainties\". These included not securing commitments for future funding, a downgrade to its credit rating or a failure to meet its legal obligations.\n\nThe situation is so severe that the new prime minister, Keir Starmer, and chancellor, Rachel Reeves, have been briefed by Whitehall officials that the poor state of Thames presents a \"critical risk\" to the country during their first few days in office.\n\nChris Weston, the chief executive of Thames who joined in January, said the company could still find a solution in the financial markets, depending on decisions by its regulator, Ofwat.\n\n\"I continue to believe that a market-led solution that increases financial resilience is in the best interests of all stakeholders, but it is dependent on securing a final regulatory determination that is deliverable, financeable and investable, as well as affordable for our customers,\" he added.\n\nOn Thursday, Ofwat will give its first view on five-year business plans submitted by English and Welsh water companies, including Thames, last year.\n\nThames said it intended to contact potential investors after Ofwat's documents had been published.\n\nThe Ofwat review will indicate by how much Thames will be allowed to raise bills, and whether its \u00a319.7bn investment plan, intended in part to fix leaky pipes and prevent sewage spills, will be approved.\n\nThe company, which serves 16 million customers in the London and Thames valley regions, said it was working on the basis that an injection of new equity was \"possible\" but \"should no longer be assumed\".\n\nWeston said: \"The challenges we face are well documented, but our operational and financial performance for the last year show good progress, and these positive results provide the right foundations on which to build and improve.\"\n\nIts parent company, Kemble, defaulted on its debt in April. Weston has previously said the company only had enough funds to operate until next spring.\n\nThe slow-burn crisis at Thames Water stepped up in March, when it said shareholders - which include the pension funds USS and Omers - had U-turned on \u00a3500m of promised funding, claiming Ofwat had made the company \"uninvestable\".\n\nThe Guardian has since revealed that Thames's board approved a \u00a3150m dividend just hours before the announcement.", "source": {"uri": "uk.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

With a debt mountain totalling over \u00a315billion, Britain's largest water company reported on Tuesday its cash reserves had fallen to \u00a31.8billion at the end of June, down from \u00a32.4billion just three months earlier.\n\nIn 2023 there were double the number of sewage discharges, up to 16,990 in 2023. Last night Mr Weston defended his bonus, according to MailOnline. He said: \"You need to be able to attract the right talent, the best talent to the company and going hand in glove with that is an appropriate remuneration package.\"\n\nAs a result of its bleak financial situation, Thames Water is seeking new funds to maintain and update their infrastructure, following the withdrawal of \u00a3500million in emergency funds by investors earlier this year. The firm's financial situation will come under further scrutiny on Thursday when Ofwat issues its preliminary assessment of water companies' five-year plans, which includes proposed bill increases up until 2030.\n\nThis announcement will initiate 6 months of discussions with Ofwat, culminating in a final decision this December. Thames Water, serving 16 million customers across London and the Thames Valley, has pitched a plan in April to hike spending to \u00a319.8 billion to modernise infrastructure and cut down on sewage leaks. The company provides water and sewage services to some 16 million customers in London and the Thames Valley region.\n\nIt has spent the past year fighting to avoid being taken over by the government. Communities minister Jim McMahon said on Tuesday morning: \"We recognise over the last 14 years, frankly, the water industry hasn't been regulated anywhere near as firmly as it should have been, and we haven't seen the investment to deal with the sewage scandal. The days of putting shareholder interest above the national interest, frankly, can't carry on and so we do need to look at that and Thames do need to look at their own house and get it in order.\"\n\nOn Monday, the Prime Minister's official spokesperson declared: \"The Government has said in its manifesto that we will put failing water companies into special measures and they will have no choice but to clean up their act.\" Further government discussions have centred on empowering regulators to halt bonus payments to executives responsible for polluting waterways and to impose automatic, substantial penalties for such infractions.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "antony_clements_thrower@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Antony Clements-Thrower", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Water", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thames Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Weston", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chris Weston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sewage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofwat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ofwat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tap_water", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tap water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thames Valley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remuneration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Remuneration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Water industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_McMahon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jim McMahon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterway", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Waterway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifesto", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manifesto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Thames", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "River Thames"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling/Water_Wells_and_Pumps", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling/Water Wells and Pumps", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33207284.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Screenshot-2024-07-09-at-144822.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717113", "eventUri": "eng-9717113", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Net debt is continuing to grow, as the company seeks new sources of equity to help fund its turnaround plan. Bills for all households in London are expected to surge 40% in the next five years if the strategy is approved.\n\nThames' chief executive officer Chris Weston said he's \"well aware\" cash could run out if new equity is not found by the end of May. \"We are planning to be able to address that,\" he told journalists on Tuesday.\n\nThames Water is in crisis after shareholders halted new equity injections in March and its parent company defaulted on its debts, leaving it without the investment needed to fund a turnaround plan to stop chronic leaks and sewage spills across London and Oxfordshire.\n\nIf new equity can't be found, the government may need to step in to help. But Labour was fast to push back on providing taxpayer help for failing companies.\n\n\"There is no program of nationalization for the water industry. Why should bill payers pay twice?\" Communities Minister Jim McMahon told the BBC on Tuesday morning.\n\nHe said the industry has been regulated too weakly over the last 14 years and that they water industry will have to reform. \"The days of putting shareholder interest above the national interest can't carry on.\"\n\nThe company urged regulator Ofwat to approve its business plan in a draft ruling on Thursday to make it attractive to new investors. An equity raise will start following Ofwat's ruling this week but isn't expected to conclude until after a final decision in December.\n\nWeston said the process would likely \"stretch well into next year\" and could be dragged out if Thames decides to appeal Ofwat's decision with the Competition Markets Authority.\n\nHow Debt and Sewage Pushed Thames Water to the Brink: QuickTake\n\n\"For too long this business has been overspending against its allowances and, as is evident, this is not a sustainable business model,\" Weston said in a statement. \"We are focused on improving our financial resilience and learning to live within our means.\"\n\nThere are still signs that Thames hasn't begun that journey yet. The statement confirmed that the company paid another \u00a3158.3 million dividend to shareholders in March, despite already being under investigation by the industry watchdog Ofwat for a previous payment to service debt at its parent company Kemble Water Holdings.\n\nThames has the highest debt levels in England's privatized water industry, a vulnerability that was brought into sharp focus last year when interest rate payments soared.\n\nOn Tuesday Thames said net debt rose to \u00a315.25 billion ($19.5 billion) compared to \u00a313.96 billion a year earlier. Weston said debt will continue to rise in the short term while it still has no new equity to fund its turnaround plan.\n\nAt over 80%, Thames Water is now likely to have the highest regulatory gearing for a water utility in Britain. Ofwat will ask companies to aim for a gearing of 55% for the investment period over the next five years.\n\nThe increase in net debt comes from bonds issued in October and January. Until it can access credit markets, the only option is equity investment. The current shareholders have refused any help calling the company's business plan \"uninvestable.\"\n\nWeston reiterated on Tuesday that he believed government intervention or special administration is still a long way off and warned that it would likely be funded by taxpayers. \"There's a lot more water to go under the bridge and a lot more that we need to do and have to do before that point in time,\" he told journalists.\n\n--With assistance from Alex Wickham and Abhinav Ramnarayan.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Profits jumped 21% driven by higher revenues and \"cost discipline\".\n\nThames is laden with \u00a315.2bn of debt, up \u00a31.3bn on the previous year, the bulk of which could be added to the public purse if the government stepped in to renationalise the troubled company. The Guardian revealed in April a contingency plan, codenamed Project Timber, was being drawn up in Whitehall to renationalise Britain's biggest water company if it collapses.\n\nThames said it was \"reasonable\" to assume it would have sufficient resources to at continue operating until at least April 2025, but there were \"material uncertainties\". These not securing commitments for future funding, a downgrade to its credit rating or a failure to meet its legal obligations.\n\nThe situation is so severe that the new prime minister, Keir Starmer, and chancellor, Rachel Reeves, have been briefed by Whitehall officials that the poor state of Thames presents a \"critical risk\" to the country during their first few days in office.\n\nChris Weston, the chief executive of Thames who joined in January, said the company could still find a solution in the financial markets, depending on decisions by its regulator, Ofwat.\n\n\"I continue to believe that a market-led solution that increases financial resilience is in the best interests of all stakeholders, but it is dependent on securing a final regulatory determination that is deliverable, financeable and investable, as well as affordable for our customers,\" he added.\n\nOn Thursday, Ofwat will give its first view on five-year business plans submitted by English and Welsh water companies, including Thames, last year.\n\nThames said it intends to contact potential investors after Ofwat's documents have been published.\n\nThe Ofwat review will indicate by how much Thames will be allowed to raise bills, and whether its \u00a319.7bn investment plan, intended in part to fix leaky pipes and prevent sewage spills, will be approved.\n\nThe company, which serves 16 million customers in the London and Thames valley regions, said it was working on the basis that an injection of new equity was \"possible\" but \"should no longer be assumed\".\n\nWeston said: \"The challenges we face are well documented, but our operational and financial performance for the last year show good progress, and these positive results provide the right foundations on which to build and improve.\"\n\nIts parent company, Kemble, defaulted on its debt in April. Weston has previously said that the company only had enough funds to operate until next spring.\n\nThe slowburn crisis at Thames Water stepped up in March, when it said shareholders - which include the pension funds USS and Omers - had U-turned on \u00a3500m of promised funding, claiming that the regulator, Ofwat, had made the company \"uninvestable\".\n\nThe Guardian has since revealed that Thames Water's board approved a \u00a3150m dividend just hours before the announcement.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_lawson@theguardian.com", "name": "Alex Lawson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Thames", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "River Thames"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofwat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ofwat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitehall", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Whitehall"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wastewater", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wastewater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sewage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Reeves", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rachel Reeves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Water", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thames Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_(education)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor (education)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumber", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lumber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_rating", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Credit rating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stakeholder (corporate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thames Valley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Water industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pension fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5b8fadde9f525faf0bce285c4c1415f8b946b6f/0_156_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=f0d28110fb9584b7fd6bcb35bad6b3ea", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717113", "eventUri": "eng-9717113", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-03-31", "textStart": 497, "textEnd": 505}], "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Ofwat approved \u00a316.9 billion ($21.8 billion) in spending for the company to invest in improving services for customers and the environment -- a sum below the \u00a319.8 billion that Thames Water had requested.\n\nThe regulator meanwhile gave the company permission to raise customer bills by an average \u00a399 annually over the next five years, nearly half of what it had requested.\n\nIn a statement on Thursday, Thames Water said its spending proposal was intended to \"maintain reliable supplies of safe, high quality drinking water and to take away and effectively treat wastewater across London, the Thames Valley and Home Counties now and in the future.\"\n\nThe company questioned Ofwat's statement that its business plan was \"inadequate,\" but said it would provide the regulator with further evidence to support its proposals and noted a final determination was not due until December 2024.\n\nThe crisis-hit company has more than 16 million customers and is seeking to avoid outcomes including temporary nationalization or being broken up. In spring this year, shareholders rejected its bid for a \u00a3500 million equity injection, while its parent company Kemble defaulted.\n\nThames Water is owned by a consortium of institutional shareholders across pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and private equity. Its biggest external shareholder is the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System, one of Canada's largest pension plans.\n\nThe firm's arrears ballooned over the last two decades, and on Wednesday it reported net debt of \u00a315.2 billion in the year to March 2024. It said that, under its current base-case, it would not run out of money until the end of May 2025, assuming it can continue to draw its revolving credit facilities and utilize all cash resources.\n\nThames Water -- and other British utilities -- have been heavily criticized over the sharp increase in sewage discharge into Britain's waterways, including in the river Thames.\n\nThames Water Chairman Adrian Montague on Wednesday said the company plan would attract \"much-needed investment,\" adding that he believed it was possible to \"turn this business around.\"\n\nIn the company results, Montague said the U.K. water industry required sharply higher investment in the coming years and was competing for debt and equity in a \"very competitive market, at a time of increased regulatory and political uncertainty and risk.\"\n\nAchieving a \"market-led solution\" will require working together with regulators and the government to deliver a turnaround and ensure investors have the incentives to continue to invest in U.K. water firms, he added.\n\nS&P Global on Wednesday dealt the company a further blow, as it placed its class A and class B debt at risk of a downgrade, which it said reflected a belief that Thames Water might not be able to maintain adequate liquidity -- sparking market fears of a \"junk\" rating.\n\nThe Company's position is under additional strain because of the large capital investment program required, S&P said, which will offset free operating cash flow and limit its ability to de-leverage.", "source": {"uri": "nbcdfw.com", "dataType":

In its so-called \"draft determination\", the regulator will sign off on company spending plans and customer bills ahead of a final determination at the end of the year.\n\nIt's a fundamental moment for all our regional monopoly suppliers but none more so than Thames, for whom a bad deal could be terminal.\n\nMoney latest:\n\nCheapest supermarket rankings now include loyalty prices\n\nEarlier this year existing shareholders pulled the plug on a \u00a3500m enquiry injection, and cancelled a commitment to a further \u00a33bn over the next five years, leaving a vacuum in the finances.\n\nThe latest accounts tell us the debt pile got bigger in the last year too, with debt at company level rising \u00a31.3bn to \u00a315.2bn, with another \u00a34bn or so in parent companies beyond the reach of the regulator.\n\nThe company's debt has also been downgraded by ratings agencies, with any further deterioration potentially triggering a default on its group financing arrangements.\n\nWhat Thames needs from Ofwat is an agreement that allows it to increase customer bills sufficiently to make the company attractive to new investors. It has asked Ofwat to allow it to raise prices by 44% and support \u00a321bn of spending over the next five years. It also wants leniency when it comes to fines for pollution and other licence breaches.\n\nIn the words of chief executive Chris Weston it needs to be \"deliverable, financeable and investable, as well as affordable for our customers.\"\n\nThe dilemma for the regulator is that for the privatised model to have any merit, shareholders and investors have to receive a return as well as bearing the cost of mismanagement and poor performance, but punishing Thames might prove self-defeating.\n\nIf the company is not able to raise enough revenue to give investors a return, the alternative is a special administration regime that could land the taxpayer with responsibility for a loss-making utility.\n\nThames has also consistently been among the worst performing water companies, with repeated fines for pollution incidents - up again the last year - as well as overseeing rising customer complaints and persistent issues with leakage.\n\nSources suggest Thames is unlikely to get any special treatment, as any deal would have to be offered to the wider industry.\n\nRead more from Sky News\n\nCrisis-hit Thames Water reveals when it may run out of cash\n\nCard spending falls for 'first time in three years'\n\nMr Weston conceded that the company's future is in the balance, and tellingly admitted that it has been profligate and poorly run in the past. \"We need to learn to live within our means,\" he said.\n\nHe also made the case that Thames's challenges are more acute than its industry peers because of the challenge of operating in London, a congested city with 150-year old infrastructure designed for a population a fraction of its current size.\n\nHe is not yet giving up on turning the company round, though the final verdict will rest with the markets.\n\n\"Not going to speculate on what may or may not happen, we look at all sorts of contingency plans, but in March when I spoke to media I said it [administration] is a possibility, but there's a lot more water to go under the bridge and a lot more that we need to do before that point in time.\"", "source": {"uri": "news.sky.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sky News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofwat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ofwat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Thames", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "River Thames"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Privatization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Water", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thames Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drowning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England and Wales"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermarket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supermarket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Weston", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Weston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Water industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sky News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Cash_Flow", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Cash Flow", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/23/06/1600x900/skynews-thames-water-street-works_6202026.jpg?20230629083446", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717113", "eventUri": "eng-9717113", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

Ofwat said that this reflected its analysis of those plans, removing or reducing costs where expenditure was insufficiently justified, inefficient or for activity for which companies have already been funded.\n\n\u00a335bn of the expenditure reflects the investment needed to reduce pollution, improve customer service, river and bathing water quality, and deliver greater resilience to the impact of climate change, it said. This is more than a trebling of the level of investment in the 2020 to 2025 period.\n\nThe water companies wanted to increased customers' bills by an average of \u00a3144 over the five years. Ofwat has reduced this to \u00a394 (\u00a319 a year), excluding inflation. Thames Water's proposed increase of \u00a3191 by 2030 has been reduced to \u00a399; Severn Trent's proposed increase of \u00a3144 has been reduced to \u00a393.\n\nThe overall investment programme is expected to reduce the number of spills from storm overflows by 44% (compared with 2021 levels) by spending \u00a310bn and upgrading 2,500 storm overflows; this includes the 21% reduction that Ofwat has required companies to deliver by 2025 at their own expense.\n\nSome \u00a36bn is to be invested in securing water supplies, including progressing nine new reservoirs and seven large-scale water transfer schemes.\n\nWater companies will be required to replace around 8,000 km of water mains pipes, a 400% increase compared with the current five-year period.\n\nThese draft decisions are open for consultation and responses are welcome from customers, stakeholders and water companies. The deadline for consultation responses is 12 noon on 28 August 2024.\n\nOfwat expects to publish its final decisions on 19 December 2024. If companies do not agree with the final decisions, they have two months from the date of publication to ask for an appeal to the Competition & Markets Authority.\n\nOfwat chief executive David Black said: \"Customers want to see radical change in the way water companies care for the environment. Our draft decisions on company plans approve a tripling of investment to make sustained improvement to customer service and the environment at a fair price for customers.\n\n\"These proposals aim to deliver a 44% reduction in spills from storm overflows compared to levels in 2021. We expect all companies to embrace innovation and go further and faster to reduce spills wherever possible.\n\n\"Today's announcement also increases the resilience of our water supplies to the impact of climate change and will reduce how much water is taken from rivers by enabling a range of long-term water supply projects, which includes plans for nine reservoirs.\n\n\"Let me be very clear to water companies. We will be closely scrutinising the delivery of their plans and will hold them to account to deliver real improvements to the environment and for customers and on their investment programmes.\"\n\nCoinciding with Ofwat's draft determination, the new secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs, Steve Reed, has written to the regulator to ask it to make sure that infrastructure funding is ringfenced and can only be spent on upgrades benefiting customers and the environment. He also wants Ofwat to ensure that when money for investment is not spent, companies refund customers, with money never allowed to be diverted for bonuses, dividends or salary increases.", "source": {"uri": "theconstructionindex.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheConstructionIndex"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofwat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ofwat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Water industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Effects of climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_resilience", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate resilience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_quality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Water quality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Water", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thames Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Severn", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "River Severn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Water supply network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stakeholder (corporate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reservoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_and_Markets_Authority", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Competition and Markets Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Environment,_Food_and_Rural_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Water supply"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling/Water_Wells_and_Pumps", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling/Water Wells and Pumps", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://www.theconstructionindex.co.uk/assets/news_articles/2024/07/1720682983_1707895567-pollution.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717113", "eventUri": "eng-9717113", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

something which Labour has pledged to clamp down on.\n\nSewage spills into England's rivers and seas more than doubled in 2023.\n\nAccording to the Environment Agency, there were 3.6 million hours of spills last year -

The regulation around it will have to be looked at, and we have to see more investment going forward,\" he told the BBC. \"Thames really do need to look at their own house and get it in order.\"\n\nRegulator Ofwat will make an initial decision on how much Britain's water companies can raise bills on Thursday, before a final ruling on Dec. 19.\n\nHIGHER BILLS\n\nCEO Weston, who is seven months into the job, needs the regulator to allow it to raise customer bills by 40%, excluding inflation, over 2025-30 to pay for infrastructure improvements.\n\nThames' ability to raise new equity and debt will depend on Ofwat's decision. It needs equity of 3.25 billion pounds over the next five years and said formal talks would begin in autumn.\n\n\"It won't conclude until the beginning of next year at the earliest,\" Weston said, adding there was \"interest\" in the market.\n\nA \"supportive determination\" from Ofwat would be helpful but Weston did not expect the next few months to be straightforward.\n\n\"Draft determination, as I said, is a point in time. We will continue to work with Ofwat over the coming months to make our case again,\" he said.\n\nThe government wants Ofwat to ensure consumers get value for money. But Thames Water argues investors need to make returns in upgrading infrastructure which is more than 100 years old to cope with a growing population and climate change.\n\nThe company is struggling with 15 billion pounds ($19.21 billion) of debt. Its current owners said in March they would not provide a 500-million pound equity lifeline, calling it \"uninvestible\".\n\nThames Water said its liquidity of 1.8 billion pounds was sufficient to keep funding operations until the end of May 2025.\n\nFor the year to the end of March, it swung to a post-tax profit of 140 million pounds from a loss last year, but the number of pollution spills rose.\n\nThames Water's nine shareholders include Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System, the UK's Universities Superannuation Scheme, a unit of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and the China Investment Corporation.

whether that's having the confidence to swim at their local beach or experiencing a more reliable water supply.\n\n\"If customers are going to be asked to pay considerably more, they have a right to expect far more in return.\"", "source": {"uri": "irishnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofwat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ofwat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sewage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Water", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southern Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wessex_Water", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wessex Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Water", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thames Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thames Valley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England and Wales"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_utility", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public utility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windermere", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Windermere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_District", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lake District"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Water industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Environment Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Privatization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Council_for_Water", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumer Council for Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_West_Water", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South West Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severn_Trent", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Severn Trent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Utilities", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Utilities"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Greenwich", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Greenwich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Water supply"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling/Water_Wells_and_Pumps", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling/Water Wells and Pumps", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 47}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://www.irishnews.com/resizer/v2/TTJGYWRG4NIAXDBPVLWRWPAP6M.jpg?smart=true&auth=cf93ee3d5793734856baac6cd4b23f61ee59b6fdcb084897cbb6074c4a2c8169&width=1200&height=630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717113", "eventUri": "eng-9717113", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

Thames admitted that sewage discharges shot up from 8,015 to 16,990 in the year to the end of March while pollution incidents rose six per cent from 331 to 350.\n\nBut Mr Weston insisted that the deterioration was largely down to unusually heavy rainfall over the course of a particularly wet year, when 40 per cent more than average fell on London and its Thames Valley catchment area.\n\nMr Weston, who is on a salary of \u00a3850,000, said staff at Thames Water \"go to extraordinary lengths\" to try to prevent sewage or other pollutants flowing into rivers, pointing out that incidents of pollution classified at \"serious\" by the Environment Agency had actually fallen.\n\nHe said, \"No one at Thames likes the thought of pollution or waste going into water courses\", but that the ageing mains and treatment infrastructure were simply not built to cope with recent deluges. February this year had been particularly difficult to cope with as rainfall amounted to 250 per cent of normal and had \"overwhelmed\" a system designed by Sir Joseph Bazalgette 150 years ago.\n\nThe company said: \"As part of our turnaround plan, we are prioritising targeted cleaning of the network to prevent blockages, the biggest cause of network pollutions.\"\n\nBut furious campaigners said Thames bosses and shareholders could not offload all the blame on unusual weather and an ageing infrastructure.\n\nPaul de Zylva, senior sustainability analyst at Friends of the Earth, said: \"Water companies have had free licence to line their shareholders' pockets handsomely for decades while letting our rivers and seas fill with sewage and infrastructure crumble.\"\n\nThe latest pollution figure came ahead of Thursday's key draft decision from regulator Ofwat on how much Thames can put up bills over the next five years to help pay for its investment programme. Thames has asked for one of the biggest hikes -- 59 per cent.\n\nThames Water, which has about 16 million customers across London and the Thames Valley, wants to significantly hike bills to fund \u00a33billion of investment and upgrade the Victorian-era pipes running under parts of the capital.\n\nBut it comes as the debt-ridden firm paid out more than \u00a3195million of dividends in the 12 months ending March, compared to \u00a345.2million the previous year.\n\nIt said the payments were given out to help two financially struggling holding companies, Kemble Eurobond and Thames Water Limited.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sewage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Water", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thames Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Thames", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "River Thames"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Water pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Bazalgette", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joseph Bazalgette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thames Valley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollutant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pollutant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Environment Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage_basin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drainage basin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofwat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ofwat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends_of_the_Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Friends of the Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_era", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Victorian era"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kemble,_Gloucestershire", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kemble, Gloucestershire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kemble, Gloucestershire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling/Water_Wells_and_Pumps", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling/Water Wells and Pumps", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/evening_standard_239/7612b1412dc5d46a366c5312183a763c", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717113", "eventUri": "eng-9717113", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

which release untreated wastewater into rivers and seas when there is heavy rain to prevent sewers becoming overwhelmed - dumped sewage into the environment 464,056 times and for more than 3.6 million hours in 2023.\n\nWater utilities have also been hit by multimillion-pound fines for repeated and damaging illegal pollution in the last five years, and there is concern about the levels of leaks from water infrastructure - especially in times of drought when hosepipe bans are imposed.\n\nAnd worse is to come as climate change and worsening weather extremes, from downpours to drought, pile more pressure on supplies.\n\nMeanwhile, some of the privatised water companies are creaking under high levels of debt or face criticism over dividends to shareholders and executive bonuses.\n\nReacting to the announcement by Ofwat, Giles Bristow, chief executive of Surfers Against Sewage, said: \"The General Election campaign made clear that the public is fed up with those in power turning a blind eye to the sewage scandal.\n\n\"Unfortunately today's announcement, in which Ofwat accepts that we will all have to swim and surf in sewage way beyond 2030, does nothing to change that.\n\n\"Signing off on the continuation of at least 200,000 sewage discharges a year is simply unacceptable and a sign that the regulator still doesn't comprehend the scale of public fury on this issue.\"\n\nHe called for the new Labour Government to launch a public inquiry as the only way to \"help us understand how we got here and how we can dig our way out\".\n\nPaul de Zylva, from Friends of the Earth, said the decision on bills and investment \"yet again proves that our current form of water privatisation is not fit for purpose\".\n\n\"It sees water companies pile pressure on Ofwat to allow them to hike customers' bills to subsidise long-overdue investment in our crumbling sewage infrastructure which might cut or prevent some, but by no means all, pollution.\"\n\nWhile he said Ofwat's draft determination shows it is not pandering to everything water companies want, many will still see the increase in bills as \"unfair\".He called for the Government to provide greater funding for the Environment Agency, which is tasked with regulating the environmental actions of water companies, and put a \"green duty\" on Ofwat alongside its environmental focus, as well as impose tougher sanctions on \"irresponsible\" water firms.\n\nNew Environment Secretary Steve Reed is meeting bosses from all 16 water companies covering England and Wales on Thursday, amid the furore over bills and sewage.\n\nLabour has set out the first steps it plans to take to tackle the issue, including ring-fencing funding for infrastructure, and more power and focus on customers.\n\nTim Farron, environment spokesman for the Liberal Democrats who campaigned heavily on the sewage scandal in the election, warned that any \"insulting price hikes\" by water companies must be blocked.\n\n\"It is a national scandal that these disgraced firms are demanding more money from families and pensioners in a cost-of-living crisis, all whilst dumping raw sewage into our rivers,\" he said.\n\n\"Communities spoke loudly at the election, demanding an end to the sewage scandal and water firms stuffing their pockets with bonuses and dividends. The Government and regulator must listen to the country.\"\n\nThe Green Party has called for water companies to be taken into public ownership.\n\nGreen MP Sian Berry said: \"Once this is done, Government can invest affordably in the creaking infrastructure without all the harm falling on to our bills, and into our rivers and oceans that are currently being treated as open sewers.\"\n\nAnd chief executive of campaign group River Action James Wallace said: \"These bill hikes punish households struggling with the cost-of-living crisis for the abject failure of greedy water companies to invest in their crumbling infrastructure and reduce record sewage spills.\n\n\"For decades the industry has put profit before the environment, rewarding its shareholders with billions in dividends, and in the process filling our rivers with human sewage.\n\n\"We must fix this national embarrassment of systemic sewage pollution which has caused environmental carnage to our rivers.\"\n\nMr Wallace called for failing water companies to be put into special administration, and for Ofwat and the EA to be properly resourced and reformed to prioritise people and the environment.", "source": {"uri":

which release untreated wastewater into rivers and seas when there is heavy rain to prevent sewers becoming overwhelmed - dumped sewage into the environment 464,056 times and for more than 3.6 million hours in 2023.\n\nWater utilities have also been hit by multimillion-pound fines for repeated and damaging illegal pollution in the last five years, and there is concern about the levels of leaks from water infrastructure - especially in times of drought when hosepipe bans are imposed.\n\nAnd worse is to come as climate change and worsening weather extremes, from downpours to drought, pile more pressure on supplies.\n\nMeanwhile, some of the privatised water companies are creaking under high levels of debt or face criticism over dividends to shareholders and executive bonuses.\n\nReacting to the announcement by Ofwat, Giles Bristow, chief executive of Surfers Against Sewage, said: \"The General Election campaign made clear that the public is fed up with those in power turning a blind eye to the sewage scandal.\n\n\"Unfortunately today's announcement, in which Ofwat accepts that we will all have to swim and surf in sewage way beyond 2030, does nothing to change that.\n\n\"Signing off on the continuation of at least 200,000 sewage discharges a year is simply unacceptable and a sign that the regulator still doesn't comprehend the scale of public fury on this issue.\"\n\nHe called for the new Labour Government to launch a public inquiry as the only way to \"help us understand how we got here and how we can dig our way out\".\n\nPaul de Zylva, from Friends of the Earth, said the decision on bills and investment \"yet again proves that our current form of water privatisation is not fit for purpose\".\n\n\"It sees water companies pile pressure on Ofwat to allow them to hike customers' bills to subsidise long-overdue investment in our crumbling sewage infrastructure which might cut or prevent some, but by no means all, pollution.\"\n\nWhile he said Ofwat's draft determination shows it is not pandering to everything water companies want, many will still see the increase in bills as \"unfair\".\n\nHe called for the Government to provide greater funding for the Environment Agency, which is tasked with regulating the environmental actions of water companies, and put a \"green duty\" on Ofwat alongside its environmental focus, as well as impose tougher sanctions on \"irresponsible\" water firms.\n\nNew Environment Secretary Steve Reed is meeting bosses from all 16 water companies covering England and Wales on Thursday, amid the furore over bills and sewage.\n\nLabour has set out the first steps it plans to take to tackle the issue, including ring-fencing funding for infrastructure, and more power and focus on customers.\n\nTim Farron, environment spokesman for the Liberal Democrats who campaigned heavily on the sewage scandal in the election, warned that any \"insulting price hikes\" by water companies must be blocked.\n\n\"It is a national scandal that these disgraced firms are demanding more money from families and pensioners in a cost-of-living crisis, all whilst dumping raw sewage into our rivers,\" he said.\n\n\"Communities spoke loudly at the election, demanding an end to the sewage scandal and water firms stuffing their pockets with bonuses and dividends. The Government and regulator must listen to the country.\"\n\nThe Green Party has called for water companies to be taken into public ownership.\n\nGreen MP Sian Berry said: \"Once this is done, Government can invest affordably in the creaking infrastructure without all the harm falling on to our bills, and into our rivers and oceans that are currently being treated as open sewers.\"\n\nAnd chief executive of campaign group River Action James Wallace said: \"These bill hikes punish households struggling with the cost-of-living crisis for the abject failure of greedy water companies to invest in their crumbling infrastructure and reduce record sewage spills.\n\n\"For decades the industry has put profit before the environment, rewarding its shareholders with billions in dividends, and in the process filling our rivers with human sewage.\n\n\"We must fix this national embarrassment of systemic sewage pollution which has caused environmental carnage to our rivers.\"\n\nMr Wallace called for failing water companies to be put into special administration, and for Ofwat and the EA to be properly resourced and reformed to prioritise people and the environment.", "source": {"uri":

We will go to the market and we will look at a broad church of investors.\n\n\"Some of those investors may or may not be some of our existing shareholders. That process will stretch well into next year.\"\n\nThames' directors warned the funding crisis meant there was a \"material uncertainty\" over whether the company could remain a going concern beyond the initial 12-month period.\n\nThames posted its first pre-tax profit in four years for the year ending March 2024, totalling \u00a375.4m compared with a \u00a330m loss last year.\n\nHowever, net debt rose to \u00a315.3bn, up from \u00a313.9bn a year ago owing to higher levels of spending on its creaking infrastructure.\n\nMr Weston defended the company's decision to pay bosses a bonus this year, which will see the chief executive receive \u00a3195,000 and \u00a3446,000 for chief financial officer Alastair Cochran.\n\nMr Weston said the bonus was based \"purely on performance\".\n\nHe added: \"You need to be able to attract the right talent, the best talent to that company and going hand in glove with that is an appropriate remuneration package.\"\n\nThames Water said it increased dividend payments to \u00a3196m, up from \u00a345m a year ago, to cover the cost of debt interest payments. Shareholders did not receive the dividends, the group said.\n\nOfwat, the water regulator, is due to issue a draft judgment on Thames' five-year business plan on Thursday.\n\nThames is seeking to hike customer bills by an average of 59pc between 2025-29 as part of its request to the regulator.\n\nWithout such a steep increase, Thames has said it could not attract new shareholders to invest in the company.\n\nOfwat's July 11 judgment is a draft determination, with a final decision expected in December.\n\nIf Thames is unhappy with the decision it can appeal the matter to the competition watchdog, which could further slow the process of attracting new investors.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

The plant is classified as one of the UK's most important pieces of national infrastructure.\n\nA financial update due on Tuesday will reveal more details of the UK's biggest water company's tattered finances. Following Thames' annual results, Thursday will see the water company's five-year spending plan and an initial ruling from water watchdog Ofwat on rising bills.\n\nAccording to a briefing provided to the Prime Minister and Chancellor, the Thames River has been included in a list of critical risks requiring urgent attention, with potential financial disruption from the river seen as a potential major threat to critical national infrastructure.\n\nFear that infrastructure collapse could lead to widespread disruption to essential services appears to have been compounded by management failures.\n\nIt has been reported that tackling ailing water companies is one of the top priorities for the Prime Minister's top adviser, Sue Gray.\n\nOn Monday, the prime minister's spokesman said the government would prefer not to nationalise the company, saying that was not the right course of action.\n\nInstead, they added, the government should focus on holding these companies accountable and getting them to invest in and improve our systems instead of rewarding themselves.\n\nNevertheless, the government will be forced to take action to protect London's water supply if Thames fails. Thames is the most indebted of the UK's water monopolies, with debts of $15.6 billion.\n\nThe company's finances have been in shambles since former shareholders, led by Australian bank Macquarie, embezzled billions of pounds in dividends and fined it for pollution and leaks.\n\nThe contingency plan, drawn up by Whitehall and seen by the Guardian, would transform the company into a publicly owned, neutral entity under a special administration, allowing it to continue providing water and sewerage services to 16 million customers in London and the Thames Valley.\n\nThames is burning through its cash reserves as it struggles to attract new investment. Last month, the Guardian revealed that existing shareholders had agreed to pay out a $150m dividend at the end of March, before turning around to provide $500m in emergency funding.\n\nConcerns about the future aren't limited to the company's financial position. Managers fear the company's ability to make and maintain essential improvements to its creaking operations and infrastructure.\n\nGet ready for your business day.

They weakened regulation, left water companies in debt, the sewer system collapsed and illegal wastewater dumping reached record levels.\n\nThey added: The election of this Labour government is a reset moment for the water industry, and in the coming weeks and months this government will outline its first steps to reform the water sector.\n\nThe plan to nationalise Thames would actually put a dent in the government's balance sheet, with investors likely to see huge losses on loans to the company.\n\nThames Water declined to comment.\n\nAn Ofwat spokesperson declined to comment on the specific briefing. In a statement, they said: \"Regardless of the challenges facing Thames Water shareholders, safeguards are in place to ensure customer services are protected. We will publish our views on our business plan for 2025-2030 alongside all other water companies on 11 July as part of our PR24 proposals.

This crucial step involves approving firms' requests for bill increases based on their proposed spending plans, with a final decision expected by year's end.\n\nSouthern Water has put forward the steepest request among utility companies, seeking a 73% increase in bills to \u00a3727 annually. Wessex Water isn't far behind, asking for a 36% rise to \u00a3690 per annum.\n\nThames Water, serving 16 million customers across London and the Thames Valley region, unveiled plans in April that would see expenditure rise to \u00a319.8billion as it aims to use the money to upgrade infrastructure and curb sewage spills.\n\nHowever, this plan also will see customer bills rising by by 44% to \u00a3627 - a proposal that has sparked outrage among consumer groups. The proposed bill increases come amid public fury around firms' rampant polluting of waterways with sewage spills as they continue to hand dividends to shareholders, and bonuses to executives - something which Labour has pledged to clamp down on.\n\nSewage spills into England's rivers and seas more than doubled in 2023. The Environment Agency reported 3.6 million hours of spills last year equivalent to about 400 years a significant jump from 1.75 million hours in 2022. In England, not a single river is rated as being in overall good health, with spots like Windermere in the Lake District suffering from sewage spills.\n\nOutraged campaigners argue that private water companies have doled out billions to shareholders and executives at the expense of adequate investment in the country's water infrastructure although these utilities point to their substantial investments.\n\nThe high level of wastage through leaks raises significant concern, particularly during dry spells when consumers face hosepipe restrictions. Recent research conducted by the University of Greenwich indicates that roughly \u00a385.2bn have been withdrawn by investors from 10 water and sewerage firms in England and Wales since the privatisation of the sector more than three decades ago.\n\nIn recent developments, England's three largest listed water companies - Severn Trent, South West Water, and United Utilities - all announced increased dividends this year compared to last year. Regulations introduced just last year require water companies to demonstrate acceptable service levels for customers and environmental compliance before disbursing dividends.\n\nMike Keil, Chief Executive of Consumer Council for Water, emphasised in May that customers will not accept future rate increases \"unless they see and feel a step change in the service they receive from their water company whether that's having the confidence to swim at their local beach or experiencing a more reliable water supply.\"\n\n\"If customers are going to be asked to pay considerably more, they have a right to expect far more in return.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "josie_clarke@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Josie Clarke", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "lawrence_matheson@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Lawrence Matheson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sewage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofwat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ofwat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Water", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southern Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wessex_Water", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wessex Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Water", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thames Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thames Valley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England and Wales"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_utility", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public utility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windermere", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Windermere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_District", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lake District"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Water industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Environment Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Council_for_Water", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumer Council for Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_West_Water", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South West Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severn_Trent", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Severn Trent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Utilities", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Utilities"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Greenwich", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Greenwich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewerage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sewerage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Privatization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Water supply"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling/Water_Wells_and_Pumps", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling/Water Wells and Pumps", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/money/article33213247.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_consumers-in-england-and-wales-are-set-to-learn-how-much-their-water-bills-are-likely-to-rise-by-over-the-next-five.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717113", "eventUri": "eng-9717113", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

Thames Water wants customer bills to rise by 59% after accounting for inflation. Southern is seeking to raise bills by 91% by 2030, to \u00a3915 a year.\n\nThe letter, organised by the campaign group We Own It, was also signed by the GMB and Unite unions. It says: \"Saturday marked 35 years since the Water Act 1989 established our current model of water and sewage management, including privatisation and top-down regulation.\n\n\"Bills have risen at twice the rate of inflation. No new drinking reservoirs have been delivered. A quarter of our supply leaks out of our pipes. Debts are unpaid; plans 'uninvestable'. And last year, operators released sewage for over 3 million hours into our rivers and seas.\n\n\"If the current failed model remains in place, Labour could be fighting the next election with some bills topping \u00a3915 a year and sewage a greater threat to our health than ever.\"\n\nThe letter calls on the prime minister to pause the current price-setting process and start a root-and-branch public review of ownership and regulation immediately, including consultation with water campaigners, trade union representatives and customers.\n\nWater companies are promising their biggest ever investment of \u00a3100bn to fix ageing infrastructure, cut sewage discharges and build new reservoirs, 35 years after the sector was privatised.\n\nThey are acting after a public outcry over sewage pollution in rivers and seas, and a decline in the state of English rivers to a situation in which no river is deemed to be in good health. As well as concern over river health, there are growing fears about the threat to public health from the way wastewater is treated in England. The chief medical officer for England, Prof Chris Whitty, has said public health must be central to future investment in a new wastewater system to protect people from waterborne diseases from contact with rivers and coastal waters polluted by treated and untreated sewage.\n\nThe regulator Ofwat, which is itself under pressure for allowing companies to pay dividends of \u00a378bn in the past three decades while building debts of \u00a360bn, will on Thursday announce whether it approves the business plans of the main water and sewerage companies.\n\nThe Ofwat decision, which was delayed until 11 July because of the general election, comes amid a growing crisis in the water sector. Thames Water, the biggest privatised water monopoly, is struggling to stay afloat with debts of almost \u00a315bn, and investors are threatening to pull the plug on the company. Ofwat has flagged concerns over the financial resilience of other privatised companies, including Southern Water, SES Water and South East Water, as of the highest concern. The financial resilience of Yorkshire Water and Portsmouth Water is also of concern by the regulator.\n\n\"No other country in the world runs water and sewage in the way we do: 90% is publicly owned and delivered,\" the letter to Starmer says.\n\n\"Regulation has been flawed, captured, and underfunded: a constant threat of the current model. Accountability must be reviewed, including putting community representatives on company boards and using 'sunshine regulation' to deliver greater transparency.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com",

For years, Ofwat sat back and did little as the sector accumulated gargantuan debts, with the effect of turbo-boosting returns to absentee shareholders, neglecting desperately needed investment and service in the process - and polluting our waterways with abandon to boot.\n\nWith Thames Water now on the brink of collapse and public anger mounting at the situation, Ofwat appears to have woken up to the national scandal taking place before its eyes by rejecting water companies' demands for steep bill increases in an interim verdict on suppliers' five-year business plans.\n\nThat is to be applauded. If Ofwat were to emerge from these negotiations with any credibility it had to get tough, particularly given the eye-watering increases some suppliers have asked for.\n\nSouthern Water - one of the more financially stretched companies - topped the league of shame with a proposed rise of more than 90pc once inflation is taken into account between 2025 and 2030. That's equivalent to bill increases of nearly \u00a3306. Industry pariah Thames wants to ramp up bills by 56pc to nearly \u00a3627 per year.\n\nThursday's ruling will come as a severe shock to some, then, after the watchdog ruled that bills will rise by \u00a319 a year or 21pc on average by the end of the decade - a third less than the combined increases that the 16 companies had submitted.\n\nPredictably, it didn't take long for the howls of protest from suppliers to be heard. Industry lobbyist Water UK warned that Ofwat had swung too far the other way and risks killing off investment by watering down returns too heavily. Bemoaning \"the biggest ever cut in investment\", lobbyist Water UK claimed: \"If it doesn't put this right, Ofwat will be repeating the mistakes of the past.\"\n\nNonsense. It's the sort of tin-eared response that merely underlines the extent to which the industry still doesn't get it, despite the uproar at its woeful track record and the dramatic consequence of years of debt-fuelled ownership.\n\nThis is a wake-up call. Suppliers are finally paying the price for their incompetence and greed. Investors have had more than a decade of being allowed to financially engineer these businesses during which the media, campaigners, and politicians warned that the consequences would be extremely bad - but they didn't listen.\n\nIt couldn't go on forever. A system that privatises the profits during the go-go years cannot socialise the losses when the music stops. What shareholders are effectively asking the rest of us to accept is for them to have unlimited upside and for all the risk to sit with bill-payers so that they can walk away when it all goes wrong, leaving the public is left to pick up the pieces. If Ofwat hadn't got tough then there was a real risk of it creating moral hazard.\n\nIn making an example of Thames, the chances of that happening are dramatically reduced. As a direct result of its reckless mismanagement, Britain's biggest water supplier is being placed into special measures. The action means it will face far more intrusive oversight under which it must demonstrate that its parlous finances stack up. It is the first time that Ofwat has used such powers since its formation nearly 40 years ago.\n\nThe company cannot complain. Ofwat officials are scathing about its proposals in the face of intense pressure to clean up its act. Despite having months to put forward a credible plan that regulators could take seriously, Ofwat criticised Thames Water's \"inadequate\" business plan on Thursday morning, claiming it not only \"lacked ambition\" but was submitted \"late and incomplete\".\n\nThe watchdog also revealed that \"parts of the plan did not have the assurances of Thames' own board\", which led to it limiting the amount the company can charge customers. This prompted Ofwat director Chris Walters to remark: \"It is difficult for us to stand behind a plan that a board can't stand behind.\"\n\nCritics will say the regulator should have gone further. Indeed, reports of a planned government crackdown are proof that it could have imposed tougher conditions. Environment Secretary Steve Reed has drafted measures including banning bonuses for executives of heavily polluting water companies, imposing criminal charges on the worst lawbreakers and introducing tougher monitoring of sewage overflows.\n\nThe watchdog has instead sought to strike a sensible balance. It's a bloody nose for the more greedy suppliers, yet it acknowledges that our leaky Victorian infrastructure desperately requires investment.\n\nAt the same time, despite what the water industry's cheerleaders say, there is still room for shareholders to make a return - they just won't be as generous. The challenge for Thames will be to identify the investors willing to accept more modest profits.\n\nA bigger barrier will be a balance sheet stretched to breaking point by an \u00a318bn debt pile that is getting bigger. The company's worsening cash crunch means it is having to increasingly draw down on what's left of its borrowing facilities just to stay afloat.\n\nWithout a proper restructuring plan that includes a big debt write-off, the scramble for billions of new equity is likely to prove fruitless. If that means temporary nationalisation, so be it.

The Government and regulator must listen to the country.\"\n\nThe Green Party has called for water companies to be taken into public ownership.\n\nGreen MP Sian Berry said: \"Once this is done, Government can invest affordably in the creaking infrastructure without all the harm falling on to our bills, and into our rivers and oceans that are currently being treated as open sewers.\"\n\nAnd chief executive of campaign group River Action James Wallace said: \"These bill hikes punish households struggling with the cost-of-living crisis for the abject failure of greedy water companies to invest in their crumbling infrastructure and reduce record sewage spills.\n\n\"For decades the industry has put profit before the environment, rewarding its shareholders with billions in dividends, and in the process filling our rivers with human sewage.\n\n\"We must fix this national embarrassment of systemic sewage pollution which has caused environmental carnage to our rivers.\"\n\nMr Wallace called for failing water companies to be put into special administration, and for Ofwat and the EA to be properly resourced and reformed to prioritise people and the environment.", "source": {"uri":

The rise was attributed to delays in investment to create more capacity at many of the company's 400 ageing sewage treatment works. Chris Weston, Thames Water's chief executive, said the works could not cope with a 40% increase in rainfall and exceptionally high levels of groundwater.\n\nAsked why Thames had failed for many years to invest in upgrading treatment works, Weston repeated that the works were \"old\" and required a lot of investment on top of what had been put in already.\n\nThe company said there had been a \"significant increase in sewage treatment works pollutions\" in the year, caused by delays to pollution improvement engineering programmes, as well as the installation of more monitoring at works.\n\nThe need for improvements at the huge treatment works at Mogden in south-west London and delayed works to increase capacity at treatment works in Witney in Oxfordshire, Chesham in Buckinghamshire, and Fairford in Gloucestershire were given as reasons for the rise in pollution incidents.\n\nCampaigners in these areas have raised concerns for many years about pollution into rivers from the treatment works. In March sewage was pumped into the River Chess from the Chesham treatment works for more than 800 hours over more than a month. Thames Water admitted the works had \"a history of prolonged storm discharges\".\n\nWeston said: \"Pollutions are a massive area of focus for Thames. We deal with over 5bn litres of sewage of waste every day. All of that has to be treated through sewage treatment works. People in Thames Water go to extraordinary lengths to make sure that the network is functioning as it should and do all they can to avoid pollution.\n\n\"Rain has a huge impact on spills. Our sewage treatment works can only take a certain capacity and we have to protect them. When we get adverse rainfall as we did in February, it is a volume that our treatment works were never designed to cope with.\"\n\nThames Water is at the centre of an Ofwat investigation into widespread illegal sewage dumping across its treatment works and faces huge fines. The Environment Agency is conducting a criminal investigation into illegal sewage dumping from its network.\n\nIn its business plan to 2030, which has been submitted to Ofwat, the company is seeking to be treated differently from all other water companies and face lower fines for polluting rivers, as it attempts to stay afloat.\n\nThames, which has debts of almost \u00a315bn, wants to be allowed to raise bills by 59% to pay for investment in infrastructure, as well as paying out higher dividends to its shareholders.\n\nThe company has admitted it has been sweating assets for many years and said bills needed to rise to pay for the investment.\n\nOfwat is due to make a draft determination on the business plan on Thursday.\n\nWeston said one of the reasons the company was putting forward a plan with significant investment was to tackle its ageing treatment works.\n\nPaul de Zylva, a senior sustainability analyst at Friends of the Earth, said: \"Water companies have had free licence to line their shareholders' pockets handsomely for decades while letting our rivers and seas fill with sewage and infrastructure crumble.\n\n\"It's staggering that the company is still counting on weak regulation to allow it to survive by pushing its problems on to its customers - asking Ofwat to allow it to increase bills by a shocking 59%. This means bill payers being left to subsidise what little it's prepared to invest towards fixing the pollution and sewage scandal. The regulator must end this licence for water companies to profit from pollution, while wildlife and our health is put at risk.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sandra_laville@theguardian.com", "name": "Sandra Laville", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Water", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thames Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage_treatment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sewage treatment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sewage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Thames", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "River Thames"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundwater", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Groundwater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chesham", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chesham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chesham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Chess", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "River Chess"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofwat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ofwat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckinghamshire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buckinghamshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Buckinghamshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloucestershire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gloucestershire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gloucestershire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxfordshire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oxfordshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oxfordshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witney", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Witney"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Witney"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends_of_the_Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Friends of the Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Water industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Environment Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wildlife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eafccca5ff274659ba433fe639b16075e9f8080a/0_408_4500_2701/master/4500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=7ff8f8eadb91e2d93a0cda8ac513be50", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717113", "eventUri": "eng-9717113", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

Water companies have asked for \u00a3100bn over the five years to 2030 to run their businesses, almost half of which would be used to deliver infrastructure improvements amid a public outcry over sewage pollution.\n\nAllies of Reed refused to say whether new legislation for the \"special measures\" proposals would be in the King's Speech next week.\n\nBut industry figures believe the legislation is likely to be included in next week's package of new laws.\n\nThe most eye-catching proposal is giving Ofwat new powers to block the payment of bonuses to executives of heavily polluting water companies.\n\nUnder the new regime criminal charges could be brought against the most persistent offenders, as well as the introduction of \"automatic and severe fines\" for wrongdoing by water companies.\n\nMeanwhile the government would introduce independent monitoring of every combined sewage overflows (CSO), which release untreated effluent and stormwater into rivers, lakes and coastal waters.\n\nAlthough all the CSOs have monitors installed, they measure the frequency of overflows rather than the quantity, with water companies self-reporting the data to the Environment Agency.\n\nReed has summoned the heads of all 16 water companies to a meeting at the headquarters of Defra, the environment department, soon after the Ofwat announcement on Thursday morning to discuss the regulator's decision on bills.\n\nAlthough Ofwat is not expected to agree to all of the companies' demands for bill increases, the regulator is still expected to allow a sharp jump in water prices, according to figures in Whitehall and the industry.\n\nThames Water, Britain's biggest water company, has warned that without a generous settlement from Ofwat it will struggle to raise the financing it needs for its financial survival.\n\nThere was fresh anger this week as Thames's chief executive Chris Weston, who joined in January, took a \u00a3195,000 bonus for the three months to the end of March.\n\nIt is not clear how Labour's determination to crack down on the industry will tally with a separate Ofwat proposal for a new \"recovery regime\" for the most stressed water companies to avoid nationalisation.\n\nThis could include leniency on regulatory fines and performance targets such as reducing sewage and water leaks and outages, in exchange for more regulatory oversight for a period of up to five years, the Financial Times recently revealed.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

This might be the case if multiple residences share the same water pipes.\n\nMeanwhile, in some areas, having one is compulsory if the water company requests it.\n\nThe CCW has a calculator that helps you understand if a water meter could save you money.\n\nHowever, the rule of thumb is that a water bill could lower your bills if you live in a property with a high 'rateable value' (the formula used to set estimated water bills), do not use much water and/or live alone.\n\nMeter ruler: Many water bill savings are only possible if you are one of the minority of households that have a water meter fitted, which can monitor exactly how much you are using\n\nUse less water if you can\n\nIf you have a water meter fitted, using less water means paying lower bills.\n\nWater bills for homes with these meters are made up of fees for water used, as well as daily standing charges.\n\nBut using less water also means lower energy bills, as much of the water homes use is heated first.\n\nCCW figures show that if every person in a family of four reduced their daily shower time by two minutes, they could save around \u00a3280 a year in water and energy combined costs.\n\nFix leaks and upgrade thirsty appliances\n\nLikewise, fixing leaks early can save you money on water bills - again if you have a meter fitted.\n\nRead More Getting a new toilet could save you \u00a3109 a year on water bills\n\nSigns of a water leak include the obvious - drips, dampness, walls, floors and ceilings changing colour, mould and a musty smell.\n\nBut some water leaks can be harder to spot. For example, wet patches or greener spots in your garden can indicate a water leak from an underground pipe.\n\nLikewise, low boiler pressure can indicate a leak in your hot water system.\n\nUpdating some of your appliances at the end of their life can also save huge amounts on water bills.\n\nFor example, even replacing your old toilet with a dual flush model could save more than \u00a3100 a year, according to B&Q owner Kingfisher.\n\nThis is because toilets are responsible for 22 per cent of all the water used in a home, and a dual flush loo lets users regulate how much is used in every flush.\n\nCheck if you are eligible for a social tariff\n\nEvery water company in England and Wales has its own social tariff scheme designed to help customers on a low income.\n\nBut who is eligible and the level of support offered varies hugely from company to company. In some instances, bills can be reduced by as much as 90 per cent.\n\nCCW has a list of social tariffs and criteria on its website.\n\nFor example, Thames Water's social tariff is called Water Help.\n\nIt cuts water bills by 50 per cent for homes where this costs more than 5 per cent of their net income.\n\nAlmost two million homes - or 15 per cent - are eligible for water social tariffs but not signed up to one, according to the CCW.\n\nFive water companies use their own profits to help offer cheaper tariffs.\n\nThese are Welsh Water, Severn Trent, Yorkshire Water, SES Water and United Utilities.\n\nConsider the WaterSure scheme\n\nWaterSure is a Government programme run by water firms to discount bills for qualifying households in England and Wales.\n\nTo qualify, a household must be on certain benefits, such as Universal Credit, Pension Credit, Housing Benefit or income-related Employment and Support Allowance.\n\nMost of the benefits on the list are for those on low incomes.\n\nA household signing up to WaterSure will also need large amounts of water, either for medical reasons or because it has a lot of young children.\n\nThey must also either have a water meter fitted, or be on a waiting list for one.\n\nWaterSure provides discounts to both the water and sewerage parts of a water bill.\n\nTo apply, you will need to fill in a form from your water company, and will likely need to prove you are on benefits and have a qualifying medical condition.\n\nConsider water-saving gadgets\n\nMany devices that help save water and money are handed out for free by water firms, though this does depend on where you live.\n\nThese widgets include water-saving shower heads, water butts and so on.\n\nTo find out what you can get, put your postcode into the Save Water Save Money website.\n\nSAVE MONEY, MAKE MONEYInvesting boostInvesting boost5.09% on cash for Isa investorsLearn MoreLearn MoreCash Isa at 5.17%Cash Isa at 5.17%Includes 0.88% bonus for one yearLearn MoreLearn MoreFree share offerFree share offerNo account fee and free share dealingLearn MoreLearn More5.78% savings5.78% savings365 day notice accountLearn MoreLearn MoreFibre broadbandFibre broadband\u00a350 BT reward card - \u00a330.99 for 24 monthsLearn MoreLearn More\n\nAffiliate links: If you take out a product This is Money may earn a commission.

They were warned by civil servants that the dire state of Thames's infrastructure is one of the most urgent problems facing the new government, according to sources.\n\nThe condition of Coppermills, a vast water treatment works in north-east London that serves as many as 3 million people, is particularly alarming, ministers and aides have been told. The site is classed among the UK's most important pieces of national infrastructure.\n\nA financial update on Tuesday is due to reveal more about the frayed finances of Britain's biggest water company. Thames's annual results will be followed on Thursday by an initial verdict from the water watchdog Ofwat on water companies' five-year spending plans and bill increases.\n\nThames was among a list of \"critical risks\" that require urgent attention, with its potential financial collapse considered a potential \"major threat to critical national infrastructure\", according to briefings given to the prime minister and chancellor.\n\nManagement failings have added to fears of potential \"widespread disruption to essential services\" caused by crumbling infrastructure, it is understood.\n\nIt has been reported that the ailing water company is among the top priorities of the prime minister's chief of staff, Sue Gray.\n\nOn Monday, the PM's spokesperson suggested that the government would prefer not to nationalise the company, saying it doesn't \"think it's the right course of action\".\n\nThey added: \"Instead, the government's focused on holding these companies to account, ensuring they're investing and improving our systems rather than rewarding themselves.\"\n\nNevertheless, the government will have no choice but to move to safeguard London's water supply should Thames's finances fail. Thames is the most indebted of the UK's water monopolies and is labouring under a \u00a315.6bn debt pile.\n\nIts finances have been left threadbare after previous shareholders, led by the Australian bank Macquarie, siphoned out billions of pounds of dividends and it was fined for pollution and leaks.\n\nEmergency plans drawn up by Whitehall and seen by the Guardian would turn the company into a publicly owned arm's-length body under the state's special administration regime. This would ensure that it can continue to provide water and sewage treatment services to its 16 million customers in London and the Thames valley.\n\nThames is burning through its cash reserves as it struggles to attract new investment. Last month it was revealed by the Guardian that the company agreed to pay a \u00a3150m dividend in late March - hours before its existing shareholders U-turned on providing \u00a3500m of emergency funding.\n\nConcerns about its future rest not only on its financial position. Officials are fearful of the ability of the company to make and manage essential improvements to is creaking operations and infrastructure.\n\nIn a sign of how serious concerns about its future are, the debate is being weighed at No 10 and 11, rather than solely at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, which has been working on rescue plans with the Treasury.\n\nA spokesperson for Defra said: \"We are closely monitoring the situation and the company remains stable.\"\n\nA source close to Steve Reed, the newly appointed Defra secretary of state, said: \"We are in this situation because of 14 years of Conservative incompetence. The Conservatives weakened regulation, allowing water companies to get into debt while the sewage system crumbled and illegal sewage-dumping hit record levels.\"\n\nThey added: \"The election of this Labour government is a reset moment for the water industry. Over the coming weeks and months, this government will outline its first steps to reform the water sector.\"\n\nPlans for Thames's nationalisation would in effect pull it on to the government's balance sheet. Investors would be likely to face steep losses on loans made to the company.\n\nThames Water declined to comment.\n\nA spokesperson for Ofwat declined to comment on specific briefings. They said in a statement: \"Safeguards are in place to ensure that services to customers are protected, regardless of issues faced by shareholders of Thames Water. We will publish our view of its business plan for the 2025-2030 period on 11 July, along with all other water companies, as part of our PR24 proposals. Thames Water must continue to pursue all options to seek further equity to fund its turnaround plan for the benefit of customers and the environment.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com",

The talks are reportedly at an \"advanced\" stage and bosses \"expect\" to raise the extra funding, but no deal on the investment has been finalised yet.\n\nIn a results statement released on Wednesday, the company warned: \"If it is not possible to raise the additional liquidity, the group and therefore company would not have sufficient liquidity for the going concern period,\".\n\nFurthermore, it highlighted that \"the risk that the funding will not be received constitutes a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the group and company to continue as a going concern\". South East Water is already on regulator Ofwat's watch-list for financially at-risk companies, alongside Thames Water and other regional monopolies.\n\nOn Thursday, a draft verdict from Ofwat on water companies' five-year spending plans and bill increases to 2030 will follow the company's financial update. This will initiate six months of negotiations with Ofwat, leading up to its final decision in December.\n\nSouth East Water has proposed plans that would see spending rise to \u00a31.9billion to maintain and update its infrastructure. However, this would also involve increasing customer bills by 22%. The search for funding comes after South East Water's owners provided a \u00a3150 million loan to a unit in the utility group earlier this year.\n\nThe company managed to narrow its pre-tax loss to \u00a336million in the year ending March 31, a significant improvement from the \u00a374million loss reported the previous year.

This is more than a trebling of the level of investment in the 2020 to 2025 period.\n\nThe total expenditure proposed is \u00a316bn lower than in companies' business plans. This reflects Ofwat's analysis of those plans, removing or reducing costs where expenditure is insufficiently justified, inefficient or for activity for which companies have already been funded; customers will not pay twice.\n\nThe average bill increase for water and wastewater companies will be \u00a319 a year over five years (\u00a394 in total), excluding inflation. Companies' business plans proposed increases averaging \u00a3144 over five years. Ofwat's interventions have reduced the level of bill increases proposed by companies. For example, Thames Water's proposed increase of \u00a3191 by 2030 has been reduced to \u00a399; Severn Trent's proposed increase of \u00a3144 has been reduced to \u00a393.\n\nCompanies have been required to prepare for the future by setting their plans in the context of a 25-year delivery strategy. These proposals include the work of the regulators' joint team RAPID, which is helping to accelerate the delivery of \u00a317bn of new water assets including 6 reservoirs, some of which are part of the wider programme of major projects; in total 9 new reservoirs are proposed.\n\nThe overall investment programme will deliver improvements in the environment, strengthen the resilience of water supplies and improve day-to-day customer service.\n\nThe cost of this investment will initially be funded by shareholders or through borrowing, with these costs then recovered through customers' bills in this 5-year period and beyond. Ofwat has proposed a rate of return of 3.72%. This is above the level set for 2020 to 2025, reflecting increases in the cost of finance and the need to ensure the sector can raise the finance necessary to fund such a significant programme of investment.\n\nDavid Black, Chief Executive, Ofwat said:\n\n\"Customers want to see radical change in the way water companies care for the environment.\n\n\"Our draft decisions on company plans approve a tripling of investment to make sustained improvement to customer service and the environment at a fair price for customers.\n\n\"These proposals aim to deliver a 44% reduction in spills from storm overflows compared to levels in 2021. We expect all companies to embrace innovation and go further and faster to reduce spills wherever possible.\n\n\"Today's announcement also increases the resilience of our water supplies to the impact of climate change and will reduce how much water is taken from rivers by enabling a range of long-term water supply projects, which includes plans for 9 reservoirs.\n\n\"Let me be very clear to water companies. We will be closely scrutinising the delivery of their plans and will hold them to account to deliver real improvements to the environment and for customers and on their investment programmes.\"\n\nEvery five years Ofwat is required to set the price, investment and service package for water companies in England and Wales. Today's proposals are part of the 2024 Price Review (PR24) and cover the period from 1 April 2025 to 31 March 2030.\n\nInvestment\n\nAs with previous price reviews the level of the investment programme is principally driven by environmental requirements, set out through the statutory planning processes led by the Environment Agency, Natural Resources Wales, and the UK and Welsh Governments.\n\nThis has led to companies' proposed total expenditure increasing by \u00a329bn - this is split between a \u00a35bn increase in the core costs for running their business and a \u00a324bn increase in expenditure to meet requirements set by Governments and for other environmental improvements.\n\nPart of Ofwat's role as the economic regulator is to scrutinise companies' cost proposals, to ensure they deliver efficiently; this has led to a \u00a316bn reduction. The reductions have applied to proposals where additional expenditure allowances have not been justified, including where customers are being asked to pay twice, or where proposed costs do not reflect efficient delivery. Where companies can provide additional evidence to justify their proposals it will be considered by Ofwat ahead of final decisions.\n\nThe increase in the scale of investment will challenge companies' capacity to deliver. It is encouraging that over the past 18 months many companies have strengthened their relationships with key suppliers to enable the step-up in activity that will be needed. Ofwat is putting in place additional processes for Thames Water and Southern Water which face some of the greatest delivery challenges; approval for parts of their funding will be phased over time, linking it to progress on delivering their investment plans.\n\nOfwat has established new approaches for large schemes to ensure that investments of over \u00a3100m are delivered as efficiently as possible, improving value for customers and outcomes for the environment. 21 large schemes in today's proposals will be delivered by these new approaches, enabling capital and operational cost savings as well as a reduction in financing costs, while maintaining quality.\n\nIn addition to these large schemes Ofwat has a programme of 18 major projects ranging from reservoirs to water transfers and treatment works. These projects will attract around \u00a326 billion pounds of new investment to the sector over the next 5 - 15 years through innovative competitive delivery models. Third parties will compete to design, build and in some cases operate and maintain this essential infrastructure, driving best value for money for customers. To qualify for these models major projects are over \u00a3200 million and distinct from the rest of the company networks.\n\nThis builds on the experience from the \u00a34.5bn Thames Tideway super sewer, which is currently being commissioned. This is showing how the use of competitive models for delivery and innovation in finance arrangements helps deliver better outcomes for customers and the environment.\n\nThe increased allowance for companies' base expenditure reflects measures including: increased expenditure in maintaining long term asset health by increasing the rate of mains replacement; accommodating population growth including by increasing capacity at sewage treatment works; and the effect of higher energy costs.\n\nBills\n\nThe increase in investment will lead to an increase in customer bills. Ofwat is committed to fair bills for current and future customers:\n\nThe average bill increase for water and wastewater companies for the five years from 1 April 2025 is \u00a394 (21%), around \u00a319 per year.\n\nOfwat welcomes commitments from a number of companies to increase substantially the level of support given to customers who need a helping hand. Overall, nearly \u00a3500 million is going to be made available for the five-year period.\n\nA breakdown of bill changes by company is provided at the end of this statement.\n\nDelivering improved performance\n\nPR24 also sets performance targets which companies are expected to achieve, with rewards or penalties for outperformance or underperformance. There are 8 new environmental targets including:\n\nA fair return for investors\n\nInvestment in the water sector is financed up front by investors and repaid by customers over time. Companies will therefore need to access additional debt and equity to support the investment programme. Since 2021 over \u00a34.6bn of equity has been raised by the sector; business plans identified a further new equity funding requirement of \u00a37bn by 2030. Some water companies will need to take further steps to strengthen their financial resilience and Ofwat has required further assurance about their financial resilience in 2025-30 and beyond\n\nOfwat has set the allowed rate of return for companies at 3.72%, reflecting a cost of equity of 4.8% and debt at 2.84% and underpinned by a gearing ratio of 55%. At these levels, and taking account of the overall balance of risk and return in these proposals, Ofwat is satisfied that an efficient company can finance its functions.\n\nThames Water\n\nOfwat has allowed Thames Water \u00a316.9bn to invest on improving services for customers and the environment. Around 20% of the \u00a316.9bn funding (worth more than \u00a33bn) is conditional on the company demonstrating it is ready and able to effectively deploy investment or that the investment will be effectively and efficiently targeted. This is in addition to the price review process that will see customers' money clawed back if investment is not delivered.\n\nGiven concerns about the performance of the company, Ofwat is imposing a Turnaround Oversight Regime on the company. This will include:\n\nIn addition, we are considering appointing an Independent Monitor to monitor and report on the company's progress, including against its transformation plan. The Independent Monitor would report back to us and be entitled to full access to company information.\n\nNext steps\n\nToday's announcement sets out Ofwat's draft decisions based on its review of company business plans.\n\nThese draft decisions are open for consultation and responses are welcome from customers, stakeholders and water companies. The deadline for consultation responses is 12 noon on 28 August 2024.\n\nOfwat expects to publish its final decisions on 19 December 2024. If companies do not agree with the final decisions, they have two months from the date of publication to ask for an appeal to the Competition and Markets Authority.\n\nA consultation has also been published today on a proposed modification to companies' licences. This would allow Ofwat to if necessary due to unforeseen circumstances.\n\nNotes\n\nAll figures before inflation. Companies proposed changes to bills, as submitted in their business plans is available here. We propose to apply a delivery mechanism for Southern Water and Thames Water so that customers will not pay until we have greater clarity on the timing and profile of these companies' plans. If the mechanism is triggered, this would increase average 2029-30 bills by a further \u00a316 and \u00a35, respectively.", "source": {"uri": "wired-gov.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "WiredGov"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofwat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ofwat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Water industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reservoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Effects of climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Water", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thames Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Severn", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "River Severn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wastewater", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wastewater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_quality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Water quality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_of_return", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rate of return"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_Resources_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natural Resources Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Regulatory agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_Government", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Welsh Government"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_planning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Urban planning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Environment Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England and Wales"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Water supply"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Water", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southern Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tideway", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tideway"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Cash_Flow", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Cash Flow", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://www.wired-gov.net/wg/news.nsf/channel-social/DEVV-6ZKE35/$file/GWC_social.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717113", "eventUri": "eng-9717113", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

embattled Thames Water on Tuesday said its debt continues to rise despite increased revenues, leaving the group with cash reserves taking it through only until May next year.\n\nBritain's biggest water supplier avoided a state rescue under the previous Conservative government, leaving the newly-elected Labour administration to decide whether taxpayers should renationalise the company.\n\nThames said that debt increased around nine per cent to nearly \u00a315.25 billion ($19.5 billion) in the year to the end of March.\n\nBritain's water regulator is on Thursday due to respond to a five-year business plan laid out by UK water companies including Thames, which on Tuesday said it had sufficient liquid funds of \u00a31.8 billion -- enough to see it through until May 2025.\n\n'The challenges we face are well documented,' chief executive Chris Weston said in the results statement.\n\n'But our operational and financial performance for the last year show good progress, and these positive results provide the right foundations on which to build and improve.'\n\nThames on Tuesday said its last financial year saw record investment -- up 18 per cent at \u00a32.1 billion -- to improve 'ageing' infrastructure.\n\nIt was helped by a 10-per cent rise in revenue to \u00a32.4 billion as customers paid more for their water.\n\nThe company, which supplies around 16 million homes and businesses in London and elsewhere in southern England, has missed targets to reduce leaks and slash sewage discharges into rivers, despite the major investment.\n\nEnvironmentalists have increasingly voiced outrage at the rise in pollution on the UK's beaches and waterways, and have pointed the finger at privatised water companies.\n\nThe new Labour government waded into the debate Tuesday after bringing an end to 14 years of Conservative rule in last week's general election.\n\nCommunities minister Jim McMahon said there was 'no programme of nationalisation for the water industry' should Thames Water collapse.\n\nBut he added: 'The days of putting shareholder interest above the national interest, frankly, can't carry on and so we do need to look at that and Thames do need to look at their own house and get it in order.'", "source": {"uri": "newagebd.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Age | The Most Popular Outspoken English

which release untreated wastewater into rivers and seas when there is heavy rain to prevent sewers becoming overwhelmed - dumped sewage into the environment 464,056 times and for more than 3.6 million hours in 2023.\n\nWater utilities have also been hit by multimillion-pound fines for repeated and damaging illegal pollution in the last five years, and there is concern about the levels of leaks from water infrastructure - especially in times of drought when hosepipe bans are imposed.\n\nAnd worse is to come as climate change and worsening weather extremes, from downpours to drought, pile more pressure on supplies.\n\nThe General Election campaign made clear that the public is fed up with those in power turning a blind eye to the sewage scandal Giles Bristow, Surfers Against Sewage\n\nMeanwhile, some of the privatised water companies are creaking under high levels of debt or face criticism over dividends to shareholders and executive bonuses.\n\nReacting to the announcement by Ofwat, Giles Bristow, chief executive of Surfers Against Sewage, said: \"The General Election campaign made clear that the public is fed up with those in power turning a blind eye to the sewage scandal.\n\n\"Unfortunately today's announcement, in which Ofwat accepts that we will all have to swim and surf in sewage way beyond 2030, does nothing to change that.\n\n\"Signing off on the continuation of at least 200,000 sewage discharges a year is simply unacceptable and a sign that the regulator still doesn't comprehend the scale of public fury on this issue.\"\n\n(PA Graphics)\n\nHe called for the new Labour Government to launch a public inquiry as the only way to \"help us understand how we got here and how we can dig our way out\".\n\nPaul de Zylva, from Friends of the Earth, said the decision on bills and investment \"yet again proves that our current form of water privatisation is not fit for purpose\".\n\n\"It sees water companies pile pressure on Ofwat to allow them to hike customers' bills to subsidise long-overdue investment in our crumbling sewage infrastructure which might cut or prevent some, but by no means all, pollution.\"\n\nWhile he said Ofwat's draft determination shows it is not pandering to everything water companies want, many will still see the increase in bills as \"unfair\".\n\nHe called for the Government to provide greater funding for the Environment Agency, which is tasked with regulating the environmental actions of water companies, and put a \"green duty\" on Ofwat alongside its environmental focus, as well as impose tougher sanctions on \"irresponsible\" water firms.\n\nIt is a national scandal that these disgraced firms are demanding more money from families and pensioners in a cost-of-living crisis, all whilst dumping raw sewage into our rivers Liberal Democrat environment spokesman Tim Farron\n\nNew Environment Secretary Steve Reed is meeting bosses from all 16 water companies covering England and Wales on Thursday, amid the furore over bills and sewage.\n\nLabour has set out the first steps it plans to take to tackle the issue, including ring-fencing funding for infrastructure, and more power and focus on customers.\n\nTim Farron, environment spokesman for the Liberal Democrats who campaigned heavily on the sewage scandal in the election, warned that any \"insulting price hikes\" by water companies must be blocked.\n\n\"It is a national scandal that these disgraced firms are demanding more money from families and pensioners in a cost-of-living crisis, all whilst dumping raw sewage into our rivers,\" he said.\n\n\"Communities spoke loudly at the election, demanding an end to the sewage scandal and water firms stuffing their pockets with bonuses and dividends. The Government and regulator must listen to the country.\"\n\nThe Green Party has called for water companies to be taken into public ownership.\n\nGreen MP Sian Berry said: \"Once this is done, Government can invest affordably in the creaking infrastructure without all the harm falling on to our bills, and into our rivers and oceans that are currently being treated as open sewers.\"\n\nAnd chief executive of campaign group River Action James Wallace said: \"These bill hikes punish households struggling with the cost-of-living crisis for the abject failure of greedy water companies to invest in their crumbling infrastructure and reduce record sewage spills.\n\n\"For decades the industry has put profit before the environment, rewarding its shareholders with billions in dividends, and in the process filling our rivers with human sewage.\n\n\"We must fix this national embarrassment of systemic sewage pollution which has caused environmental carnage to our rivers.\"\n\nMr Wallace called for failing water companies to be put into special administration, and for Ofwat and the EA to be properly resourced and reformed to prioritise people and the environment.", "source": {"uri":

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nThe North East is set to have the lowest water bills in the country after industry watchdog Ofwat published its price review for the next five years.\n\nOfwat said that average bills in the Northumbrian Water area would rise from \u00a3415 now to \u00a3460, excluding inflation, in the period between 2025 and 2030. The regulator said that rise would mean the company was \"in a position to deliver the investment that is required\" to improve the water system in the region.\n\nIn its judgement, Ofwat acknowledged that Northumbrian Water had been a \"top performer in reducing internal sewer flooding and pollution incidents\" but said it had performed worse on interuptions to water supply and on leaks. The company has been told to invest \u00a3882m on environmental measures, including a target of reducing storm overflow spills by 38%. Ofwat also wants a \u00a3656m programme to reduce leaks by 7%.\n\nRead more: AI project aims to reduce sewage spills in the North East Keep up to date with all the latest breaking news and top stories from the North East with our free newsletter\n\nOfwat said: \"Overall, to deliver its performance commitments and legal obligations, our draft decision provides Northumbrian Water with a total expenditure allowance of \u00a35.7bn over the 2025-30 period. This is \u00a32.2bn more than the company was provided within the current price review period (2020-25).\n\n\"We consider that Northumbrian Water can deliver its performance commitments and obligations for less cost than it requested, and our proposed allowances are 7% lower than the company's plan.\"\n\nNorthumbrian Water had wanted to increase average annual bills to \u00a3471 a year, and the company has until August 28 to challenge Ofwat's determination.\n\nThe proposed bill level would see Northumbrian Water become the cheapest water company in the UK, with some suppliers being allowed to raise bills over \u00a3600 a year.\n\nOfwat chief executive David Black said: \"Customers want to see radical change in the way water companies care for the environment. Our draft decisions on company plans approve a tripling of investment to make sustained improvement to customer service and the environment at a fair price for customers.\n\n\"These proposals aim to deliver a 44% reduction in spills from storm overflows compared to levels in 2021. We expect all companies to embrace innovation and go further and faster to reduce spills wherever possible.\n\n\"Today's announcement also increases the resilience of our water supplies to the impact of climate change and will reduce how much water is taken from rivers by enabling a range of long-term water supply projects, which includes plans for nine reservoirs.\n\n\"Let me be very clear to water companies - we will be closely scrutinising the delivery of their plans and will hold them to account to deliver real improvements to the environment and for customers and on their investment programmes.\"\n\nThe UK's water companies are also coming under pressure from the new Government, with Environment Secretary Steve Reed set to outline a package of reforms aimed at stopping the \"unacceptable destruction of our waterways\".\n\nAmong the reforms the Environment Secretary is set to announce is ensuring water infrastructure funding is ringfenced and can only be spent on upgrades, as well as a change of company rules to ensure customers are at the heart of the companies' objectives. Consumers will also be given the power to summon bosses to meetings through new customer panels which are designed to hold firms to account while Labour also wants to more than double compensation when water companies fail to meet key standards.\n\nNorthumbrian Water has been contacted for comment.", "source": {"uri": "chroniclelive.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chronicle Live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "graeme_whitfield@chroniclelive.co.uk", "name": "Graeme Whitfield", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofwat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ofwat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northumbrian_Water", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Northumbrian Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_East_England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North East England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitary_sewer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sanitary sewer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Water supply"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Water industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sewage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Effects of climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Environment,_Food_and_Rural_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterway", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Waterway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reservoir"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling/Water_Wells_and_Pumps", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling/Water Wells and Pumps", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://i2-prod.chroniclelive.co.uk/incoming/article29420746.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Howdon-Sewage-Treatment-Works.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717113", "eventUri": "eng-9717113", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-28", "textStart": 1811, "textEnd": 1820}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

Major tech companies like Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, and Google leading the way.\n\nPre-market data implies around 20 points of losses on the Nasdaq when trading commences, bringing the tech-heavy index down to 20,646.\n\nIt is a big day for macroeconomic data, with inflation and employment data on the agenda.\n\nOn the company news front, PepsiCo is set to fall after noting \"subdued\" North American snack demand in the second quarter.\n\nDelta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL), meanwhile, flew to record revenues, but its shares are set to fall 9% as earnings touched down 12% lower year on year.\n\nBack in London and the FTSE 100 blue-chip index is currently up 23 points to 8,216.\n\n12.53pm: Water bill price hikes a 'bitter pill' says Labour\n\nLabour chancellor Rachel Reeves has called the planned 21% increase in water bills by 2030 a \"bitter pill\" for Brits to swallow.\n\nUnder draft proposals released today by regulator Ofwat, water firms will be allowed to hike bills by an average of \u00a319 per year, or \u00a394 over five years to 2030.\n\n\"It's clearly a bitter pill for people who are seeing today's announcements about higher water bills,\" said Reeves.\n\n\"This reflects 14 years of failure from the Conservatives to drive investment to reduce pollution, and to ensure that families are not struggling the way that they have been with the cost-of-living crisis.\"\n\nWhile it comes at a time of public outrage over escalating sewage spills and water contamination incidents, the price hikes fall significantly short of what the water companies wanted.\n\nThames Water, for instance, will only be allowed to raise water prices by \u00a399 over the next five years, barely half of the \u00a3191 it was seeking.\n\nIn a sign that this compromise will satisfy no one, campaigners and the Liberal Democrats have robustly rubbished the price hikes as unfair, disgraceful and insulting.\n\nIndustry group Water UK was equally outraged for the opposite reason, calling the decision to not meet water companies' demands \"an unrealistic and unfair decision from Ofwat, and our economy and environment will pay the price\".\n\n12.25pm: Ofwat in water firm face-off\n\nWater regulator Ofwat is preparing for a confrontation with Britain's water executives over the austere draft determination proposals released today.\n\nIn its five-year review of consumer bill prices and investment spending, Ofwat has allowed UK water companies to increase bills by only 21% by 2030.\n\nWhile this is positive news for consumers, it significantly falls short of the water firms' expectations, raising concerns about a potential shortfall in essential infrastructure investment.\n\nDavid Henderson, chief executive of industry group Water UK, told the BBC that Ofwat has \"got this wrong.\"\n\n\"This is an unrealistic and unfair decision from Ofwat, and our economy and environment will pay the price,\" he added.\n\nAnother spokesperson for Water UK described it as \"the biggest ever cut in investment,\" contrasting sharply with Ofwat boss David Black's assertion that the plans represent the \"biggest ever\" investment in the water sector.\n\n11.41am: Pound at four-month high\n\nA spate of bullish economic figures has pushed the pound to a four-month high.\n\nGross domestic product figures show that Labour has inherited an economy growing faster than expected, while construction output also surprised to the upside.\n\nThe pound rallied in response, as the markets began to wonder if the Bank of England intends to delay anticipated interest rate cuts.\n\n\"After all, cutting rates is something a central bank does to stimulate a lackluster economy, not grease the wheels for one already moving ahead,\" stated Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.\n\nMould added: \"That said, momentum could easily lose pace, particularly if the jobs market weakens and sticky inflation causes consumers to stay cautious on spending.\"\n\nIG data shows that rate cut expectations have been trimmed slightly, although a 25-basis-point move lower is still widely favoured in September.\n\n10.53am: Hargreaves warns of diluted investor rights under new listing regime\n\nThe Financial Conduct Authority today announced an overhaul of the UK listing regime, aimed at making London's struggling capital markets a more attractive place for global businesses.\n\nBut Tom Lee, head of trading proposition at Hargreaves Lansdown, warned that certain measures being implemented by the FCA could harm shareholders.\n\nWhile \"a successful listings regime which supports our home market is essential,\" Lee said that \"making the UK an attractive place to list has to be balanced with rights for shareholders and ensuring that the quality of the market is not diluted.\"\n\nUnder the new listing rules coming into effect at the end of the month, listed companies will not require shareholder approval on significant or related-party transactions. They will also have more flexibility around enhanced voting rights.\n\n\"We have been concerned that the plan to remove shareholder votes on significant and related-party transactions would dilute investors' rights,\" said Lee. \"We will watch closely as these new rules embed.\"\n\nOn the bright side, Lee noted that retail access to primary and secondary listings will be enhanced under the new rules.\n\n\"The demand from retail investors to buy into the equities market is there, and regulatory change should support this demand.\n\n\"Boosting retail investment on the stock exchange will have wider market benefits, providing depth and liquidity, as well as boosting interest in investment with the wider public, unlocking further capital for UK-listed companies.\"\n\n10.01am: FCA overhauls UK listing standards\n\nThe Financial Conduct Authority has unveiled the biggest overhaul of UK listing requirements in decades, aimed at rejuvenating London's flailing capital markets.\n\nThe primary goal of the overhaul is to make it easier and more attractive for companies to list their shares in the UK, with the biggest change being the scrapping of Britain's two-tier listing structure.\n\nHistorically, Listings have been divided into primary and secondary segments, with the latter having stricter reporting standards.\n\nA single category called 'commercial companies' will replace this structure when the rules into into effect at the end of this month.\n\nKey changes include removing the need for shareholder votes on significant or related party transactions and allowing flexibility around enhanced voting rights.\n\nA more detailed breakdown of the changes is available here.\n\n9.30am: Water companies buoy market after Ofwat review\n\nMore on the water sector where share price reactions suggest a bullet had been dodged especially by SouthWest Water owner Pennon.\n\nIts share price is up by a thumping 6.3% to 658p.with Severn Trent up 2.7% at 2,687p, and United Utilities 2.3% higher at 1,090p\n\nIndeed, Severn Trent and United Utilities are Footsie's biggest gainers after Ofwat's latest decision on price rises between 2025 and 2030.\n\nMidlands-focused Severn Tent had asked for a \u00a3144 rise over the five years, but got \u00a393 (23%). United Utilities gets a \u00a394 rise (21%) while Pennon's South West Water arm gets a \u00a364 (13%) rise. All exclude inflation.\n\nOfwat said in total, an average bill will rise by \u00a319 a year and pay for \u00a388 billion of spending by the sector of which \u00a335 billion will be directed towards fewer sewage spills and better water quality, including \u00a310 billion for storm overflows.\n\nFootsie up 18 at 8,211.\n\n8.55am: The morning so far\n\nThe FTSE 100 shifted to and fro when trading commenced this Thursday, but it ultimately looks to be heading in the right direction.\n\nAs of 8.55am, the blue-chip index was trading 15 points higher at 8,208, supported by a raft of bullish economic announcements.\n\nGDP figures show that the economy grew by 1.4% year on year in May, outstripping the expected growth rate of 1.2% and doubling April's 0.7% gain.\n\nMonth on month, gross domestic product grew by 0.4%, an upside surprise following a zero-growth period in April, though the data still shows \"significant room for improvement under the incoming Labour government\", according to Rob Morgan, chief investment analyst at Charles Stanley (LSE:CAY).\n\nConstruction output, meanwhile, advanced by 0.8% year-on-year in May, marking a strong rebound from a 2.1% drop in the prior month and exceeding market expectations of a 1.9% decline.\n\nWater firms Severn Trent PLC (LSE:SVT) and United Utilities Group PLC (LSE:UU.) were the two biggest FTSE 100 risers of the morning.\n\nThis follows regulator Ofwat's latest draft determination, which sets the pricing and investment agenda for British water firms.\n\nOn average, water bills are set to rise 21% by 2030, Ofwat declared.\n\nThough this is less than what the water firms wanted, Severn Trent is higher following a decent first-quarter financial update.\n\nElsewhere in company news, Dr Martens has published a bare trading update prior to its AGM meeting this morning.\n\nThe classic British footwear company said that \"trading since the start of this financial year has been in line with expectations and our guidance for (financial 2025) remains unchanged\".\n\n8.43am: Construction output grows\n\nConstruction output in the UK advanced by 0.8% year-on-year in May 2024, according to the Office for National Statistics.\n\nThis marks a significant rebound from a 2.1% drop in the prior month and exceeded market expectations of a 1.9% decline.\n\nIt was the first expansion in construction output since January.\n\nThe increase was driven by a 7.7% rise in repair and maintenance activity, up from 6.4% in April, while new work saw a smaller decline of 4% compared to 9.4% previously.\n\n8.30am: Dr Martens targets growth in US direct-to-customer market\n\nDr Martens has published a bare trading update prior to its AGM meeting this morning.\n\nThe classic British footwear company said that \"trading since the start of this financial year has been in line with expectations and our guidance for (financial 2025) remains unchanged\".\n\nThe first quarter is typically \"the smallest period of our financial year, representing the end of the Spring/Summer season\", said the group, adding that the current financial year will be weighted to the second half.\n\n\"The upcoming Autumn/Winter 24 season remains a key focus,\" said Dr Martens, with detailed trading plans currently being implemented.\n\nDr Martens is targeting target positive direct-to-customer growth in the US in the second half of the current financial year.\n\n\"Work on our cost action plan is ongoing and we will provide a detailed update at our first half results in November.\"\n\nShares were up 1.6% in opening exchanges.\n\n8.25am: Blue chips wobble\n\nMarkets dipped their toes into the red in opening trades despite pre-market data pointing to a strong start.\n\nThe FTSE 100 is currently a handful of points lower at 8,191, with Rolls-Royce Group plc, BAE Systems PLC (LSE:BA.) and Antofagasta plc among the worst performers.\n\n8.10am: Labour has inherited improving economy, GDP data shows\n\nBritain's economy grew by 1.4% year on year in May, outstripping the expected growth rate of 1.2% and doubling April's 0.7% gain.\n\nMonth on month, gross domestic product grew by 0.4%, an upside surprise following a zero-growth period in April.\n\n\"This should be a boon for the new Labour government with growth now likely to outstrip the OBR's 2024 GDP forecasts, partially offsetting some of the projected increase in interest rate costs,\" said Deutsche Bank's chief UK economist Sanjay Raja.\n\nAccording to Rob Morgan, chief investment analyst at Charles Stanley (LSE:CAY): \"The UK's economic scorecard shows significant room for improvement under the incoming Labour government.\n\n\"The UK economy has been subdued coming out of the pandemic, an energy crisis, and a cost-of-living crisis which has been very difficult for UK consumers.\n\n\"However, tepid growth now looks to be warming up heading into the second half of the year.\"\n\nMorgan said today's GDP data \"illustrates we are in the midst of a very gentle upswing in activity following a slowdown in 2023\"\n\n7.59am: Thames Water bills to rise by \u00a399, barely half of what it sought\n\nOfwat will allow Thames Water to raise its annual bills by \u00a399 over the next five years, falling significantly below what the London and south east England water supplier wanted.\n\nOfwat made the announcement in its latest draft determination, which sets investment and pricing targets for Britain's water suppliers.\n\nThames Water was seeking a \u00a3191 bill rise to support investment in creaking infrastructure.\n\nDespite slashing Thames Water's pricing wishes, Ofwat has outlined some strict expectations of the water supplier.\n\nOfwats expects Thames Water to deliver a 19% reduction in leakage, and 18% reduction in phosphorus and a full 50% reduction in pollution incidents from average 2020-23 levels.\n\nOver 2025-30, Thames Water should deliver a 66% reduction in water supply interruptions and a 55% reduction in internal sewer flooding events from 2020-23 levels.\n\nThames Water is expected to deliver \u00a316.9 billion worth in total infrastructure improvements.\n\n7.35am: Annual water bills to rise 21% by 2030\n\nWater bills are expected to rise by \u00a319 per year to fund investment into Britain's ageing infrastructure, Ofwat has declared.\n\nIt means the average household water bill across the UK will increase from \u00a3441 to \u00a3535 by 2030, an increase of 21%.\n\nThis is below the average asked of Ofwat by Thames Water, United Utilities and other major water firms.\n\nOfwat laid out the plans in the regulator's draft determination, which sets the agenda for all UK water firms over the next five years.\n\nIt has proposed total investment spending to increase to \u00a388 billion between 2025 and 2030, a 50% increase from the previous draft determination.\n\nOfwat expects water companies to triple investment in new infrastructure and resources \"to improve the environment, resilience and service\".\n\n\"We expect increased investment to be reflected in better performance,\" said Ofwat.\n\n\"We set each company targets for up to 23 areas of performance which are important to customers.\n\n\"If companies do not meet their targets each year, they will face automatic penalties, reflected in reduced bills. But there are incentives to beat the targets, and good performance will be rewarded.\"\n\nSouth West Water owner Pennon and United Utilities said they will review Ofwat's draft determination and will respond by 28 August.\n\n7.10am: Markets to bounce higher\n\nThe FTSE 100 looks set to move high when trading commences today following a bullish session on Wednesday, when the blue-chip index finished 53 points higher at 8,193.\n\nMarkets were buoyed by a strong performance from airline and utilities stocks, as well an afternoon rally from Ladbrokes-owner Entain PLC (LSE:ENT) in the run up to England's victory over Netherlands in the Euro semi-finals.\n\nBetter-than-expected GDP figures released this morning should offer some support.\n\nThe economy expanded 1.4% year on year in May, beating expectations of a 1.2% expansion. Month on month, the economy rose 0.4% after not moving a blip in April.\n\nOn the company news front, recruiter Hays PLC (LSE:HAS) reports its full-year earnings amid a lukewarm time for City recruiters.\n\nWater firms are on tenterhooks as Ofwat prepares to rule on their five-year investment and pricing plans in the latest draft determination.", "source": {"uri":

state rescue under the previous Conservative government, leaving the newly-elected Labour administration to decide whether taxpayers should renationalise the company.\n\nThames said that debt increased around nine percent to nearly pound15.25 billion ($19.5 billion) in the year to the end of March.\n\nBritain's water regulator is on Thursday due to respond to a five-year business plan laid out by UK water companies including Thames, which on Tuesday said it had sufficient liquid funds of pound1.8 billion -- enough to see it through until May 2025.\n\n\"The challenges we face are well documented,\" chief executive Chris Weston said in the results statement.\n\n\"But our operational and financial performance for the last year show good progress, and these positive results provide the right foundations on which to build and improve.\"\n\nThames on Tuesday said its last financial year saw record investment -- up 18 percent at pound2.1 billion -- to improve \"ageing\" infrastructure.\n\nIt was helped by a 10-percent rise in revenue to pound2.4 billion as customers paid more for their water.\n\nThe company, which supplies around 16 million homes and businesses in London and elsewhere in southern England, has missed targets to reduce leaks and slash sewage discharges into rivers, despite the major investment.\n\nEnvironmentalists have increasingly voiced outrage at the rise in pollution on the UK's beaches and waterways, and have pointed the finger at privatised water companies.\n\nThe new Labour government waded into the debate Tuesday after bringing an end to 14 years of Conservative rule in last week's general election.\n\nCommunities minister Jim McMahon said there was \"no programme of nationalisation for the water industry\" should Thames Water collapse.\n\nBut he added: \"The days of putting shareholder interest above the national interest, frankly, can't carry on and so we do need to look at that and Thames do need to look at their

The situation has become so bad that Thames warned there was a \"material uncertainty\" over whether it can continue beyond the next 12 months.\n\nMr Weston, 60, is now racing to stitch up a funding deal with major infrastructure and pension investors that would inject fresh capital into the group and stave off a Labour nationalisation. Documents published on Tuesday revealed that he needs to find \u00a33.25bn from investors and strike a deal with bondholders, while also keeping regulators happy.\n\nThames has been struggling for several months owing to its complex financial structure.\n\nAfter its tortured ownership under Macquarie, which took out billions in dividends, the group has been left with \u00a315.3bn worth of debt and a creaking 19th century infrastructure dating back to when it was built by engineer Joseph Bazalgette.\n\nFor the new Labour government, the crisis at Thames poses the first real test of its mettle amid questions over whether a failure by Mr Weston to strike his deal could trigger nationalisation. Will Mr Weston succeed and live up to his battlefield status, or will Sir Keir Starmer be forced to step in and revive memories of Labour's prior nationalisations?\n\nThe Government has so far indicated it has no desire to bring Thames back under state control, but if Mr Weston fails the taxpayer could become the investor of last resort.\n\nThe new Business Secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, said there is no desire to re-nationalise Thames while Chancellor Rachel Reeves has also said a move \"doesn't stack up\" against the party's fiscal rules.\n\nYet if Mr Weston fails to get a deal done in time, Ministers could be forced to act\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Labour has already hinted it wants to take a more interventionist role with water companies. Its manifesto pledged to put \"failing\" water companies into \"special measures\".\n\nThe Government has so far failed to spell out what this means, and Mr Weston himself admitted he was confused about the concept.\n\n\"I don't yet fully understand what the special measures referred to in the Labour manifesto are,\" he admitted on Tuesday.\n\nAmid rising anger over pollution and sewage in water supplies, there are growing calls from backbench MPs to nationalise water groups.\n\nLeft-wing Labour MPs such as Kate Osamor have previously called for Thames Water to be brought back into public ownership, while Clive Lewis has also indicated support for ditching a capitalist model for water companies.\n\nRuth Cadbury, a more centrist Labour MP, whose constituency covers the River Thames, backed the Government to introduce special measures for failing water companies after Thames's update today.\n\n\"I know the Government is not saying nationalisation, but what's more important is ensuring that in the years to come we have clean water to drink and they process sewage without polluting our rivers and beaches.\n\n\"My understanding is that special measures do not mean nationalisation. Nationalisation is very structural and what my constituents want is outcomes - and the structure of how this happens isn't necessarily the answer.\n\n\"Our front bench is not ruling it in, nor are they ruling it out.\"\n\nIndustry figures are increasingly fearful that if Thames goes into special administration, the Government could seek to nationalise the whole water sector.\n\nThe Earl of Devon, a crossbench peer, recently highlighted the wider industry issue, pointing out that growing regulatory burdens on water companies such as the Environment Act were making it \"unprofitable\" to invest in the water industry and that nationalisation was \"at some point inevitable\".\n\nMr Weston would not be drawn on his detailed discussions with the Government but said that although a bailout was a \"possibility\" there was \"a lot more water to go under the bridge\".\n\n\"It is extremely early days,\" he said. \"We have been in contact with the Government, as you would imagine, as part of the normal course of process and I have every confidence that we will have discussions, as appropriate, with them in the near future.\"\n\nFor the former British Gas executive, who is widely considered to have brought a fresh reality to proceedings and displays a calmness under pressure that reflects his military background, his most pressing task now is to find new investors to take the strain.\n\nThames's nine current shareholders, which includes the Canadian pension fund giant Omers and UK groups like Hermes and USS, have failed to commit to any fresh funding owing to uncertainty over Thames' future.\n\nEarlier this year they pulled the plug on an emergency \u00a3500m equity injection after Thames was deemed \"uninvestable\" in its current state.\n\nWorking with his advisers, Mr Weston is now planning to launch a charm offensive in the autumn to lure new investors to stump up \u00a33.25bn.\n\nHe suggested there was \"interest in the market\" to buy shares in the company and that \"informal discussions\" had already taken place.\n\n\"We are wholly focused on bringing new equity into Thames Water. We will go to the market and we will look at a broad church of investors\" he said.\n\n\"Some of those investors may or may not be some of our existing shareholders, that isn't a matter entirely for them.\"\n\nOne glimmer of hope for Thames is the booming interest in infrastructure investments from major North American investors. The likes of BlackRock, Brookfield and KKR have all sung the praises of infrastructure in recent months due to its stable returns.\n\nYet to lure investors in, investors need to be able to make a healthy profit and that hinges on the role of Britain's water regulator Ofwat.\n\nThe regulator, led by chief executive David Black, will deliver a key verdict on July 11 by ruling on whether five-year business plans put forward by Britain's 20 water companies can proceed. Thames wants to hike customer bills by 56pc to an average of \u00a3608 per year by 2030.\n\nIt says the ratepayer hike is required for a \u00a320bn investment plan and to make the company attractive to investors.\n\nIf Ofwat agrees, the fresh funding package could unlock a new wave of investors into the group and stave off insolvency. Fail, and Thames could struggle to attract the cash needed to survive.\n\nThe problem poses serious questions for the new Labour government who are keen to both protect ratepayers from bill rises amid the cost of living crisis and maintain its pro-business stance.\n\nLuke Hickmore, a leading bondholder in Thames Water, said Thames' latest warning over whether it can continue was \"a shot across the bows of Ofwat\".\n\n\"It just continues to amp the pressure on them,\" he said.\n\n\"Saying these are things that need to be covered to avoid going into special administration, which would be very bad for the sector, this is part of that whole cat and mouse game between the regulator and Thames.\n\n\"I do think this is quite a careful game for Ofwat to play because you don't want to spook investors.\"\n\nIt is understood that Labour was in contact with Thames bondholders before the election, with creditors lobbying against any plans to force losses on lenders.\n\nMr Weston suggested Ofwat could push through a bill hike for Thames while also cracking down on other water companies. He pointed to the unique challenges of supplying water to London, a city with nine million people.\n\n\"Operating in London, one of the most congested cities in the world with an infrastructure that's 150 years old and that needs replacing, is a very different prospect to operating elsewhere in the country,\" he said.\n\nMr Weston, who previously led energy provider Aggreko, said getting shareholders to inject equity was better than forcing taxpayers to shoulder the burden.\n\n\"I don't think it's in the interest of anyone that we go into special administration that is not good for our stakeholders. It will probably go to the taxpayer so it is not a solution.\n\n\"Special administration is absolutely not inevitable. There is an alternative,\" he said.\n\nTime is not on his or the Government's side, however.", "source": {"uri": "uk.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Nationalisation is very structural and what my constituents want is outcomes and the structure of how this happens isn't necessarily the answer.\n\n\"Our front bench is not ruling it in, nor are they ruling it out.\"\n\nIndustry figures are increasingly fearful that if Thames goes into special administration, the Government could seek to nationalise the whole water sector.\n\nThe Earl of Devon, a crossbench peer, recently highlighted the wider industry issue, pointing out that growing regulatory burdens on water companies such as the Environment Act was making it \"unprofitable\" to invest in the water industry and that nationalisation was \"at some point inevitable\".\n\nMr Weston would not be drawn on his detailed discussions with the Government but said that although a bailout was a \"possibility\" there was \"a lot more water to go under the bridge\".\n\n\"It is extremely early days,\" he said. \"We have been in contact with the Government, as you would imagine, as part of the normal course of process and I have every confidence that we will have discussions as appropriate with them in the near future.\"\n\nFor the former British Gas executive, who is widely considered to have brought a fresh reality to proceedings and displays a calm under pressure which reflects his military background, his most pressing task now is to find new investors to take the strain.\n\nThames' nine current shareholders, which includes the Canadian pension fund giant Omers and UK groups like Hermes and USS, have failed to commit to any fresh funding owing to uncertainty over Thames' future.\n\nEarlier this year they pulled the plug on an emergency \u00a3500m equity injection after Thames was deemed \"uninvestable\" in its current state.\n\nWorking with his advisers, Mr Weston is now planning to launch a charm offensive in the autumn to lure new investors to stump up \u00a33.25bn.\n\nHe suggested there was \"interest in the market\" to buy shares in the company and that \"informal discussions\" had already taken place.\n\n\"We are wholly focused on bringing new equity into Thames Water. We will go to the market and we will look at a broad church of investors\" he said.\n\n\"Some of those investors may or may not be some of our existing shareholders, that isn't a matter entirely for them.\"\n\nOne glimmer of hope for Thames is the booming interest in infrastructure investments from major North American investors. The likes of BlackRock, Brookfield and KKR have all sung the praises of infrastructure in recent months due to its stable returns.\n\nYet to lure investors in, investors need to be able to make a healthy profit and that hinges on the role of Britain's water regulator Ofwat.\n\nThe regulator, led by chief executive David Black, will deliver a key verdict on July 11 by ruling on whether five-year business plans put forward by Britain's 20 water companies can proceed.\n\nThames wants to hike customer bills by 56pc to an average of \u00a3608 per year by 2030.\n\nIt says the ratepayer hike is required for a \u00a320bn investment plan and to make the company attractive to investors.\n\nIf Ofwat agrees, the fresh funding package could unlock a new wave of investors into the group and stave off insolvency. Fail, and Thames could struggle to attract the cash needed to survive.\n\nThe problem poses serious questions for the new Labour government who are keen to both protect ratepayers from bill hikes amid the cost of living crisis and maintain its pro-business stance.\n\nLuke Hickmore, a leading bondholder in Thames Water, said Thames' latest warning over whether it can continue was \"a shot across the bows of Ofwat\".\n\n\"It just continues to amp the pressure on them,\" he said.\n\n\"Saying these are things that need to be covered to avoid going into special administration, which would be very bad for the sector, this is part of that whole cat and mouse game between the regulator and Thames.\n\n\"I do think this is quite a careful game for Ofwat to play because you don't want to spook investors.\"\n\nIt is understood that Labour was in contact with Thames bondholders before the election, with creditors lobbying against any plans to force losses on lenders.\n\nMr Weston suggested Ofwat could push through a bill hike for Thames while also cracking down on other water companies. He pointed to the unique challenges of supplying water to London, a city with nine million people.\n\n\"Operating in London, one of the most congested cities in the world with an infrastructure that's 150 years old and that needs replacing, is a very different prospect to operating elsewhere in the country,\" he said.\n\nMr Weston, who previously led energy provider Aggreko, said getting shareholders to inject equity was better than forcing taxpayers to shoulder the burden.\n\n\"I don't think it's in the interest of anyone that we go into special administration that is not good for our stakeholders. It will probably go to the taxpayer so it is not a solution.\n\n\"Special administration is absolutely not inevitable. There is an alternative,\" he said.\n\nTime is not on his or the Government's side, however.", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [],

For years, Ofwat sat back and did little as the sector accumulated gargantuan debts, with the effect of turbo-boosting returns to absentee shareholders, neglecting desperately needed investment and service in the process - and polluting our waterways with abandon to boot.\n\nWith Thames Water now on the brink of collapse and public anger mounting at the situation, Ofwat appears to have woken up to the national scandal taking place before its eyes by rejecting water companies' demands for steep bill increases in an interim verdict on suppliers' five-year business plans.\n\nThat is to be applauded. If Ofwat were to emerge from these negotiations with any credibility it had to get tough, particularly given the eye-watering increases some suppliers have asked for.\n\nSouthern Water - one of the more financially stretched companies - topped the league of shame with a proposed rise of more than 90pc once inflation is taken into account between 2025 and 2030. That's equivalent to bill increases of nearly \u00a3306. Industry pariah Thames wants to ramp up bills by 56pc to nearly \u00a3627 per year.\n\nThursday's ruling will come as a severe shock to some, then, after the watchdog ruled that bills will rise by \u00a319 a year or 21pc on average by the end of the decade - a third less than the combined increases that the 16 companies had submitted.\n\nPredictably, it didn't take long for the howls of protest from suppliers to be heard. Industry lobbyist Water UK warned that Ofwat had swung too far the other way and risks killing off investment by watering down returns too heavily. Bemoaning \"the biggest ever cut in investment\", lobbyist Water UK claimed: \"If it doesn't put this right, Ofwat will be repeating the mistakes of the past.\"\n\nNonsense. It's the sort of tin-eared response that merely underlines the extent to which the industry still doesn't get it, despite the uproar at its woeful track record and the dramatic consequence of years of debt-fuelled ownership.\n\nThis is a wake-up call. Suppliers are finally paying the price for their incompetence and greed. Investors have had more than a decade of being allowed to financially engineer these businesses during which the media, campaigners, and politicians warned that the consequences would be extremely bad - but they didn't listen.\n\nIt couldn't go on forever. A system that privatises the profits during the go-go years cannot socialise the losses when the music stops. What shareholders are effectively asking the rest of us to accept is for them to have unlimited upside and for all the risk to sit with bill-payers so that they can walk away when it all goes wrong and the public is left to pick up the pieces. If Ofwat hadn't got tough then there was a real risk of it creating moral hazard.\n\nIn making an example of Thames, the chances of that happening are further reduced. As a direct result of its reckless mismanagement, Britain's biggest water supplier is being placed into special measures. The action means it will face far more intrusive oversight under which it must demonstrate that its parlous finances stack up. It is the first time that Ofwat has used such powers since its formation nearly 40 years ago.\n\nCritics will say Ofwat should have gone further. Indeed, reports of a planned government crackdown are proof that it could have imposed tougher conditions. Environment Secretary Steve Reed has drafted measures including banning bonuses for executives of heavily polluting water companies, imposing criminal charges on the worst lawbreakers and introducing tougher monitoring of sewage overflows.\n\nThe watchdog has instead sought to strike a sensible balance. It's a bloody nose for the more greedy suppliers, yet it acknowledges that our leaky Victorian infrastructure desperately requires investment at the same time as allowing for shareholders to still make a decent return, whatever its proponents may say.\n\nBut there should be no doubt about the underlying message here. An era in which financial rewards for investors and industry executives were completely disproportionate to the service provided looks to be over, and that can only be a blessing for millions of short-changed households everywhere.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofwat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ofwat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Water", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thames Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_UK", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Water UK"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lobbying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Thames", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "River Thames"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlow,_Buckinghamshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marlow, Buckinghamshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Marlow, Buckinghamshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Water", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southern Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Water industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Reed_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Reed (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Environment,_Food_and_Rural_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sewage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Engineer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_era", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Victorian era"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Sanitary_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Sanitary Engineering", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Water_Parks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Water Parks", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/GcmceWQ9bOxkLDkIdK4fDA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_the_telegraph_624/f6d63dcd113cc878f4776e2c8b0bf5f0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717113", "eventUri": "eng-9717113", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

The 21 per cent increase, or \u00a319 a year on average, is intended to fund investment at water companies for improvements.\n\nThis is for things such as fixing leaking pipes and tackling the discharge of sewage into rivers and seas.

They will also have more flexibility around enhanced voting rights.\n\n\"We have been concerned that the plan to remove shareholder votes on significant and related-party transactions would dilute investors' rights,\" said Lee. \"We will watch closely as these new rules embed.\"\n\nOn the bright side, Lee noted that retail access to primary and secondary listings will be enhanced under the new rules.\n\n\"The demand from retail investors to buy into the equities market is there, and regulatory change should support this demand.\n\n\"Boosting retail investment on the stock exchange will have wider market benefits, providing depth and liquidity, as well as boosting interest in investment with the wider public, unlocking further capital for UK-listed companies.\"", "source": {"uri":

That will kick off six months of negotiations with Ofwat, before the regulator's final decision in December.\n\nSouth East Water has put forward plans that would see spending rise to \u00a31.9bn to maintain and update its infrastructure. Those plans would also involve increasing customer bills by 22%.\n\nThe search for funding comes after South East Water's owners provided a \u00a3150m loan to a unit in the utility group earlier this year.\n\nSouth East Water's pre-tax loss narrowed to \u00a336m for the year to 31 March, down from \u00a374m the year before. Turnover rose 9% to \u00a3281m.\n\nIt is also still under investigation by Ofwat for an incident in June 2023 when the company failed to deliver water to thousands of customers for more than a week. The consequences could include a hefty fine from the regulator.\n\nSouth East Water said: \"Since the investigation was launched, we have entered into a constructive and transparent dialogue with Ofwat.\n\n\"Our colleagues, contractors, partners and stakeholders have all played a vital role in ensuring we kept the taps flowing for as many customers as possible, even during the extreme weather which impacted on our operations and overall performance in 2023/24.\n\n\"Despite all our efforts, there were still some issues during the year and we'd like to apologise to customers who experienced any supply interruptions.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_East_Water", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South East Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Market liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofwat", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ofwat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sussex", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sussex"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pension"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kent"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kent"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NatWest", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NatWest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Water", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thames Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Water industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stakeholder (corporate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Cash_Flow", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Cash Flow", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b016fc305888ee72ac81723758b9b04b190e7433/0_289_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=4743849ea149290f9c01da88c3ed42b9", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717113", "eventUri": "eng-9717113", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-03-31", "textStart": 2007, "textEnd": 2015}], "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

They will also have more flexibility around enhanced voting rights.\n\n\"We have been concerned that the plan to remove shareholder votes on significant and related-party transactions would dilute investors' rights,\" said Lee. \"We will watch closely as these new rules embed.\"\n\nOn the bright side, Lee noted that retail access to primary and secondary listings will be enhanced under the new rules.\n\n\"The demand from retail investors to buy into the equities market is there, and regulatory change should support this demand.\n\n\"Boosting retail investment on the stock exchange will have wider market benefits, providing depth and liquidity, as well as boosting interest in investment with the wider public, unlocking further capital for UK-listed companies.\"\n\n10.01am: FCA overhauls UK listing standards\n\nThe Financial Conduct Authority has unveiled the biggest overhaul of UK listing requirements in decades, aimed at rejuvenating London's flailing capital markets.\n\nThe primary goal of the overhaul is to make it easier and more attractive for companies to list their shares in the UK, with the biggest change being the scrapping of Britain's two-tier listing structure.\n\nHistorically, Listings have been divided into primary and secondary segments, with the latter having stricter reporting standards.\n\nA single category called 'commercial companies' will replace this structure when the rules into into effect at the end of this month.\n\nKey changes include removing the need for shareholder votes on significant or related party transactions and allowing flexibility around enhanced voting rights.\n\nA more detailed breakdown of the changes is available here.\n\n9.30am: Water companies buoy market after Ofwat review\n\nMore on the water sector where share price reactions suggest a bullet had been dodged especially by SouthWest Water owner Pennon.\n\nIts share price is up by a thumping 6.3% to 658p.with Severn Trent up 2.7% at 2,687p, and United Utilities 2.3% higher at 1,090p\n\nIndeed, Severn Trent and United Utilities are Footsie's biggest gainers after Ofwat's latest decision on price rises between 2025 and 2030.\n\nMidlands-focused Severn Tent had asked for a \u00a3144 rise over the five years, but got \u00a393 (23%). United Utilities gets a \u00a394 rise (21%) while Pennon's South West Water arm gets a \u00a364 (13%) rise. All exclude inflation.\n\nOfwat said in total, an average bill will rise by \u00a319 a year and pay for \u00a388 billion of spending by the sector of which \u00a335 billion will be directed towards fewer sewage spills and better water quality, including \u00a310 billion for storm overflows.\n\nFootsie up 18 at 8,211.\n\n8.55am: The morning so far\n\nThe FTSE 100 shifted to and fro when trading commenced this Thursday, but it ultimately looks to be heading in the right direction.\n\nAs of 8.55am, the blue-chip index was trading 15 points higher at 8,208, supported by a raft of bullish economic announcements.\n\nGDP figures show that the economy grew by 1.4% year on year in May, outstripping the expected growth rate of 1.2% and doubling April's 0.7% gain.\n\nMonth on month, gross domestic product grew by 0.4%, an upside surprise following a zero-growth period in April, though the data still shows \"significant room for improvement under the incoming Labour government\", according to Rob Morgan, chief investment analyst at Charles Stanley (LSE:CAY).\n\nConstruction output, meanwhile, advanced by 0.8% year-on-year in May, marking a strong rebound from a 2.1% drop in the prior month and exceeding market expectations of a 1.9% decline.\n\nWater firms Severn Trent PLC (LSE:SVT) and United Utilities Group PLC (LSE:UU.) were the two biggest FTSE 100 risers of the morning.\n\nThis follows regulator Ofwat's latest draft determination, which sets the pricing and investment agenda for British water firms.\n\nOn average, water bills are set to rise 21% by 2030, Ofwat declared.\n\nThough this is less than what the water firms wanted, Severn Trent is higher following a decent first-quarter financial update.\n\nElsewhere in company news, Dr Martens has published a bare trading update prior to its AGM meeting this morning.\n\nThe classic British footwear company said that \"trading since the start of this financial year has been in line with expectations and our guidance for (financial 2025) remains unchanged\".\n\n8.43am: Construction output grows\n\nConstruction output in the UK advanced by 0.8% year-on-year in May 2024, according to the Office for National Statistics.\n\nThis marks a significant rebound from a 2.1% drop in the prior month and exceeded market expectations of a 1.9% decline.\n\nIt was the first expansion in construction output since January.\n\nThe increase was driven by a 7.7% rise in repair and maintenance activity, up from 6.4% in April, while new work saw a smaller decline of 4% compared to 9.4% previously.\n\n8.30am: Dr Martens targets growth in US direct-to-customer market\n\nDr Martens has published a bare trading update prior to its AGM meeting this morning.\n\nThe classic British footwear company said that \"trading since the start of this financial year has been in line with expectations and our guidance for (financial 2025) remains unchanged\".\n\nThe first quarter is typically \"the smallest period of our financial year, representing the end of the Spring/Summer season\", said the group, adding that the current financial year will be weighted to the second half.\n\n\"The upcoming Autumn/Winter 24 season remains a key focus,\" said Dr Martens, with detailed trading plans currently being implemented.\n\nDr Martens is targeting target positive direct-to-customer growth in the US in the second half of the current financial year.\n\n\"Work on our cost action plan is ongoing and we will provide a detailed update at our first half results in November.\"\n\nShares were up 1.6% in opening exchanges.\n\n8.25am: Blue chips wobble\n\nMarkets dipped their toes into the red in opening trades despite pre-market data pointing to a strong start.\n\nThe FTSE 100 is currently a handful of points lower at 8,191, with Rolls-Royce Group plc, BAE Systems PLC (LSE:BA.) and Antofagasta plc among the worst performers.\n\n8.10am: Labour has inherited improving economy, GDP data shows\n\nBritain's economy grew by 1.4% year on year in May, outstripping the expected growth rate of 1.2% and doubling April's 0.7% gain.\n\nMonth on month, gross domestic product grew by 0.4%, an upside surprise following a zero-growth period in April.\n\n\"This should be a boon for the new Labour government with growth now likely to outstrip the OBR's 2024 GDP forecasts, partially offsetting some of the projected increase in interest rate costs,\" said Deutsche Bank's chief UK economist Sanjay Raja.\n\nAccording to Rob Morgan, chief investment analyst at Charles Stanley (LSE:CAY): \"The UK's economic scorecard shows significant room for improvement under the incoming Labour government.\n\n\"The UK economy has been subdued coming out of the pandemic, an energy crisis, and a cost-of-living crisis which has been very difficult for UK consumers.\n\n\"However, tepid growth now looks to be warming up heading into the second half of the year.\"\n\nMorgan said today's GDP data \"illustrates we are in the midst of a very gentle upswing in activity following a slowdown in 2023\"\n\n7.59am: Thames Water bills to rise by \u00a399, barely half of what it sought\n\nOfwat will allow Thames Water to raise its annual bills by \u00a399 over the next five years, falling significantly below what the London and south east England water supplier wanted.\n\nOfwat made the announcement in its latest draft determination, which sets investment and pricing targets for Britain's water suppliers.\n\nThames Water was seeking a \u00a3191 bill rise to support investment in creaking infrastructure.\n\nDespite slashing Thames Water's pricing wishes, Ofwat has outlined some strict expectations of the water supplier.\n\nOfwats expects Thames Water to deliver a 19% reduction in leakage, and 18% reduction in phosphorus and a full 50% reduction in pollution incidents from average 2020-23 levels.\n\nOver 2025-30, Thames Water should deliver a 66% reduction in water supply interruptions and a 55% reduction in internal sewer flooding events from 2020-23 levels.\n\nThames Water is expected to deliver \u00a316.9 billion worth in total infrastructure improvements.\n\n7.35am: Annual water bills to rise 21% by 2030\n\nWater bills are expected to rise by \u00a319 per year to fund investment into Britain's ageing infrastructure, Ofwat has declared.\n\nIt means the average household water bill across the UK will increase from \u00a3441 to \u00a3535 by 2030, an increase of 21%.\n\nThis is below the average asked of Ofwat by Thames Water, United Utilities and other major water firms.\n\nOfwat laid out the plans in the regulator's draft determination, which sets the agenda for all UK water firms over the next five years.\n\nIt has proposed total investment spending to increase to \u00a388 billion between 2025 and 2030, a 50% increase from the previous draft determination.\n\nOfwat expects water companies to triple investment in new infrastructure and resources \"to improve the environment, resilience and service\".\n\n\"We expect increased investment to be reflected in better performance,\" said Ofwat.\n\n\"We set each company targets for up to 23 areas of performance which are important to customers.\n\n\"If companies do not meet their targets each year, they will face automatic penalties, reflected in reduced bills. But there are incentives to beat the targets, and good performance will be rewarded.\"\n\nSouth West Water owner Pennon and United Utilities said they will review Ofwat's draft determination and will respond by 28 August.\n\n7.10am: Markets to bounce higher\n\nThe FTSE 100 looks set to move high when trading commences today following a bullish session on Wednesday, when the blue-chip index finished 53 points higher at 8,193.\n\nMarkets were buoyed by a strong performance from airline and utilities stocks, as well an afternoon rally from Ladbrokes-owner Entain PLC (LSE:ENT) in the run up to England's victory over Netherlands in the Euro semi-finals.\n\nBetter-than-expected GDP figures released this morning should offer some support.\n\nThe economy expanded 1.4% year on year in May, beating expectations of a 1.2% expansion. Month on month, the economy rose 0.4% after not moving a blip in April.\n\nOn the company news front, recruiter Hays PLC (LSE:HAS) reports its full-year earnings amid a lukewarm time for City recruiters.\n\nWater firms are on tenterhooks as Ofwat prepares to rule on their five-year investment and pricing plans in the latest draft determination.", "source": {"uri":

During the hot summer of 1995, the managing director of Yorkshire Water, Trevor Newton, achieved notoriety when he urged customers to use less of his company's product by issuing a motivational message: \"I personally have not had a bath or shower for three months.\"\n\nAfter a round of jokes about \"the filthy rich\" - because megabucks pay for water company bosses was also in the headlines in those days - Newton invited the press to watch him washing with a flannel and bowl. It later emerged he had been popping out of Yorkshire for a soak at his parents' and in-laws' homes.\n\nRelated: Rise in sewage pollution from Thames Water's ageing treatment works\n\nThe serious aspect of the farce was that, just as now, the public was outraged by the mismatch between rewards for investors and the standard of service being provided by a privatised utility. Yorkshire had just paid a \u00a350m dividend to shareholders and yet the city of Bradford was at risk of running dry. A new grid was behind schedule and the company was reduced to transporting water by tanker through the Dales. \"Public anger exploded,\" recalled Sir Ian Byatt, the first head of the Office of Water Services, or Ofwat, the regulatory body created at privatisation in 1989, in his account of his career.\n\nThe saga also underlined the rotten state of the water infrastructure, the reason given for privatisation in the first place. The UK was regarded as the \"dirty man of Europe\" on account of pollution on beaches and in rivers. Spending by the industry on overhauling its pipes and sewage-treatment works had been falling from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s and now the UK had to meet new European Community standards on pollution.\n\nMargaret Thatcher's administration, which had already privatised British Telecom and British Gas, decided only private capital and stock market ownership could deliver improvements. \"Much emotive nonsense was talked along the lines of, 'Look, she's even privatising the rain that falls from the heavens',\" wrote Thatcher in her memoirs. \"I used to retort that the rain may come from the Almighty but he did not send the pipes, plumbing and engineering to go with it.\"\n\nMore than three decades later, that same infrastructure requires a big upgrade, with bills to soar when Ofwat outlines the regime for the next five years on Thursday. In the meantime, the 10 English and Welsh water and wastewater companies have paid \u00a378bn in dividends since 1989, and accumulated \u00a360bn in debt. Meanwhile, the biggest of the lot, Thames Water, is at risk of temporary renationalisation. Only three of the 10 are still listed on the stock market. Meanwhile, the industry has become synonymous with mismanagement, corporate greed and pollution, as a string of sewage spills, water leaks and hefty fines led to deep public anger. How did we get here?\n\nRelated: Thames Water to tap investors for funds as it will run out of cash by next June\n\nSold on the cheap\n\nTo make privatisation happen in December 1989 - a month after the fall of the Berlin Wall - the government cancelled all the long-term debt owed by the previous water authorities and injected cash into the new companies as a \"green dowry\". Such exercises meant the net proceeds to the Treasury, even after selling the companies for a total of \u00a37.6bn, was roughly zero.\n\nThere was, though, the usual quick win for investors in the stock market listings: shares in the 10 companies rose 20% on average within a month. Half the small investors, encouraged to buy with the slogan \"You could be an H2Owner\", took their profits and sold their shares within a year. It was a period of corporate exuberance, lampooned by Harry Enfield's \"Loadsamoney\" character.\n\nBut extra spending did arrive. Investment roughly doubled in the four years after the sellout, from \u00a33bn a year to \u00a36bn. Privatisation fans could also argue that the discipline of a stock market listing, plus a smack from an independent regulator, could force underperformers to improve. After Yorkshire's shambles in 1995, Ofwat sent in investigators, which led to a management clear-out. By the end of decade, the company was top of the class for performance. Byatt also proposed that Yorkshire should return \u00a340m to customers in the form of price cuts and \"after some discussion, it concurred\".\n\nRelated: How Tory neglect flooded Britain's rivers with sewage\n\nBut it was immediately obvious that the companies had been sold far too cheaply. Customers' bills went up by a third in the first five years on the assumption at sale that the companies would need ready access to cash to fund the step-up in investment. Debt levels, it was thought originally, would comprise a maximum of only 35% of the value of the assets - the leverage, or gearing, ratio. The bond market, however, was willing to lend far greater sums to monopoly businesses with captive customers.\n\nAnd, strange as it may now sound, the regulator was keen to see financial gearing rise. The rationale was that savings from lower funding costs would be passed to customers in the form of lower bills. Ofwat's first five-yearly price review in 1994 slowed the bill rises imagined at privatisation; the second, in 1999, cut bills by an average of 12%.\n\nThe companies were happy to play the debt game. Some, flush with rising share prices and access to cheap capital, caught the diversification bug in the go-go 1990s. Thames won contracts to run water networks as far away as Indonesia and Chile. Welsh Water lost a packet by buying hotels and country clubs. In 2000, Anglian Water bought a construction company.\n\nTakeover games\n\nThen there were the takeover games, which began when the government cancelled its golden shares in the 10 companies in 1995. Northumbrian Water was bought by Lyonnaise des Eaux of France. Scottish Power bought Southern Water. Enron of the US - before it crashed in scandalous style in 2001 - bought Wessex Water. Water companies were not allowed to buy one another, but some adopted the fashionable notion of \"multi utilities\" and bought regional electricity suppliers, which were privatised in 1990. North West Water bought its local supplier to become United Utilities and Welsh Water took over South Wales Electricity, restyling itself as Hyder.\n\nNone of this activity was slowed by a windfall tax on the privatised utilities, water included, imposed by the incoming Labour government in 1997. Thames, for example, was sold for \u00a3922m at privatisation but was valued by the stock market at \u00a32.9bn in July 1997; Severn Trent had risen from \u00a3849m to \u00a33bn.\n\nBy the end of that first decade, the privatised water sector was changed beyond recognition. This newspaper reflected in 1999 on \"the mixed effects of water privatisation\". On one hand, too much of the extra profits had been \"dissipated in ill-advised diversifications, excess dividends and unearned mega-increases in boardroom pay\". On the other, \"a lot of money was invested in improving the infrastructure, so that we now have much improved drinking water\".\n\nThe deal-making kept coming. Thames was bought in 2000 by the German utility RWE, which paid \u00a34.3bn in cash and assumed \u00a32.5bn of debt. The takeover price of \u00a312.15 a share represented a fivefold increase from the 240p at which all 10 water companies were sold in 1989. Foreign capital continued to chase UK utilities and, in the spirit of times, that was seen as an excellent thing. New Labour was not going to mess with the model.\n\nPanic stations\n\nWhat followed was a critical turning point. In the early 2000s, Railtrack, after a series of horrendous fatal accidents on the railways, was forced into receivership and turned into Network Rail. Then British Energy, owner of the bulk of the country's nuclear plants, had to be bailed out.\n\nBoth events caused political panic, with the City doing its best to stoke fears that foreign capital would evaporate if owners were seen to be short-changed by government action (the unmerited allegation at Railtrack). In the wings, the water sector was still complaining bitterly that the supposed toughness of Ofwat's 1999 price review left it with insufficient incentives to invest.\n\nThe result was two actions that, with hindsight, accelerated financial risk-taking. First, in 2002, Ofwat extended the water companies' operating licences, which were due to expire in 2014. In their place, 25-year rolling licences were granted. \"The longer notice period will enable companies and their investors to plan ahead more securely,\" said Philip Fletcher, the late head of Ofwat. That was the hope, but the reform also insulated underperformers from any medium-term threat of being replaced.\n\nThen, in 2004, the next five-yearly price review was widely seen as a giveaway to the companies: bills were increased by 20%. Water was seen as even more attractive for investors.\n\nAt that point, takeover action went into overdrive. New buyers were not other utilities, but financial buyers - investment banks, infrastructure funds, pension funds. Macquarie's fateful \u00a38bn acquisition of Thames from RWE happened in 2006. So did the takeover of the parent of Anglian by a group of Canadian and Australian pension funds. In 2007, Southern Water fell to a consortium including JP Morgan Asset Management after a tussle with US investment bank Goldman Sachs. Kelda Group, the owner of Yorkshire Water, was bought by a consortium including Citigroup and HSBC.\n\nFormer regulators have pinpointed this period as one in which the game changed. Byatt wrote in his book A Regulator's Sign Off: Changing the Taps in Britain: \"Private equity infrastructure capital showed the hard face of capitalism, involving leveraged buyouts and short-term policies, namely high borrowing and high dividends, meriting widespread criticism for its lack of transparency and for its financial engineering.\"\n\nJonson Cox, who had spells running Yorkshire and Anglian before he was chair of Ofwat from 2012 until 2022, told a House of Lords committee soon after leaving the regulator: \"In the 2000s, investment banks began to realise that there was an opportunity to acquire the water company assets and to put significantly more leverage on to those capital structures. I was not at Ofwat at that time. I have disagreed with that approach and I think it is very unfortunate that it happened.\"\n\nInvestment banks created skewed incentives, he argued, and created \"the predisposition of thinking of water companies as financial assets\".\n\nRelated: Ruling paves way for businesses and public to sue water firms over sewage\n\nFinancial engineering on steroids\n\nShortly after Macquarie bought it, Thames embarked on a \"whole business securitisation\" in 2007 - a fundraising whose banal name belied its aggressive approach. A previously staid business of pipes and sewage treatment works was packaged into a complex corporate structure, with eight layers of ownership - including a subsidiary in the Cayman Islands, which allowed debt to be layered on debt, like the tiers in a wedding cake.\n\nSuddenly, leverage ratios of 50% or 60% went higher than 80% at some companies taken off the stock market. As Thames explained in 2018, this byzantine corporate structure let it borrow more, with the approval of the ratings agencies: \"A higher level of leverage is possible at an investment grade credit rating.\"\n\nMacquarie has defended its use of a whole business securitisation at Thames, saying it was \"very common\" at the time. \"It was a UK water utility product that was invented, advised and constructed by UK banks,\" Martin Bradley, the company's head of infrastructure, told Infrastructure Investor magazine last year.\n\nFor investors in Macquarie funds that cashed in via a staggered sale of Thames in 2017, he pointed to annual gross returns of 12%-13%, which he argued were in line with regulatory guidance in the 2005-09 period. \"There's nothing in our returns that I'm embarrassed about,\" Bradley argued.\n\nThe Australian bank has also defended its broader stewardship of Thames, saying the company \"undertook a record level of investment despite the returns allowed by Ofwat being reduced\".\n\nThe legacy of the sector's debt binge in the mid-2000s era lives on, however. Southern Water, which adopted a whole business securitisation in 2003, had to be rescued in 2021 in what now looks like a miniature version of the financial crisis now engulfing Thames. Controversially, the buyer at Southern was Macquarie, which injected \u00a31bn in new equity to recapitalise the business.\n\nIt was only belatedly that Ofwat woke up to the dangers of overborrowing. Powers to stop the payment of dividends if they would risk the company's financial resilience were introduced only last year.\n\nOne core question about the post-privatisation era is whether the gravitational shift from sensibly capitalised public companies on the stock market to heavily leveraged private entities contributed to the sector's woeful environmental record.\n\nIs it, for example, a coincidence that the two most heavily fined companies over the years - Thames and Southern - were also the two with the most aggressive financing structures?\n\nDebt, it should be said, has also been used for its original purpose of accelerating investment, complementing the portion funded from bills. Overall, post-privatisation investment has totalled \u00a3190bn. But the overuse of financial leverage, with the aim of maximising returns for shareholders, is undeniable.\n\nCurrent Ofwat chief executive, David Black, addressed the point last year when Thames' financial crisis became acute: \"For most companies, debt has been a prudent low-cost source of finance with low interest rates fixed for the long-term,\" he said. \"However, some companies borrowed too much, most obviously Thames Water. The risk for this - and for correcting this - belongs to the company and its shareholders.\"\n\nTherein lies one huge tension at the heart of the recent ruling from Ofwat on the companies' business plans for the next five years. Investment is needed on a massive scale and customers' bills are going up substantially, whatever happens. But will the regulator really make the worst debt addicts pay for their borrowing binges?", "source": {"uri": "uk.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Its precaruous situation is a concern to the new government.\n\nThames Water's draft business plan for the eighth asset management period (AMP8), between 2025 and 2030, promises \u00a319.8bn investment, including \u00a34.5bn on enhancements. If this gets sign off from regulator Ofwat next week it will be engaging with potential investors and creditors to seek new equity and extend its liquidity runway.\n\nThe annual report states that poor asset health a \"key root cause\" of Thames Water's performance challenges.\n\n\"The declining health of our ageing infrastructure has taken place over decades as we have stretched the life of our assets,\" it further states. \"This has helped to keep bills down for customers but it has also meant we have been repairing assets rather than replacing them and this is only sustainable for a limited period. Poor asset health today impacts our financial position through performance penalties, which subsequently results in less money to invest in improvement.\"\n\nBeyond the \u00a33.5bn needed to hold asset deterioration stable across its \u00a3147bn asset base, Thames Water says that reversing the decline will take a programme that runs across multiple AMP cycles - suggesting a minimum of 10 years. It says that it is \"making progress towards that ambition\".\n\nRisk in delivery renewal programme\n\nDesign and delivery of capital projects is listed as one of Thames Water's principal risks and uncertainties as it is responsible for the sector's largest capital infrastructure renewal programme. The risk to this has been identified as coming from its ability to resource and access specialist contractors and its ability to effectively control \"such a large and complex delivery portfolio\".\n\nIt says that this risk is increasing and it has experienced delivery challenges in AMP7 (2020-2025) \"due to the change of delivery model and impact of Covid-19\".

It is instead focused on holding water companies to account and improving systems, rather than allowing them to reward themselves.\n\nHowever, the Guardian reports that it has seen emergency plans that have been written up to turn Thames Water into a publicly-owned arm's length body under the state's special administration regime, if required.\n\nThe good news\n\nThames Water's annual report did provide some positive outlook in both financial and operational performance.\n\nThe overview of financial performance shows:\n\nOperational performance\n\n\"The challenges we face are well documented, but our operational and financial performance for the last year show good progress, and these positive results provide the right foundations on which to build and improve,\" Thames Water CEO Chris Weston said. \"\"We've delivered year-on-year improvements in our key water metrics, with leakage at its lowest ever level, and we're supporting more customers through our social tariffs.\n\n\"Revenue, EBITDA and operating cash flow all grew strongly, supporting a record \u00a32bn of investment in our infrastructure that will ultimately improve asset resilience, environmental performance, and customer service. Our teams should be immensely proud of what they've delivered during a difficult year and for maintaining focus on what matters most to our customers.\"\n\nReaction\n\nInstitution of Civil Engineers interim associate director of policy David Hawkes said: \"The challenges faced by the water sector are complex. None will have a one-size-fits-all solution.\n\n\"However, regardless of whether companies are in public or private ownership, the new government's priorities should be those that the ICE has been advising for some time. The regulatory system must be reformed to align with new priorities like net zero and there needs to be a longer-term approach to investment, maintenance, and planning - the current five-year cycle is too short.\n\n\"The role of nature-based solutions in delivering a better water infrastructure system should be considered, and finally, rebuilding trust between the public, water companies, and regulators must be a priority. The ICE will launch a consultation to dive deeper into these issues later this year.\"", "source": {"uri": "newcivilengineer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Civil Engineer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rob_hakimian@newcivilengineer.com", "name": "Rob Hakimian", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Water", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thames Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Market liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofwat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ofwat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asset management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_plan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business plan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitehall", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Whitehall"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outsourcing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Outsourcing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portfolio_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Portfolio (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3M", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "3M"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hawkes_(sinologist)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Hawkes (sinologist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "East London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution_of_Civil_Engineers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Institution of Civil Engineers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_neutrality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carbon neutrality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thames Valley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quango", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quango"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Water industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_treatment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Water treatment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nationalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Customer service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_water", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drinking water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Sanitary_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Sanitary Engineering", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Investment_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Investment Services", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://emap-romulus-prod.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/copper-mills-water-treatment-works-london-thames-water-560x315.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717113", "eventUri": "eng-9717113", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nAverage household water bills in Greater Manchester and the north west are set to rise by \u00a394 over a five year period, it was revealed today. It includes an average rise of \u00a327 between 2024-25 and 2025-26, the Water Services Regulation Authority, Ofwat, said.\n\nThe regulator, meanwhile, said it expects United Utilities to 'deliver a significantly improved level of service for customers and the environment' - and outlined a series of key demands.\n\nOfwat said it has set UU 'a much broader range of commitments to protect and improve the environment'. The company, which provides water and wastewater services across the north, has been told to do more to tackle storm overflow spills, leaks and external sewer flooding - and to reduce pollution incidents by 30 per cent. It must also deliver a 31 per cent reduction in the amount of phosphorus entering rivers, Ofwat said.\n\nSewage spills into England's rivers and seas more than doubled in 2023.\n\nREAD MORE: M62 LIVE traffic updates as motorway fully SHUT after serious crash\n\nOfwat revealed UU wanted to charge its customers more for their water over the period. The average household bill for 2024-5 for customers is \u00a3442. UU's proposed plan would see that figure increase to \u00a3556 in 2029-30, but Ofwat's draft determination, published today, is costed \u00a320 cheaper, at \u00a3536.\n\nThe proposals are part of the 2024 Price Review and cover the period from 1 April 2025 to 31 March 2030, ahead of a final decision at the end of the year. Ofwat said the average 21 per cent bill increase nationally, around \u00a319 per year, follows firms' proposals to increase their total spending by \u00a329 billion, split between a \u00a35 billion increase in the core costs for running their business and a \u00a324 billion rise in spending to meet requirements set by governments and for other environmental improvements.\n\nThe regulator said its scrutiny of companies' cost proposals, to ensure they deliver efficiently, had led to a \u00a316 billion reduction.\n\nIt said its draft decision 'allows United Utilities to collect \u00a312 billion through bills from both households and businesses over the 2025-30 period'. \"This will recover a share of the cost of historical expenditure, as well as a portion of the \u00a312 billion expenditure planned for 2025-30,\" said Ofwat\n\n\"Overall, this will increase average household bills by \u00a394 from 2024-25 to 2029-30 for United Utilities customers, before inflation. This includes an average rise of \u00a327 between 2024-25 and 2025-26. Because of our challenge on United Utilities' costs and the speed that revenue is recovered from customers, average bills will be lower than those originally proposed by United Utilities.\"\n\nOfwat said that over the period it 'expects' UU to reduce storm overflow spills by more than half and reduce leaks by 13 per cent\n\n\"The company is expected to use \u00a3213 million to supply smart meters to 900,00 household and business customers,\" added the draft decision.\n\n\"Over 2025-30, United Utilities will be expected to reduce the duration of interruptions to customers water supply by 71 per cent, as well as a 26 per cent reduction in external sewer flooding. The company is allowed an additional \u00a3189 million to continue its programme to improve the taste, smell and appearance of its water.\n\n\"Overall, to deliver its performance commitments and legal obligations, our draft decision provides United Utilities with a total expenditure allowance of \u00a312 billion over the 2025-30 period. This is \u00a34.5 billion more than the company was provided with in the current price review period (2020-25).\n\n\"We consider that United Utilities can deliver its performance commitments and obligations for less cost than it requested, and our proposed allowances are 17 per cent lower than the company's plan.\"\n\nUnited Utilities published its business plan for 2025-30 in October 2023. Ofwat said it has 'scrutinised' the company's proposed costs 'so that customers do not pay more than is necessary for the service they receive and are not charged twice for work which should have already been delivered'.\n\nIt said it has also ensured 'the returns that investors earn reflect the performance delivered for customers and the environment'.\n\n\"Our draft decision means that United Utilities will be in a position to deliver the investment that is required. We have incentivised it to go beyond its performance targets to achieve even better outcomes for customers and the environment. We will hold the company to account to deliver real improvements for customers and the environment,\" it said.\n\nUU's current performance was described as 'average' compared to other companies. In 2022-23, it was said to have been a 'top performer' in reducing pollution incidents. But Ofwat said it 'performed worse' than a target set for 'performance in areas such as water supply interruptions and drinking water quality'.\n\n\"We view its business plan as displaying reasonable levels of ambition for its performance in 2025-30. Under our draft decision, we require United Utilities to deliver a significantly improved level of service for customers, and the environment,\" it went on.\n\nOfwat chief executive David Black said: \"Customers want to see radical change in the way water companies care for the environment. Our draft decisions on company plans approve a tripling of investment to make sustained improvement to customer service and the environment at a fair price for customers.\n\n\"These proposals aim to deliver a 44% reduction in spills from storm overflows compared to levels in 2021. We expect all companies to embrace innovation and go further and faster to reduce spills wherever possible. Today's announcement also increases the resilience of our water supplies to the impact of climate change and will reduce how much water is taken from rivers by enabling a range of long-term water supply projects, which includes plans for nine reservoirs.\"\n\nWater firms can challenge Ofwat's proposals and a final decision is expected later this year.", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_britton@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Paul Britton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofwat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ofwat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Utilities", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Utilities"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M62_motorway", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "M62 motorway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wastewater", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wastewater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phosphorus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitary_sewer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sanitary sewer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greater Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Greater Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Water supply"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Effects of climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Water industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_quality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Water quality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reservoir"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 47}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29519653.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Davyhulme-wastewater-treatement-works.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717113", "eventUri": "eng-9717113", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

Repeated incidents of sewage discharge into rivers and seas have left Britain's waters increasingly dirty in recent years, putting pressure on the regulator Ofwat to take decisive action.\n\nOfwat will publish its initial decision on allowable charges for the 2025-2030 period, with Thames Water requesting a 44% increase, excluding inflation. Other providers have sought varying hikes, from Southern Water's 73% to Severn Trent's 36% and United Utilities' 25%.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Water industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Water", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thames Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofwat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ofwat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Utilities", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Utilities"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Severn", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "River Severn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Privatization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sewage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Hazardous_Materials", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Hazardous Materials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon_Cycle", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon Cycle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling/Water_Wells_and_Pumps", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling/Water Wells and Pumps", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/10_07_2024_14_04_34_6465179.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717113", "eventUri": "eng-9717113", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

Eligibility and the level of support varies by company.\n\nGet a water meter: Meters can reduce bills for some. Every household can apply to have one installed. If a meter is not suitable, the water company must offer something called an \"assessed charge\" which may also save you money.\n\nSewage service rebates: Households may be able to get a rebate for certain sewage services if they can prove they do not use them.\n\nUse less water: Many water companies offer customers free water-saving devices.

The firm's debt pile rose to \u00a315.2bn from \u00a313.9bn in March last year.\n\nChairman Sir Adrian Montague, who joined Thames Water in July last year, said he was focused on \"improving our financial resilience and learning to live within our means\".\n\n\"Notwithstanding this, in the short term, gearing [borrowing] is forecast to increase further to support our much-needed investment programme and following the decision by our shareholders not to provide a further \u00a3500m of equity funding in March 2024,\" he said.\n\nHowever, he noted that the refusal by its shareholders to support it had led to its credit quality being downgraded, which would contribute to restricting its ability to pay dividends in the future and incur new debt.\n\n\"Consequently, and as previously announced, we are planning to seek new equity funding from investors following the receipt of\n\nour PR24 draft determination from Ofwat on 11 July,\" Sir Adrian said.\n\n\"I continue to believe that a market-led solution that increases financial resilience is in the best interests of all stakeholders, but it is dependent on securing a final regulatory determination that is deliverable, financeable and investable, as well as affordable for our customers.\"\n\nEssentially, the outcome of regulator Ofwat's decision on Thursday about how much the company can charge its customers will be a key milestone in the company's near-term future.\n\nSir Adrian said Ofwat's determination was a \"critical enabler of our success\".\n\nThe comments from the firm came as it revealed its full-year results for the 12 months to the end of March.\n\nRevenue rose 10 per cent to \u00a32.4bn, while adjusted profits jumped by more than a fifth (21 per cent) to \u00a31.2bn.\n\nThe company has been under huge pressure over its sewage spills, something increasingly common in the industry.\n\nIt said that the Thames Tideway improvements, which include the Tideway Tunnel and Lee Tunnel, would \"secure a 95 per cent reduction in the annual duration of spills into the tidal Thames, making a huge difference to the health of the river in the capital\".\n\nFurthermore, the firm said it had reduced leakage by 7 per cent, to its lowest ever level to 570 megalitres per day (Ml/d) but missed its regulatory target, which is based on a three-year rolling average.\n\nElsewhere, the firm said it a record level of capital expenditure of \u00a32.1bn, up 18 per cent as it worked to \"increase investment in our ageing assets and improve network resilience\".\n\nPaul de Zylva, senior sustainability analyst at Friends of the Earth, criticised water companies' \"free licence to line their shareholders' pockets handsomely for decades\".\n\n\"It's staggering that the company is still counting on weak regulation to allow it to survive by pushing its problems onto its customers -

We found out today that the water company only has enough cash to last until next May - thanks to a debt pile of more than \u00a315bn. It has also confirmed it paid two fresh dividends worth \u00a3158.3m in March - and warned it is unlikely to raise fresh funds before December.\n\nIt is a fresh blow for the supplier, which has already faced widespread criticism for the levels of sewage leaking into waterways. Events including this year's Boat Race and Henley Royal Regatta faced warnings over levels of E coli in the water - and pollution incidents increased to 350, up on 331 last year.\n\nThe firm has said it is looking for fresh funding to maintain and update its infrastructure after investors pulled the plug on \u00a3500m of emergency cash earlier this year; which leaves Keir Starmer with a significant dilemma: whether or not to nationalise (but more on that later...).\n\nStill, there's no need to panic just yet. The company's financial travails - writ large in its latest results - are highly unlikely to end in the taps running dry. We aren't going to witness emergency standpipes in the street and queues outside Tesco for multipacks of Evian.\n\nThe real pain for the consumer is coming in the form of much higher bills. Thames Water has managed to declare an \"underlying\" profit of \u00a3140m for the year to 31 March, an improvement of \u00a3270m on the previous year, largely down to increasing what it charged customers. Those underlying profits exclude \u00a3152m worth of one-off costs incurred during the year.\n\nThat is by no means the end of it. The company thinks it has enough cash to keep going for just 11 months. Warnings about its future as a \"going concern\" are splashed all over the accounts, including from the company's auditors. The company also records the payment of \u00a3195.8m in dividends.\n\nGiven the dire situation - and the knock-on effects on its customers - the bonuses handed out to top bosses seem tasteless in the extreme.\n\nCEO Chris Weston, who was appointed on 8 January, received \u00a3437,000, including a bonus of \u00a3195,000, for fewer than three months work. Finance chief Alistair Cockburn was paid \u00a31.33m for a year's service, which included a spell as co-CEO. His package was fattened by a \u00a3446,000 annual bonus. Thames Water's pain is being shared widely - just not in the boardroom.\n\nBut there is more to leave a sour taste in the mouths of consumers in the weeds of Thames Water's annual report. I turned to the section marked \"customer performance\": only to discover that bad debt levels are twice the industry average and \"this has to improve\". That's right: it's all our fault.\n\nThat this river of bad news is still running is in part down to the fact that the government wants no part of nationalisation, even though polls suggest that it would be highly popular with the public. Rachel Reeves does not want Thames Water's debt on her books. Business secretary Jonathan Reynolds does not want to be on the hook for the inevitable increases in water bills in the capital. Environment secretary Steve Reed does not want to cop the flak the next time untreated sewage is pumped into an unsuspecting watercourse.\n\nThis gives Weston a certain amount of breathing room; but not much. In March, existing investors - including sovereign wealth funds in Abu Dhabi and China, along with pension funds in Canada and the UK - described the company as \"uninvestable\", pulling out of plans to serve up \u00a3500m of emergency funding and \u00a33.25bn over the next five years. Omers, a Canadian pension fund, has written down the value of its holding to zero.\n\nWeston is going to have to look elsewhere for cash. He's been talking up the prospects of doing that, claiming he's held discussions and received expressions of interest. However, he's having to wait on regulator Ofwat's verdict on the 59 per cent extra he wants customers to stump up for between 2025 and 2030. The watchdog may also have thoughts on those dividends and bonuses.\n\nOfwat bosses are going to find approving such a package a challenge, given that they are already facing questions on how Thames Water's infrastructure has been allowed to degrade to such an extent. This is something for one or more select committees to get their teeth into when their memberships have been selected. There will be blood.\n\nBut you don't really need a full-scale parliamentary inquiry to ascertain how we made it to this particular impasse. Regulators slept while the scales tipped far too far in favour of investors, financial engineers and the City.\n\nHow does this end? It's hard to see Weston securing the funds he needs on terms that will be acceptable to Ofwat. Investing in Thames Water in its current state represents a high risk. If I were sat on an investment firm's risk committee I'd have my red \"no, not under any circumstances\" stamp at the ready.\n\nI wouldn't be at all surprised to see some sort of recovery vehicle being set up, with the backing of the taxpayer, albeit at arm's length. In the interim, Reynolds might be wise to pick up the phone to Stephen Byers, a predecessor of his (albeit with a different title) who had a nasty post-privatisation migraine of his own to deal with in the form of Railtrack, which eventually became (the state-owned) Network Rail.\n\nNone of which changes the fact that billpayers are going to be spitting with rage and disbelief when their bills kick in the door.

At the same time, the watchdog demanded that United Utilities should provide a much-improved service for both customers and the environment, laying out a list of stringent requirements.\n\nUnited Utilities has been tasked with a wide array of environmental protections and enhancements, according to Ofwat's latest announcement. The firm, responsible for water and sewerage services in the region, is under orders to tackle frequent storm overflow spills, plug leaks and prevent external sewer flooding with an aim to slash pollution incidents by nearly a third.\n\nREAD MORE: DWP warning for Universal Credit claimants who plan holiday abroad\n\nAdditionally, a 31 per cent dip in phosphorus levels polluting rivers is mandated. Last year saw a disturbing jump in sewage dumps into England's rivers and oceans, more than doubling in number.\n\nOfwat said: \"We expect United Utilities to deliver significantly better outcomes for our natural environment over the next few years and to meet its legal obligations: we want lower pollution, healthier rivers and waterways, and the company to do its bit to combat the effects of climate change.\"\n\nOfwat revealed UU wanted to charge its customers more for their water over the period. The average household bill for 2024-5 for customers is \u00a3442. UU's proposed plan would see that figure increase to \u00a3556 in 2029-30, but Ofwat's draft determination, published today, is costed \u00a320 cheaper, at \u00a3536.\n\nThe proposals are part of the 2024 Price Review and cover the period from 1 April 2025 to 31 March 2030, ahead of a final decision at the end of the year. Ofwat said the average 21 per cent bill increase nationally, around \u00a319 per year, follows firms' proposals to increase their total spending by \u00a329 billion, split between a \u00a35 billion increase in the core costs for running their business and a \u00a324 billion rise in spending to meet requirements set by governments and for other environmental improvements.\n\nThe regulator said its scrutiny of companies' cost proposals, to ensure they deliver efficiently, had led to a \u00a316 billion reduction.\n\nIt said its draft decision 'allows United Utilities to collect \u00a312 billion through bills from both households and businesses over the 2025-30 period'. \"This will recover a share of the cost of historical expenditure, as well as a portion of the \u00a312 billion expenditure planned for 2025-30,\" said Ofwat\n\n\"Overall, this will increase average household bills by \u00a394 from 2024-25 to 2029-30 for United Utilities customers, before inflation. This includes an average rise of \u00a327 between 2024-25 and 2025-26. Because of our challenge on United Utilities' costs and the speed that revenue is recovered from customers, average bills will be lower than those originally proposed by United Utilities.\"\n\nOfwat said that over the period it 'expects' UU to reduce storm overflow spills by more than half and reduce leaks by 13 per cent\n\n\"The company is expected to use \u00a3213 million to supply smart meters to 900,00 household and business customers,\" added the draft decision.\n\n\"Over 2025-30, United Utilities will be expected to reduce the duration of interruptions to customers water supply by 71 per cent, as well as a 26 per cent reduction in external sewer flooding. The company is allowed an additional \u00a3189 million to continue its programme to improve the taste, smell and appearance of its water.\"\n\n\"Overall, to deliver its performance commitments and legal obligations, our draft decision provides United Utilities with a total expenditure allowance of \u00a312 billion over the 2025-30 period. This is \u00a34.5 billion more than the company was provided with in the current price review period (2020-25).\"\n\n\"We consider that United Utilities can deliver its performance commitments and obligations for less cost than it requested, and our proposed allowances are 17 per cent lower than the company's plan.\"\n\nUnited Utilities published its business plan for 2025-30 in October 2023. Ofwat said it has 'scrutinised' the company's proposed costs 'so that customers do not pay more than is necessary for the service they receive and are not charged twice for work which should have already been delivered'.\n\nIt said it has also ensured 'the returns that investors earn reflect the performance delivered for customers and the environment'.\n\n\"Our draft decision means that United Utilities will be in a position to deliver the investment that is required. We have incentivised it to go beyond its performance targets to achieve even better outcomes for customers and the environment. We will hold the company to account to deliver real improvements for customers and the environment,\" it said.\n\nUU's current performance was described as 'average' compared to other companies. In 2022-23, it was said to have been a 'top performer' in reducing pollution incidents. But Ofwat said it 'performed worse' than a target set for 'performance in areas such as water supply interruptions and drinking water quality'.\n\n\"We view its business plan as displaying reasonable levels of ambition for its performance in 2025-30. Under our draft decision, we require United Utilities to deliver a significantly improved level of service for customers, and the environment,\" it went on.\n\nOfwat chief executive David Black said: \"Customers want to see radical change in the way water companies care for the environment. Our draft decisions on company plans approve a tripling of investment to make sustained improvement to customer service and the environment at a fair price for customers.\"\n\n\"These proposals aim to deliver a 44% reduction in spills from storm overflows compared to levels in 2021. We expect all companies to embrace innovation and go further and faster to reduce spills wherever possible. Today's announcement also increases the resilience of our water supplies to the impact of climate change and will reduce how much water is taken from rivers by enabling a range of long-term water supply projects, which includes plans for nine reservoirs.\"\n\nWater firms can challenge Ofwat's proposals and a final decision is expected later this year.\n\nFull list of proposed average water bills by 2029/30, by company\n\nHere is a full list of the draft proposals for the average bills customers will be charged by water and wastewater companies in England and Wales by 2029/30.

A slow-moving crisis that has engulfed Thames has left it teetering on the brink of a painful restructuring, or even a temporary renationalisation.\n\nThames has also become a powerful totem of mismanagement, corporate greed and lax regulatory oversight. And for a new Labour government coming to terms with its economic inheritance, Thames is a timebomb that is about to detonate.\n\nNew breed of investors\n\nThe roots of that decay can be traced back more than two decades. In the early 2000s, as the government prepared to shunt two renationalised companies, Railtrack and British Energy, back into private hands, the message to regulators was clear: play nice and do not put off foreign investors.\n\nIt was against this backdrop of light-touch regulation that Macquarie, which started out as a small Australian merchant bank in the 1960s, decided to buy Thames Water in 2006.\n\nBritain's privatisation wave, kicked off by Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s, was entering a new phase. The early owners were cashing in their lucrative investments, and a new breed of financially savvy investors was circling.\n\nThe Macquarie-led consortium outmuscled investment heavyweights - including the gas-rich state of Qatar and Guy Hands's Terra Firma - to land the \u00a38bn acquisition from German's RWE.\n\nMacquarie pruned costs ruthlessly. Thames Water lifer Cliff Roney, who had a four-decade career within the company before retiring in 2018, recalls a perceptible shift when it took over from RWE.\n\n\"When Macquarie arrived, they presented a glossy presentation to us, promising investment in assets and staff. Within months, it was clear we'd been sold a pup,\" he says. \"Some important sites needed in case of water shortages were sold off. They were so tight on spending, you could barely order a box of pens. All the skills were contracted out - we had electricians, blacksmiths, window fitters - they were all outsourced under Macquarie.\"\n\nParsimony even extended to the boardroom - although not where pay was concerned. When Martin Baggs left his job running Thames Water in late 2016, he might have expected a lavish celebration, or at least a gold watch. Baggs had spent seven years as chief executive churning out profits and dividends for Macquarie. But in recognition of his service, Baggs and his top team were each presented with a tea towel.\n\n\"It had self-portraits drawn by the directors - they didn't even pay for a designer to create them,\" says a former Thames executive. \"Macquarie ran a very tight ship: if money didn't need to be spent, it wasn't.\"\n\nThey added: \"I'm not saying they're not the bad guys in this, but they were responsible in the core running of the company. If you needed to buy vital chemicals, you could buy them - you just couldn't buy any more than was absolutely necessary. It was all very precise. They would not leave any dividends if that could be taken out.\"\n\nHollowed out\n\nBut money was flowing, elsewhere. A \u00a3656m dividend was extracted in the first year of Macquarie's stewardship, in 2007, dwarfing the company's profits of \u00a3241m. Thames churned out dividends of more than \u00a3200m in each of the seven years which followed.\n\nIt carved Thames up into a complex corporate structure, layering debt across multiple tiers of companies. This so-called whole-business securitisation even involved setting up subsidiaries in the Cayman Islands.\n\nThe consortium would ultimately take out \u00a32.8bn during Macquarie's ownership, representing two-fifths of the total \u00a37bn in dividends that Thames Water has paid between 1990 and 2022, according to Guardian analysis. Macquarie said \u00a31.1bn was paid out to all shareholders, with its funds receiving \u00a3508m.\n\nIts current owners - which include Canadian pension fund Omers, the UK universities pension fund and a subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund - have not taken a dividend since 2017, although \"internal\" dividends have been paid to service debts higher up its complex corporate structure.\n\nThames Water, which was privatised with zero debt, saw its debts swell from \u00a33.4bn in 2006 to \u00a310.8bn in 2017, when Macquarie sold its final stake. The pension position went from a \u00a326.1m surplus in 2008 to a \u00a3260m deficit in 2015. \"They left Thames in a crumbling state,\" says Roney.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2019, there were \"grotesque excesses\" of debt amassed at water companies, including Thames, while dividends grew fatter, a senior water industry source said. \"It was asset stripping, pure and simple.\"\n\nA Macquarie spokesperson said: \"Debt increased in line with the company's asset base, which doubled due to the record \u00a311bn of investment delivered over the period.\"\n\nThe highest profile Macquarie executive linked to Thames is Martin Stanley, its former head of asset management, whose division oversaw Thames Water transactions. He earned \u00a310m in 2021, the year he stepped down from the role.\n\nIrked by \"misconceptions\" about utility investors, another Macquarie executive, Martin Bradley, the head of asset management, who oversaw the Thames transactions, wrote to the Financial Times earlier this year arguing that the consortium had kept bills affordable and invested \u00a311bn in network upgrades.\n\nThe company has even taken the unusual step of addressing media \"mischaracterisations\" online.\n\nThe Macquarie spokesperson said: \"We have had no influence over the decisions taken at Thames Water in the seven years since our managed funds sold their final equity stake. During the 11 years in which our funds were shareholders in Thames Water, we oversaw the largest investment programme in the company's history and the highest rate of investment per customer in the industry.\"\n\nConcerns about underinvestment in the water industry amid the broader challenges of the climate crisis and population growth led to a National Infrastructure Commission report in 2018 which underlined the need for greater drought resilience and leakage reduction. It is still issuing such warnings, saying in 2023 that \"a lot more still needs to be done\".\n\nIn the aftermath of that report, long-mooted plans for reservoirs finally advanced, including a reservoir to the south-west of Abingdon in Oxfordshire - although it still remains the centre of an intense local tussle.\n\nBy the time Macquarie cashed in its stake, work had begun on the much-debated Thames supersewer, a separate project that sits outside Thames Water's ownership but which will ultimately be paid for by Thames customers.\n\nIt was hard to find a corner of British infrastructure free from the bank's reach. From airports such as Glasgow, Aberdeen and Southampton to the gas pipe network manager Cadent, Macquarie was now deeply embedded in the UK's critical national infrastructure.\n\nIts link to Cadent would prove handy - insiders say Sir Adrian Montague's position as Cadent's chair, and experience dealing with Macquarie, contributed to his appointment as chair of Thames in July last year, parachuted in to handle its turnaround.\n\nBut along with those assets, Macquarie has acquired a mixed reputation among financial services professionals. Three current lenders to Thames criticised its approach during its time as a major shareholder at the company, saying its behaviour had reflected poorly on the rest of the investment community.\n\nOutrage grows\n\nIn March 2017, Britain's biggest water company was hit with a huge fine - a precursor of what was to follow.\n\nIt was just eight days after Macquarie had sold its final stake in Thames to investment managers controlled by Omers and the Kuwait Investment Authority.\n\nThe Environment Agency's prosecution led to a record \u00a320.3m penalty, imposed after the emergence of huge leaks of untreated sewage into the Thames and its tributaries which had led to serious impacts on residents, farmers and wildlife, killing birds and fish. The incidents, in 2013 and 2014, took place at sewage treatment works at Aylesbury, Didcot, Henley and Little Marlow, and a large sewage pumping station at Littlemore.\n\n\"This is a shocking and disgraceful state of affairs,\" said Judge Francis Sheridan, delivering the sentence at Aylesbury crown court. \"One has to get the message across to the shareholders that the environment is to be treasured and protected, and not poisoned.\"\n\nIn the four years after Macquarie's exit, Thames was fined \u00a332.4m for 11 water pollution cases, including \u00a34m for discharging an estimated half a million litres of raw sewage into the Seacourt and Hinksey streams in Oxford.\n\nIn 2023, it was fined \u00a33.3m and called \"reckless\" over a 2017 incident which saw millions of litres of raw sewage enter two rivers near Gatwick airport. That came on top of \u00a312m of penalties for late or badly managed roadworks in London.\n\nThe fines were also racking up elsewhere: in 2021, Southern Water was fined a new record of \u00a390m by the Environment Agency for deliberately dumping billions of litres of raw sewage into the seas off north Kent and Hampshire over several years.\n\nBetween 2015 and the summer of 2023, there were 59 prosecutions of water companies in England, with fines handed down by the courts of over \u00a3150m. As the fines mounted, so did the public outrage, led by a clutch of vociferous campaigners, notably the former lead singer of the Undertones, Feargal Sharkey.\n\nFinancial implosion\n\nThe political winds started to shift, with the then environment secretary, Michael Gove, saying in 2018 that water companies \"have not been acting sufficiently in the public interest.\" Some had been \"playing the system for the benefit of wealthy managers and owners, at the expense of consumers and the environment\", hiding \"behind complex financial structures\" to avoid scrutiny, he said. Ultimately, it had allowed \"failures to persist for far too long\".\n\nBut the wheels of regulation turn slowly. Ofwat's concerns were building in 2018, 2019 and 2020, according to insiders who were working on issues such as dividends at the time. In 2017, the Cayman subsidiaries were ordered to be shut down.\n\n\"By the time Macquarie left, it was abundantly clear that it had ransacked Thames,\" a former Ofwat board member told the Guardian. \"It might have been after that particular horse had bolted, but Ofwat did take steps to try and stem the tide of dividends.\"\n\nBut it was ultimately only last year that Ofwat gained new powers to stop the payment of dividends to shareholders if they threatened a water company's financial resilience.\n\nRelated: Thames Water to shut Cayman Islands subsidiaries under new chairman\n\nAnd despite the catastrophic financial position it left Thames Water in, Macquarie made a shock return to the English water industry in 2021, taking control of troubled Southern Water and injecting \u00a31bn to save it from possible renationalisation. Its surprise comeback came with a warning from the then chair of Ofwat, Jonson Cox, who told Macquarie that \"very profound changes\" would be required at Southern.\n\nMacquarie said that the regulator had welcomed its investment in struggling Southern Water.\n\nOfwat faced a worsening conundrum. The water monopolies were so heavily indebted that fines risked further undermining their financial resilience.\n\nBy 2021, mounting outrage over sewage discharges had reached a climax. In November of that year the Environment Agency and Ofwat announced separate, parallel investigations into \"potential widespread non-compliance at wastewater treatment works\".\n\nMeanwhile, financial problems at Thames were starting to mount. Sarah Bentley, the latest chief executive to promise to turn around the struggling utility, abruptly resigned in June 2023. Before the week was out, it emerged that the government had begun contingency planning for the collapse of Thames, and that Montague would become chair.\n\nAccounts differ on the reasons for Bentley's departure. Industry sources claim she was frustrated with a lack of available funds to turn around Thames more quickly. Montague told MPs she was \"feeling the burdens of office were quite considerable\", before hastily apologising. \"Sarah Bentley became known as the Scarlet Pimpernel: she was barely seen and only communicated with most staff through emails and bulletins,\" recalls Roney.\n\nAcross English and Welsh water companies, fraught negotiations with Ofwat were under way over how much they could increase bills by for their next five-year spending cycle, due to run from 2025 to 2030.\n\nBut cash was running out. In July 2023, Thames said it had secured \u00a3750m of emergency funding from its shareholders to run to March 2025 and indicated that a further \u00a32.5bn would be needed to cover the five years to 2030.\n\nBy December, Thames's complex financial structure was the source of intense examination in Westminster, and had been described by one MP as an \"absolute shambles\".\n\nThe arrival in January of Chris Weston, the former British Gas executive who was most recently boss of power generator Aggreko, was a last roll of the dice by its despairing shareholders. The \u00a32.3m-a-year chief executive was \"the bolshiest utilities executive they could find,\" sources said.\n\nBut not everyone is convinced of this: another former colleague says Weston had a reputation for indecision at Centrica, notably when he was running its North American subsidiary Direct Energy. \"The joke was Chris was much like the Canadian weather - if you didn't like his decision, just hang around for half an hour and it will change,\" a source recalled.\n\nIn March, shareholders dropped a bombshell: they pulled the plug on the first \u00a3500m tranche of the \u00a3750m committed the prior summer, deeming the company \"uninvestable\". Ministers showed little sympathy - Gove called Thames \"arrogant\". With no more shareholder cash forthcoming amid the standoff with Ofwat, Thames's parent company, Kemble, told its creditors in April it would be unable to pay a \u00a3190m loan due at the end of that month.\n\nInside Whitehall, contingency planning for Thames's failure gathered pace. A team set up inside government to study the Thames situation in 2023, codenamed Project Timber, drafted a blueprint for turning Thames into a publicly owned arm's-length body. Lenders would be forced to take heavy losses - with the rest of its \u00a315.6bn of debt added to the public purse. Its dire situation was described as a \"critical risk\" to the country in briefings to the prime minister, Keir Starmer, and chancellor, Rachel Reeves, within days of them taking office.\n\nRelated: Thames Water nationalisation plan could move bulk of \u00a315bn debt to state\n\nA Thames Water spokesperson said: \"We have set out an ambitious business plan for the next five years, and with consistent leadership and priorities, time and resources, and the appropriate regulatory determination, we will turn around this business and make it perform for all our customers, the environment and our wider stakeholders.\"\n\nThe special administration regime for water monopolies, hastily drawn up when the industry was privatised in 1989, was updated. The changes now allow companies to enter administration and ultimately be sold as a going concern after their debts are restructured, rather than liquidating the company.\n\nCrucially, the rules have been rewritten to protect taxpayers, ensuring any state support issued would now need to be repaid, before even secured creditors.\n\nThe company's fate now rests on how generous Ofwat is with its first ruling on its spending plans on Thursday. Thames has been lobbying desperately to allow it to pay dividends up to Kemble, increase bills by up to 59% and receive smaller fines, but it is unlikely to receive a warm reception.\n\nA damaging restructuring for investors and lenders - or even temporary renationalisation - looks inevitable. Ofwat's final view on bills increases will be released in December. Thames, its investors and - quietly - Macquarie will hope it is still in private hands by that point. The 35-year privatisation experiment looks set to culminate in a crisis that the new Labour government will have to clear up.", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Keir Starmer, the new prime minister, and Rachel Reeves, the new chancellor, have been briefed that the company presents a \"critical risk\" to the country.\n\nThames Water Utilities Limited, the regulated subsidiary, on Tuesday said it had \u00a31.8bn in cash and other liquid assets \"sufficient to fund our operations for the next 11 months to the end of May 2025\".\n\nFollowing the draft determination and our response to Ofwat we will be engaging with potential investors and creditors to seek new equity and to extend our liquidity runway. Any equity process is not expected to conclude until after the final determination.\n\nThe company reported a 10% increase in revenues to \u00a32.4bn in the year to 31 March as it raised bills in line with inflation, and scraped to a profit of \u00a375m. It also said that it spent a record \u00a32.1bn as it maintained and upgraded its ageing pipe network.\n\nChris Weston, chief executive of Thames Water since December, said he believed the business could be turned around. He said:\n\nThe challenges we face are well documented, but our operational and financial performance for the last year show good progress, and these positive results provide the right foundations on which to build and improve.\n\nJapan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index closed at a new record high on Tuesday, the latest in a series of records amid a global surge in investor interest in artificial intelligence companies.\n\nComputer chip semiconductor companies - who have been some of the biggest beneficiaries of the rally - helped the index to a 2% gain on Tuesday, outpacing other Asian stock indices.\n\nThe index closed at a record high of 41,580.17 on Tuesday, after rising as high as 41,769.35 during afternoon trading.\n\nThe Nikkei had taken decades to surpass its previous peak, hit during the 1989 bubble.

expected 8.55am: The morning so far\n\nThe FTSE 100 shifted to and fro when trading commenced this Thursday, but it ultimately looks to be heading in the right direction.\n\nAs of 8.55am, the blue-chip index was trading 15 points higher at 8,208, supported by a raft of bullish economic announcements.\n\nGDP figures show that the economy grew by 1.4% year on year in May, outstripping the expected growth rate of 1.2% and doubling April's 0.7% gain.\n\nMonth on month, gross domestic product grew by 0.4%, an upside surprise following a zero-growth period in April, though the data still shows \"significant room for improvement under the incoming Labour government\", according to Rob Morgan, chief investment analyst at Charles Stanley (LSE:CAY).\n\nConstruction output, meanwhile, advanced by 0.8% year-on-year in May, marking a strong rebound from a 2.1% drop in the prior month and exceeding market expectations of a 1.9% decline.\n\nWater firms Severn Trent PLC (LSE:SVT) and United Utilities Group PLC (LSE:UU.) were the two biggest FTSE 100 risers of the morning.\n\nThis follows regulator Ofwat's latest draft determination, which sets the pricing and investment agenda for British water firms.\n\nOn average, water bills are set to rise 21% by 2030, Ofwat declared.\n\nThough this is less than what the water firms wanted, Severn Trent is higher following a decent first-quarter financial update.\n\nElsewhere in company news, Dr Martens has published a bare trading update prior to its AGM meeting this morning.\n\nThe classic British footwear company said that \"trading since the start of this financial year has been in line with expectations and our guidance for (financial 2025) remains unchanged\".\n\n8.43am: Construction output grows\n\nConstruction output in the UK advanced by 0.8% year-on-year in May 2024, according to the Office for National Statistics.\n\nThis marks a significant rebound from a 2.1% drop in the prior month and exceeded market expectations of a 1.9% decline.\n\nIt was the first expansion in construction output since January.\n\nThe increase was driven by a 7.7% rise in repair and maintenance activity, up from 6.4% in April, while new work saw a smaller decline of 4% compared to 9.4% previously.\n\n8.30am: Dr Martens targets growth in US direct-to-customer market\n\nDr Martens has published a bare trading update prior to its AGM meeting this morning.\n\nThe classic British footwear company said that \"trading since the start of this financial year has been in line with expectations and our guidance for (financial 2025) remains unchanged\".\n\nThe first quarter is typically \"the smallest period of our financial year, representing the end of the Spring/Summer season\", said the group, adding that the current financial year will be weighted to the second half.\n\n\"The upcoming Autumn/Winter 24 season remains a key focus,\" said Dr Martens, with detailed trading plans currently being implemented.\n\nDr Martens is targeting target positive direct-to-customer growth in the US in the second half of the current financial year.\n\n\"Work on our cost action plan is ongoing and we will provide a detailed update at our first half results in November.\"\n\nShares were up 1.6% in opening exchanges.\n\n8.25am: Blue chips wobble\n\nMarkets dipped their toes into the red in opening trades despite pre-market data pointing to a strong start.\n\nThe FTSE 100 is currently a handful of points lower at 8,191, with Rolls-Royce Group plc, BAE Systems PLC (LSE:BA.) and Antofagasta plc among the worst performers.\n\n8.10am: Labour has inherited improving economy, GDP data shows\n\nBritain's economy grew by 1.4% year on year in May, outstripping the expected growth rate of 1.2% and doubling April's 0.7% gain.\n\nMonth on month, gross domestic product grew by 0.4%, an upside surprise following a zero-growth period in April.\n\n\"This should be a boon for the new Labour government with growth now likely to outstrip the OBR's 2024 GDP forecasts, partially offsetting some of the projected increase in interest rate costs,\" said Deutsche Bank's chief UK economist Sanjay Raja.\n\nAccording to Rob Morgan, chief investment analyst at Charles Stanley (LSE:CAY): \"The UK's economic scorecard shows significant room for improvement under the incoming Labour government.\n\n\"The UK economy has been subdued coming out of the pandemic, an energy crisis, and a cost-of-living crisis which has been very difficult for UK consumers.\n\n\"However, tepid growth now looks to be warming up heading into the second half of the year.\"\n\nMorgan said today's GDP data \"illustrates we are in the midst of a very gentle upswing in activity following a slowdown in 2023\"\n\n7.59am: Thames Water bills to rise by \u00a399, barely half of what it sought\n\nOfwat will allow Thames Water to raise its annual bills by \u00a399 over the next five years, falling significantly below what the London and south east England water supplier wanted.\n\nOfwat made the announcement in its latest draft determination, which sets investment and pricing targets for Britain's water suppliers.\n\nThames Water was seeking a \u00a3191 bill rise to support investment in creaking infrastructure.\n\nDespite slashing Thames Water's pricing wishes, Ofwat has outlined some strict expectations of the water supplier.\n\nOfwats expects Thames Water to deliver a 19% reduction in leakage, and 18% reduction in phosphorus and a full 50% reduction in pollution incidents from average 2020-23 levels.\n\nOver 2025-30, Thames Water should deliver a 66% reduction in water supply interruptions and a 55% reduction in internal sewer flooding events from 2020-23 levels.\n\nThames Water is expected to deliver \u00a316.9 billion worth in total infrastructure improvements.\n\n7.35am: Annual water bills to rise 21% by 2030\n\nWater bills are expected to rise by \u00a319 per year to fund investment into Britain's ageing infrastructure, Ofwat has declared.\n\nIt means the average household water bill across the UK will increase from \u00a3441 to \u00a3535 by 2030, an increase of 21%.\n\nThis is below the average asked of Ofwat by Thames Water, United Utilities and other major water firms.\n\nOfwat laid out the plans in the regulator's draft determination, which sets the agenda for all UK water firms over the next five years.\n\nIt has proposed total investment spending to increase to \u00a388 billion between 2025 and 2030, a 50% increase from the previous draft determination.\n\nOfwat expects water companies to triple investment in new infrastructure and resources \"to improve the environment, resilience and service\".\n\n\"We expect increased investment to be reflected in better performance,\" said

A slow-moving crisis that has engulfed Thames has left it teetering on the brink of a painful restructuring, or even a temporary renationalisation.\n\nThames has also become a powerful totem of mismanagement, corporate greed and lax regulatory oversight. And for a new Labour government coming to terms with its economic inheritance, Thames is a timebomb that is about to detonate.\n\nThe roots of that decay can be traced back more than two decades. In the early 2000s, as the government prepared to shunt two renationalised companies, Railtrack and British Energy, back into private hands, the message to regulators was clear: play nice and do not put off foreign investors.\n\nIt was against this backdrop of light-touch regulation that Macquarie, which started out as a small Australian merchant bank in the 1960s, decided to buy Thames Water in 2006.\n\nBritain's privatisation wave, kicked off by Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s, was entering a new phase. The early owners were cashing in their lucrative investments, and a new breed of financially savvy investors was circling.\n\nThe Macquarie-led consortium outmuscled investment heavyweights - including the gas-rich state of Qatar and Guy Hands's Terra Firma - to land the \u00a38bn acquisition from German's RWE.\n\nMacquarie pruned costs ruthlessly. Thames Water lifer Cliff Roney, who had a four-decade career within the company before retiring in 2018, recalls a perceptible shift when it took over from RWE.\n\n\"When Macquarie arrived, they presented a glossy presentation to us, promising investment in assets and staff. Within months, it was clear we'd been sold a pup,\" he says. \"Some important sites needed in case of water shortages were sold off. They were so tight on spending, you could barely order a box of pens. All the skills were contracted out - we had electricians, blacksmiths, window fitters - they were all outsourced under Macquarie.\"\n\nParsimony even extended to the boardroom - although not where pay was concerned. When Martin Baggs left his job running Thames Water in late 2016, he might have expected a lavish celebration, or at least a gold watch. Baggs had spent seven years as chief executive churning out profits and dividends for Macquarie. But in recognition of his service, Baggs and his top team were each presented with a tea towel.\n\n\"It had self-portraits drawn by the directors - they didn't even pay for a designer to create them,\" says a former Thames executive. \"Macquarie ran a very tight ship: if money didn't need to be spent, it wasn't.\"\n\nThey added: \"I'm not saying they're not the bad guys in this, but they were responsible in the core running of the company. If you needed to buy vital chemicals, you could buy them - you just couldn't buy any more than was absolutely necessary. It was all very precise. They would not leave any dividends if that could be taken out.\"\n\nBut money was flowing, elsewhere. A \u00a3656m dividend was extracted in the first year of Macquarie's stewardship, in 2007, dwarfing the company's profits of \u00a3241m. Thames churned out dividends of more than \u00a3200m in each of the seven years which followed.\n\nIt carved Thames up into a complex corporate structure, layering debt across multiple tiers of companies. This so-called whole-business securitisation even involved setting up subsidiaries in the Cayman Islands.\n\nThe consortium would ultimately take out \u00a32.8bn during Macquarie's ownership, representing two-fifths of the total \u00a37bn in dividends that Thames Water has paid between 1990 and 2022, according to Guardian analysis. Macquarie said \u00a31.1bn was paid out to all shareholders, with its funds receiving \u00a3508m.\n\nIts current owners - which include Canadian pension fund Omers, the UK universities pension fund and a subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund - have not taken a dividend since 2017, although \"internal\" dividends have been paid to service debts higher up its complex corporate structure.\n\nThames Water, which was privatised with zero debt, saw its debts swell from \u00a33.4bn in 2006 to \u00a310.8bn in 2017, when Macquarie sold its final stake. The pension position went from a \u00a326.1m surplus in 2008 to a \u00a3260m deficit in 2015. \"They left Thames in a crumbling state,\" says Roney.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2019, there were \"grotesque excesses\" of debt amassed at water companies, including Thames, while dividends grew fatter, a senior water industry source said. \"It was asset stripping, pure and simple.\"\n\nA Macquarie spokesperson said: \"Debt increased in line with the company's asset base, which doubled due to the record \u00a311bn of investment delivered over the period.\"\n\nThe highest profile Macquarie executive linked to Thames is Martin Stanley, its former head of asset management, whose division oversaw Thames Water transactions. He earned \u00a310m in 2021, the year he stepped down from the role.\n\nIrked by \"misconceptions\" about utility investors, another Macquarie executive, Martin Bradley, the head of asset management, who oversaw the Thames transactions, wrote to the Financial Times earlier this year arguing that the consortium had kept bills affordable and invested \u00a311bn in network upgrades.\n\nThe company has even taken the unusual step of addressing media \"mischaracterisations\" online.\n\nThe Macquarie spokesperson said: \"We have had no influence over the decisions taken at Thames Water in the seven years since our managed funds sold their final equity stake. During the 11 years in which our funds were shareholders in Thames Water, we oversaw the largest investment programme in the company's history and the highest rate of investment per customer in the industry.\"\n\nConcerns about underinvestment in the water industry amid the broader challenges of the climate crisis and population growth led to a National Infrastructure Commission report in 2018 which underlined the need for greater drought resilience and leakage reduction. It is still issuing such warnings, saying in 2023 that \"a lot more still needs to be done\".\n\nIn the aftermath of that report, long-mooted plans for reservoirs finally advanced, including a reservoir to the south-west of Abingdon in Oxfordshire - although it still remains the centre of an intense local tussle.\n\nBy the time Macquarie cashed in its stake, work had begun on the much-debated Thames supersewer, a separate project that sits outside Thames Water's ownership but which will ultimately be paid for by Thames customers.\n\nIt was hard to find a corner of British infrastructure free from the bank's reach. From airports such as Glasgow, Aberdeen and Southampton to the gas pipe network manager Cadent, Macquarie was now deeply embedded in the UK's critical national infrastructure.\n\nIts link to Cadent would prove handy - insiders say Sir Adrian Montague's position as Cadent's chair, and experience dealing with Macquarie, contributed to his appointment as chair of Thames in July last year, parachuted in to handle its turnaround.\n\nBut along with those assets, Macquarie has acquired a mixed reputation among financial services professionals. Three current lenders to Thames criticised its approach during its time as a major shareholder at the company, saying its behaviour had reflected poorly on the rest of the investment community.\n\nIn March 2017, Britain's biggest water company was hit with a huge fine - a precursor of what was to follow.\n\nIt was just eight days after Macquarie had sold its final stake in Thames to investment managers controlled by Omers and the Kuwait Investment Authority.\n\nThe Environment Agency's prosecution led to a record \u00a320.3m penalty, imposed after the emergence of huge leaks of untreated sewage into the Thames and its tributaries which had led to serious impacts on residents, farmers and wildlife, killing birds and fish. The incidents, in 2013 and 2014, took place at sewage treatment works at Aylesbury, Didcot, Henley and Little Marlow, and a large sewage pumping station at Littlemore.\n\n\"This is a shocking and disgraceful state of affairs,\" said Judge Francis Sheridan, delivering the sentence at Aylesbury crown court. \"One has to get the message across to the shareholders that the environment is to be treasured and protected, and not poisoned.\"\n\nIn the four years after Macquarie's exit, Thames was fined \u00a332.4m for 11 water pollution cases, including \u00a34m for discharging an estimated half a million litres of raw sewage into the Seacourt and Hinksey streams in Oxford.\n\nIn 2023, it was fined \u00a33.3m and called \"reckless\" over a 2017 incident which saw millions of litres of raw sewage enter two rivers near Gatwick airport. That came on top of \u00a312m of penalties for late or badly managed roadworks in London.\n\nThe fines were also racking up elsewhere: in 2021, Southern Water was fined a new record of \u00a390m by the Environment Agency for deliberately dumping billions of litres of raw sewage into the seas off north Kent and Hampshire over several years.\n\nBetween 2015 and the summer of 2023, there were 59 prosecutions of water companies in England, with fines handed down by the courts of over \u00a3150m. As the fines mounted, so did the public outrage, led by a clutch of vociferous campaigners, notably the former lead singer of the Undertones, Feargal Sharkey.\n\nThe political winds started to shift, with the then environment secretary, Michael Gove, saying in 2018 that water companies \"have not been acting sufficiently in the public interest.\" Some had been \"playing the system for the benefit of wealthy managers and owners, at the expense of consumers and the environment\", hiding \"behind complex financial structures\" to avoid scrutiny, he said. Ultimately, it had allowed \"failures to persist for far too long\".\n\nBut the wheels of regulation turn slowly. Ofwat's concerns were building in 2018, 2019 and 2020, according to insiders who were working on issues such as dividends at the time. In 2017, the Cayman subsidiaries were ordered to be shut down.\n\n\"By the time Macquarie left, it was abundantly clear that it had ransacked Thames,\" a former Ofwat board member told the Guardian. \"It might have been after that particular horse had bolted, but Ofwat did take steps to try and stem the tide of dividends.\"\n\nBut it was ultimately only last year that Ofwat gained new powers to stop the payment of dividends to shareholders if they threatened a water company's financial resilience.\n\nAnd despite the catastrophic financial position it left Thames Water in, Macquarie made a shock return to the English water industry in 2021, taking control of troubled Southern Water and injecting \u00a31bn to save it from possible renationalisation. Its surprise comeback came with a warning from the then chair of Ofwat, Jonson Cox, who told Macquarie that \"very profound changes\" would be required at Southern.\n\nMacquarie said that the regulator had welcomed its investment in struggling Southern Water.\n\nOfwat faced a worsening conundrum. The water monopolies were so heavily indebted that fines risked further undermining their financial resilience.\n\nBy 2021, mounting outrage over sewage discharges had reached a climax. In November of that year the Environment Agency and Ofwat announced separate, parallel investigations into \"potential widespread non-compliance at wastewater treatment works\".\n\nMeanwhile, financial problems at Thames were starting to mount. Sarah Bentley, the latest chief executive to promise to turn around the struggling utility, abruptly resigned in June 2023. Before the week was out, it emerged that the government had begun contingency planning for the collapse of Thames, and that Montague would become chair.\n\nAccounts differ on the reasons for Bentley's departure. Industry sources claim she was frustrated with a lack of available funds to turn around Thames more quickly. Montague told MPs she was \"feeling the burdens of office were quite considerable\", before hastily apologising. \"Sarah Bentley became known as the Scarlet Pimpernel: she was barely seen and only communicated with most staff through emails and bulletins,\" recalls Roney.\n\nAcross English and Welsh water companies, fraught negotiations with Ofwat were under way over how much they could increase bills by for their next five-year spending cycle, due to run from 2025 to 2030.\n\nBut cash was running out. In July 2023, Thames said it had secured \u00a3750m of emergency funding from its shareholders to run to March 2025 and indicated that a further \u00a32.5bn would be needed to cover the five years to 2030.\n\nBy December, Thames's complex financial structure was the source of intense examination in Westminster, and had been described by one MP as an \"absolute shambles\".\n\nThe arrival in January of Chris Weston, the former British Gas executive who was most recently boss of power generator Aggreko, was a last roll of the dice by its despairing shareholders. The \u00a32.3m-a-year chief executive was \"the bolshiest utilities executive they could find,\" sources said.\n\nBut not everyone is convinced of this: another former colleague says Weston had a reputation for indecision at Centrica, notably when he was running its North American subsidiary Direct Energy. \"The joke was Chris was much like the Canadian weather - if you didn't like his decision, just hang around for half an hour and it will change,\" a source recalled.\n\nIn March, shareholders dropped a bombshell: they pulled the plug on the first \u00a3500m tranche of the \u00a3750m committed the prior summer, deeming the company \"uninvestable\". Ministers showed little sympathy - Gove called Thames \"arrogant\". With no more shareholder cash forthcoming amid the standoff with Ofwat, Thames's parent company, Kemble, told its creditors in April it would be unable to pay a \u00a3190m loan due at the end of that month.\n\nInside Whitehall, contingency planning for Thames's failure gathered pace. A team set up inside government to study the Thames situation in 2023, codenamed Project Timber, drafted a blueprint for turning Thames into a publicly owned arm's-length body. Lenders would be forced to take heavy losses - with the rest of its \u00a315.6bn of debt added to the public purse. Its dire situation was described as a \"critical risk\" to the country in briefings to the prime minister, Keir Starmer, and chancellor, Rachel Reeves, within days of them taking office.\n\nA Thames Water spokesperson said: \"We have set out an ambitious business plan for the next five years, and with consistent leadership and priorities, time and resources, and the appropriate regulatory determination, we will turn around this business and make it perform for all our customers, the environment and our wider stakeholders.\"\n\nThe special administration regime for water monopolies, hastily drawn up when the industry was privatised in 1989, was updated. The changes now allow companies to enter administration and ultimately be sold as a going concern after their debts are restructured, rather than liquidating the company.\n\nCrucially, the rules have been rewritten to protect taxpayers, ensuring any state support issued would now need to be repaid, before even secured creditors.\n\nThe company's fate now rests on how generous Ofwat is with its first ruling on its spending plans on Thursday. Thames has been lobbying desperately to allow it to pay dividends up to Kemble, increase bills by up to 59% and receive smaller fines, but it is unlikely to receive a warm reception.\n\nA damaging restructuring for investors and lenders - or even temporary renationalisation - looks inevitable. Ofwat's final view on bills increases will be released in December. Thames, its investors and - quietly - Macquarie will hope it is still in private hands by that point. The 35-year privatisation experiment looks set to culminate in a crisis that the new Labour government will have to clear up.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

News that Thames Water has been put in special measures at the same time that Ofwat has given permission for other water companies to increase bills by an average of \u00a394 over the next five years is going to rekindle the beliefs of many in his party that public utilities do not belong in the private sector.\n\nStarmer is not helped by the fact that when he won the Labour leadership in 2020 it was on the promise of renationalising water and energy companies. His leadership has looked as if it was bought on a false prospectus ever since he changed his mind on the matter in 2022. His excuse, repeated many times since, was that he didn't think that buying out private shareholders was the best use of public money when there are so many other demands on the public purse.\n\nI am no socialist but it is hard not to sympathise with those who say that privatisation of the water industry has been a disaster. The whole point of privatising any public service is surely threefold: to bring extra investment into the industry, to transfer financial risk from the taxpayer to private capital and to improve the experience for consumers, on both price and service, by creating a competitive environment in place of grudging service by a state monolith.\n\nIn the case of the water industry none of these objectives has been realised. There is no competition for domestic consumers - our water supply has simply been taken out of the hands of a public monolith and put into the hands of private monoliths. Investment, compared with the decades prior to nationalisation, has dried up. Construction of new reservoirs has all but ceased. There has been little effort to avert sewage spills by separating foul and storm drainage. Pipes are still leaky. Thames Water did go as far as investing in one innovation to save us from water shortages - a desalination plant in East London - but then refused to use it during the drought two years ago. As for financial risk, we are about to find out where that really lies. Is it going to be Thames Water's owners and bondholders who pay the price for its dismal performance - or are the public, either in the form of taxpayers or the company's captive customers?\n\nPrivate enterprise works wonders when there is competition to keep everyone on their toes. The trouble with the water industry - and to some extent other public utilities too - is that the incentive structure is too weak. Water companies know we have no choice but to use their service, and so find it cheaper to fob us off with hosepipe bans rather than supply adequate water. They can't offer us the choice to pay for more expensive water from desalination plants during a drought because the prices they can charge us are fixed by Ofwat.\n\nWater companies do in theory have incentives to avoid polluting waterways in the form of threatened fines from Ofwat, but the fines are too feeble - with the result water companies find it cheaper simply to pay the fines rather than invest. As for financial risk, water companies know that the government can't let them fail and so they can splash out on large dividends for their owners, knowing that if they get into trouble they will have to be bailed out in some way.\n\nStarmer is right that buying out private shareholders is not the best use of public money, but surely there is something that Tony Blair would call a 'third way'. It would also happen to appeal to believers in capitalism, too. That would be to up the fines for pollution to levels which are a proper disincentive, but otherwise leave water companies alone so long as they are solvent. But they must make it absolutely clear that if they get into financial trouble there will be no bailout - rather they will be allowed to go bust. In order to allow this there needs to be a proper mechanism for a government agency to take over water and sewerage services at short notice. Taxpayers should pay for the assets in such a situation, but at firesale prices, as would happen with any other business that goes bust.\n\nGet on with the job and you can carry on making profits. But fail, and you will be toast - your shareholders and bondholders will be wiped out and the government will seize your pipes and sewers at a price that is favourable to taxpayers. That ought to be Starmer's message to our monopolistic water industry.", "source": {"uri": "spectator.us", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectator USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ross_clark@spectator.us", "name": "Ross Clark", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Water", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thames Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Water industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nationalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofwat", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ofwat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Privatization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_utility", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public utility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Private sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Socialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "East London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_drain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Storm drain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desalination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Desalination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_scarcity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Water scarcity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sewage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reservoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drought", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Water supply"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Way", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Third Way"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewerage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sewerage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterway", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Waterway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Capitalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bailout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Blair", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tony Blair"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://www.spectator.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2138347084-e1720698226423.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717113", "eventUri": "eng-9717113", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

Thankfully, the new government says it's not going down the road, which John McDonnell and Jeremy Corbyn wanted us to take, of nationalising this \u00a3100 billion industry. But the main regulator Ofwat's proposal to limit price increases to an average of just \u00a319 a year until 2030 will not allow much in the way of new investment. It's a third less than the industry was asking for.\n\nThe disastrous management of Thames Water, which borrowed \u00a314bn against a revenue of about \u00a32bn a year, and is projected to run out of cash by the end of next year, has cast a huge shadow over the whole of our privatised water industry. But all sixteen water companies have faced some similar problems: hosepipe bans in a drearily rainy country, frequent Niagara-style leakages, regular sewage spills polluting rivers and beaches and giving bathers the runs and worse.\n\nWhat's the problem? Well, plenty would say our water-related woes are down to predatory capitalists ripping off helpless customers.\n\nBut the water industry in England and Wales is hardly rampant Wild West capitalism. It's a heavily-regulated business facing major problems.\n\nOfwat juggles at least four objectives. First, in the face of local monopolies for domestic consumers (businesses do have some choice of suppliers), keeping prices down to tolerable levels. Second, ensuring that water suppliers maintain and improve drinking water standards. Third, making them expand water sources and reduce leakages. And finally, getting them to cut back seriously on those awful sewage spills whenever it rains heavily.\n\nRemember that this juggling act takes place while increasing demands for water face a limited supply. No new reservoir has been created in 30 years, with proposals being hobbled by bureaucracy and Nimbyism. Over that period, population has grown by 10 million and we use far more water - with multiple bathrooms in homes and omnipresent washing machines. And (not so you'd notice) people generally insist on taking baths and showers every day in a way which our grubbier predecessors couldn't afford. We need 2bn more litres a day than in the 1990s.\n\nNot only that, but our increased population also needs to go to the toilet: this involves more sewage than ever before, often accompanied by unwanted wet wipes and other gunk which creates pipe-blocking fatbergs. Meanwhile, rainwater runoff has become more problematic. Houses have foolishly been built on floodplains, while hundreds of thousands of homeowners have concreted over their gardens to provide parking spaces, or replaced verdant lawns with plastic astroturf.\n\nThis means that the capacity of land to absorb rainwater has been reduced. More water thus drains into the sewers and has to go somewhere. That somewhere is, all too often, our watercourses. Hence the polluted rivers and dying fishes. We need to construct more overflow storage, but in the short run the only alternative would be to let the mess back up into our homes.\n\nAll of this, of course, in the context of an ancient infrastructure - particularly in London, where there is still heavy reliance in some areas on Joseph Bazalgette's wonderful 19th-century sewers. Hundreds of miles of supply pipes probably need replacing, so leaks are inevitable. To stop all leaks would be massively expensive. 'Zero leakage', like most zero targets, is ill-informed and wishful thinking.\n\nOfwat has to prioritise. It has certainly managed to keep water prices down in real terms, and the quality of drinking water now meets European standards, which it didn't twenty years ago. Leakages, though still too high, have been significantly reduced. Some progress has been made on reducing sewage overflows, but there are far too many.\n\nThere have been some notable investments funded by a mixture of public and private capital. Take the almost-completed Thames Tideway Tunnel. Costing almost \u00a35bn, this 24 foot diameter monster runs from Acton down to Stratford, and on to the treatment plant at Beckton. It should prevent overspill into the Thames from more than 30 current outlets. But it's taken years and occupied a huge chunk of the specialist workforce, the limited size of which is another constraint on rapid improvement.\n\nSo there have been achievements, but of course they're not enough. Arguably, keeping water prices down has not been the right approach. Privatisation in 1989 provided an initial boost to investment. But companies can only continue to invest if they recoup the money they lay out in higher future revenue. With controlled prices, this is difficult and encourages shortcuts. Rather than raising costly new equity funding, Thames Water took advantage of low interest rates prior to lockdown to run up debt to meet Ofwat's targets. Now reality has caught up with them. Belated attempts in recent weeks to bring in more equity to mitigate the problem have understandably proved difficult.\n\nUltimately the public will have to pay for the improved standards we all want, but politicians avoid articulating this. The current set up encourages the fantasy that shareholders will update this massive industry's ancient infrastructure for free. Quibbles about bonuses and 'excessive' dividends - which the regulator does monitor, and to be fair has increasingly intervened over - are irrelevant.\n\nThe new Labour government's reluctance to go for the nationalisation many of its supporters crave is understandable. Apart from the colossal cost and organisational upheaval involved, sensible members of the government will be aware that having direct control over a nation's water is no panacea.\n\nIn Northern Ireland and Scotland, water remains in government hands, while in Wales a non-profit company operates. A model for England? Hardly. Northern Ireland's industry has been chronically underfunded and has a poor record on leakages. Meanwhile, Scotland has a growing sewage spill problem. In Wales, we see the same sort of complaints we get in England.\n\nNor is the picture obviously better in continental Europe where water is almost always a state responsibility. Water prices are significantly higher in Italy, France and Germany than here. Germany and France have major river pollution problems. And bear in mind that too-high leakage numbers here are still well below the European average.\n\nCosts would be reduced with no dividends to pay, of course. But government funding has a rising cost as it pushes the limits of its borrowing capacity. Moreover, past experience of nationalised industries of all kinds suggests that productivity growth would be slower than under commercial pressures. Although hidden in general taxation, costs would thus rise faster than before. We'd indirectly be paying more for water.\n\nAnd once again, we'd be dependent for investment on what the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs could cajole the Treasury into providing. Good luck with selling a boring old water pipe as the NHS, schools, defence and a thousand and one more exotic supplicants clamour for funding.\n\nThere's much wrong with our water industry. But the answer lies with improved regulation, a sharp rise in the price of water services, and far greater realism from politicians and a public which continues to live in dreamland.", "source":

Major tech companies like Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, and Google leading the way.\n\nPre-market data implies around 20 points of losses on the Nasdaq when trading commences, bringing the tech-heavy index down to 20,646.\n\nIt is a big day for macroeconomic data, with inflation and employment data on the agenda.\n\nOn the company news front, PepsiCo is set to fall after noting \"subdued\" North American snack demand in the second quarter.\n\nDelta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL), meanwhile, flew to record revenues, but its shares are set to fall 9% as earnings touched down 12% lower year on year.\n\nBack in London and the FTSE 100 blue-chip index is currently up 23 points to 8,216.\n\n12.53pm: Water bill price hikes a 'bitter pill' says Labour\n\nLabour chancellor Rachel Reeves has called the planned 21% increase in water bills by 2030 a \"bitter pill\" for Brits to swallow.\n\nUnder draft proposals released today by regulator Ofwat, water firms will be allowed to hike bills by an average of \u00a319 per year, or \u00a394 over five years to 2030.\n\n\"It's clearly a bitter pill for people who are seeing today's announcements about higher water bills,\" said Reeves.\n\n\"This reflects 14 years of failure from the Conservatives to drive investment to reduce pollution, and to ensure that families are not struggling the way that they have been with the cost-of-living crisis.\"\n\nWhile it comes at a time of public outrage over escalating sewage spills and water contamination incidents, the price hikes fall significantly short of what the water companies wanted.\n\nThames Water, for instance, will only be allowed to raise water prices by \u00a399 over the next five years, barely half of the \u00a3191 it was seeking.\n\nIn a sign that this compromise will satisfy no one, campaigners and the Liberal Democrats have robustly rubbished the price hikes as unfair, disgraceful and insulting.\n\nIndustry group Water UK was equally outraged for the opposite reason, calling the decision to not meet water companies' demands \"an unrealistic and unfair decision from Ofwat, and our economy and environment will pay the price\".\n\n12.25pm: Ofwat in water firm face-off\n\nWater regulator Ofwat is preparing for a confrontation with Britain's water executives over the austere draft determination proposals released today.\n\nIn its five-year review of consumer bill prices and investment spending, Ofwat has allowed UK water companies to increase bills by only 21% by 2030.\n\nWhile this is positive news for consumers, it significantly falls short of the water firms' expectations, raising concerns about a potential shortfall in essential infrastructure investment.\n\nDavid Henderson, chief executive of industry group Water UK, told the BBC that Ofwat has \"got this wrong.\"\n\n\"This is an unrealistic and unfair decision from Ofwat, and our economy and environment will pay the price,\" he added.\n\nAnother spokesperson for Water UK described it as \"the biggest ever cut in investment,\" contrasting sharply with Ofwat boss David Black's assertion that the plans represent the \"biggest ever\" investment in the water sector.\n\n11.41am: Pound at four-month high\n\nA spate of bullish economic figures has pushed the pound to a four-month high.\n\nGross domestic product figures show that Labour has inherited an economy growing faster than expected, while construction output also surprised to the upside.\n\nThe pound rallied in response, as the markets began to wonder if the Bank of England intends to delay anticipated interest rate cuts.\n\n\"After all, cutting rates is something a central bank does to stimulate a lackluster economy, not grease the wheels for one already moving ahead,\" stated Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.\n\nMould added: \"That said, momentum could easily lose pace, particularly if the jobs market weakens and sticky inflation causes consumers to stay cautious on spending.\"\n\nIG data shows that rate cut expectations have been trimmed slightly, although a 25-basis-point move lower is still widely favoured in September.\n\n10.53am: Hargreaves warns of diluted investor rights under new listing regime\n\nThe Financial Conduct Authority today announced an overhaul of the UK listing regime, aimed at making London's struggling capital markets a more attractive place for global businesses.\n\nBut Tom Lee, head of trading proposition at Hargreaves Lansdown, warned that certain measures being implemented by the FCA could harm shareholders.\n\nWhile \"a successful listings regime which supports our home market is essential,\" Lee said that \"making the UK an attractive place to list has to be balanced with rights for shareholders and ensuring that the quality of the market is not diluted.\"\n\nUnder the new listing rules coming into effect at the end of the month, listed companies will not require shareholder approval on significant or related-party transactions. They will also have more flexibility around enhanced voting rights.\n\n\"We have been concerned that the plan to remove shareholder votes on significant and related-party transactions would dilute investors' rights,\" said Lee. \"We will watch closely as these new rules embed.\"\n\nOn the bright side, Lee noted that retail access to primary and secondary listings will be enhanced under the new rules.\n\n\"The demand from retail investors to buy into the equities market is there, and regulatory change should support this demand.\n\n\"Boosting retail investment on the stock exchange will have wider market benefits, providing depth and liquidity, as well as boosting interest in investment with the wider public, unlocking further capital for UK-listed companies.\"\n\n10.01am: FCA overhauls UK listing standards\n\nThe Financial Conduct Authority has unveiled the biggest overhaul of UK listing requirements in decades, aimed at rejuvenating London's flailing capital markets.\n\nThe primary goal of the overhaul is to make it easier and more attractive for companies to list their shares in the UK, with the biggest change being the scrapping of Britain's two-tier listing structure.\n\nHistorically, Listings have been divided into primary and secondary segments, with the latter having stricter reporting standards.\n\nA single category called 'commercial companies' will replace this structure when the rules into into effect at the end of this month.\n\nKey changes include removing the need for shareholder votes on significant or related party transactions and allowing flexibility around enhanced voting rights.\n\nA more detailed breakdown of the changes is available here.\n\n9.30am: Water companies buoy market after Ofwat review\n\nMore on the water sector where share price reactions suggest a bullet had been dodged especially by SouthWest Water owner Pennon.\n\nIts share price is up by a thumping 6.3% to 658p.with Severn Trent up 2.7% at 2,687p, and United Utilities 2.3% higher at 1,090p\n\nIndeed, Severn Trent and United Utilities are Footsie's biggest gainers after Ofwat's latest decision on price rises between 2025 and 2030.\n\nMidlands-focused Severn Tent had asked for a \u00a3144 rise over the five years, but got \u00a393 (23%). United Utilities gets a \u00a394 rise (21%) while Pennon's South West Water arm gets a \u00a364 (13%) rise. All exclude inflation.\n\nOfwat said in total, an average bill will rise by \u00a319 a year and pay for \u00a388 billion of spending by the sector of which \u00a335 billion will be directed towards fewer sewage spills and better water quality, including \u00a310 billion for storm overflows.\n\nFootsie up 18 at 8,211.\n\n8.55am: The morning so far\n\nThe FTSE 100 shifted to and fro when trading commenced this Thursday, but it ultimately looks to be heading in the right direction.\n\nAs of 8.55am, the blue-chip index was trading 15 points higher at 8,208, supported by a raft of bullish economic announcements.\n\nGDP figures show that the economy grew by 1.4% year on year in May, outstripping the expected growth rate of 1.2% and doubling April's 0.7% gain.\n\nMonth on month, gross domestic product grew by 0.4%, an upside surprise following a zero-growth period in April, though the data still shows \"significant room for improvement under the incoming Labour government\", according to Rob Morgan, chief investment analyst at Charles Stanley (LSE:CAY).\n\nConstruction output, meanwhile, advanced by 0.8% year-on-year in May, marking a strong rebound from a 2.1% drop in the prior month and exceeding market expectations of a 1.9% decline.\n\nWater firms Severn Trent PLC (LSE:SVT) and United Utilities Group PLC (LSE:UU.) were the two biggest FTSE 100 risers of the morning.\n\nThis follows regulator Ofwat's latest draft determination, which sets the pricing and investment agenda for British water firms.\n\nOn average, water bills are set to rise 21% by 2030, Ofwat declared.\n\nThough this is less than what the water firms wanted, Severn Trent is higher following a decent first-quarter financial update.\n\nElsewhere in company news, Dr Martens has published a bare trading update prior to its AGM meeting this morning.\n\nThe classic British footwear company said that \"trading since the start of this financial year has been in line with expectations and our guidance for (financial 2025) remains unchanged\".\n\n8.43am: Construction output grows\n\nConstruction output in the UK advanced by 0.8% year-on-year in May 2024, according to the Office for National Statistics.\n\nThis marks a significant rebound from a 2.1% drop in the prior month and exceeded market expectations of a 1.9% decline.\n\nIt was the first expansion in construction output since January.\n\nThe increase was driven by a 7.7% rise in repair and maintenance activity, up from 6.4% in April, while new work saw a smaller decline of 4% compared to 9.4% previously.\n\n8.30am: Dr Martens targets growth in US direct-to-customer market\n\nDr Martens has published a bare trading update prior to its AGM meeting this morning.\n\nThe classic British footwear company said that \"trading since the start of this financial year has been in line with expectations and our guidance for (financial 2025) remains unchanged\".\n\nThe first quarter is typically \"the smallest period of our financial year, representing the end of the Spring/Summer season\", said the group, adding that the current financial year will be weighted to the second half.\n\n\"The upcoming Autumn/Winter 24 season remains a key focus,\" said Dr Martens, with detailed trading plans currently being implemented.\n\nDr Martens is targeting target positive direct-to-customer growth in the US in the second half of the current financial year.\n\n\"Work on our cost action plan is ongoing and we will provide a detailed update at our first half results in November.\"\n\nShares were up 1.6% in opening exchanges.\n\n8.25am: Blue chips wobble\n\nMarkets dipped their toes into the red in opening trades despite pre-market data pointing to a strong start.\n\nThe FTSE 100 is currently a handful of points lower at 8,191, with Rolls-Royce Group plc, BAE Systems PLC (LSE:BA.) and Antofagasta plc among the worst performers.\n\n8.10am: Labour has inherited improving economy, GDP data shows\n\nBritain's economy grew by 1.4% year on year in May, outstripping the expected growth rate of 1.2% and doubling April's 0.7% gain.\n\nMonth on month, gross domestic product grew by 0.4%, an upside surprise following a zero-growth period in April.\n\n\"This should be a boon for the new Labour government with growth now likely to outstrip the OBR's 2024 GDP forecasts, partially offsetting some of the projected increase in interest rate costs,\" said Deutsche Bank's chief UK economist Sanjay Raja.\n\nAccording to Rob Morgan, chief investment analyst at Charles Stanley (LSE:CAY): \"The UK's economic scorecard shows significant room for improvement under the incoming Labour government.\n\n\"The UK economy has been subdued coming out of the pandemic, an energy crisis, and a cost-of-living crisis which has been very difficult for UK consumers.\n\n\"However, tepid growth now looks to be warming up heading into the second half of the year.\"\n\nMorgan said today's GDP data \"illustrates we are in the midst of a very gentle upswing in activity following a slowdown in 2023\"\n\n7.59am: Thames Water bills to rise by \u00a399, barely half of what it sought\n\nOfwat will allow Thames Water to raise its annual bills by \u00a399 over the next five years, falling significantly below what the London and south east England water supplier wanted.\n\nOfwat made the announcement in its latest draft determination, which sets investment and pricing targets for Britain's water suppliers.\n\nThames Water was seeking a \u00a3191 bill rise to support investment in creaking infrastructure.\n\nDespite slashing Thames Water's pricing wishes, Ofwat has outlined some strict expectations of the water supplier.\n\nOfwats expects Thames Water to deliver a 19% reduction in leakage, and 18% reduction in phosphorus and a full 50% reduction in pollution incidents from average 2020-23 levels.\n\nOver 2025-30, Thames Water should deliver a 66% reduction in water supply interruptions and a 55% reduction in internal sewer flooding events from 2020-23 levels.\n\nThames Water is expected to deliver \u00a316.9 billion worth in total infrastructure improvements.\n\n7.35am: Annual water bills to rise 21% by 2030\n\nWater bills are expected to rise by \u00a319 per year to fund investment into Britain's ageing infrastructure, Ofwat has declared.\n\nIt means the average household water bill across the UK will increase from \u00a3441 to \u00a3535 by 2030, an increase of 21%.\n\nThis is below the average asked of Ofwat by Thames Water, United Utilities and other major water firms.\n\nOfwat laid out the plans in the regulator's draft determination, which sets the agenda for all UK water firms over the next five years.\n\nIt has proposed total investment spending to increase to \u00a388 billion between 2025 and 2030, a 50% increase from the previous draft determination.\n\nOfwat expects water companies to triple investment in new infrastructure and resources \"to improve the environment, resilience and service\".\n\n\"We expect increased investment to be reflected in better performance,\" said Ofwat.\n\n\"We set each company targets for up to 23 areas of performance which are important to customers.\n\n\"If companies do not meet their targets each year, they will face automatic penalties, reflected in reduced bills. But there are incentives to beat the targets, and good performance will be rewarded.\"\n\nSouth West Water owner Pennon and United Utilities said they will review Ofwat's draft determination and will respond by 28 August.\n\n7.10am: Markets to bounce higher\n\nThe FTSE 100 looks set to move high when trading commences today following a bullish session on Wednesday, when the blue-chip index finished 53 points higher at 8,193.\n\nMarkets were buoyed by a strong performance from airline and utilities stocks, as well an afternoon rally from Ladbrokes-owner Entain PLC (LSE:ENT) in the run up to England's victory over Netherlands in the Euro semi-finals.\n\nBetter-than-expected GDP figures released this morning should offer some support.\n\nThe economy expanded 1.4% year on year in May, beating expectations of a 1.2% expansion. Month on month, the economy rose 0.4% after not moving a blip in April.\n\nOn the company news front, recruiter Hays PLC (LSE:HAS) reports its full-year earnings amid a lukewarm time for City recruiters.\n\nWater firms are on tenterhooks as Ofwat prepares to rule on their five-year investment and pricing plans in the latest draft determination.", "source": {"uri":

It had reported a profit of \u00a3118.8million last year.\n\n'We continued to see challenging market conditions throughout the group in Q2 and we experienced a softening in activity levels through the quarter, particularly in terms of new jobs registered and number of interviews,' CEO Nicholas Kirk said in a statement.\n\nPageGroup said converting interviews into accepted offers is the most significant area of challenge for the group.\n\n07:02Thames Water pins hopes on Ofwat\n\nThames Water has said its efforts to raise new equity to ensure its survival continue but there would be no conclusion until the regulator made a final decision on how much it could raise bills for the next five years.\n\nBritain's biggest water supplier is struggling under \u00a316billion of debt. It was thrown into crisis in March when its owners said they would not provide a \u00a3500million equity lifeline.\n\nIts liquidity of \u00a31.8billion is sufficient to fund operations until the end of May 2025, it told shareholders.\n\nBritain's new government could need to nationalise the company if it cannot secure new funding.\n\nThe crisis in Britain's privatised water industry has deepened this year as sewage releases into rivers and seas have become much more frequent after companies failed to invest enough in crumbling infrastructure.\n\nInvestors in Thames Water said in March that the business was 'uninvestible'.\n\nThames Water wants to hike customer bills by 40 per cent, excluding inflation, over 2025-2030 to pay for infrastructure improvements and reduce sewage spills, but it needs the regulator Ofwat to agree.\n\nOfwat will make an initial decision on Thursday before a final determination is due in December.\n\n\"Following the draft determination and our response to Ofwat we will be engaging with potential investors and creditors to seek new equity and to extend our liquidity runway,' Thames Water said.\n\n'Any equity process is not expected to conclude until after the final determination.'\n\n06:59No rate cuts until we beat inflation, says departing Bank of England hawk Jonathan Haskel\n\nInterest rates should be left on hold until there is more evidence inflation is back under control, a key Bank of England official said yesterday.\n\nJonathan Haskel's comments are the first from any member of the Bank's nine-member Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) after a period of purdah since the general election was called.\n\nRates remains at a 16-year-high of 5.25 per cent and markets expect it to be cut at next month's MPC meeting after inflation fell to its 2 per cent target.\n\nNo rate cuts until we beat inflation, says Bank of EnglandThe bank rate remains at a 16-year-high of 5.25% and markets expect it to be cut at next month's MPC meeting after inflation fell to its 2% target.This is Money\n\n06:59Consumer spending slips\n\nConsumer spending suffered last month as wet and cold weather contributed to a fall in retail sales volumes, marking the latest sign of weaker UK economic performance.\n\nBarclays data published on Tuesday shows spending on its credit and debit cards fell by 0.6 per cent in annual terms in June - the first drop since February 2021. It linked the fall to cool weather at the start of month.\n\nKaren Johnson, head of retail at Barclays, said: 'Once again, our data demonstrates the undeniable impact that unseasonable weather can have on consumer spending.\n\n'The sluggish demand at the start of June even caused some fashion brands to adjust their sales schedules, although I was pleased to see that the situation has since improved with the arrival of sunnier days.'\n\nSimilarly, the British Retail Consortium cited chilly weather as its data showed a 0.2 per cent drop in sales values in June compared with a year earlier, after a 0.7 per cent rise in May.\n\nThe readings chimed with other signs of slowing growth, including business surveys, after the economy rebounded in the first quarter from a recession in the second half of 2023.\n\nImproving economic growth is the top priority of new Prime Minister Keir Starmer.\n\nBarclays said spending at supermarkets fell for the first time in two years last month but there were reasons for optimism.\n\n'While June's data suggests a weak month, the view looking ahead to the second half of the year, as we see it, is one of falling interest rates, growing real incomes, and increasing confidence among consumers to spend and businesses to invest,' said Barclays' chief UK economist Jack Meaning.\n\nAccountants KPMG, sponsor of the BRC's retail sales survey, said the economic environment was improving but said many retailers were still struggling.\n\nRetail sales volumes, excluding petrol, remain slightly below their pre-pandemic level, according to official data.", "source": {"uri": "thisismoney.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "This is Money"}, "authors": [{"uri": "live_commentary@thisismoney.co.uk", "name": "Live Commentary", "type":

During the hot summer of 1995, the managing director of Yorkshire Water, Trevor Newton, achieved notoriety when he urged customers to use less of his company's product by issuing a motivational message: \"I personally have not had a bath or shower for three months.\"\n\nAfter a round of jokes about \"the filthy rich\" - because megabucks pay for water company bosses was also in the headlines in those days - Newton invited the press to watch him washing with a flannel and bowl. It later emerged he had been popping out of Yorkshire for a soak at his parents' and in-laws' homes.\n\nThe serious aspect of the farce was that, just as now, the public was outraged by the mismatch between rewards for investors and the standard of service being provided by a privatised utility. Yorkshire had just paid a \u00a350m dividend to shareholders and yet the city of Bradford was at risk of running dry. A new grid was behind schedule and the company was reduced to transporting water by tanker through the Dales. \"Public anger exploded,\" recalled Sir Ian Byatt, the first head of the Office of Water Services, or Ofwat, the regulatory body created at privatisation in 1989, in his account of his career.\n\nThe saga also underlined the rotten state of the water infrastructure, the reason given for privatisation in the first place. The UK was regarded as the \"dirty man of Europe\" on account of pollution on beaches and in rivers. Spending by the industry on overhauling its pipes and sewage-treatment works had been falling from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s and now the UK had to meet new European Community standards on pollution.\n\nMargaret Thatcher's administration, which had already privatised British Telecom and British Gas, decided only private capital and stock market ownership could deliver improvements. \"Much emotive nonsense was talked along the lines of, 'Look, she's even privatising the rain that falls from the heavens',\" wrote Thatcher in her memoirs. \"I used to retort that the rain may come from the Almighty but he did not send the pipes, plumbing and engineering to go with it.\"\n\nMore than three decades later, that same infrastructure requires a big upgrade, with bills to soar when Ofwat outlines the regime for the next five years on Thursday. In the meantime, the 10 English and Welsh water and wastewater companies have paid \u00a378bn in dividends since 1989, and accumulated \u00a360bn in debt. Meanwhile, the biggest of the lot, Thames Water, is at risk of temporary renationalisation. Only three of the 10 are still listed on the stock market. Meanwhile, the industry has become synonymous with mismanagement, corporate greed and pollution, as a string of sewage spills, water leaks and hefty fines led to deep public anger. How did we get here?\n\nTo make privatisation happen in December 1989 - a month after the fall of the Berlin Wall - the government cancelled all the long-term debt owed by the previous water authorities and injected cash into the new companies as a \"green dowry\". Such exercises meant the net proceeds to the Treasury, even after selling the companies for a total of \u00a37.6bn, was roughly zero.\n\nThere was, though, the usual quick win for investors in the stock market listings: shares in the 10 companies rose 20% on average within a month. Half the small investors, encouraged to buy with the slogan \"You could be an H2Owner\", took their profits and sold their shares within a year. It was a period of corporate exuberance, lampooned by Harry Enfield's \"Loadsamoney\" character.\n\nBut extra spending did arrive. Investment roughly doubled in the four years after the sellout, from \u00a33bn a year to \u00a36bn. Privatisation fans could also argue that the discipline of a stock market listing, plus a smack from an independent regulator, could force underperformers to improve. After Yorkshire's shambles in 1995, Ofwat sent in investigators, which led to a management clear-out. By the end of decade, the company was top of the class for performance. Byatt also proposed that Yorkshire should return \u00a340m to customers in the form of price cuts and \"after some discussion, it concurred\".\n\nBut it was immediately obvious that the companies had been sold far too cheaply. Customers' bills went up by a third in the first five years on the assumption at sale that the companies would need ready access to cash to fund the step-up in investment. Debt levels, it was thought originally, would comprise a maximum of only 35% of the value of the assets - the leverage, or gearing, ratio. The bond market, however, was willing to lend far greater sums to monopoly businesses with captive customers.\n\nAnd, strange as it may now sound, the regulator was keen to see financial gearing rise. The rationale was that savings from lower funding costs would be passed to customers in the form of lower bills. Ofwat's first five-yearly price review in 1994 slowed the bill rises imagined at privatisation; the second, in 1999, cut bills by an average of 12%.\n\nThe companies were happy to play the debt game. Some, flush with rising share prices and access to cheap capital, caught the diversification bug in the go-go 1990s. Thames won contracts to run water networks as far away as Indonesia and Chile. Welsh Water lost a packet by buying hotels and country clubs. In 2000, Anglian Water bought a construction company.\n\nThen there were the takeover games, which began when the government cancelled its golden shares in the 10 companies in 1995. Northumbrian Water was bought by Lyonnaise des Eaux of France. Scottish Power bought Southern Water. Enron of the US - before it crashed in scandalous style in 2001 - bought Wessex Water. Water companies were not allowed to buy one another, but some adopted the fashionable notion of \"multi utilities\" and bought regional electricity suppliers, which were privatised in 1990. North West Water bought its local supplier to become United Utilities and Welsh Water took over South Wales Electricity, restyling itself as Hyder.\n\nNone of this activity was slowed by a windfall tax on the privatised utilities, water included, imposed by the incoming Labour government in 1997. Thames, for example, was sold for \u00a3922m at privatisation but was valued by the stock market at \u00a32.9bn in July 1997; Severn Trent had risen from \u00a3849m to \u00a33bn.\n\nBy the end of that first decade, the privatised water sector was changed beyond recognition. This newspaper reflected in 1999 on \"the mixed effects of water privatisation\". On one hand, too much of the extra profits had been \"dissipated in ill-advised diversifications, excess dividends and unearned mega-increases in boardroom pay\". On the other, \"a lot of money was invested in improving the infrastructure, so that we now have much improved drinking water\".\n\nThe deal-making kept coming. Thames was bought in 2000 by the German utility RWE, which paid \u00a34.3bn in cash and assumed \u00a32.5bn of debt. The takeover price of \u00a312.15 a share represented a fivefold increase from the 240p at which all 10 water companies were sold in 1989. Foreign capital continued to chase UK utilities and, in the spirit of times, that was seen as an excellent thing. New Labour was not going to mess with the model.\n\nWhat followed was a critical turning point. In the early 2000s, Railtrack, after a series of horrendous fatal accidents on the railways, was forced into receivership and turned into Network Rail. Then British Energy, owner of the bulk of the country's nuclear plants, had to be bailed out.\n\nBoth events caused political panic, with the City doing its best to stoke fears that foreign capital would evaporate if owners were seen to be short-changed by government action (the unmerited allegation at Railtrack). In the wings, the water sector was still complaining bitterly that the supposed toughness of Ofwat's 1999 price review left it with insufficient incentives to invest.\n\nThe result was two actions that, with hindsight, accelerated financial risk-taking. First, in 2002, Ofwat extended the water companies' operating licences, which were due to expire in 2014. In their place, 25-year rolling licences were granted. \"The longer notice period will enable companies and their investors to plan ahead more securely,\" said Philip Fletcher, the late head of Ofwat. That was the hope, but the reform also insulated underperformers from any medium-term threat of being replaced.\n\nThen, in 2004, the next five-yearly price review was widely seen as a giveaway to the companies: bills were increased by 20%. Water was seen as even more attractive for investors.\n\nAt that point, takeover action went into overdrive. New buyers were not other utilities, but financial buyers - investment banks, infrastructure funds, pension funds. Macquarie's fateful \u00a38bn acquisition of Thames from RWE happened in 2006. So did the takeover of the parent of Anglian by a group of Canadian and Australian pension funds. In 2007, Southern Water fell to a consortium including JP Morgan Asset Management after a tussle with US investment bank Goldman Sachs. Kelda Group, the owner of Yorkshire Water, was bought by a consortium including Citigroup and HSBC.\n\nFormer regulators have pinpointed this period as one in which the game changed. Byatt wrote in his book A Regulator's Sign Off: Changing the Taps in Britain: \"Private equity infrastructure capital showed the hard face of capitalism, involving leveraged buyouts and short-term policies, namely high borrowing and high dividends, meriting widespread criticism for its lack of transparency and for its financial engineering.\"\n\nJonson Cox, who had spells running Yorkshire and Anglian before he was chair of Ofwat from 2012 until 2022, told a House of Lords committee soon after leaving the regulator: \"In the 2000s, investment banks began to realise that there was an opportunity to acquire the water company assets and to put significantly more leverage on to those capital structures. I was not at Ofwat at that time. I have disagreed with that approach and I think it is very unfortunate that it happened.\"\n\nInvestment banks created skewed incentives, he argued, and created \"the predisposition of thinking of water companies as financial assets\".\n\nShortly after Macquarie bought it, Thames embarked on a \"whole business securitisation\" in 2007 - a fundraising whose banal name belied its aggressive approach. A previously staid business of pipes and sewage treatment works was packaged into a complex corporate structure, with eight layers of ownership - including a subsidiary in the Cayman Islands, which allowed debt to be layered on debt, like the tiers in a wedding cake.\n\nSuddenly, leverage ratios of 50% or 60% went higher than 80% at some companies taken off the stock market. As Thames explained in 2018, this byzantine corporate structure let it borrow more, with the approval of the ratings agencies: \"A higher level of leverage is possible at an investment grade credit rating.\"\n\nMacquarie has defended its use of a whole business securitisation at Thames, saying it was \"very common\" at the time. \"It was a UK water utility product that was invented, advised and constructed by UK banks,\" Martin Bradley, the company's head of infrastructure, told Infrastructure Investor magazine last year.\n\nFor investors in Macquarie funds that cashed in via a staggered sale of Thames in 2017, he pointed to annual gross returns of 12%-13%, which he argued were in line with regulatory guidance in the 2005-09 period. \"There's nothing in our returns that I'm embarrassed about,\" Bradley argued.\n\nThe Australian bank has also defended its broader stewardship of Thames, saying the company \"undertook a record level of investment despite the returns allowed by Ofwat being reduced\".\n\nThe legacy of the sector's debt binge in the mid-2000s era lives on, however. Southern Water, which adopted a whole business securitisation in 2003, had to be rescued in 2021 in what now looks like a miniature version of the financial crisis now engulfing Thames. Controversially, the buyer at Southern was Macquarie, which injected \u00a31bn in new equity to recapitalise the business.\n\nIt was only belatedly that Ofwat woke up to the dangers of overborrowing. Powers to stop the payment of dividends if they would risk the company's financial resilience were introduced only last year.\n\nOne core question about the post-privatisation era is whether the gravitational shift from sensibly capitalised public companies on the stock market to heavily leveraged private entities contributed to the sector's woeful environmental record.\n\nIs it, for example, a coincidence that the two most heavily fined companies over the years - Thames and Southern - were also the two with the most aggressive financing structures?\n\nDebt, it should be said, has also been used for its original purpose of accelerating investment, complementing the portion funded from bills. Overall, post-privatisation investment has totalled \u00a3190bn. But the overuse of financial leverage, with the aim of maximising returns for shareholders, is undeniable.\n\nCurrent Ofwat chief executive, David Black, addressed the point last year when Thames' financial crisis became acute: \"For most companies, debt has been a prudent low-cost source of finance with low interest rates fixed for the long-term,\" he said. \"However, some companies borrowed too much, most obviously Thames Water. The risk for this - and for correcting this - belongs to the company and its shareholders.\"\n\nTherein lies one huge tension at the heart of the recent ruling from Ofwat on the companies' business plans for the next five years. Investment is needed on a massive scale and customers' bills are going up substantially, whatever happens. But will the regulator really make the worst debt addicts pay for their borrowing binges?", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri":

We'll get a firmer guide - maybe - after regulator Ofwat gives its verdict on all the English and Welsh water companies' business plans on Thursday. In the meantime, all we have to go on is this pre-election comment from Jonathan Reynolds, now the business secretary: \"I wouldn't want to see a nationalisation. I think there should be a solution that falls short of that.\"\n\nThat statement raises more questions than it answers, unfortunately. Which type of nationalisation would Labour not wish to see? A full-fat, permanent return to public ownership? Or also the temporary \"special administration\" variety in which Thames's balance sheet would be straightened out before a return to the private sector?\n\nIf Reynolds merely meant that permanent nationalisation is a bad idea, many of us would agree. The state's last grand adventure into building infrastructure, which is what water companies do, was the financial catastrophe called HS2. It is too easy to imagine a repeat in which over-worked departmental officials are given the runaround by sharp private sector contractors who would inevitably do much of the actual work at Thames. Customers might end up no better off.\n\nBut there is a problem if the Labour government is also signalling that it is reluctant to press the \"special admin\" button. The threat of special administration is surely essential in the current unstable position. It is one way to impose on Thames the solution that has always looked the simplest way out of the financial mess - a debt-for-equity swap in which shareholders are wiped out while bondholders, owed \u00a315.2bn collectively, take a hefty haircut.\n\nThames's current shareholders, as it happens, have already given up. They have written down the value of their stakes and declared the company to be \"uninvestable\". But that still leaves the bondholders, who are hoping to escape intact if Ofwat is sufficiently generous with its increases in bills.\n\nThe company's business plan involves a 44% rise over the next five years, which equates to 59% after inflation, to fund the bulk of a \u00a319.8bn investment programme. On that basis, Thames's management thinks it has a chance of raising \u00a33.25bn in fresh equity from new shareholders while also avoiding losses for lenders.\n\nCome on, though, a hike of 59% is extreme. Everybody knows bills have to rise meaningfully, but 59% would smell suspiciously like a case of billpayers bailing out bondholders by stealth. The cleaner outcome would be a debt write-down to bring the leverage ratio, currently 80%, to the 55%-60% level that regulators regard as financially resilient.\n\nIf Thames was towing, say, \u00a310bn of borrowings rather than \u00a315bn, the balance sheet would be transformed and the company would look a far more investable proposition. It would be a credible re-set moment. Thames would have financial breathing space while its new chief executive attempts the trickier task of improving the operational performance.\n\nWe'll see where Ofwat lands on bills, but Thursday's draft determination is just the start of the horse-trading and political lobbying before the final decision in December. It is why ministers should be careful about what they mean when talking about preferred outcomes. Do not rule out special administration: it may yet be needed to impose a debt-for-equity swap that would probably have happened already if Thames were listed on the stock market.\n\nIf Reynolds and co are scared of upsetting bondholders because the government is relying on some of the same source of capital to finance new energy infrastructure, they need to get over it. Financial markets are quite capable of viewing Thames for what it is - a special case of extreme financial engineering. On the right terms, they'll still show up for the windfarms and gigafactories.\n\nWorry instead about the fury of Thames customers if they are bounced into a stitch-up for the benefit of bondholders.", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

The announcement comes as South East Water remains under scrutiny by Ofwat, alongside Thames Water, for its financial vulnerability.\n\n\"If it is not possible to raise the additional liquidity, the group and therefore company would not have sufficient liquidity for the going concern period,\" the company's statement revealed. The firm mentioned that these talks are at an \"advanced\" stage and that its directors are optimistic about securing the necessary additional funds. However, a concrete agreement has yet to be finalised.\n\nThe company's statement also highlighted: \"The risk that the funding will not be received constitutes a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the group and company to continue as a going concern.\"\n\nSouth East Water's proposal includes a significant increase in spending to \u00a31.9 billion, partly funded by a 22% hike in customer bills, to ensure the maintenance and upgrade of its infrastructure. Despite these plans, the company's financial performance has shown some improvement, with pre-tax losses reduced to \u00a336 million for the year ending 31 March, compared to a \u00a374 million loss the previous year.\n\nCompounding its challenges, South East Water is also under investigation by Ofwat following prolonged water supply interruptions affecting thousands of customers in Kent and Sussex.

According to Environment Agency figures, there were 3.6m hours of spills in 2023, which is equal to about 400 years.\n\nNot a single river in England is in good overall health and iconic spots like Windermere in the Lake District have had sewage dumped in them.\n\nThe issue has sparked anger among the public and campaigners as water firms continue to pay huge bonuses to bosses and dividends to shareholders.\n\nThames Water this week said that it paid out \u00a3196million in dividends to its parent company and executive bonuses of \u00a3754,000 last year.\n\nToday's draft Ofwat ruling on business plans for the next five years is of particular importance to Thames Water, which needs to know whether it can hike bills by 44 per cent before it can hold formal talks with shareholders to raise fresh cash.\n\nIf it is unable to secure extra money, it could spark a major industrial crisis for the Government.\n\nMeanwhile, South East Water yesterday said that it needs more money from its shareholders.\n\nIt wants to hike customer bills by 22 per cent, and 'expects' to secure the extra funding but has not yet struck a deal, which raised concerns that it is at risk of collapse.\n\nOfwat's announcement will kick off six months of negotiations before a final decision in December.\n\nChairman faces fresh fury over railway job\n\nBacklash: International Distribution Services Chairman Keith William\n\nThe chairman of Royal Mail's owner faced a fresh backlash last night over its move to stop transporting post by rail.\n\nKeith Williams leads the board of International Distribution Services and is already under fire over plans to sell the business to a Czech billionaire for \u00a33.6billion.\n\nHe is now facing further criticism after Royal Mail said it would stop moving post by train in October.\n\nThis is because he is also chairman of Great British Railways Transition Team (GBRTT) and co-wrote a report on the future of railways with then-Transport Secretary Grant Shapps.\n\nThe GBRTT website declares: 'Growing rail freight is hugely important to the wider reform of the railway.' It adds that using rail 'delivers economic benefits across the country'.\n\nBut under Williams' leadership, Royal Mail is selling its 15 trains. This could prove awkward for rail minister Lord Hendy, chairman of Network Rail and Williams' deputy on the GBRTT board.\n\n'On behalf of rail freight, bring us the head of Keith Williams,' an industry source said. 'Wouldn't it be ironic if Lord Hendy's first job would be to sack his long-time friend from GBRTT.'\n\nThe DfT said: 'The economic and environmental potential of rail freight is significant.\n\n'The Government is committed to supporting its growth. Under plans to deliver the biggest overhaul of railways in a generation, Great British Railways will have a duty and targets to grow the use of freight.'\n\nDIY INVESTING PLATFORMSAJ BellAJ BellEasy investing and ready-made portfoliosLearn MoreLearn MoreHargreaves LansdownHargreaves LansdownFree fund dealing and investment ideasLearn MoreLearn Moreinteractive investorinteractive investorFlat-fee investing from \u00a34.99 per monthLearn MoreLearn MoreeToroeToroShare investing: 30+ million communityLearn MoreLearn MoreTrading 212Trading 212Free share dealing and no account feeLearn MoreLearn More\n\nAffiliate links: If you take out a product This is Money may earn a commission.

In an article in the New York Times, he said the Biden he met recently was not the Biden of 2010 -- \"he wasn't even the Joe Biden of 202 ... we are not going to win in November with this president\".\n\nBy contrast, former speaker Nancy Pelosi more cautiously said: \"It's up to the president to decide whether to run\", ignoring his insistence that he was determined to run. There is unusual interest in his speech to Nato leaders today, not for what he says about US support for Nato, but about how coherently he says it.\n\nIn Britain, our political leaders are more sensitive. The so-called men in suits, delivering unpalatable truths to untenable prime ministers, can make even the most recalcitrant leave office: witness Liz Truss's departure. Biden should have the humility to realise that he is a liability to his party, that he should yield to a better candidate. It would be the brave and honourable thing to do.\n\nOfwat, the water regulator, has today flexed its muscles by rejecting Thames Water's request for a 44 per cent increase in bills. It was right to do so. But the figure that was agreed, 23 per cent -- or \u00a399 -- over the next five years, still represents an insult to customers. They might expect to receive a good service for their money. Instead their cash seems to be propping up a struggling business in an industry that is still dishing out billions of pounds of dividends to shareholders and bonuses to executives.\n\nThe quid pro quo for this increase must be improved service and cleaner waterways. Ofwat was also correct to make the point today that Thames Water's customers cannot be expected to pay for debts racked up by poor management. The company has accrued \u00a316 billion of debt, despite having been sold in 1989 with no debt at all. The almighty mess that Thames Water has landed itself in is the company's, not customers', responsibility to fix. The special measures must work and be seen to work. Thames Water executives would be fooling themselves if they believe customers, politicians or the public will accept anything less.\n\nThe Art Fund Museum Award has gone to the Young V&A, the most joyous museum in the world, which just celebrated its first birthday.

Give us a stonking price rise or Thames Water is \"uninvestable\" and, well, nobody will ever lend us a penny ever again, and you'll be sorry. The company's CEO did not put it quite like that in his begging letter to Ofwat, the water regulator, ahead of this week's pricing proposal for the next five years, but the meaning is clear enough.\n\nHe wants forgiveness for past sins (of his predecessors) and a price regime to turn from uninvestable to investable at the expense of captive customers who have already paid once. By \"investable\" he means terms for new money which allow attractive monopoly profits. You have to admire his chutzpah.\n\nThis high-stakes poker game has a way to run yet, and Mr Weston is essentially saying that unless he gets his 59 per cent (plus inflation) rise in London's water bills by 2030, nobody will put up the billions needed to clean up from the rivers to the sea. This really is so much hogwash.\n\nThames has been systematically destabilised over many years. A decade ago its balance sheet was already too weak to support the financing of the Thames supersewer, as the private equity owners were busy replacing risk equity with debt, taking large dividends and minimising capital investment. Today the equity is worth only option value and the \u00a315 billion of debt threatens to overwhelm the business. Mr Weston reckons it runs out of money a (curiously precise) 11 months from now.\n\nNow the equity is gone, the next in line are the bondholders and lenders. They should take a severe haircut for lending to an unstable business. Of course, the individuals in the banks who authorised such poor lending will have long since moved on, leaving a different department to pick up the pieces. The lenders will argue that forcing losses onto them will jeopardise Thames' and the City's credit standing. They know that it won't. Converting half (say) of that \u00a315bn into equity would transform the balance sheet, and plenty of banks - perhaps even the same ones - would rush in with fresh capital.

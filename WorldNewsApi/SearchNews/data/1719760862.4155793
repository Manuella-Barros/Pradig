The television duo, who share a 22-year-old son named Jack, shocked fans over the weekend when they announced their separation after nearly 14 years of marriage. Now, 35-year-old Rylan, who has previously presented This Morning alongside his close friend Ruth, 64, is said to be organising an action-packed summer for his TV colleague to lift her spirits.

It's been a really tough time for her as her whole life has now changed. \"She no longer has Eamonn and their son Jack is all grown up living his life - she feels a little lost. But she's got a very strong group of friends who have all been there for her and will support her - with the main person being Rylan.\" The source emphasised that the former 'X Factor' contestant isn't looking to pick sides but is eager to see Ruth enjoy herself, especially after the strain of caring for Eamonn, 64, who has been dealing with a shoulder injury following major back surgery in 2022. They added: \"Rylan was close to both Ruth and Eamonn and owes them both a lot so he doesn't want to take sides. But he and Ruth have always got on and love a party so Rylan has promised to take Ruth away this summer and make her go wild. \"She's had a tough few years because of looking after Eamonn and also caring for her mum so he feels she deserves it, he's desperate to take Ruth clubbing in Ibiza! \". This was shared just a day after Eamonn expressed his gratitude towards the public following the announcement of their separation. While on GB News, he said: \"Just before we move on, we'd just like to thank people for your support for Ruth and I over the last few days as to the news of our separation. Your support for both of us is very much appreciated.\" The Belfast-born TV star Eamonn has now spoken out about a major issue that was a possible cause of his marriage breakdown. He has told how the couple didn't see eye to eye over their future, as he wants to return to live in his native Northern Ireland but Ruth doesn't want to, reports the Mirror.", "summary": "This Morning stars Rylan and Ruth have been friends for years", "url": "https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/showbiz-news/rylan-clark-says-wants-take-29258042", "image": "https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article24860164.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_RuthandRylan.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:14:09", "author": "Phoebe Jobling", "authors": ["Phoebe Jobling"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.36}

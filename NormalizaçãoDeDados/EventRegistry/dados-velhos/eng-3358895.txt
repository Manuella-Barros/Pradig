The rate of electricity should be one and equal across the country like the rate of train fare. You go to any state, be it Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra or any state of north, the rate of train fare is same. Similarly, the Centre and the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) should fix an equal rate of electricity,\" he argued.\n\nNitish also said that Bihar had been raising the demand of one rate across the nation at every meeting/ conference of energy ministers for the past few years. But the Centre was yet to consider over it.\n\nCM further lauded the efforts of Bihar State Power (Holding) Corporation Limited (BSPHCL) officials, specially its CMD Pratyay Amrit, for setting up the country's first all-woman power grid sub-station in Patna. \"It's matter of great happiness that one power grid (Karbigahia) in Patna is being manned only by women engineers and technicians. It will definitely raise the morale of women,\" he said and added the state government has already taken several steps for woman empowerment including 50% quota in panchayat bodies and 35% reservation in all government jobs.\n\nCM also handed over scroll of honours to all 11 woman employees of Karbigahia grid sub-station which supplies electricity to major establishments in the state capital. Assistant electrical engineer Monica Kumari, who leads the team of woman technocrats at the grid station, was called first for receiving the scroll of honour from the CM. Energy minister Vijendra Prasad Yadav too lauded the power corporation's efforts to set up all-woman grid. \"Its first in the country. No other state has such power grid being manned by only woman staff,\" he said.\n\nDeputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi said the state government has fixed a target of connecting all habitation with electricity by the end December 2017 and all household by December 2018. \"In the third phase, we will ensure electricity to all agricultural fields. Around 8 lakh farmers in the state will be provided electricity in next five years.

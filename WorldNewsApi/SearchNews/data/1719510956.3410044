The network announced that the series is \u201ccurrently filming in Montana\u201d and \u201cslated to return in November.\u201d Yee, and may I add, haw. Why Did Kevin Costner Leave Yellowstone? Decider\u2019s Nicole Gallucci recently did a tremendous job of breaking down all the messy, messy drama surrounding Kevin Costner and Yellowstone: After Yellowstone Season 5, Part 1 wrapped, explosive Yellowstone reports suggested that creator Taylor Sheridan and star/EP Kevin Costner were feuding. In May 2023, fans learned Costner would be leaving the Yellowstone franchise after Season 5, and he reportedly wouldn\u2019t return for Season 5, Part 2 unless he approved of John Dutton\u2019s final storyline. In June 2023, Sheridan entered the chat, telling The Hollywood Reporter he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by Costner\u2019s exit but adding, \u201cI don\u2019t do fuck-you car crashes\u2026 Whether [Dutton\u2019s fate] inflates [Costner\u2019s] ego or insults is collateral damage that I don\u2019t factor in with regard to storytelling.\u201d In September 2023, People reported that when asked if he\u2019d be receiving a salary for the second half of Season 5, Costnery detailed struggles experienced while negotiating, saying, \u201cI will probably go to court over it.\u201d Costner gave a more hopeful update on his potential return in an April 2024 interview with Entertainment Tonight, saying, \u201cI\u2019d like to be able to do it but we haven\u2019t been able to\u2026I thought I was going to make seven [seasons] but right now we\u2019re at five. So how it works out \u2014 I hope it does \u2014 but they\u2019ve got a lot of different shows going on. Maybe it will. Maybe this will circle back to me. If it does and I feel really comfortable with [it], I\u2019d love to do it.\u201d Costner revealed that production delays led to his exit during a recent interview with GQ. As Samantha Nungesser wrote on Decider, \u201cproduction delays due to the dual Hollywood strikes and COVID along with scheduling conflicts made it difficult for Costner to remain on board for the second half of Season 5 \u2014 especially since he was set to direct, co-write and star in the new Western Horizon.\u201d \u201cWe very rarely started when we said we would and we didn\u2019t finish when we said we would,\u201d Costner told GQ in regards to filming Yellowstone. \u201cAnd I was okay with that. I really was. I was okay with it, but it wasn\u2019t a trend that could continue for me.\u201d Costner\u2019s potential involvement in the final episodes of the fifth season, and the fate of John Dutton, remain shrouded in uncertainty. It\u2019s a mystery the actor himself doesn\u2019t know the answer to. \u201d love that character. I love that world. I am a person that is very script-oriented. And if the scripts aren\u2019t there now, I need to know what I am,\u201d he told GQ. \u201cI want to make sure that the character lines up with what\u2019s important to me too. And that\u2019s pretty simple. That\u2019s just between, again, Taylor [Sheridan] and myself. Can we ever get there? I don\u2019t know.\u201d Paramount Network released a statement to GQ regarding Costner\u2019s exit. \u201cKevin has been a big part of Yellowstone\u2019s success,\u201d the company said. \u201cWhile we had hoped that we would continue working with him, unfortunately, we could not find a window that worked for him, all the other talent, and our production needs in order to move forward together. We respect that Kevin has prioritized his new film series and we wish him the best.\u201d Will There Be A Season 6 Of Yellowstone? In May 2023, it was confirmed that Yellowstone Season 5 would be the show\u2019s final season, which means a sixth season likely won\u2019t happen, with or without Costner. Two new spinoffs \u2014 currently titled 1944 and 2024 \u2014 are, however, in the works. No plot details for 1944 or 2024 are available, but Variety reports that 2024 is expected to begin airing following the conclusion of Yellowstone, with the show featuring \u201cnew cast members and locations with some crossover characters as well.\u201d This is the series that could potentially include Matthew McConaughey, who\u2019s been rumored to star in a Yellowstone spinoff since April 2023. Yellowstone star Cole Hauser, who plays Rip on the series, also teased a potential future project with his co-star Kelly Reilly, who portrays his wife Beth Dutton. \u201cI know that there\u2019s some stuff on the horizon when it comes to Taylor [Sheridan]\u2019s ideas for Kelly Reilly and myself and some of the other cast,\u201d Hauser told Country Living in an April 2024 interview. \u201cI\u2019m excited to see where he goes creatively with that but right now it\u2019s just, let\u2019s finish strong; let\u2019s do the best we can.\u201d When Does Kevin Costner\u2019s Horizon: An American Saga Hit Theaters? Kevin Costner\u2019s multi-part Western movie Horizon: An American Saga \u2014 which he starred in, directed, co-wrote, and produced \u2014 is scheduled to premiere in theaters on June 28, with Part 2 releasing on August 16.

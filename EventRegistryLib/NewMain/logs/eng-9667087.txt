The singer's opening acts consist of Rag 'n' Bone Man, GAYLE and DJ and producer KidCutUp.\n\nTickets\n\nWe're unsure as to how, considering Pink's Summer Carnival has become somewhat a viral phenomenon, but there are still a few tickets available to her Dublin gigs available to purchase here.\n\nSince the Summer Carnival 2024 tour commenced on June 7, Pink's setlist has remained largely unchanged.\n\nBefore coming to the Aviva Stadium, the singer's latest gig was at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London on June 16. The setlist consisted of the following 22 songs as well as a couple of interludes.\n\nThere is no bike or car parking around Dublin's Aviva Stadium for security reasons, and there're limited spaces available in commercial car parks nearby.\n\nDublin Bus routes that will be operating a full service, however, are the 4, 7, 7a, 39a, 46a, 145 and 155.\n\nThe stadium's a good 30 to 40-minute walk from the nearest Luas stop, whereas Lansdowne Road Dart station is less than a minute's walk from the south of the Aviva Stadium.\n\nAdditional Info\n\nPer MCD Productions, no early queuing is permitted. A limited quantity of early entry pitch packages were sold, these ticket holders will be granted access shortly before doors open at 5pm.\n\nAn Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and security will be on patrol around the area, and are prepared to turn anyone who arrives at the venue early without an early entry ticket away.\n\nBags of an A4 size or smaller are permitted in Aviva Stadium.

The much loved pop superstar, whose real name is Alecia Beth Moore, is known for her high energy, carnival party-esque aerial acrobatics, dance routines, and vibrant costume change.\n\nSince her debut in 2000, Pink has released 8 studio albums, one greatest hits album, sold more than 140 million album equivalents worldwide, has had 15 singles in the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart (four at number one) and has sold out stadiums all over the world. She has received three Grammy Awards, been nominated for 21, won one Daytime Emmy Award, seven MTV Video Music Awards, including the 2017 Vanguard Award, two MTV Europe Awards, two People's Choice Awards, was named Billboard's Woman of the Year in 2013, and received The Brits Outstanding Contribution To Music Award in 2019.\n\nSo, if you are headed to the Aviva Stadium for one of Pink's sold-out shows, keep reading to find out everything you need to know.\n\nPink takes to the Aviva Stadium as part of her Summer Carnival on June 20th and June 21st.\n\nUnfortunately tickets for both concerts are sold out, but if you are lucky you may nab one on resale on ticketmaster.ie. Buy tickets from accredited sources only.\n\nDoors open at 5pm, with the show expected to start at 6pm.\n\nJoining Pink will be Rag'n'Bone Man, GAYLE, and DJ and producer KidCutUp.\n\nOrganisers have said fans should allow for extra travel time to and from the venue. As traffic and parking delays are inevitable, you are encouraged to walk, cycle, use public transport and private coach services.\n\nBy Luas: The stadium is a fair walk from the nearest Luas stop. It's about a 30- 40-minute walk from Ranelagh, Charlemont, Harcourt, St Stephen's Green, Dawson and Trinity on the Green Line.\n\nBy train: Lansdowne Road Dart station is less than a minute's walk from the southern end of the stadium. There will be large crowds entering and exiting the stadium at the same time, so plan accordingly. Extra dart services will be running.\n\nIrish Rail has advised those travelling to and from these events to plan carefully. Customers are urged to allow extra time for your journey, as high volumes of passengers will probably cause delays. People not attending these events have been asked to avoid these routes during event times. As part of a Garda event plan for big events at the Aviva Stadium, Grand Canal Dock Station will be closed at the end of the concerts.\n\nBy bus: The Dublin Bus routes that will be operating a full service nearest to the Aviva Stadium are the 4, 7, 7a, 39a, 46a, 145 and 155.\n\nBy car: There is no bike or car parking at the stadium on concert days for security reasons. There are, however, commercial car parks around the city, such as Claremont Parking or Q-Park, but spaces are limited. If you're travelling from outside the county and have a friend with a space in their driveway within the M50, that could be a good shout.\n\nSuggested locations for taxi drop off are the junction off Pembroke Road/Northumberland Road or the junction of Tritonville Road and Herbert Road depending on which colour road your ticket is for.\n\n[ Pink: Hurts 2B Human review - Skews a little too safe to pack a real punch ]\n\nAccording to the singer's recent concert in Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London, here is a snippet of what fans can expect:\n\nI'm Not Dead (Snippet as a part of nightly \"guess that tune\" game with pianist)\n\nMake You Feel My Love (Bob Dylan cover) (P!nk played the piano)\n\nUnder 16s must be accompanied by an adult over 25, and standing tickets are available to people aged 14 or over. No under 16s will be allowed on the pitch unless accompanied by an adult.\n\nDon't bring a bag unless absolutely necessary, as you'll be patted down and searched while everyone else is fast-tracked through security. Any bag must be smaller than a sheet of A4 paper and there are no storage facilities on site. Banned items include umbrellas, large-lens professional cameras, flagpoles, selfie sticks, sticks for banners, anything that could be used as a weapon, bottles, glass vessels, cans, flasks, frisbees, illegal substances, scooters, skateboards or other skates, laser devices, prams or pushchairs, inflatable or folding chairs, suitcases, laptops, illegal merchandise, hampers and cool boxes, air horns, and all animals except service dogs and guide dogs.\n\nContact MCD productions at access@mcd.ie for accessible parking and information about wheelchair access to the venue and accessible seating.\n\nYes, but only with a smartphone or small digital camera. Professional cameras with a detachable lens and any other recording equipment are banned.\n\nThursday should be dry, with a slight chance of rain and some sun, and temperatures between 12-17 degrees. Friday however is giving rain in the evening time, with temperatures between 15-18 degrees.\n\nThe show will take place rain, hail or shine though, so keep an eye on the ever-changing Irish weather forecast and dress accordingly. Think wellies, boots or runners, layers, raincoats/ponchos and sun cream. But remember - no umbrellas.", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviva_Stadium",

The US star arrives in the capital tonight to deliver the first of two shows at the Aviva Stadium.\n\nRenowned as one of the world's top live entertainers, Pink promises to thrill fans with her trademark high-energy performances featuring aerial acrobatics, dance extravaganzas, and vibrant costumes.\n\nThe last time the singer, real name Alecia Beth Moore, brought her spectacular live show to Ireland was back in 2019 with her Beautiful Trauma World Tour.\n\nSince skyrocketing to fame in the early 2000s, the pop sensation has released 8 studio albums and a greatest hits collection, selling over 140 million album equivalents worldwide.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about Pink's sold-out Dublin shows on June 20 and 21.\n\nWhen is the performance?\n\nPink will grace the stage at the Aviva Stadium tonight, June 20, and tomorrow, June 21. Doors open at 5pm and no queuing will be permitted prior to gates opening. The full timings for the concert have yet to be confirmed. Under-16s must be accompanied by an adult (25+).\n\nAre tickets still available?\n\nUnfortunately, tickets for both concerts are sold out. However, keep an eye on resale platforms like Ticketmaster for possible last-minute availability.\n\nWho are the supporting acts?\n\nOpening for Pink is Rag'n'Bone Man, GAYLE, and DJ/producer KidCutUp.\n\nHow to get to and from the venue\n\nEvent organisers recommend planning ahead for traffic and parking challenges. The venue is within walking distance of Dublin city centre, but if you don't fancy a stroll then there are plenty of transport links:\n\nBy Luas (Tram): There is no direct route from the Luas to the Aviva, but the Luas red line connects to the Dart at Connolly Station. You can then get the Dart from Connolly to Landsdowne Road.\n\nBy Train: Lansdowne Road Dart station is less than a minute's walk from the stadium's southern end. Expect large crowds and utilise extra Dart services if available.\n\nBy Bus: Dublin Bus routes 4, 7, 7a, 39a, 46a, 145, and 155 serve the Aviva Stadium.\n\nBy Car: Parking is not available at the stadium on concert days for security reasons. Limited commercial parking is offered in nearby city car parks.\n\nTaxi Drop-off Points: Recommended drop-off points are Pembroke Road/Northumberland Road or Tritonville Road/Herbert Road, depending on your designated entry point.\n\nWhat songs will she perform?\n\nJudging off the singer's most recent concert in London, here is a list of songs fans may expect to hear at her two Dublin gigs:\n\nWhat can I bring?\n\nFor faster entry, only bring essential items. Bags must be smaller than an A4 sheet. Prohibited items include large-lens cameras, selfie sticks, weapons, drugs, and more. Smartphone photography is permitted; professional cameras and recording equipment are not allowed.\n\nThere are five colour-coded routes to access the stadium. The route you must take is dictated by the location of your seat within the stadium. The applicable route colour will be stated on your event ticket.", "source": {"uri": "independent.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

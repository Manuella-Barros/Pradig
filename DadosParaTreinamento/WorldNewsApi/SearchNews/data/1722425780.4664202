{"id": 243210338, "title": "Warriors Rumors: Klay Thompson Drawing Interest From Western Conference Rival", "text": "The Golden State Warriors are entering a crucial offseason in terms of where the organization heads.Read more: Warriors Reportedly Trying to Trade Multi-Time All-Star Before NBA Free AgencyAfter winning the NBA title in 2022 with the core of Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green, Golden State has seemed to fall off. They were eliminated in the second round of the playoffs in 2023 by the Los Angeles Lakers and then missed the playoffs entirely last season, dropping their Play-In game to the Sacramento Kings.Now, they enter the offseason with more questions than answers. But none are more pressing than the status of Thompson who is scheduled to be a free agent.More news: Warriors News: Klay Thompson Contract Talks with Golden State Are Reportedly 'Frozen'So far, talks on a contract with Thompson haven't gone to plan and the likelihood of him leaving remains high. Thompson has reportedly felt disrespected by the Warriors in the process, especially given that he helped the franchise win four NBA championships over the last 10 years. With Thompson likely heading out the door, it remains a question where he will land. He should sign outright with a team but most quality teams don't have enough cap space for him. This has brought about the idea of him completing a sign-and-trade with the Warriors to go elsewhere.One team that seemingly has shown interest in Thompson is the Dallas Mavericks. Fresh off falling short in the NBA Finals, Dallas is looking for a splash to make sure it doesn't happen again. Thompson could be the missing piece to this team, adding shooting and size on the wing. NBA insider Marc Stein reported the interest from Dallas on the four-time NBA champion guard.\"League sources tell The Stein Line that the Dallas Mavericks, with some newfound financial flexibility after securing the Tim Hardaway Jr.-to-Detroit trade that I wrote about Tuesday (see the full Twitter thread here), are another team intent on exploring the feasibility of signing Thompson once he makes it to free agency.\"Depending on how much Thompson would ask for, the Mavericks could outright sign him away from the Warriors. But they also could work on a sign-and-trade deal as well. If Thompson were to tell the Warriors that he was going to head to Dallas, the two sides could work out a deal to net Golden State some assets, however small they may be.Pairing Thompson up with Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving would create a lethal shooting trio for the Mavericks and give them a legitimate shot to get back to the NBA Finals next season. The idea of Thompson leaving the only place he has called home while in the NBA may seem strange but the new CBA has created an unusual reality around the league. Thompson will have plenty of suitors in free agency but only time will tell where he will play next season.", "summary": "Star Klay Thompson seems to be drawing interest from one of the Warriors' rivals in the Western Conference.", "url": "https://www.newsweek.com/sports/nba/warriors-rumors-klay-thompson-drawing-interest-western-conference-rival-1919048", "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2419548/klay-thompson.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 00:00:01", "author": "Matt Levine", "authors": ["Matt Levine"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.323}

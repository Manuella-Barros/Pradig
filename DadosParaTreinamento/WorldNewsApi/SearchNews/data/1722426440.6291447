Delhi-Dehradun 212 km. long Green Field Corridor is being constructed. In this, an 18 km long elevated road has been built from Akshardham to Loni Border. This is the initial part. According to the NHAI official, no toll will be taken from the drivers in this, but the driver who travels further than this will be charged toll from Akshardham to wherever he travels. It is worth noting that most of the part till the UP border has been completed and it is likely that it will be opened by the end of next month. Toll rates are likely to be high from Delhi to Baghpat EPA, because 90 percent of the expressway is elevated here. This will provide relief to the people of Ghaziabad living on the Delhi border. Because they commute to Delhi daily and if they had to pay toll, it would be very heavy. Similarly, there is no toll to be paid for traveling from Nizamuddin to Dasna in Delhi Meerut Expressway, but the driver who travels beyond this has to pay toll from Nizamuddin to wherever he travels.

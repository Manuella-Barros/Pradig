{"id": 243359298, "title": "Solos unveils AirGo Vision smart glasses with ChatGPT, Gemini and Claude integration", "text": "Solos, a company for making smartglasses recently unveiled AirGo Vision, a new pair of smart glasses powered by OpenAI's latest large language model - GPT-4o. Similar to other products by the company, AirGo Vision also comes with swappable frames so you can easily remove the camera in case you don't need it. Even if you detach the camera, the smart glasses will still offer AI-powered functionalities that rely on audio input. Solos says the AirGo Vision is also compatible with popular AI models like Gemini and Claude, which can also be used to get information about what the user is looking at. For example, you can ask the smart glasses for directions to a place, summarise shopping, ask for recipes and more. Just like the Meta Ray-Ban, you can also use voice to take photos, but for reasons unknown, the AirGo Vision does not let you record videos. It has an LED notification light built right into the frame which acts as an indicator for messages and also doubles up as a flash for taking photos. One area where the product differs from other smart glasses like the ones from Meta is that the camera is part of the arm instead of being baked into the frame itself. Solos AirGo Vision will be launching sometime later this year, but there is still no word on how much it will cost. However, the LED-only frames will be available for purchase on the company's website in three different styles next month for $249.99.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/gadgets/solos-unveils-airgo-vision-smart-glasses-with-chatgpt-gemini-and-claude-support-9422072/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/06/Solos-AirGo-Vision.jpeg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 06:06:48", "author": "Tech Desk", "authors": ["Tech Desk"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": 0.305}

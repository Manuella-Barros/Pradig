And to be completely open, I didn't actually have the budget fully in place when I said I was ready to sign. So I managed to sign and had a few people underwriting and supporting me and some very loyal partners stay with me, but it's taken a little bit longer to get everything together.\n\n\"So fortunately, I obviously secured the seat and was back with Andretti, but there was a very, very, very close chance where I wasn't returning.\"\n\nJamie Chadwick is first woman to win on Indy NXT road course, leading every lap from pole at Road America\n\nThe native of England held off challenges by Louis Foster and Jacob Abel for her first career victory in the series.\n\nShe returned triumphantly at Road America, leading every lap from the pole position and proving she is worthy of the exposure that she has built over the years a three-time W Series champion and Extreme E veteran. Chadwick has been featured in national advertising (including a commercial for IBM) but says her branding \"still is always needing more.\n\n\"It's a sport that does rely on commercial support,\" she said. \"We were very close on a knife's edge to not securing the season budget-wise, so yeah, it's all welcomed support, and I'm very lucky to have loyal partners. But I know if I want to go up to IndyCar, there's a good chance I'm going to need a lot more commercial support.\"\n\nIn an exclusive conversation with NBC Sports, Chadwick, who turned 26 in May, discussed her successful Road America weekend, how she's adjusted to the Indy NXT car in her second season, her name on a youth go-karting series and her aspirations of eventually racing in IndyCar (this interview has been condensed and slightly edited for clarity):\n\nQ: You've made a jump on pace this season, but was Road America the weekend in which you finally had the pace to win?\n\nChadwick: \"Yeah, kind of exactly that; you're bang on. We've had good pace all year, but yeah, there's always been a little bit of a gap, especially to sort of the top three. I feel like I've been in the top five quite comfortably, but then that top three, there's been a bit of a gap too. And actually, coming to Road America from last year, I knew this would be one of my stronger tracks. We actually went really well here last year but didn't make it into a result, But it's a track I loved and felt like we could go well, and we had a few issues in practice. We had a fuel issue in in Practice 1 and then we were chasing balance in Practice 2. So this is where it's nice to have you know such a strong team in Andretti because we were able to basically match the work that the other teammates had done after that going into qualifying and then knowing Louis (Foster) had just smashed out of the park in Group 1, and I was in Group 2. I knew, 'OK, we've got a really good car here, and the track's improving. And I feel like we're in a great window.' So I felt like there was a great opportunity in qualifying in our session.\n\n\"But yeah, going into the race, I still didn't know if I had the speed to be able to hold off the guys behind, but I knew we had a really good car. I knew I'd be happy if I got out front, and I could lead from the front, I'd be in a good place. So that we did and just managed to control the race from there. It still wasn't easy, especially with the slipstream effect of Road America. It's very difficult to get away, combined with the fact that there were a thousand restarts. (laughs) But yeah, we had a really strong car, and I was confident to be able to bring it home.\"\n\nQ: Presuming this was the first time you'd been leading since the W Series days; did it feel comfortable to be up front and be able to control the rhythm?\n\nChadwick: \"Exactly. Super comfortable. Honestly, that's the most comfortable I've been in Indy NXT, actually. I don't say it's easier, but for me and from what I've come from, it felt a lot more natural to be out front. You can control the pace. You can manage things how you want to manage it. As soon as I realized that we had a strong car, I was comfortable. I could quite comfortably manage with the push to pass that we had available as well. I felt super comfortable compared to when you're in the middle of the pack. I've watched a bit of the race back. I don't envy those guys when you're trying to attack, and you're being attacked, and the racing is so aggressive. I was definitely happy to be out front.\"\n\nQ: So you just had confidence in the team to be able to get it right despite the issues in practice?\n\nChadwick: \"Exactly that. Yeah, the team have done a really, really good job this year. I've worked really hard on my side to kind of put myself in a position where I know what I want in the car, but sometimes, you've got a teammate that's going in a different direction that's also something that's working as well. It felt a little bit like that. We were going in our direction, (Foster) was going in his direction, and at one point, I just happened to be like, 'Hey, let's just try what they're doing,' and it worked really well. Yeah, it's great to have that environment in the team and Andretti this year being super strong. That's making my life a lot easier for sure.\"\n\nQ: What as the afterglow of the victory like? Who did you hear from at the track and elsewhere?\n\nChadwick: \"I was soaking it in for sure. Yeah, I never find these moments really properly sink in, so I tried to enjoy the moment as much as I can. We've got a pretty back-to-back season, so it does very much feel like we're straight into the next thing. And that's also quite a nice feeling as well. But just trying to read through messages and look at my phone where I can, and it is quite overwhelming, to be honest. Some of the biggest feelings that I got from the weekend was just in the IndyCar paddock, to be honest. The likes of Michael Andretti, obviously he's the team boss, but he's also someone that's out to mentor me a lot. So his support, his father Mario's support and then a lot of the IndyCar drivers as well, to be honest. Just having their support is a pretty cool feeling.\n\n\"Especially having done some of the Formula One package stuff, I love how integrated our series (Indy NXT) is with IndyCar. And we're either racing just before or just after them a lot at the time. So we interact quite a lot. And yeah, I was going out for the (Indy NXT) driver presentations before the (IndyCar) race, and I'm pretty sure every single (IndyCar) driver came up to me and said, 'Well done,' which was something I've never experienced before. So that was very cool and inspiring as well in many ways. That was special.\"\n\nQ: Looking back at your struggles in the first half of the 2023 Indy NXT season, was it mostly about adapting to a heavier car without power steering?\n\nChadwick: \"Yeah, last year coming into the series, I had tested the car, but it was on a different tire. And when we got to the first race, I was like, 'This is a lot tougher than I was prepared for,' and that combined with the fact I was coming from a much different series with shorter races, a lot less power, a lot less downforce. So in many ways, it was a big step up. So I knew I was going to have to make the difference. But once you get in season, it's very difficult to make a big, big difference to your physical strength. Yes, you get more car-fit, but it's not that easy to change what you're doing midseason.\n\n\"So as soon as the offseason came, we hit the ground running. I changed trainers. I worked with a specialist boxing coach. And I gave him one sort of instruction: Just make me as strong as possible. And it felt like that's what that's what he's done. So yeah, I'm super happy that that's made a big difference. But also there's a lot of other factors. We've changed the car a lot over the course of last year to get me into a place where I'm comfortable with the effort that it takes to drive. And it isn't the standard car that Andretti wouldn't usually run. And so I'm very lucky they've adapted the car for me, and actually a lot of the male drivers have gone to what I'm driving now as well. So, yeah, that's helped a lot as well.\"\n\nQ: Your social media feeds since winter has been filled with posts about working out at a boxing gym with a new trainer, Dan Lawrence. How has that emphasis on fitness been working?\n\nChadwick: \"Yes, he's in England, but we train remotely a lot of the time. And then in Indianapolis, I sometimes train as well with a guy that a lot of the drivers train with as well. I just looked at what (Lawrence) had done, particularly with some of his athletes, and I look at female boxers, especially, and I think they're some of the strongest athletes in the world. And I was like, 'If you can make me as strong as that, then I think I'm going to be OK.'\n\n\"And I don't think I'm as strong as that yet, but he's definitely done a very good job with me. I couldn't tell you the exact numbers, but it's crazy how much stronger I've gotten. And also, there's loads of other factors, working with the right dietician and definitely having a lot more protein in my diet. Things like this have made a big difference, but I put on 4 kilos since last year and for my size that's quite a lot. I keep saying I hope it's muscle because otherwise I just put on a lot of weight (laughs), but yeah, it's definitely made a big difference.\"\n\nQ: You've also been posting about your involvement in the first all-female karting championship and mentorship program in England. What's the backstory there?\n\nChadwick: \"That was something we launched at the beginning of this year and really it's something we've been talking about for a long time, but it was trying to do what we can to really tackle the grassroots level of the sport. There's so much that we're doing now, so many initiatives to help women in the sport but not a huge amount at that entry level. So it's an all-female karting series that runs at three different locations in the U.K. and supported by Daytona, which is a ride-and-drive karting company in the U.K. And yeah, it's subsidized racing for an all-female lineup.\n\n\"So whilst the argument is we want to avoid this segregation, the argument on the flip side of that is what we're doing is creating an environment and a community that young girls can go enjoy and make friends and feel safe and comfortable. When I started in go-karts, there were no other girls, and it's not an environment that many would jump to be in, so it's all about just encouraging people to start in the sport in the first place. We had nearly 400 young girls show interest. And then at the first event, we had nearly 50 8-year-olds, 50 12-year-olds, so it was incredible to see. So, yeah, it's really a bit of a passion project for my side now. We've already had the first couple of races, and it finishes toward the end of the year, so it's amazing to see. There are some clear talents and also some people that have never done it before but are loving experiencing the sport for the first time.\"\n\nQ: Looking ahead now that you're an Indy NXT winner, does reaching IndyCar become the primary goal over the Formula One aspirations that you had in the past?\n\nChadwick: \"Yeah, I mean I'm on this sort of journey over here in the States, and I'd love to be able to step up into IndyCar. But I do keep saying it's going to take a lot more than just one race win to guarantee me anything in IndyCar. So I just need to keep working hard in Indy NXT.\n\n\"I think I'm in the perfect place and perfect feeder series to transition and move up if I can have the right success, so yeah, that's my full focus at the moment and yeah, hopefully IndyCar isn't too far away. I've had a few discussions (with Andretti Global management). Andretti has a super strong three-car lineup at the moment, but the discussions are there and that's the great thing about being in a team like Andretti. You feel well placed if you're performing and in the right environment. You look at what Kyle Kirkwood did. He won with Andretti (in Indy NXT). He didn't get the option straight away to move to IndyCar with them, but now he's got a great setup there. So yeah, I feel like if you can do what Kyle did at a team like Andretti, I hope you can be rewarded.\"\n\nQ: You're ranked ninth in the Indy NXT points standings with eight races remaining, including a doubleheader at WeatherTech Raceway Laguna Seca, so what is the objective for the rest of 2024?\n\nChadwick: \"We're way off in the championship, unfortunately and frustratingly. We actually should be top three, top five if we'd had a little bit more fortune earlier in the year. So I think that's definitely still our aim to climb up the championship and still be getting results. I set my goal for this year to win a race and to get a podium, and we've done that already. So yeah, now we just need to keep working and keep chipping away.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indy_NXT", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indy NXT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Chadwick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Chadwick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INDYCAR", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "INDYCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andretti_Autosport", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andretti Autosport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Road America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Road racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_Series_(championship)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "W Series (championship)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_NASCAR_Cup_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2023 NASCAR Cup Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Foster", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louis Foster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_E", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extreme E"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chip_Ganassi_Racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chip Ganassi Racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kart_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kart racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_position", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pole position"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Indy_NXT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2023 Indy NXT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_2_(racing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Group 2 (racing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drafting_(aerodynamics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drafting (aerodynamics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Andretti", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Andretti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_steering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Power steering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laguna_Seca", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laguna Seca"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Kirkwood", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Kirkwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daytona_International_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daytona International Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Physical fitness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle Racing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Karting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Karting", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/GJcNTNs.cxzFCKkSh9sGyA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/nbcsports.com/2cd3e9432d2c565bf028c414b8eedbd7", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669442", "eventUri": "eng-9669442", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-09", "textStart": 514, "textEnd": 520}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

She made a clean sweep: qualifying on pole, leading every lap, and becoming the first woman to win in IndyCar's feeder series, Indy NXT, in almost 15 years.\n\nMore than a week later, it still feels like an out-of-body experience for her.\n\n\"I always feel like it never really sinks in,\" Chadwick, 26, told Motorsport.com. \"I've had to watch it back and be like: 'Oh, that did just happen. That was legit.' It's weird. You do it, you've done it, and you still don't feel like it was real.\"\n\nEven if her victory doesn't feel real for Chadwick, it shouldn't be much of a surprise to Indy NXT fans. This is the British-born driver's second season in Indy NXT, both of which she's spent with powerhouse team Andretti Global. She came to the series as a driver in the Williams Formula One Team's development program and a three-time champion in the W Series, a now-defunct all-female open-wheel championship. Chadwick's best Indy NXT finish last year was sixth, but she stormed into the 2024 season. At Indianapolis Motor Speedway in May, she scored the first series podium by a woman since 2010. Then, at Road America (the season's sixth race), she put herself on pole. Still, she wasn't sure if she \"actually had the speed to win the race.\"\n\n\"I went into this year with the goal of winning a race and getting podiums,\" Chadwick said. \"But, to be honest, I didn't actually believe in that goal. I believed I could get a podium, but I didn't believe I could necessarily win a race.\"\n\nWhen she crossed the finish line, Chadwick's mind was a mix of raw emotions and white noise. But mostly relief.\n\n\"I was so happy -- so, so happy,\" she said. \"You get pole, and you're like, 'Cool, that was nice.' But you're never fully happy until you cross that line and ultimately win, so it does feel like a little bit of a weight off.\"\n\nChadwick wanted to prove, perhaps mostly to herself, that she could win in Indy NXT. No crashes, no attrition, no right place-right time asterisks. She wanted to command a race, then win it. Her doubts were \"just an ounce of realism.\"\n\n\"I think every driver feels like this,\" Chadwick said. \"You give yourself a number, and you're happy with that number. Last year, I remember I'd be happy if I was in the top 12. This year, I started off with the top 10 -- then it was top five.\n\n\"Now, it's started to become a top-three. I felt that's where our speed was at, and there was a bit of a gap to the top two -- to be really winning races. We bridged that gap at the weekend. Not to say it's always going to be like that, but now I do believe we can be up there.\"\n\nSince the win, headlines everywhere have been about Chadwick making history: that she's the first woman to win in Indy NXT since Pippa Mann in 2010, and the first woman to ever win on a non-oval track. But Chadwick didn't think about that stat before Road America, and she hasn't thought about it since.\n\n\"I don't like that stat, because it's frustrating that it's been that long,\" Chadwick said. \"Why haven't there been women winning races? You just haven't had women competing at this level, and therefore not winning races. It shouldn't be the case.\n\n\"We've got Lindsay [Brewer] in the championship, but we haven't got many young girls in the feeder series through to IndyCar. Hopefully we can change that, and it's not going to be so long to the next one.\"\n\nEven Chadwick -- history-making, race-winning Jamie Chadwick -- was never certain this level of success would be in the cards for her.\n\n\"I was good enough at it [as a child] to kind of just about keep going, but it wasn't clear that I was going to be making it to the big leagues,\" Chadwick said. \"I was fortunate that I had a few opportunities as a woman in the sport. I definitely wouldn't be here today without W Series. I was just fortunate that people continued to believe in me even when things weren't so easy.\"\n\nNow, Chadwick is taking both checkered flags and photos with the young girls cheering her on from the grandstands. While the \"first woman in more than a decade\" stat is frustrating for her, she knows what it means to them.\n\n\"That's really cool for me,\" Chadwick said. \"If they want to get into the sport and see someone that looks like them having success, they know that that's something they can do. Hopefully that's planted in their memories, and they can go home and tell their mom or dad: 'I want to go to the kart track and to try this myself.'\n\n\"The sport's tough for everyone, but if we've only got a handful of young girls starting in the sport in the first place, then you're never going to see them filter through to the top, just by rule of numbers. Increasing [the number of] young girls who can start in the sport and be in an environment they enjoy -- comfortable, safe -- then I think that's a good starting place.\"\n\nChadwick knows her big win is a good starting place for her own career, too.", "source": {"uri": "motorsport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Motorsport.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indy_NXT", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indy NXT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Road America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_Series_(championship)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "W Series (championship)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Chadwick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Chadwick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williams_Grand_Prix_Engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Williams Grand Prix Engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INDYCAR", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "INDYCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andretti_Autosport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andretti Autosport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Motor_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Motor Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorsport.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motorsport.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pippa_Mann", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pippa Mann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kart_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kart racing"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle Racing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://cdn-9.motorsport.com/images/amp/0mbpOV42/s6/jamie-chadwick-indynxt-intervi.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669442", "eventUri": "eng-9669442", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

And to be completely open, I didn't actually have the budget fully in place when I said I was ready to sign. So I managed to sign and had a few people underwriting and supporting me and some very loyal partners stay with me, but it's taken a little bit longer to get everything together.\n\n\"So fortunately, I obviously secured the seat and was back with Andretti, but there was a very, very, very close chance where I wasn't returning.\"\n\nShe returned triumphantly at Road America, leading every lap from the pole position and proving she is worthy of the exposure that she has built over the years a three-time W Series champion and Extreme E veteran. Chadwick has been featured in national advertising (including a commercial for IBM) but says her branding \"still is always needing more.\n\n\"It's a sport that does rely on commercial support,\" she said. \"We were very close on a knife's edge to not securing the season budget-wise, so yeah, it's all welcomed support, and I'm very lucky to have loyal partners. But I know if I want to go up to IndyCar, there's a good chance I'm going to need a lot more commercial support.\"\n\nIn an exclusive conversation with NBC Sports, Chadwick discussed her successful Road America weekend, how she's adjusted to the Indy NXT car in her second season, her name on a youth go-karting series and her aspirations of eventually racing in IndyCar (this interview has been condensed and slightly edited for clarity):\n\nQ: You've made a jump on pace this season, but was Road America the weekend in which you finally had the pace to win?\n\nChadwick: \"Yeah, kind of exactly that; you're bang on. We've had good pace all year, but yeah, there's always been a little bit of a gap, especially to sort of the top three. I feel like I've been in the top five quite comfortably, but then that top three, there's been a bit of a gap too. And actually, coming to Road America from last year, I knew this would be one of my stronger tracks. We actually went really well here last year but didn't make it into a result, But it's a track I loved and felt like we could go well, and we had a few issues in practice. We had a fuel issue in in Practice 1 and then we were chasing balance in Practice 2. So this is where it's nice to have you know such a strong team in Andretti because we were able to basically match the work that the other teammates had done after that going into qualifying and then knowing Louis (Foster) had just smashed out of the park in Group 1, and I was in Group 2. I knew, 'OK, we've got a really good car here, and the track's improving. And I feel like we're in a great window.' So I felt like there was a great opportunity in qualifying in our session.\n\n\"But yeah, going into the race, I still didn't know if I had the speed to be able to hold off the guys behind, but I knew we had a really good car. I knew I'd be happy if I got out front, and I could lead from the front, I'd be in a good place. So that we did and just managed to control the race from there. It still wasn't easy, especially with the slipstream effect of Road America. It's very difficult to get away, combined with the fact that there were a thousand restarts. (laughs) But yeah, we had a really strong car, and I was confident to be able to bring it home.\"\n\nQ: Presuming this was the first time you'd been leading since the W Series days; did it feel comfortable to be up front and be able to control the rhythm?\n\nChadwick: \"Exactly. Super comfortable. Honestly, that's the most comfortable I've been in Indy NXT, actually. I don't say it's easier, but for me and from what I've come from, it felt a lot more natural to be out front. You can control the pace. You can manage things how you want to manage it. As soon as I realized that we had a strong car, I was comfortable. I could quite comfortably manage with the push to pass that we had available as well. I felt super comfortable compared to when you're in the middle of the pack. I've watched a bit of the race back. I don't envy those guys when you're trying to attack, and you're being attacked, and the racing is so aggressive. I was definitely happy to be out front.\"\n\nQ: So you just had confidence in the team to be able to get it right despite the issues in practice?\n\nChadwick: \"Exactly that. Yeah, the team have done a really, really good job this year. I've worked really hard on my side to kind of put myself in a position where I know what I want in the car, but sometimes, you've got a teammate that's going in a different direction that's also something that's working as well. It felt a little bit like that. We were going in our direction, (Foster) was going in his direction, and at one point, I just happened to be like, 'Hey, let's just try what they're doing,' and it worked really well. Yeah, it's great to have that environment in the team and Andretti this year being super strong. That's making my life a lot easier for sure.\"\n\nQ: What as the afterglow of the victory like? Who did you hear from at the track and elsewhere?\n\nChadwick: \"I was soaking it in for sure. Yeah, I never find these moments really properly sink in, so I tried to enjoy the moment as much as I can. We've got a pretty back-to-back season, so it does very much feel like we're straight into the next thing. And that's also quite a nice feeling as well. But just trying to read through messages and look at my phone where I can, and it is quite overwhelming, to be honest. Some of the biggest feelings that I got from the weekend was just in the IndyCar paddock, to be honest. The likes of Michael Andretti, obviously he's the team boss, but he's also someone that's out to mentor me a lot. So his support, his father Mario's support and then a lot of the IndyCar drivers as well, to be honest. Just having their support is a pretty cool feeling.\n\n\"Especially having done some of the Formula One package stuff, I love how integrated our series (Indy NXT) is with IndyCar. And we're either racing just before or just after them a lot at the time. So we interact quite a lot. And yeah, I was going out for the (Indy NXT) driver presentations before the (IndyCar) race, and I'm pretty sure every single (IndyCar) driver came up to me and said, 'Well done,' which was something I've never experienced before. So that was very cool and inspiring as well in many ways. That was special.\"\n\nQ: Looking back at your struggles in the first half of the 2023 Indy NXT season, was it mostly about adapting to a heavier car without power steering?\n\nChadwick: \"Yeah, last year coming into the series, I had tested the car, but it was on a different tire. And when we got to the first race, I was like, 'This is a lot tougher than I was prepared for,' and that combined with the fact I was coming from a much different series with shorter races, a lot less power, a lot less downforce. So in many ways, it was a big step up. So I knew I was going to have to make the difference. But once you get in season, it's very difficult to make a big, big difference to your physical strength. Yes, you get more car-fit, but it's not that easy to change what you're doing midseason.\n\n\"So as soon as the offseason came, we hit the ground running. I changed trainers. I worked with a specialist boxing coach. And I gave him one sort of instruction: Just make me as strong as possible. And it felt like that's what that's what he's done. So yeah, I'm super happy that that's made a big difference. But also there's a lot of other factors. We've changed the car a lot over the course of last year to get me into a place where I'm comfortable with the effort that it takes to drive. And it isn't the standard car that Andretti wouldn't usually run. And so I'm very lucky they've adapted the car for me, and actually a lot of the male drivers have gone to what I'm driving now as well. So, yeah, that's helped a lot as well.\"\n\nQ: Your social media feeds since winter has been filled with posts about working out at a boxing gym with a new trainer, Dan Lawrence. How has that emphasis on fitness been working?\n\nChadwick: \"Yes, he's in England, but we train remotely a lot of the time. And then in Indianapolis, I sometimes train as well with a guy that a lot of the drivers train with as well. I just looked at what (Lawrence) had done, particularly with some of his athletes, and I look at female boxers, especially, and I think they're some of the strongest athletes in the world. And I was like, 'If you can make me as strong as that, then I think I'm going to be OK.'\n\n\"And I don't think I'm as strong as that yet, but he's definitely done a very good job with me. I couldn't tell you the exact numbers, but it's crazy how much stronger I've gotten. And also, there's loads of other factors, working with the right dietician and definitely having a lot more protein in my diet. Things like this have made a big difference, but I put on 4 kilos since last year and for my size that's quite a lot. I keep saying I hope it's muscle because otherwise I just put on a lot of weight (laughs), but yeah, it's definitely made a big difference.\"\n\nQ: You've also been posting about your involvement in the first all-female karting championship and mentorship program in England. What's the backstory there?\n\nChadwick: \"That was something we launched at the beginning of this year and really it's something we've been talking about for a long time, but it was trying to do what we can to really tackle the grassroots level of the sport. There's so much that we're doing now, so many initiatives to help women in the sport but not a huge amount at that entry level. So it's an all-female karting series that runs at three different locations in the U.K. and supported by Daytona, which is a ride-and-drive karting company in the U.K. And yeah, it's subsidized racing for an all-female lineup.\n\n\"So whilst the argument is we want to avoid this segregation, the argument on the flip side of that is what we're doing is creating an environment and a community that young girls can go enjoy and make friends and feel safe and comfortable. When I started in go-karts, there were no other girls, and it's not an environment that many would jump to be in, so it's all about just encouraging people to start in the sport in the first place. We had nearly 400 young girls show interest. And then at the first event, we had nearly 50 8-year-olds, 50 12-year-olds, so it was incredible to see. So, yeah, it's really a bit of a passion project for my side now. We've already had the first couple of races, and it finishes toward the end of the year, so it's amazing to see. There are some clear talents and also some people that have never done it before but are loving experiencing the sport for the first time.\"\n\nQ: Looking ahead now that you're an Indy NXT winner, does reaching IndyCar become the primary goal over the Formula One aspirations that you had in the past?\n\nChadwick: \"Yeah, I mean I'm on this sort of journey over here in the States, and I'd love to be able to step up into IndyCar. But I do keep saying it's going to take a lot more than just one race win to guarantee me anything in IndyCar. So I just need to keep working hard in Indy NXT.\n\n\"I think I'm in the perfect place and perfect feeder series to transition and move up if I can have the right success, so yeah, that's my full focus at the moment and yeah, hopefully IndyCar isn't too far away. I've had a few discussions (with Andretti Global management). Andretti has a super strong three-car lineup at the moment, but the discussions are there and that's the great thing about being in a team like Andretti. You feel well placed if you're performing and in the right environment. You look at what Kyle Kirkwood did. He won with Andretti (in Indy NXT). He didn't get the option straight away to move to IndyCar with them, but now he's got a great setup there. So yeah, I feel like if you can do what Kyle did at a team like Andretti, I hope you can be rewarded.\"\n\nQ: You're ranked ninth in the Indy NXT points standings with eight races remaining, including a doubleheader at WeatherTech Raceway Laguna Seca, so what is the objective for the rest of 2024?\n\nChadwick: \"We're way off in the championship, unfortunately and frustratingly. We actually should be top three, top five if we'd had a little bit more fortune earlier in the year. So I think that's definitely still our aim to climb up the championship and still be getting results. I set my goal for this year to win a race and to get a podium, and we've done that already. So yeah, now we just need to keep working and keep chipping away.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indy_NXT", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indy NXT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INDYCAR", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "INDYCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andretti_Autosport", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andretti Autosport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Road America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_Series_(championship)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "W Series (championship)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_NASCAR_Cup_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2023 NASCAR Cup Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_E", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extreme E"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Chadwick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Chadwick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chip_Ganassi_Racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chip Ganassi Racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kart_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kart racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_position", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pole position"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Road racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Indy_NXT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2023 Indy NXT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drafting_(aerodynamics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drafting (aerodynamics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Andretti", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Andretti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_steering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Power steering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laguna_Seca", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laguna Seca"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Kirkwood", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Kirkwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Motor_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Motor Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daytona_International_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daytona International Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Karting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Karting", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://nbcsports.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0bd9cbf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5184x2916+0+347/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnbc-sports-production-nbc-sports.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F60%2F94%2F9143583a42c7a507e49e95d36b3b%2Fjamie-chadwick-indy-nxt-by-firestone-open-test-at-milwaukee-mile-by-chris-jones-large-image-without-watermark-m109480.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669442", "eventUri": "eng-9669442", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-09", "textStart": 514, "textEnd": 520}], "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

Independent Schools' state swimming championships might have been the fastest in history.\n\nThere were 22 races held and 14 finished with new boys' or girls' meet records.\n\nAnd the boys' swimmers from Charlotte Latin -- who shattered four of those meet records -- won the championship by 194 points.\n\nToday, those dominant Hawks earn the distinction as The Charlotte Observer's boys' high school team of the 2023-24 school year.\n\nThis is the third year the media outlet has named year-ending awards to the top athletes, coaches and teams in its circulation area.\n\n\"I think our team this year was a reflection of the many years of strong teams we've had at Latin,\" said second-year coach Michael Chadwick, a former collegiate All-American at Missouri. \"It was about encouraging and fulfilling strong values, and what it means to be a strong swimmer.\"\n\nChadwick credits longtime Hawks' swim coach Patty Waldron with establishing a culture that he said he simply built on.\n\nChadwick said it helped to have strong athletes like Observer boys' swimmer of the year Novy Clontz on his team. Clontz is a top-five recruit nationally who will swim at the University of California in Berkeley.\n\nAt the state meet, Clontz broke a 20-year-old state record in the 200 freestyle and swam on state record-setting 200 medley (with Zachary Spicer, Aidan Hill and James Harper) and 400 free relay teams (with Harper, Wiley Spinner and Hill).\n\nHill also set a six-year-old meet record in the 100 butterfly and won the 100 backstroke.\n\nChadwick admits he thought his team could be good. He just wasn't sure it could be as good as any NCISAA boys' team that had come before it.\n\n\"You can never really be sure,\" he said, \"but I think given some talent we had on our team, and how it stacked up, it really was impressive to watch. I was anticipating a really good (state) meet because of how I watched these swimmers the last couple years. They are pretty gifted people.\"\n\nChadwick said he'll graduate a lot of talent from this year's team, but is looking forward to next season.\n\n\"I think the Latin legacy continues,\" he said, \"no matter what.\"", "source": {"uri": "charlotteobserver.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Charlotte Observer"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Charlotte_Observer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Charlotte Observer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Latin_School", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte Latin School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Chadwick_(swimmer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Chadwick (swimmer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Latin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-America", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Butterfly stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Berkeley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medley_swimming", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medley swimming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backstroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Backstroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freestyle_swimming", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freestyle swimming"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Swimming_and_Diving", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Swimming and Diving", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Teams", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Education_and_Training/Team_Building", "label": "dmoz/Business/Education and Training/Team Building", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.charlotteobserver.com/latest-news/p27k3d/picture285456962/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/CLT_NCISSAchamp_206.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669442", "eventUri": "eng-9669442", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

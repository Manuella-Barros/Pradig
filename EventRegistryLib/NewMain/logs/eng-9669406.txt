Organizers are asking \"ordinary citizens\" to help save the day.\n\nAll of the work in this big undertaking does come at a cost as planners work to raise $2.5 million to cover labor and materials. Their fundraising efforts kicked off on Thursday at a press conference at the Cleveland History Center.\n\nSUBSCRIBE: Get the day's top headlines sent to your inbox each weekday morning with the free 3News to GO! newsletter\n\nAt the heart of the project is the nonprofit Siegel and Shuster Society. Over the last few years, the organization worked to get approval from city and county leaders as well as DC and Warner Bros. Discovery, who hold copyrights over Superman.\n\nThe Jerry Siegel & Joe Shuster Tribute Plaza is set to be located in front of the expanded Huntington Convention Center in downtown Cleveland. Here's what you can expect:\n\nPlanners say the vision of the plaza will be \"to tell a story\" in three parts.\n\nYou'll see the clothing of \"mild-mannered reporter Clark Kent\" inside the locked, non-operational phone booth.\n\nTo the left of the phone booth will be a bronze statue featuring Jerry Siegel, Joe Shuster and Siegel's wife, Joanne, who served as the model for Superman's love interest, Lois Lane. They are seen pointing and looking up at Superman.\n\nThe highlight of the plaza will be an 18-foot tall stainless steel statue of Superman.\n\nWhen you put it all together in a park-like setting with grass, trees, pavers and benches, here's how the Jerry Siegel & Joe Shuster Tribute Plaza will look.\n\n\"Superman was the very first comic book superhero. All the rest came later - Batman, Captain America, but it all started in Cleveland, Ohio,\" said Gary Kaplan, president of the Siegel and Shuster Society.\n\nKaplan and society leaders are incredibly excited to watch the tribute plaza come to life. They believe it will positively impact city tourism and they're hoping for donations from anyone who loves Superman and believes in this vision.\n\nThe Siegel & Shuster Society says it is funding the cost for construction of the sculptures and the infrastructure in the plaza, while the Cuyahoga County Convention Facilities Development Corporation will handle the maintenance of the plaza.\n\nThe goal is for the plaza to open to the public in March 2025. Organizers say that's the plan regardless of whether they reach their fundraising goals by that time.\n\nIf you would like to donate to the Siegel & Shuster Tribute Plaza, click here.\n\nThe fundraising kickoff for the statue honoring the \"Man of Steel\" comes as Northeast Ohio plays host to a major motion picture currently in production -- which many believe is the new Superman film directed by James Gunn that's set for release on July 11, 2025. Multiple sites in downtown Cleveland have been transformed into \"Metropolis\" with the Leader Building being tagged as \"The Daily Planet.\"", "source": {"uri": "wkyc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "wkyc.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "assets@wkyc.com", "name": "assets", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Superman (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Shuster", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Shuster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Siegel", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Siegel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_square", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Town square"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Downtown Cleveland"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Reserve_Historical_Society", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Reserve Historical Society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

The event will be held at the Western Reserve Historical Society, 10825 East Blvd., Cleveland.\n\nThe Cleveland City Planning Commission approved plans for the project in April.\n\nThe campaign kickoff coincides with the start of local filming by DC for its new upcoming \"Superman'' movie at locations in downtown Cleveland and at Mentor Headlands Beach State Park.\n\nGary Kaplan, who heads the Siegel and Shuster Society, said the organization's goal is to complete the Superman monument project by next April.\n\n\"We think April is realistic,'' he said Monday in an interview. \"I'm optimistic that we will raise the money. I think there's a lot of support inside and outside Cleveland for the project.\"\n\nTax deductible donations can be made to the project through its website; supermanstatuecleveland.org. or mailed to the Siegel and Shuster Society c/o Leigh Goldie, 23500 Mercantile Road, Suite D, Beachwood, OH, 44122.\n\nThe design for the tribute plaza calls for placing Deming's 9.5-foot-long stainless steel sculpture of Superman atop an 18.5-foot tall, blue-painted pylon in a plaza at the southwest corner entry to the former Global Center for Health Innovation in downtown Cleveland. The center is undergoing a $40 million renovation to make it an integral part of the Huntington Cleveland Convention Center.\n\nThe installation will include three life-size bronze statues of Shuster, Siegel and Siegel's future wife, Joanne, the original model for newspaper reporter Lois Lane, Superman's love interest.\n\nThe trio will look skyward in amazement, as if exclaiming: \"It's a Bird... It's a Plane... It's Superman.\"\n\nA facsimile of a phone booth nearby will evoke the quick-change location in which \"mild-mannered'' newspaper reporter Clark Kent becomes an airborne fighter for \"Truth, Justice and the American Way,'' as his motto traditionally stated. In 2021, DC changed Superman's motto to \"Truth, Justice and a Better Tomorrow.''\n\nThe project has been approved by DC Comics and its parent company, Warner Media.\n\nKaplan, whose mother was a first cousin of Jerry Siegal, said the Siegel and Shuster Society has raised and spent or committed more than $600,000 for the project so far.\n\nOf that amount, $170,000 has been devoted to foundations for the three elements of the Superman site. Kaplan said another $450,000 will be spent as partial down payments to foundries engaged by Deming to cast elements of the monument.\n\nThe total breakdown for elements of the project include:\n\n- $170,000 for foundation work.\n\n- $500,000 for the superman sculpture and his base pylon, including Deming's fee as the sculptor.\n\n- $600,000 for the bronze statues of Jerry and Joanne Siegal, and Joe Shuster, including the sculptor's fee.\n\nThe news release announcing the fundraising campaign states that \"no taxpayer money is being used for this project.'' It seeks \"donations from ordinary citizens from all walks of life who believe that a man can fly -- at least one man.''\n\nLong journey to liftoff\n\nThe tribute plaza for Superman has been a long time in coming. The Plain Dealer reported that in 2009, public relations and advertising consultant Howard \"Hutch\" Stoller, of Mayfield, approached Deming on behalf of Superman enthusiasts and suggested that if the sculptor would create a mockup for a monument, Stoller would launch a campaign to raise the money to get it built.\n\nBy 2015, developer Dick Pace, who had been chosen by the City of Cleveland to develop portions of land around North Coast Harbor with housing and a hotel, agreed to include the Superman sculpture in his plans for a site between to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Great Lakes Science Center.\n\nThe site would have been next to the north end of a pedestrian bridge designed by Boston architect Miguel Rosales, extending from the north end of the downtown Mall across railroad tracks and the Ohio 2 Shoreway to a spot between the museums where Pace had proposed a hotel.\n\nBy 2018, however, those plans fell apart and the Superman statue needed a new place to land. Cuyahoga County, which owns the convention center, ultimately approved the site on the northeast corner of Huron Road and St. Clair Avenue.\n\nMoney raised for the project so far includes $100,000 bequeathed by real estate developer Irv Fine, who is Kaplan's uncle, plus fees channeled to the nonprofit by the State of Ohio through its sale of Superman license plates. Each sale nets the Siegal and Shuster Society $10, Kaplan said.\n\nThe money, which has accumulated at the rate of $40,000 a year, has been invested by the Cleveland Foundation, which provides financial services and advice to nonprofit organizations whose missions align with those of the foundation, a spokesperson said.\n\nSpeakers at Thursday's event, in addition to Deming, are to include Goldie, who is a cousin of Shuster's; and former Plain Dealer reporter Michael Sangiacomo, a founding member of the Siegal and Shuster Society.\n\nKaplan said the tribute to Superman will recognize what he called the birth of the superhero genre in comics in the Forest City during the Depression.\n\n\"It basically started with two teenagers from Cleveland,'' he said. \"It's all over the world now. Many Clevelanders will feel very proud of this.\"", "source": {"uri": "cleveland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cleveland"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

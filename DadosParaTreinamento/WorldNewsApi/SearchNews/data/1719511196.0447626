The couple seemed in good spirits as they made their way through the airport to the First Class lounge before jetting off to a romantic getaway. Meanwhile Sophie's ex husband Joe Jonas was all smiles as he arrived in the paddock at the Formula One Grand Prix in Monaco. The actress, 27, showed off her incredible figure in a pair of black leggings and kept comfortable in a pair of Ugg shoes. The Game Of Thrones star added a brown suede jacket over the number and carried a green Louis Vuitton cabin bag. Styling her long tresses in a high bun, Sophie kept low-key by wearing a pair of dark sunglasses. Property developer Peregrine, 29, was spotted wearing a dark baseball cap and sunglasses with a navy sweatshirt and jeans. Sophie seemed in high spirits while her ex-husband Joe was spotted with friends in Monaco at the Formula One race The singer was all smiles as he attended wearing a beige patterned shirt and matching shorts. He kept comfortable in a pair of white trainers and shielded from the sun behind a pair of red tinted glasses. Sophie, who is divorcing Joe, shared a series of snaps from her ski trip with Peregrine as she confirmed their relationship in December. Peregrine is the eldest son and heir of Michael Pearson, the 4th Viscount Cowdray \u2013 a former film producer who owns a significant chunk of the Pearson media empire. While Sophie is said to be worth a whopping \u00a310million, this pales in comparison to Peregrine's family fortune which is said to be more than \u00a3224million. He has a \u00a35million pad in Chelsea while his father owns a sprawling mansion in West Sussex with 22 bedrooms and 16,500 acres of grounds. His ancestral estate is home to Cowdray Park Polo Club \u2013 which boasts ten pitches and hosts more than 450 matches each year. The prestigious club hosts the annual Gold Cup, where both Prince William and Prince Harry have played. Peregrine previously admitted that despite being the heir to the sprawling estate, which also features a farm shop and caf\u00e9, he does not play polo himself. He told the Telegraph in 2018: 'I'm getting lessons, I grew up riding and over the next few years it's something I can see myself doing a lot more.' Sophie's ex Joe has also moved on, and was seen on a romantic ski trip in Aspen, Colorado, earlier in January with the pageant queen-turned-model Stormi Bree. Rumours had already been swirling that Joe had taken up with Stormi, a one-time Miss Teen USA, in the midst of his ongoing divorce. Joe filed for divorce from Sophie in September 2023 and their battle over custody of daughters Willa, three, and Delphine, 17 months, made headlines worldwide. Earlier in January, Sophie asked the judge presiding over their case to dismiss her child abduction claim against him after they finally hashed out a custody plan. The exes were previously engaged in significant conflict over where their children would live and Sophie claimed Joe prevented them from traveling to the UK with her by withholding the kids' passports. Sophie and Joe began dating in 2016. They got engaged in 2017 and a Las Vegas wedding in May 2019 before marrying properly a month later.", "summary": "Sophie Turner\u00a0cut a casual figure in a Playboy blue sweatshirt as she arrived at Heathrow Airport with boyfriend Peregrine Pearson on Sunday.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-13461491/Sophie-Turner-dresses-Playboy-sweatshirt-arrives-Heathrow-boyfriend-Peregrine-Pearson-ex-husband-Joe-Jonas-attends-Monaco-Grand-Prix.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/05/26/15/85352681-0-image-m-28_1716734153038.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 15:51:39", "author": "Bethan Edwards,Editor", "authors": ["Bethan Edwards", "Editor"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.128}

On the first weekend of the general election campaign, the shadow chancellor said she and Keir Starmer wanted taxes on working people to be lower. Pressed on how Labour would fund public services, Reeves ruled out raising income tax or national insurance and insisted that there would be no \u201cunfunded proposals\u201d in the party\u2019s election manifesto. Speaking on the BBC\u2019s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Reeves said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to make any cuts to public spending, which is why we\u2019ve announced the immediate injection of cash into public services. \u201cSo that money for our NHS, the additional police \u2013 13,000 additional police and community officers \u2013 and the 6,500 additional teachers in our schools, they are all fully costed and fully funded promises, because unless things are fully costed and fully funded, frankly, you can\u2019t believe they\u2019re going to happen.\u201d Pressed repeatedly on her tax plans, Reeves said: \u201cWhat I want and Keir wants is taxes on working people to be lower, and we certainly won\u2019t be increasing income tax or national insurance if we win at the election.\u201d She added: \u201cThere\u2019s not going to be a return to austerity under a Labour government. We had austerity for five years and that is part of the reason why our economy and our public services are in a mess today. \u201cIn the end, we have to grow the economy. We have to turn around this dire economic performance.\u201d She said the party would raise money to fund its pledges by introducing VAT on private school fees, increasing tax on private equity bonuses, extending the windfall tax on energy companies\u2019 profits, and cracking down on non-doms and tax avoidance. The shadow chancellor also defended Labour\u2019s plans to end fire-and-rehire practices after Unite criticised the party for excluding an outright ban from the final version of its workers\u2019 rights package. The union\u2019s secretary general, Sharon Graham, said the plans now had \u201cmore holes than Swiss cheese\u201d. Reeves said she was \u201csorry that Sharon feels like that\u201d, but insisted that Labour retained the support of trade unions for \u201cthe biggest ever extension of workplace rights that\u2019s ever been introduced\u201d. \u201cWe will end fire-and-rehire, which has seen companies \u2026 sack all their staff and then try and bring them back on worse contracts. That is deplorable and we will not allow that to happen,\u201d the shadow chancellor said. Reeves stressed that fire-and-rehire would be allowed only in very specific cases of restructuring. \u201cWhen a company\u2019s facing bankruptcy and there is no alternative, they will have to consult with their workers and their trade unions. Those are very, very limited circumstances,\u201d she said. In the same interview, Reeves declined to say whether Labour would end the two-child benefit cap and refused to put a timetable on the party\u2019s commitment to increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP.", "summary": "<p>Shadow chancellor rules out income tax and national insurance rises and says manifesto will have no unfunded proposals</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/politics/live/2024/may/26/labour-criticises-rishi-sunaks-national-service-plan-as-unfunded-uk-politics-live\">UK politics live \u2013 latest updates</a></li></ul><p>Rachel Reeves vowed that there would be no \u201creturn to austerity\u201d under a Labour government as she ruled out increases to income tax or national insurance.

Top leaders, from the BJP and its NDA allies, will also be inducted as ministers at the swearing-in ceremony, scheduled to begin at 7:15 pm, at the Rashtrapati Bhavan. Narendra Modi will become the first Prime Minister since Jawaharlal Nehru to be elected for a third straight term. This time, however, he will be heading a full-fledged coalition government after the BJP failed to get majority on its own in the Lok Sabha polls. The BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) secured 293 seats in the recent Lok Sabha elections. The BJP bagged 240 seats, falling short of the majority mark of 272. This marks a significant shift from the party's decade-long single-party dominance. Hours before the ceremony, Narendra Modi met with NDA leaders, many of whom are anticipated to receive ministerial posts. Key figures present included Amit Shah, Rajnath Singh, Nitin Gadkari, Nirmala Sitharaman, SJaishankar, Ashwini Vaishnaw, Piyush Goyal, Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Jyotiraditya Scindia. Leaders from alliance partners included Rajiv Ranjan Singh (JDU), Jitan Ram Manjhi (HAM), Jayant Chaudhary (RLD), HS Kumaraswamy (JDS), and Chirag Paswan (LJP Ram Vilas).Who gets which ministry in Modi 3.0?

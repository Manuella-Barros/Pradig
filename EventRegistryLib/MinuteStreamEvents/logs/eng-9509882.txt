The basis for comparison is also unfavorable, since Q1 23 was a strong quarter, stemming from a cycle of high demand due to the precautions taken during the chip crisis, with an exceptional level of activity at some of our strategic customers. The scale of the slowdown is in line with our forecasts and justifies the strong adjustment measures we are currently deploying.

The integration of Home Networks is proceeding according to plan and will generate the expected synergies more rapidly than anticipated, enabling the group to defend its profitability in this market context, and to be ready to benefit from the market recovery\".\n\nThe downturn in \"Connected Home\" sales is in line with our forecasts at the start of the year. It can be explained by a first quarter 2023 which saw an exceptional level of deliveries with some of our biggest customers, both Vantiva and Home Networks. The return to normal with these customers and a general downturn in business, linked to the need to clear inventories, are therefore at the root of this downturn. A sequential improvement is expected from the second quarter of 2024 onwards.\n\nThe integration of the Home Networks business is proceeding according to plan, and the group is accelerating the implementation of synergies, which should reach, net of costs, around 40 million euros by 2024 and exceed 200 million euros from 2026 onwards.\n\nThe \"SCS\" business also saw a decline in sales, albeit more contained. Diversification activities helped limit the impact of the structural decline in demand for optical disks.\n\nAfter interest and taxes and before restructuring and Home Networks acquisition costs\n\n\"Connected Home\" sales totaled 358 million euros in the first quarter, down 21.7% despite the contribution of Home Networks activities for 2024, and accounted for 78% of group sales (80% in Q1 2023). At constant exchange rates, the decline would have been 20.8% compared with Q1 2023 as reported.\n\nSales were impacted by continued weak activity due to order reductions by our customers in a context of destocking, and also by a particularly high basis for comparison due to an exceptional level of deliveries with certain strategic customers in North America and Europe.\n\nThe integration of Home Networks explains the sharp rise in Video sales.\n\nDiversification activities contributed 18 million euros, and the group signed new contracts for its \"Internet of Things\" (IoT) activities.\n\nSupply Chain Solutions\n\nFirst quarter SCS sales totaled 100 million euros, representing 22% of group sales (20% in Q1 2023). This represents a 13.2% decline compared with Q1 2023, and at constant exchange rates would have been down 12.4%. This variation is the result of contrasting trends: demand for optical discs continues to fall, but is partially offset by price increases, while sales of vinyl discs and logistics services have risen.\n\nThis press release contains certain statements that constitute \"forward-looking statements\", including but not limited to statements that are predictions of or indicate future events, trends, plans or objectives, based on certain assumptions or which do not directly relate to historical or current facts.

This represents a 13.2% decline compared with Q1 2023, and at constant exchange rates would have been down 12.4%.

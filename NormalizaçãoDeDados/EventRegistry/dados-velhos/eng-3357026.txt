out at the World Athletics Championships' organisers in London as Usain Bolt labelled the delay to his final race on Saturday \"crazy\", with the sprint legend ending his career in agony after being struck down by injury.\n\nAs Great Britain powered their way to a stunning gold in the men's 4x100m relay with the third-quickest time in history, Bolt was struck down midway through his stint with what has been revealed as cramp in his left leg.\n\nThe race started 10 minutes later than planned, with the teams being held in the warm-up area for nearly 30 minutes before they were able to run out into the London Stadium, and Bolt's teammate Yohan Blake spoke afterwards of their concern with how the preparations were dragging on.\n\nUsain Bolt's best moments 10 show all Usain Bolt's best

celebrates crossing the line for his eighth Olympic gold in the 200m final\n\nGetty\n\nThe concern was so great that Bolt turned to Blake before the raise to express his unhappiness, and Blake furiously hit out at organisers immediately after the race after having to watch the women's high jump medal presentation overrun.\n\n\"I think they were holding us too long in the call room,\" Blake said on Saturday night. \"The walk was too long. Usain was really cold. In fact Usain said to me, 'Yohan, I think this is crazy'.\n\n'No regrets' for Usain Bolt after 100m final\n\n\"It was 40 minutes and two medal presentations before our run. We keep warming up and waiting, then warming up and waiting. I think it got the better of us.\n\n\"We were over warm. And to see a true legend, a true champion go out there and struggling like that...The race was 10 minutes late, we were kept 40 minutes and it was a 300 metre walk. It was crazy.\"\n\nRead more Great Britain storm to surprise gold in men's 4x100m relay final\n\nJamaica failed to finish the race as Bolt lay prone on the track, but he dismissed the aid of a wheelchair to get up and cross the line before waving goodbye to the crowd, with Bolt now unlikely to race in Zurich as had been hinted if the injury proves worse than first feared. The Jamaican team medic, Dr Kevin Jones, played down any long-term injuries though and claimed the injury was just cramp.\n\n\"It's cramp in his left hamstring but a lot of pain is from disappointment from losing the race,\" Dr Jones said. \"The last three weeks have been hard for him, you know. We hope for the best for him.\"\n\nGreat Britain and USA were ahead of Jamaica when Bolt suffered injury (Getty)\n\nHowever, his other two sprint teammates, Omar McLeod and Julian Forte, were in agreement with Blake that 30-year-old Bolt's final farewell had been doomed to fail because of the delays.\n\n\"It's heart-wrenching,\" said 110m hurdle gold medallist McLeod. \"I gave it my all and I really wanted Usain to leave golden, or even if it was just a medal, it was really heart-wrenching.\n\n\"I couldn't believe it, I'm in shock, utter disbelief.\n\n\"It was ridiculous, man. We were there around 45 minutes waiting outside, I think they had three medal ceremonies before we went out so we were really trying our hardest to stay warm and keep upbeat, but it was ridiculous. We waited a really long time. I drank like two bottles of water.\"\n\nBolt was struck down while running the final leg for Jamaica (Getty)\n\nForte added: \"I really wanted to be a part of the team that sends Usain off in style. Unfortunately it's one of those things, it's part of sport.\n\n\"They kept us in the call room for an extremely long time in our running kits, and it's not the warmest over here and they had us around there for quite a while, so I think they really need to look into that and do something about it.\n\n\"We were excited, we were ready, we had been doing some hand offs and everybody was feeling good, but they kept us hanging around for a long time, you know. So it's just really crazy.\"\n\nJamaica failed to finish due to Bolt's injury (Getty)\n\nThe frustration with the long wait before the race was not contained to the Jamaican team, with USA sprinter and 100m gold medallist Justin Gatlin expressing sympathy for his long-time rival Bolt as he agreed with the cause of the injury.\n\n\"You can't really have this night or championship define what he's done in the past. From 2008 on, Usain Bolt has done amazing things. Tonight is not going to define who he is. He is still the man,\" said Gatlin, whose USA team finished runner-up to Great Britain.\n\n\"This is a farewell tour, we take our hats off to him and we hope he gets better.\n\n\"I know it's TV magic, and everybody has to be prepared on time to make everything happen for the viewers at home, (but) I personally think that we were held in the stadium a little too long without our clothes on, and there was a little draught in there. I lost all my sweat and body heat.\n\nBolt's teammates believe the pre-race delayed caused his injury (Getty)\n\nWhen asked if he thought that contributed to Bolt's injury, the 35-year-old Gatlin said: \"I believe so.\n\n\"Knowing how Usain performs, he's always ready, he's always making sure he's not injured and it's very rare to see Usain injured when he comes to performances.\"\n\nGatlin believes Bolt will run again despite his planned retirement (Reuters)\n\nHowever, Gatlin believes that London 2017 will not be the last time that Bolt is seen on the track.\n\n\"I'm going to win my 100, he's coming back in a year or two,\" Gatlin added. \"He'll be ready. He has a passion for the sport, he loves the fans, the fans love him. It's something you can't walk away too easy from.\"\n\nMore about: World Athletics Championships Usain Bolt Yohan Blake Reuse content", "time": "09:37:00"}

crashing to an end when he pulled up on the anchor leg of the world 4x100m relay won by Britain on Saturday.\n\nBolt received the baton with Jamaica in third, but halfway down his leg the towering sprinter pulled up clutching his left thigh, eventually doing a forward roll to the ground, to gasps from the 60,000 sell out London Stadium.\n\nThe British quartet of Chijindu Ujah, Adam Gemili, Daniel Talbot and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake claimed gold in 37.47 seconds, with the Justin Gatlin-led US four taking silver at 0.05sec and Japan a surprise bronze (38.04).\n\nBolt missed out on his bid to retain his 100m title earlier in the week, losing out to Gatlin and silver medallist Christian Coleman, who ran relay anchor for the Americans on Saturday.\n\nBut hopes were high for Bolt's final competitive race, with Jamaica also boasting newly-crowned 110m hurdles champion Omar McLeod, Julian Forte and Yohan Blake in their line-up.\n\nJamaica were afforded a rousing welcome from the crowd, Bolt applauding the stands, with pictures of him constantly shown on the stadium's big screens.\n\nGatlin and the US team also including another convicted doping cheat, Mike Rodgers, and Jaylen Bacon were booed when introduced although the jeering was less than for the individual 100m event.\n\nA close first three legs saw Britain, the United States and Jamaica level-pegged for the final leg.\n\nBut there was to be drama as a visibly swearing Bolt pulled up, allowing the Japanese quartet to nip in for third.\n\nThe result means Bolt, 100 and 200m world record holder, finishes his career with 14 world medals to go with eight Olympic golds.\n\nUsain Bolt retired from track and field championships after Jamaica in the 4x100m relay at the world championships in London.\n\nUnfortunately there was to be no fairytale as he pulled up and collapsed injured on the track running the anchor leg.\n\nHere AFP Sports looks at his glittering career in numbers.\n\n1: World bronze, after being beaten in the 100m in London 2017 by Americans Justin Gatlin and Christian Coleman\n\n3: The number of Olympic treble sprint doubles, in Beijing 2008, London 2012 and Rio 2016. It should have been a treble treble including all three relay titles, but teammate Nesta Carter tested positive for doping in the Chinese capital\n\n4: Times Bolt has been named Laureus World Sportsman of the Year: 2009, 2010, 2013, 2017\n\n5: The number of sprinters to have beaten Bolt over 100m: Gatlin, Coleman, Jamaica's Asafa Powell, American Tyson Gay and Antigua's Daniel Bailey\n\n6: Times Bolt has won the IAAF Male Athlete of the Year: 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2016\n\n9.63: the second fastest time ever run, when Bolt scorched to 100m gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics\n\n14: world medals amassed since making his debut in Helsinki in 2005, when he finished eighth and last in the 200m final\n\n14.35: the world best Bolt set over 150 metres in Manchester, England, in 2009. He ran the final 100 metres in a startling 8.70sec, the fastest time ever recorded\n\n30.97: His best time over the rarely-run 300m, set in 2010. Only South African Wayde van Niekerk and American Michael Johnson have gone faster\n\n31: The Jamaican turns 31 on August 21\n\n36.84: The world record for the 4x100m relay set at the London Olympics, Bolt anchoring a team also comprising Nesta Carter, Michael Frater and Yohan Blake. Bolt had been part of two previous world relay records, in Beijing in 2008 (though this was later voided) and at the 2011 Daegu worlds\n\n37.58: Bolt's average speed in km/h (23.35mph) in his 100m world record race. Should you subtract his reaction time of 0.15sec, his time is actually 9.43sec, making his average speed 38.18km/h (23.72mph)\n\n41: The number of strides it took for Bolt to cover the 100m on his record-setting run in the German capital\n\n44.72: Top speed in km/h (27.79mph) reached during his 100m run in Berlin in 2009, between the 60 to 80-metre mark\n\n53: The number of times Bolt has run sub-10 second 100m races\n\n34.2 million: Dollars earned by Bolt last year according to a list of the world's richest sportspeople by Forbes magazine", "time": "04:39:00"}

I'm sorry he got this injury. He is still the best in the world,\" Gatlin said.\n\n\"This is farewell time, I am sentimental about it already now. In the warm-up area, we give ourselves respect and greeted each other. Usain Bolt is a great athlete,\" he added.\n\nThe event was eventually won by the Great Britain.

The man we once cheered was already gone.\n\nUsain Bolt would have won. The Usain Bolt we carry in our hearts would have roared back from third place Saturday in the final race of his career, won gold in the 4x100-meter relay and engraved his legacy with one last thrilling victory.\n\nUsain Bolt was not in London for the 2017 World Championships. Someone else showed up in his place -- this Other Bolt who finished third in the 100 last week, then caught a cramp in the 4x100 and could not finish the race.\n\nUsain Bolt is the man with three world records, nine Olympic triumphs and countless come-from-behind victories, who said in Rio last summer, \"There was no one on that track that could outrun me to the finish.\"\n\nThe Other Bolt was outrun to the finish three times in London -- and that was just in the 100. So, when the Other Bolt got the baton in third place on the 4x100 anchor leg, it was clear he was not going to win.\n\nIt was the worst possible ending for an athlete whose performances and personality kept his struggling sport afloat. Despite this disastrous final meet, Usain Bolt remains the greatest sprinter of all time and one of the most thrilling and popular athletes ever. The memories of the Other Bolt will fade, just as they did of so many other greats who chose not to leave at their peak. Which is their right -- to compete as long as their sport gives them joy, not as long as they show us what we want to see.\n\n\"No one wants to see Usain go out like that, with an injury on the track in that way,\" said Justin Gatlin, who took gold in the 100 and helped the U.S. men win silver in the 4x100 relay. Great Britain won the relay and China finished third.\n\n\"He's done so much from 2008 to now,\" Gatlin added. \"I think we can look past everything that happened in this championship and congratulate him on his legendary career.\"\n\nBolt always said his joy came from the fans. Asked why he didn't retire after Rio, his third consecutive Olympics with three gold medals, Bolt said he wanted to run one more season so the people could feel him one more time -- and vice versa.\n\nThat made his ending even sadder. The 60,000 faithful fans who came to Olympic Stadium to witness history Saturday were deprived of the traditional last lap around the stadium. The sporting world went to bed without a word from their hero. There would be no iconic \"To Di World\" pose -- he went straight to the infirmary and left the arena without a public word. The Jamaican team doctor, Kevin Jones, said he was struck down by a cramp in his left hamstring, \"but a lot of pain is from the disappointment of losing the race.\"\n\nOne has to wonder what the Other Bolt thought as he took the baton on the anchor leg, exited the exchange zone and found himself one stride behind American Christian Coleman and two behind Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake of Great Britain.\n\nHe took six strides toward the finish line of his career. The gap did not close. On the seventh, he threw his head back with a grimace, hopped twice to keep weight off his left leg and somersaulted to the track.\n\nDid he realize he could not win? What I'm about to say would be inconceivable for Usain Bolt, but ... since his reign began at the 2008 Olympics, he had never been injured in a major race. Could the Other Bolt have chosen to succumb to a twinge in his own body rather than lose to another man?\n\nBlasphemy, I know.\n\nBolt is 31, with a history of niggling back and hamstring injuries. Is there any graceful way to age? On Saturday, the runners were kept waiting longer than scheduled before their race as the temperature dipped toward 60 degrees. His heart has never been questioned. Enough of that.\n\nIt did seem like his heart was elsewhere this final season, though. Maybe with his close friend Germaine Mason, whose fatal motorcycle accident in April left Bolt despondent. Or skipping ahead to a life that doesn't require a Spartan existence and vomit-inducing workouts. Bolt made more than $60 million in 2016. The good life beckons.\n\n\"He's a living legend and we look up to him respectfully,\" said Sashalee Forbes, a Jamaican sprinter who won bronze in the women's 4x100. \"He shows us whether you're down or not, you still can get across that finish line.\"\n\nThe Other Bolt limped across the finish line, through the tunnel and disappeared. Let him go. Let's hold on to the memory of Usain Bolt, in first place.", "time": "02:46:00"}

Jamaica's Usain Bolt lies on the track after pulling up injured in the final of the men's 4x100m relay athletics event at the 2017 IAAF World Championships. Andrej Isakovic/AFP\n\nLONDON, United Kingdom - Usain Bolt's glittering career swansong came crashing to an end when he pulled up with a leg cramp on the anchor leg of the world 4x100m relay won by Britain at the IAAF World Championships on Saturday, August 12.\n\nBolt received the baton with Jamaica in 3rd, but halfway down the finishing straight the towering sprinter pulled up clutching his left thigh, eventually doing a forward somersault to the ground, to gasps from the 60,000 sell out London Stadium.\n\nThe British quartet of Chijindu Ujah, Adam Gemili, Daniel Talbot and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake claimed gold in 37.47 seconds, with the Justin Gatlin-led US 4 taking silver at 0.05sec and Japan a surprise bronze (38.04).\n\nJamaican team doctor Dr Kevin Jones said Bolt had suffered from \"cramp in his left hamstring\".\n\n\"But a lot of pain is from disappointment from losing the race,\" Jones said.\n\n\"The last 3 weeks have been hard for him, you know. We hope for the best for him.\"\n\nSecond leg runner Julian Forte added: \"He didn't tell us exactly what happened but from what I saw, it looked like a strain or a cramp of some sort.\n\n\"He kept apologizing to us but we told him there was no need to apologize - injuries are part of the sport.\"\n\nNewly-crowned 110m hurdles champion Omar McLeod, Jamaica's lead-off runner, added: \"Everybody was jelly, everybody was pumped. (Bolt's injury) just happened. Usain Bolt's name will always live on.\"\n\nBolt missed out on his bid to retain his 100m title earlier in the week, losing out to Gatlin and silver medallist Christian Coleman, who ran relay anchor for the Americans on Saturday.\n\nBut hopes were high for Bolt's final competitive race, with Jamaica also boasting McLeod, Forte and 2011 world champion Yohan Blake in their line-up.\n\nJamaica were afforded a rousing welcome from the crowd, a relaxed-looking Bolt applauding the stands, with pictures of him constantly shown on the stadium's big screens.\n\nGatlin, who has served two doping bans, and the US team also including another convicted doping cheat, Mike Rodgers, and Jaylen Bacon were booed when introduced although the jeering was less pronounced than for the individual 100m event.\n\nA close first 3 legs saw Britain, the United States and Jamaica, seeking a 5th consecutive world title, level-pegged for the final leg.\n\nHigh drama\n\nBut there was to be high drama as a visibly swearing Bolt pulled up in obvious pain, allowing the Japanese quartet to edge in for 3rd.\n\nThe result means Bolt, 100 and 200m world record holder, finishes his career with 14 world career medals, one behind American Allyson Felix, to go with 8 Olympic golds.\n\nAmid wild home celebrations, Bolt was attended to by medics, but refused a ride in a wheelchair off the track, instead finally getting up and limping alongside his teammates through to the finish line and then off into the bowels of the stadium for treatment.\n\nIt was a sad exit for an athlete who has lit up the track when the sport has been dragged through its worst-ever crisis, racked by doping and corruption scandals that went to the very heart of athletics' governing body.\n\nAnd what a gaping hole his absence will leave, no matter how brave a face the IAAF try to put on it.\n\nSince confirming his sprinting dominance with triple gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Bolt spent 9 seasons amassing 19 global golds, 13 of which have come in individual events.\n\nAllied with a charismatic personality, it has guaranteed Bolt recognition as one of the world's most successful sportsmen. Last year alone he earned $34.2 million, according to Forbes. - Rappler.com", "time": "02:34:00"}

the anchor leg of the world 4x100m relay won by Britain on Saturday.\n\nBolt received the baton with Jamaica in third, but halfway down the finishing straight the towering sprinter pulled up clutching his left thigh, eventually doing a forward somersault to the ground, to gasps from the 60,000 sell out London Stadium.\n\nThe British quartet of Chijindu Ujah, Adam Gemili, Daniel Talbot and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake claimed gold in 37.47 seconds, with the Justin Gatlin-led US four taking silver at 0.05sec and Japan a surprise bronze (38.04).\n\nJamaican team doctor Dr Kevin Jones said Bolt had suffered from \"cramp in his left hamstring.\"\n\n\"But a lot of pain is from disappointment from losing the race,\" Jones said.\n\nMedical staff attends to Jamaica's Usain Bolt after injuring himself during the final of the men's 4x100m relay athletics event at the 2017 IAAF World Championships at the London Stadium in London on August 12, 2017. / AFP PHOTO / Antonin THUILLIER\n\n\"The last three weeks have been hard for him, you know. We hope for the best for him.\"\n\nSecond leg runner Julian Forte added: \"He didn't tell us exactly what happened but from what I saw, it looked like a strain or a cramp of some sort.\n\n\"He kept apologizing to us but we told him there was no need to apologize -- injuries are part of the sport.\"\n\nNewly-crowned 110m hurdles champion Omar McLeod, Jamaica's lead-off runner, added: \"Everybody was jelly, everybody was pumped. (Bolt's injury) just happened. Usain Bolt's name will always live on.\"\n\nBolt missed out on his bid to retain his 100m title earlier in the week, losing out to Gatlin and silver medalist Christian Coleman, who ran relay anchor for the Americans on Saturday.\n\nBut hopes were high for Bolt's final competitive race, with Jamaica also boasting McLeod, Forte and 2011 world champion Yohan Blake in their line-up.\n\nJamaica were afforded a rousing welcome from the crowd, a relaxed-looking Bolt applauding the stands, with pictures of him constantly shown on the stadium's big screens.\n\nGatlin, who has served two doping bans, and the US team also including another convicted doping cheat, Mike Rodgers, and Jaylen Bacon were booed when introduced although the jeering was less pronounced than for the individual 100m event.\n\nA close first three legs saw Britain, the United States and Jamaica, seeking a fifth consecutive world title, level-pegged for the final leg.\n\nHigh drama\n\nBut there was to be high drama as a visibly swearing Bolt pulled up in obvious pain, allowing the Japanese quartet to edge in for third.\n\nThe result means Bolt, 100 and 200m world record holder, finishes his career with 14 world career medals, one behind American Allyson Felix, to go with eight Olympic golds.\n\nAmid wild home celebrations, Bolt was attended to by medics, but refused a ride in a wheelchair off the track, instead finally getting up and limping alongside his teammates through to the finish line and then off into the bowels of the stadium for treatment.\n\nIt was a sad exit for an athlete who has lit up the track when the sport has been dragged through its worst-ever crisis, racked by doping and corruption scandals that went to the very heart of athletics' governing body.\n\nAnd what a gaping hole his absence will leave, no matter how brave a face the IAAF try to put on it.\n\nSince confirming his sprinting dominance with triple gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Bolt spent nine seasons amassing 19 global golds, 13 of which have come in individual events.\n\nAllied with a charismatic personality, it has guaranteed Bolt recognition as one of the world's most successful sportsmen.

It was crazy.\n\n\"They were holding us too long.\"\n\nBolt had hoped to bring an end to his career with another two gold medals in London but leaves with only a bronze from last weekend's 100m.\n\nAnd, seconds after taking the baton for Jamaica's anchor leg, he pulled up and tumbled to the floor with Dr Kevin Jones, Jamaica's team doctor, confirming Bolt had cramp in his left hamstring.\n\n\"It was 40 minutes and two medal presentations before our run,\" added former world 100m champion Blake.\n\n\"We keep warming up and waiting, then warming up and waiting. I think it got the better of us.\n\n\"It hurts to see a true legend, a true champion go out there and struggle like that.\"\n\n110m hurdle champion Omar McLeod, who led out the Jamaican team which had won the 4x100m relay in each of the last four world championships, echoed the criticism of delays at the start of the final.\n\nMo Farah's lap of honour after his second place in the 5,000m final seemed to delay the schedule, with Farah also receiving his medal before the relay final.\n\n\"It's heart-wrenching,\" he said. \"I gave it my all and I really wanted Usain to leave golden, or even if it was just a medal.\n\n\"It was ridiculous, man.

Usain Bolt is a great athlete.\"\n\n\"I think it was just one season too many,\" said former Olympic champion Michael Johnson.\n\n\"I think Bolt was prepared to not win but I don't think he would have expected his last race to end like that.

We saw him in a way we have never seen before. In the 100m straining to try to finish and now we see him limping.\"\n\nFormer Olympic medallist Darren Campbell believes that Bolt's impact off the track is almost as hard to replace as his skill and records on it.\n\nBolt's charisma, charm and character have made him one of the most recognisable and marketable people on the planet.\n\n\"Any stadium that Usain Bolt decides to grace ends up being full, that tells you all you need to know,\" Campbell said.\n\n\"What we are witnessing is so powerful, so inspirational, he can't be replaced. How do you replace him - as a sports star and a human being?\n\n\"Usain Bolt treats you the same whether you are a dignitary or the poorest man in the world.

It was crazy.\n\n\"They were holding us too long.\"\n\nBolt had hoped to bring an end to his career with another two gold medals in London but leaves with only a bronze from last weekend's 100m.\n\nAnd, seconds after taking the baton for Jamaica's anchor leg, he pulled up and tumbled to the floor with Dr Kevin Jones, Jamaica's team doctor, confirming Bolt had cramp in his left hamstring.\n\n\"It was 40 minutes and two medal presentations before our run,\" added former world 100m champion Blake.\n\n\"We keep warming up and waiting, then warming up and waiting. I think it got the better of us.\n\n\"It hurts to see a true legend, a true champion go out there and struggle like that.\"\n\n110m hurdle champion Omar McLeod, who led out the Jamaican team which had won the 4x100m relay in each of the last four world championships, echoed the criticism of delays at the start of the final.\n\nMo Farah's lap of honour after his second place in the 5,000m final seemed to delay the schedule, with Farah also receiving his medal before the relay final.\n\n\"It's heart-wrenching,\" he said. \"I gave it my all and I really wanted Usain to leave golden, or even if it was just a medal.\n\n\"It was ridiculous, man. We waited a really long time. I drank two bottles of water.\n\n\"But Usain Bolt's name will always live on.\"\n\n100m champion Justin Gatlin called Bolt 'still the best in the world' after he won silver behind Great Britain, and also felt that the weather may have played a part in Bolt's injury.\n\n\"I think it was the elements (that caused the injury),\" he said. \"I'm sorry he got this injury. He is still the best in the world.\n\n\"This is farewell time, I am sentimental about it already now. In the warm-up area, we give ourselves respect and greeted each other. Usain Bolt is a great athlete.\"\n\n\"I think it was just one season too many,\" said former Olympic champion Michael Johnson.\n\n\"I think Bolt was prepared to not win but I don't think he would have expected his last race to end like that. He would have wanted to cross the finish line.\n\n\"Even if he was just closing on the guys ahead - he wanted to give this crowd a show so they can say \"I saw Usain Bolt run down the finishing straight.\"\n\n\"That was disappointing to see. We saw him in a way we have never seen before. In the 100m straining to try to finish and now we see him limping.\"\n\nFormer Olympic medallist Darren Campbell believes that Bolt's impact off the track is almost as hard to replace as his skill and records on it.\n\nBolt's charisma, charm and character have made him one of the most recognisable and marketable people on the planet.\n\n\"Any stadium that Usain Bolt decides to grace ends up being full, that tells you all you need to know,\" Campbell said.\n\n\"What we are witnessing is so powerful, so inspirational, he can't be replaced. How do you replace him - as a sports star and a human being?\n\n\"Usain Bolt treats you the same whether you are a dignitary or the poorest man in the world. That's a unique skill.\n\n\"Whether he was a successful sports person or not, I think he would still have that flamboyant character. How do you teach that?

-- Reuters pic London, August 12 -- Usain Bolt's bid to bring the curtain down on his glittering career with a 15th world gold medal remained on track as Jamaica qualified for the final of the 4x100m relay.\n\nBolt took the unusual step of racing the relay heats, something usually reserved for the more unheralded members of the squad.\n\nTyquendo Tracey, Julian Forte and Michael Campbell safely negotiated the first three legs before Bolt steered his team home in a winning, season's best of 37.95 seconds.\n\n\"It's been brilliant. The energy in the stadium is outstanding,\" Bolt said, hailing the deafening support in the packed-out London Stadium \"not just for me but the whole championships\".\n\nBolt said his emotions were still in check at the thought of bowing out of track and field.\n\n\"For me it's hard to be sad because the energy I'm getting from the crowd is brilliant, I'm just happy.\"\n\nBolt's bid to retain his 100m title went up in smoke as American Justin Gatlin won gold, with Christian Coleman taking silver.\n\nIt was the first time Bolt had been beaten at a major championships since the 4x100m relay at the 2007 worlds in Osaka.\n\nThe 100 and 200m world record holder, who also anchored the Jamaican squad to a world record in the relay of 36.84sec at the 2012 London Olympics, will be back at the track for the final at 2050 GMT.\n\nBolt has amassed eight Olympic golds and 14 world medals, 11 of which are gold, the Jamaican having won two silvers in 2007 before his 100m bronze in London.\n\nNo matter the result of the relay, organisers said Bolt will be afforded a dedicated lap of honour on Sunday in tribute to his amazing track career.\n\nGatlin ran the second leg for the US team, led off by Mike Rodgers, another dope cheat, BeeJay Lee and Coleman on anchor.\n\nThey clocked 37.70 seconds to finish 0.06sec ahead of Britain.\n\nAlso qualifying for the final were France, China, Japan, Turkey and Canada. -- AFP", "time": "10:58:00"}

cruellest as Usain Leo Bolt pulled up hurt in his final competitive race to end, in a cry of pain and agony, a decade of dominance that is unrivalled in the history of track and field.\n\nBolt failed to finish the men's 4x100m relay race of the World Athletics Championships here after he pulled a hamstring at the home straight.\n\nThe astonishing turn of events marred what was expected to be a golden farewell.\n\nRunning the final race of his career, the 30-year-old Bolt, after taking the baton from his Jamaican teammate Yohan Blake, suffered cramps on his left hamstring as he tried, in vain, to chase down the British and American rivals in the last lap of the race.\n\nNeeding to make a lot of ground, Bolt began his familiar initial long strides but could not produce the trademark explosive burst of speed and suddenly stumbled, hobbled a few strides before falling on the track in pain and agony.\n\n\"It's cramp in his left hamstring but a lot of pain is from disappointment from losing the race. The last three weeks have been hard for him. We hope for the best for him,\" Jamaican team doctor Kevin Jones said later.\n\nIt was a terrible sight at the Olympic stadium, the theatre of his three gold winning exploits in the 2012 Olympic Games. Bolt went down on his knees with hands on his head in dejection and was then lying alone on the tracks for a while before Blake and the other teammates, Julian Forte and Omar McLeod, gathered around him.\n\nThe towering Jamaican, who had dominated the sprint race like nobody else, was helped to his feet. As he limped over the finishing line, the crowd applauded him.\n\nThe result sheet, however, showed DNF (Did Not Finish) against the Jamaicans.\n\nThe scene this weekend was more heartbreaking than last Saturday when Bolt was beaten by his long-time rival Justin Gatlin in the 100m dash in his last individual race.\n\nThe last time, Bolt took a lap of honour to acknowledge the support and adulation of the crowd. But this time, there was no lap of honour and with Britain winning the gold, the crowd gave more attention to their home heroes and Bolt disappeared to the medical room.\n\nFor that matter, there was no kissing of the finish line nor the celebrated \"Lightening Bolt' pose, which fans around the world got used to all these years. The showman actually did not turn up on this night.\n\nIn fact, it looked like the lap of honour he took while winning the bronze in the 100m dash on August 5 would be his final farewell to the crowd. But it is learnt that the IAAF and local organisers have decided to arrange a lap of honour on the final day of the championships.\n\nBritain won the gold in 37.47 seconds while United States (38.01) and Japan took the silver and bronze respectively. Bolt would have had his task cut out, if he did not suffer the injury, to fight his way into the gold medal picture, as he was some three meters behind the British counterpart when he took the baton from Blake.\n\nGatlin, who was booed by the London crowd for snatching the gold medal from Bolt in the 100m, paid a tribute to his rival.\n\n\"Usain Bolt is a great athlete. I am sorry he got this injury. I think it was the elements. But he is still the best in the world,\" said Gatlin.\n\n\"You can't let these championships define what he has done in the past. He has done amazing things. He's still the man, you know. The was his farewell race and we wish him the best and hope he recovers soon,\" added the American who ran the second leg in the relay race.\n\n\"Usain's name will always live on,\" Bolt's team-mate Omar McLeod, who ran the first leg, said.\n\nBolt ended the World Championships in disappointment by collecting just a bronze but he will still be considered the greatest sprinter of all time and saviour of a sport for long mired in doping controversies.\n\nNo man has ever dominated sprint like Bolt since he won a gold each in the 100m and 200m in the 2008 Beijing Olympics and for nearly 10 years, he strode like a colossus with his running prowess and charisma.\n\nHe has won eight Olympic and 11 World Championships gold medals before coming here.\n\nHe has won three gold each in all three Olympics he has taken part, but returned the gold he won in 4x100m relay in Beijing after team-mate Nesta Carter tested positive for a prohibited substance. He has won three gold in all World Championships from 2009 till this edition, except the 100m event in 2011, when he false started to be disqualified.\n\nHe has also won a silver each in 200m and 4x100m relay in the 2007 Osaka World Championships. Taking into account the bronze in 100m here, he has won 22 medals in Olympics and World Championships taken together, with 19 of them gold.\n\nThe 'Muhammed Ali of Athletics', as christened by world athletics body boss Sebastian Coe, Bolt is one of the most charismatic athletes across all sports and he would be remembered as someone who has brought more fans to athletics at a time when public cynicism of the sport was on the rise due to doping controversies.\n\nThe latest -- and the biggest -- controversy to hit athletics was the Russian scandal in which the country was accused of systematic state-sponsored doping programme.\n\nDespite these scandals, Bolt kept the fans intact, his exploits and charisma brought more youngsters to the sport, a fact Coe has admitted.\n\nBolt's successes are unprecedented and all the short sprint records are his. He holds the 100m (9.58 seconds) and 200m (19.19 seconds) world records -- both of them set during the 2009 Berlin World Championships.\n\nSince 2007, he has run 54 100m races (excluding heats) and won all but six. In 200m races since 2008, he has lost just one out of 30.\n\nHe emerged as a prodigious talent for the first time by winning the 200m as a 15-year-old in the 2002 World Junior Championships at his hometown Kingston. He then won another 200m gold in the World Youth Championships in Canada. Bolt's young career was, however, rocked by injuries for a few years, but he came back stronger in 2006.\n\nBolt was initially thought to be more suited to run in 200m and 400m as he had difficulty in smoothly starting out of the blocks but, in 2007, his celebrated coach Glenn Mills, who has been with him since 2005, allowed him to run the 100m.\n\nIn his native Jamaica, he is the most well-known athlete -- and possibly the most famous public figure. Thousands turned out in his domestic farewell event in Kingston earlier this year.\n\nHis exit from the competitive stage -- though the IAAF wants him to be associated as global brand ambassador -- will bring shudders to athletics bosses.\n\nBolt's clean image has been a contrast to his long-time rival Gatlin, who is considered the opposite of the Jamaican.\n\nAnd the IAAF has banked on the Jamaican's clean image to shield the dope-tainted sport.\n\nOne of the richest sportspersons in the world, he reportedly earns more than USD 30 million a year, mostly through endorsements.\n\nThe greatest entertainer that athletics -- perhaps all sports -- have known, Bolt, unlike Ali, has rarely given opinions on issues beyond sport.\n\nBut the Jamaican wants to coin superlatives about himself like the boxing legend, and fans and media lapped up the idea.\n\nJust before this championships, he had demanded that the world write one last headline about him -- \"Unbeatable. Unstoppable\".\n\nJust after his 200m triumph at the 2012 London Olympics, he had declared, \"I am a living legend. Bask in my glory!\"\n\nThe world will continue to bask in his glory!", "time": "07:38:00"}

Ajomale (R) and Cuba's Jose Luis Gaspar to win their heat in the 4x100m relay at the IAAF World Championships at the London Stadium in London, on August 12, 2017 \u00a9 AFP / Jewel SAMAD\n\nLONDON, United Kingdom, Aug 12 - Usain Bolt's bid to bring the curtain down on his glittering career with a 15th world gold medal remained on track as Jamaica qualified for the final of the 4x100m relay.\n\nBolt took the unusual step of racing the relay heats, something usually reserved for the more unheralded members of the squad.\n\nTyquendo Tracey, Julian Forte and Michael Campbell safely negotiated the first three legs before Bolt steered his team home in a winning, season's best of 37.95 seconds.\n\n\"It's been brilliant. The energy in the stadium is outstanding,\" Bolt said, hailing the deafening support in the packed-out London Stadium \"not just for me but the whole championships\".\n\nBolt said his emotions were still in check at the thought of bowing out of track and field.\n\n\"For me it's hard to be sad because the energy I'm getting from the crowd is brilliant, I'm just happy.\n\n\"There are no words to describe how I am feeling.\"\n\nBolt acknowledged that Yohan Blake would likely come in for the final, all the while praising his less experienced relay teammates.\n\n\"The young runners in our team -- it is just about executing and coming through the race for them,\" he said.\n\n\"We have been training that relay, there were some camps. Still there were some mistakes. Yohan Blake coming in for the final is definitely good.\"\n\nBolt's bid to retain his 100m title went up in smoke as American Justin Gatlin won gold, with Christian Coleman taking silver.\n\nIt was the first time Bolt had been beaten at a major championships since the 4x100m relay at the 2007 worlds in Osaka.\n\nThe 100 and 200m world record holder, who also anchored the Jamaican squad to a world record in the relay of 36.84sec at the 2012 London Olympics, will be back at the track for the final at 2050 GMT.\n\nBolt has amassed eight Olympic golds and 14 world medals, 11 of which are gold, the Jamaican having won two silvers in 2007 before his 100m bronze in London.\n\nNo matter the result of the relay, organisers said Bolt will be afforded a dedicated lap of honour on Sunday in tribute to his amazing track career.\n\nGatlin ran the second leg for the US team, led off by Mike Rodgers, another dope cheat, BeeJay Lee and Coleman on anchor.\n\nThey clocked 37.70 seconds to finish 0.06sec ahead of Britain.\n\n\"It felt good,\" said Rodgers. \"It feels like second nature because we work well together.\n\n\"We are confident we can win. We will go and prepare well for tonight.\"\n\nAlso qualifying for the final were France, China, Japan, Turkey and Canada.\n\nShares", "time": "12:17:00"}

4x100 metres relay final at the World Athletics Championships.\n\nUsain Bolt pulled up with an injury on the anchor leg of the 4x100 metres relay final at the World Athletics Championships on Saturday as the last race of his unparalleled career ended in high drama.\n\nThe 30-year-old had taken the baton for Jamaica a few metres adrift when, straining hard to catch the leaders, he suddenly suffered a hamstring injury, began hobbling and ended up coming to a halt after doing a forward roll on the track.\n\nAfter a short while, though, he rose gingerly to his feet and limped across the line to huge cheers from the 56,000 crowd.\n\nThat wasn't the only surprise. Britain went on to beat the United States in a tight finish.\n\nREAD MORE: Usain Bolt, from strong child to track king\n\nThe 60,000-capacity stadium was primed for one last Bolt show, one last \"To the World\" pose after a victory, but the injury made it blatantly clear why Bolt is ready to retire. His body can no longer hold up.\n\nHis teammates on the once-fabled Jamaican sprint squad were far from unmatchable, too. Bolt had just too much to make up in the final 100 metres as both Britain and the US were ahead and even Japan was even.\n\nAs Bolt fell to the ground, the leg with the golden shoe giving way, the crowd still went wild because the home team went on to win gold in 37.47 seconds, 0.05 seconds ahead of the US.\n\nThe brilliantly executed race by Chijindu Ujah, Adam Gemili, Danny Talbot and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake gave Britain gold in 37.47 seconds, breaking an 18-year-old national record, and the world title for the first time.\n\nThe result means Bolt, 100 and 200m world record holder, finishes his career with 14 world career medals, one behind American Allyson Felix, to go with eight Olympic golds.\n\nAmid wild home celebrations, Bolt was attended to by medics, but refused a ride in a wheelchair off the track, instead finally getting up and limping alongside his teammates through to the finish line and then off into the stadium for treatment.\n\nIt was a sad exit for an athlete who has lit up the track when the sport has been dragged through its worst-ever crisis, racked by doping and corruption scandals that went to the very heart of athletics' governing body.\n\nSince confirming his sprinting dominance with triple gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Bolt spent nine seasons amassing 19 global golds, 13 of which have come in individual events.\n\nAllied with a charismatic personality, it has guaranteed Bolt recognition as one of the world's most successful sportsmen. Last year alone he earned $34.2m, according to Forbes.\n\nAl Jazeera's Sonia Gallego, reporting from London, said Bolt would be remembered as one of the all time great athletes.\n\n\"It's very unlikely that we're going to see anyone of his ilk very soon,\" she said.\n\n\"So really quite a sad end to Usain Bolt's career but hopefully not the end of him as a personality and as an ambassador for the sport.\"\n\nBefore Bolt came onto the track, he was consoling Mo Farah, his long-distance equivalent who had just lost his first major race since 2011 when he failed to get gold in the 5,000 metres.\n\nFarah also was bidding farewell to the track, coming up short of his fifth straight 5,000-10,000 double at major championships in a sprint against Muktar Edris of Ethiopia.\n\nFarah, now 34 years old and a six-time world champion, knew the opposition would be gunning for him. And they did.\n\nThey boxed Farah in. They changed the pace of the race. They made him work hard knowing that his 10,000-metre victory on the opening day of the championships would take something out of his punishing finish.\n\n\"I gave it all,\" Farah said. \"I didn't have a single bit left at the end.\"\n\nAl Jazeera's Sonia Gallego said that Farah's silver was disappointing but that he had made a gracious lap of honour and posed with fans.\n\n\"Certainly a very honourable end for a tremendous athlete and certainly quite sad to see it happen in a place where he had made his name in such spectacular fashion back in the 2012 Olympics,\" said Gallego.\n\nTori Bowie was the unlikely first double gold medalist at the championships, anchoring the US team to the 4x100-metre relay title ahead of Britain and Jamaica.\n\nAt the same time, Allyson Felix, running the second leg on the winning team, earned a record 15th medal at the world championships in a career going back to 2005.\n\nBowie, who won the 100 metres this week, ran a strong anchor leg, leaving behind the opposition to finish in 41.82 seconds.\n\n\"Two gold medals is amazing for me,\" Bowie said. \"We are on top of the world.\"\n\nBritain took silver in 42.12 and two-time defending champion Jamaica earned bronze in 42.19.", "time": "00:00:00"}

Usain was set to run a leg of this race, but Bleacher Report shared that he was actually unable to finish the race due to an injury that happened while he was running his leg of the relay.\n\nHe was running in the 2017 IAAF World Championships in London when Usain ended up pulling up during the race. Hosts Great Britain took the gold medal with a time of 37.47 seconds and of course, Usain's Jamaica team ended up not placing after his injury. He was behind the American and British teams when he got injured and then Usain Bolt also ended up pulling up due to the injury.\n\nUsain Bolt was finally able to cross the finish line, which will be his last time to ever do this due to the fact that he is retiring after this big event. Bolt was the final leg for his team on this race. The Americans were expected to win, but the British team was able to pull it off. Jamaica has won this race the last four times at this event. Usain Bolt is ending his career with 11 World Championships gold medals.\n\nUsain Bolt was actually expected to win his final 100-meter race this week, but that didn't end up happening for him either. Sports Illustrated shared the news that Bolt ended up losing this race. He actually finished in 3rd at the IAAF World Championships in London. Usain Bolt losing this race made it where he also lost his streak. He had won 45 races in a row before this loss. It was also Bolt's first-ever loss in an Olympic or world championship semifinal. Bolt is turning 31-years-old in August and has repeatedly said that he is done after this and won't be going to any more world championships. The fans loved seeing Usain Bolt run one last time, but it was hard to see him end with an injury.\n\nWere you shocked to see Usain Bolt get injured during his leg of the 4X100 relay?

on the anchor leg of the world 4x100m relay won by Britain on Saturday.\n\nBolt received the baton with Jamaica in third, but halfway down the finishing straight the towering sprinter pulled up clutching his left thigh, eventually doing a forward somersault to the ground, to gasps from the 60,000 sell out London Stadium.\n\nThe British quartet of Chijindu Ujah, Adam Gemili, Daniel Talbot and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake claimed gold in 37.47 seconds, with the Justin Gatlin-led US four taking silver at 0.05sec and Japan a surprise bronze (38.04).\n\nJamaican team doctor Dr. Kevin Jones said Bolt had suffered from \"cramp in his left hamstring.\"\n\n\"But a lot of pain is from disappointment from losing the race,\" Jones said.\n\n\"The last three weeks have been hard for him, you know. We hope for the best for him.\"\n\nSecond leg runner Julian Forte added: \"He didn't tell us exactly what happened but from what I saw, it looked like a strain or a cramp of some sort.\n\n\"He kept apologizing to us but we told him there was no need to apologize -- injuries are part of the sport.\"\n\nNewly-crowned 110m hurdles champion Omar McLeod, Jamaica's lead-off runner, added: \"Everybody was jelly, everybody was pumped.

pm Commander Peshawar Corps visits Rajgal Valley, praises troops' morale\n\nUsain Bolt's bid to bring the curtain down on his glittering career with a 15th world gold medal remained on track as Jamaica qualified for the final of the 4x100m relay.\n\nBolt took the unusual step of racing the relay heats, something usually reserved for the more unheralded members of the squad.\n\nTyquendo Tracey, Julian Forte and Michael Campbell safely negotiated the first three legs before Bolt steered his team home in a winning, season's best of 37.95 seconds.\n\n\"It's been brilliant. The energy in the stadium is outstanding,\" Bolt said, hailing the deafening support in the packed-out London Stadium \"not just for me but the whole championships\".\n\nBolt said his emotions were still in check at the thought of bowing out of track and field.\n\n\"For me it's hard to be sad because the energy I'm getting from the crowd is brilliant, I'm just happy.\n\n\"There are no words to describe how I am feeling.\"\n\nBolt acknowledged that Yohan Blake would likely come in for the final, all the while praising his less experienced relay teammates.\n\n\"The young runners in our team -- it is just about executing and coming through the race for them,\" he said.\n\n\"We have been training that relay, there were some camps. Still there were some mistakes. Yohan Blake coming in for the final is definitely good.\"\n\nBolt's bid to retain his 100m title went up in smoke as American Justin Gatlin won gold, with Christian Coleman taking silver.\n\nIt was the first time Bolt had been beaten at a major championships since the 4x100m relay at the 2007 worlds in Osaka.\n\nThe 100 and 200m world record holder, who also anchored the Jamaican squad to a world record in the relay of 36.84sec at the 2012 London Olympics, will be back at the track for the final at 2050 GMT.\n\nBolt has amassed eight Olympic golds and 14 world medals, 11 of which are gold, the Jamaican having won two silvers in 2007 before his 100m bronze in London.\n\nNo matter the result of the relay, organisers said Bolt will be afforded a dedicated lap of honour on Sunday in tribute to his amazing track career.\n\nGatlin ran the second leg for the US team, led off by Mike Rodgers, another dope cheat, BeeJay Lee and Coleman on anchor.\n\nThey clocked 37.70 seconds to finish 0.06sec ahead of Britain.\n\n\"It felt good,\" said Rodgers. \"It feels like second nature because we work well together.\n\n\"We are confident we can win. We will go and prepare well for tonight.\"\n\nAlso qualifying for the final were France, China, Japan, Turkey and Canada.", "time": "14:35:00"}

time, pulled up and fell to the floor with what looked like a hamstring injury.\n\nUsain Bolt's unparalleled career ended in extraordinary drama on Saturday as he pulled up with injury on the anchor leg of his very last race, the 4x100 metres relay final at the World Championships.\n\nThe 30-year-old had taken the baton for Jamaica a few metres adrift of the two leaders when, straining hard to catch them, he stopped abruptly with cramp in his left hamstring, began hobbling and tumbled to a halt after a forward roll.\n\nAs Britain went on to win gold, Bolt lay on his back in his lane, his head in hands, being tended to by medics as one waited with a wheelchair to help push him off the track. Yet the sport's greatest entertainer was determined that one of the finest careers in sport was not going to end with him in a wheelchair.\n\nSo the fastest man of all-time, surrounded by his three worried team mates, Omar McLeod, Julian Forte and Yohan Blake, rose gingerly to his feet and limped the last 30 metres to the line. The official result recorded that the Jamaicans did not finish but Bolt had been absolutely determined to ensure he completed the last race after a matchless career in which he won 19 major championship gold medals.\n\nTypically, Bolt's only thoughts were with the team mates he felt he had let down. \"He kept apologising to us but we told him there was no need to apologise,\" Forte said. \"Injuries are part of the sport.\" McLeod added: \"It just happened - Usain Bolt's name will always live on.\"\n\nTHIRD PLACE\n\nJustin Gatlin, the American winner of the individual 100 metres who had consigned Bolt to third place in his final individual race last Saturday, paid tribute to his rival.\n\n\"I think it was the elements (that caused the injury). I'm sorry he got this injury. He is still the best in the world,\" Gatlin said. \"This is farewell time, I am sentimental about it already now. In the warm-up area, we give ourselves respect and greeted each other. Usain Bolt is a great athlete.\"\n\nKevin Jones, the Jamaican team doctor, said Bolt had suffered cramp in his left hamstring. Blake was angry at having to wait for two medal ceremonies to take place before the race.\n\n\"It was 40 minutes and two medal presentations before our run ... we were kept 40 minutes. It was crazy,\" Blake said. \"They were holding us too long. We keep warming up and waiting, then warming up and waiting. I think it got the better of us. It hurts to see a true legend, a true champion go out there and struggle like that.\"\n\nJamaican team manager Ian Forbes praised Bolt for \"going out there and giving his all\" and added that the squad were \"very saddened\".\n\n\"The diagnostic work will be done shortly to determine how serious it is. He was able to walk to the team bus so hopefully that signals it's not as serious as it possibly could be,\" Forbes said.\n\nWith the 56,000-strong crowd going wild about the British victory, there was still time for them to hail the sport's favourite performer, who waved to them a mite forlornly while hobbling away from the track.\n\nFive years ago, almost to the very night, British distance running hero Mo Farah had broken into Bolt's lightning bolt pose in this same stadium and the Jamaican had reciprocated with the Briton's trademark \"Mobot\" to mark their joyous supremacy at the London Olympics.\n\nYet in the same stadium on Saturday, they attempted in vain to reprise that triumphant night, Farah ending up with silver in his final track race, over 5,000 metres, and Bolt suffering his anti-climactic farewell. Their leaving of the track scene leaves a void in the sport that does not look like being filled any time soon.\n\nHeartbreaking ending to a legendary career: Usain Bolt suffered cramp in his final race at #London2017 and didn't make it to the finish line pic.twitter.com/6zhDnFd5j8 -- People's Daily,China (@PDChina)\n\nAugust 13, 2017", "time": "03:41:00"}

"USAIN Bolt's glittering career swansong came crashing to an end when he pulled up injured on the anchor leg of the 4x100m relay at the World Championships on Sunday morning (AEST).\n\nBolt received the baton with Jamaica in third, but halfway down the finishing straight the towering sprinter pulled up clutching his left thigh, eventually doing a forward somersault to the ground, to gasps from the 60,000 watching on at London Stadium.\n\nThe British quartet of Chijindu Ujah, Adam Gemili, Daniel Talbot and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake claimed gold in 37.47 seconds, with the Justin Gatlin-led US four taking silver and Japan a surprise bronze.\n\nThe result means Bolt, 100 and 200m world record holder, finishes his career with 14 world career medals, one behind American Allyson Felix, to go with eight Olympic golds.\n\nBolt was attended to by medics but refused a ride in a wheelchair off the track, instead finally getting up and limping alongside his teammates through to the finish line and then off into the bowels of the stadium for treatment.\n\nIt was a sad exit for an athlete who has lit up the track when the sport has been dragged through its worst-ever crisis, racked by doping and corruption scandals that went to the very heart of athletics' governing body.\n\nHere's how the world reacted to Bolt's disastrous day.\n\nBolt's teammate Yohan Blake slammed organisers for letting the medal presentation for the women's high jump run overtime, which meant the start of the relay was delayed by roughly 10 minutes.\n\nBlake also said Bolt had a bad feeling before the race about what the delayed start time would mean.\n\n\"A hero of the sport to go down like that, as a true friend, I didn't like it one bit,\" Blake said. \"They were holding us too long.\n\n\"To be holding us so long was atrocious.\n\n\"Usain was getting cold and he said, 'I don't like this'.\n\n\"They were holding us too long.\n\n\"Too many presentations so the race was 10 minutes long. It was cold.\"\n\nJamaican team doctor Kevin Jones later clarified Bolt suffered from a hamstring cramp, but the physical pain was overshadowed by the emotional anguish.\n\n\"It's cramps in his left hamstring but a lot of pain is from the disappointment of losing the race. The last three weeks have been hard for him, we hope for the best,\" Jones said.\n\nJones also reiterated Blake's concerns, saying: \"It was cold back there, and the guys were complaining.\"\n\nAmerican Justin Gatlin, who defeated Bolt in the 100m final while relegating him to third, agreed there was a problem with how the race was organised.\n\n\"We took (our) clothes off a little too early. Bolt was running out there cold.\"\n\nJamaican team not happy with being kept waiting before relay. Meant they got cold. They think Bolt suffered from cramp but too early to say. -- Natalie Pirks (@Natpirks)\n\nAugust 12, 2017\n\nUsain Bolt doesn't need to apologise to anyone. He may think he needs to, but his teammates say he doesn't owe anyone -- least of all them -- anything.\n\n\"He didn't tell us exactly what happened but from what I saw, it looked like a strain or a cramp of some sort,\" second leg runner Julian Forte said.\n\n\"He kept apologising to us but we told him there was no need to apologise -- injuries are part of the sport.\"\n\nNewly-crowned 110m hurdles champion Omar McLeod, Jamaica's lead-off runner, added: \"Everybody was jelly, everybody was pumped. (Bolt's injury) just happened. Usain Bolt's name will always live on.\"\n\nTHE LEGACY LIVES ON\n\nThe World Championships in London have deviated from the perfect script the 30-year-old sprinter's career has seemingly followed for its entirety. But while he missed out on 100m glory to convicted drug cheat Gatlin and left the relay without a medal, his legacy will not suffer.\n\nNew York Times sports writer Christopher Clarey said it was a cruel way for Bolt's career to end, but he will still be remembered as \"not only one of global sport's great athletes but one of its great entertainers, as well\".\n\nBolt's American rival Gatlin said: \"He is still the best in the world.\"\n\nBolt probably one year too many. Sad to see him go down in his final race. Personally I think he has been amazing for the sport. #Respect -- Michael Johnson (@MJGold)\n\nAugust 12, 2017\n\nIt's tough to see Usain Bolt end his career the way he did but his amazing legacy is unscathed. Bolt's the greatest sprinter of all time. -- Tyler Dragon (@TheTylerDragon)\n\nAugust 12, 2017\n\nWow. That was a heartbreaking finish to Bolt's career. Doesn't impact his legacy in my book. Still a transcendent champion. -- Braden Keith (@Braden_Keith)\n\nAugust 12, 2017\n\nSince confirming his sprinting dominance with triple gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Bolt spent nine seasons amassing 19 global golds, 13 of which have come in individual events.\n\nSadness was the overwhelming feeling on social media as Bolt's disaster caused a buzz in the Twittersphere.", "time": "22:49:00"}

"http://www.egyptindependent.com/bolt-gets-jamaica-relay-final-grand-farewell/", "body": "Usain Bolt set the stage for his grand farewell, powering down the finishing straight Saturday to qualify Jamaica for the 4\u00d7100-meter relay final at the world championships.\n\nFittingly, he will face Justin Gatlin and the United States in the final chapter of his unparalleled career.\n\nBoth nations won their heats early Saturday, though the U.S. relay squad got the baton around with more aplomb than Jamaica, which had to rely on Bolt to clinch victory.\n\nAnd Bolt relished the adulation at the 60,000-capacity Olympic Stadium.\n\n\"They've been outstanding so far, and continue to surprise me and give me energy,\" Bolt said.\n\nFor the best part of the past decade, though, Bolt has been 100 percent reliable in getting relay gold for the island nation. The last time Jamaica lost a world championship final was in Bolt's rookie year in 2007, when he ran the second leg and only took silver behind the Americans.\n\nEver since, Bolt has flaunted his power at the end of every major championship, getting the third gold medal for himself and sometimes another world record for Jamaica.\n\nThis year, however, he only got bronze in the 100 behind Gatlin. And the result in the relay is no longer a foregone conclusion.\n\nThe United States, with Gatlin running the second leg, won the first heat in a world leading time of 37.70 seconds. The Americans beat Britain and Japan, both of which also qualified.\n\n\"My team did a great job,\" said Gatlin, the oldest of the squad at 35. \"They're thinking and acting like veterans and I'm proud of them.\"\n\nChristian Coleman took silver in the 100 ahead of Bolt and it gave the U.S. team an added boost.\n\n\"Having the gold and silver medal on the same relay team, which hasn't been done in a long time, it gives us kind of a confidence booster that the speed can get around the track,\" Gatlin said.\n\nBolt stepped out on the track for the second heat, and the Jamaicans needed him. Trailing when he got the baton on the anchor leg, Bolt powered away, quickly swept past his rivals and had time to look to his right before crossing in 37.95 seconds.\n\nStill, Bolt was supportive of his young teammates.\n\n\"They came out here and did the job we wanted them to do, and that's to get us to the finals. They executed and ran well for a young team,\" Bolt said. \"Over the years, this will be the team bringing in the golds.\"\n\nIn the women's heats, both nations are also through.\n\nAllyson Felix stayed in line to become the athlete with the most medals in world championships history when she helped the American relay team qualify.\n\nRunning the second leg, Felix and her teammates crossed first in a season's leading time of 41.84 seconds, beating Britain and Switzerland. They also advanced to the final.\n\nIn the second heat, Germany beat two-time defending champion Jamaica to qualify along with Brazil.\n\nThe Netherlands, with 200-meter champion Dafne Schippers running the second leg, qualified on time.\n\nFelix has won 14 medals at the world championships and can move up to 16 if she runs the 4\u00d7400 relay and the United States wins medals in both events.\n\nIn the decathlon, two-time world champion Trey Hardee of the United States hit the third hurdle and clattered into the next one during the 110-meter hurdles to end his medal chances.\n\nIn the first of five events on the final day of the two-day competition, Kevin Mayer of France set a third personal record to easily stay atop the standings with 5,485 points. Rico Freimuth of Germany was in second place with 5,377 points, while Damian Warner of Canada had the fastest time in the hurdles of 13.63 seconds to move into third.\n\nAlso, British runner Mo Farah will compete in his last race on the track at a major championship when he goes for a fourth straight world title in the 5,000. He won a third 10,000-meter gold on the first day of the championships.", "time": "11:42:00"}

pulled up injured on the anchor leg of the 4x100m relay at the World Championships on Sunday morning (AEST).\n\nBolt received the baton with Jamaica in third, but halfway down the finishing straight the towering sprinter pulled up clutching his left thigh, eventually doing a forward somersault to the ground, to gasps from the 60,000 watching on at London Stadium.\n\nThe British quartet of Chijindu Ujah, Adam Gemili, Daniel Talbot and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake claimed gold in 37.47 seconds, with the Justin Gatlin-led US four taking silver and Japan a surprise bronze.\n\nThe result means Bolt, 100 and 200m world record holder, finishes his career with 14 world career medals, one behind American Allyson Felix, to go with eight Olympic golds.\n\nBolt was attended to by medics but refused a ride in a wheelchair off the track, instead finally getting up and limping alongside his teammates through to the finish line and then off into the bowels of the stadium for treatment.\n\nIt was a sad exit for an athlete who has lit up the track when the sport has been dragged through its worst-ever crisis, racked by doping and corruption scandals that went to the very heart of athletics' governing body.\n\nBolt's teammate Yohan Blake slammed organisers for letting the medal presentation for the women's high jump run overtime, which meant the start of the relay was delayed by roughly 10 minutes.\n\nBlake also said Bolt had a bad feeling before the race about what the delayed start time would mean.\n\n\"A hero of the sport to go down like that, as a true friend, I didn't like it one bit,\" Blake said.\n\n\"Usain was getting cold and he said, 'I don't like this'.\n\n\"They were holding us too long.\n\n\"Too many presentations so the race was 10 minutes long. It was cold.\"\n\nJamaican team doctor Kevin Jones later clarified Bolt suffered from a hamstring cramp, but the physical pain was overshadowed by the emotional anguish.\n\n\"It's cramps in his left hamstring but a lot of pain is from the disappointment of losing the race. The last three weeks have been hard for him, we hope for the best,\" Jones said.\n\nJones also reiterated Blake's concerns, saying: \"It was cold back there, and the guys were complaining.\"\n\nAmerican Justin Gatlin, who defeated Bolt in the 100m final while relegating him to third, agreed there was a problem with how the race was organised.\n\n\"We took (our) clothes off a little too early. Bolt was running out there cold.\"\n\nUsain Bolt doesn't need to apologise to anyone. He may think he needs to, but his teammates say he doesn't owe anyone - least of all them - anything.\n\n\"He didn't tell us exactly what happened but from what I saw, it looked like a strain or a cramp of some sort,\" second leg runner Julian Forte said.\n\n\"He kept apologising to us but we told him there was no need to apologise - injuries are part of the sport.\"\n\nNewly-crowned 110m hurdles champion Omar McLeod, Jamaica's lead-off runner, added: \"Everybody was jelly, everybody was pumped. (Bolt's injury) just happened. Usain Bolt's name will always live on.\"", "time": "02:46:00"}

with a 15th world gold medal remained on track as Jamaica qualified for the final of the 4x100m relay.\n\nBolt took the unusual step of racing the relay heats, something usually reserved for the more unheralded members of the squad.\n\nTyquendo Tracey, Julian Forte and Michael Campbell safely negotiated the first three legs before Bolt steered his team home in a winning, season's best of 37.95 seconds.\n\n\"It's been brilliant. The energy in the stadium is outstanding,\" Bolt said, hailing the deafening support in the packed-out London Stadium \"not just for me but the whole championships\".\n\nBolt said his emotions were still in check at the thought of bowing out of track and field.\n\n\"For me it's hard to be sad because the energy I'm getting from the crowd is brilliant, I'm just happy.\"\n\nBolt's bid to retain his 100m title went up in smoke as American Justin Gatlin won gold, with Christian Coleman taking silver.\n\nIt was the first time Bolt had been beaten at a major championships since the 4x100m relay at the 2007 worlds in Osaka.\n\nThe 100 and 200m world record holder, who also anchored the Jamaican squad to a world record in the relay of 36.84sec at the 2012 London Olympics, will be back at the track for the final at 2050 GMT.\n\nBolt has amassed eight Olympic golds and 14 world medals, 11 of which are gold, the Jamaican having won two silvers in 2007 before his 100m bronze in London.\n\nNo matter the result of the relay, organisers said Bolt will be afforded a dedicated lap of honour on Sunday in tribute to his amazing track career.\n\nGatlin ran the second leg for the US team, led off by Mike Rodgers, another dope cheat, BeeJay Lee and Coleman on anchor.\n\nThey clocked 37.70 seconds to finish 0.06sec ahead of Britain.\n\nAlso qualifying for the final were France, China, Japan, Turkey and Canada.", "time": "10:40:00"}

"Jamaica's Usain Bolt lies on the track after he was injured in the Men's 4x100 meters relay final at the World Athletics Championships in London Saturday, Aug. 12, 2017. (AP Photo/Martin Meissner)\n\nBy Eddie Pells, Associated Press\n\nLONDON (AP) -- Usain Bolt was ramping into warp speed when suddenly, stunningly, the sprint turned into a somersault.\n\nFifteen steps into the final homestretch of his final race, something gave in his left hamstring. The World's Fastest Man skittered to a stop -- hopping, skipping, jumping, then finally dropping to the ground and tumbling forward before coming to a rest.\n\nWhile the winning team from Britain crossed the finish line, Bolt was writhing on the track, where he eventually wound up chest down with his face pressed into Lane 5. He was certainly every bit as stunned as any of the 60,000-plus who packed the stadium Saturday, or the millions watching one of the world's most entertaining showmen make his final curtain call in the 4x100-meter relay at world championships.\n\nThere was no celebration. No gold, no silver, not even a consolation bronze, the likes of which Bolt received a week earlier in his final 100-meter race.\n\nJamaica closed the night with \"DNF\" by its name: Did Not Finish. Dead last. Bolt was helped into a wheelchair, but eventually got to his feet and, assisted by his teammates, limped gingerly across the finish line. He gave a few waves to the crowd, then left for the trainer's room, and with that, presumably left track and field forever.\n\n\"Injuries are part of our sport and, always, of course, it's sad to see,\" said Wallace Spearmon, the American sprinter who has been close with Bolt for years and was on hand helping the U.S. team. \"So, yeah, it's tragic.\"\n\nThe Jamaican team doctor, Kevin Jones, diagnosed the injury that brought a strange end to Bolt's career as, simply, a cramp in the champion's left hamstring.\n\n\"But a lot of pain is from disappointment from losing the race,\" Jones said. \"The last three weeks have been hard for him, you know. We hope for the best for him.\"\n\nWatching track's No. 1 sprinter and celebrity dropping to the ground was nothing short of jaw-dropping -- so much so that the fact that Britain won the race, outrunning a United States team that, somewhat amazingly, didn't drop the baton, almost seemed like an afterthought.\n\nNethaneel Mitchell-Blake held off U.S. anchorman Christian Coleman down the stretch and the Brits won their first-ever world title in the 4x100 in 37.47 seconds.\n\nWhen Bolt took the baton from Yohan Blake for his final homestretch, he was in third place, but that was no cause for concern. In virtually each of the seven relay golds he's won at the Olympics and world championships, Bolt has reeled in the competition down the stretch and won going away, much the same as all his 100 victories have played out.\n\nFive years and one day earlier, on the very same track, Bolt helped Jamaica set the world record. That run of 36.84 seconds earned Bolt the sixth of nine Olympic victories.\n\nBut last week in the 100, Bolt's extra gear was not enough either to catch Coleman, who finished second, or to hold off Justin Gatlin, the oft-booed American who came from behind to finish first.\n\nCould he have caught his relay competition in this one? Nobody will ever know. Bolt was gaining no ground at the 30-meter mark, which is when he felt the pain in his leg and went tumbling.\n\nAfterward, there was plenty of second-guessing to be done. Most of it came at the expense of the IAAF, which made the sprinters wait about 40 minutes from the time they were summoned from the warm-up room to the time the starting gun went off.\n\n\"I think this is crazy,\" Blake said. \"Forty minutes. Waiting. Warming up. Waiting. Warming up. It just should not happen. To have your champion go out like that. It's crazy.\"\n\nSaid Gatlin, who remains insistent that Bolt will be back someday: \"We lost all of our heat, all of our sweat, and we went out there cold.\"\n\nPart of the wait was for the U.S. women's relay team to finish its victory celebration. Tori Bowie anchored the win and, with one day left in the meet, is the only athlete to win two gold medals in London. Also, a medal ceremony was held for Russian high jump champion Mariya Lasitskene, who is competing as a neutral athlete because of the doping crisis in her country and got to listen not to her own anthem, but to the IAAF's theme song, as she stood on the podium.\n\nOther winners included Kevin Mayer of France in the decathlon and Johannes Vetter, whose victory in the javelin throw gave Germany its first gold of the championships.\n\nIn the undercard to the relays, Muktar Edris held off Mo Farah of Britain in the 5,000. With help of his Ethiopian teammates, Edris won a tactical cat-and-mouse race and denied Farah his fifth straight long-distance double, counting world championships and Olympics.\n\nAs if to prove that point one last time, he did it again -- this time without even finishing the race.", "time": "00:54:00"}

energy,\" Bolt said.\n\nFor the best part of the past decade, though, Bolt has been 100 percent reliable in getting relay gold for the island nation.

Usain Bolt's dramatic and inglorious end to his top level career was the fault of world championship organisers, his furious team-mates claimed.\n\nThe 30-year-old 100 metres and 200m world record-holder collapsed on the London Stadium track whilst anchoring Jamaica in the final of the 4x100m on Saturday as cramp gripped his leg.\n\nBolt lay prone on the track but waved away the offer of a wheelchair and eventually, aided by his three team-mates, limped across the line before making a hasty exit -- not the way the man who had won triple Olympic gold at the same stadium in 2012 would have wished his competitive career in championships to finish.\n\nBut his team-mates complained that his problem was caused by organisers keeping the relay teams waiting in the cold before their race as several medal ceremonies were held.\n\n\"I think they were holding us too long in the call room. The walk was too long. Usain was really cold. In fact Usain said to me, 'Yohan, I think this is crazy. 40 minutes and two medal presentations before our run',\" said Yohan Blake, who branded the wait as \"crazy\".\n\n\"We kept warming up and waiting, then warming up and waiting,\" added the 2011 100m world champion, who also won Olympic relay gold in 2012 and 2016 with Bolt.\n\nJamaica's Usain Bolt goes down after pulling up injured in the final of the men's 4x100m relay athletics event at the 2017 IAAF World Championships at the London Stadium in London on August 12, 2017 \u00a9 AFP / Adrian DENNIS\n\n\"I think it got the better of us. We were over warm.\n\n\"To see a true legend, a true champion go out there and struggling like that.\n\n\"The race was 10 minutes late and we were kept 40 minutes.\"\n\nBolt may not have led Jamaica to a glorious finale anyway, though, as he took the baton well behind eventual winners Great Britain and the US.\n\nBut Jamaica's 110m hurdles world champion Omar McLeod -- who ran the first leg -- likewise pointed the finger at organisers for denying his country's greatest star a more fitting swansong.\n\n\"It's heart wrenching,\" said McLeod, who is also the Olympic champion.\n\n\"It was ridiculous man, we were there around 45 minutes waiting outside, I think they had three medal ceremonies before we went out so we were really trying our hardest to stay warm and keep upbeat.\n\n\"But it was ridiculous. We waited a really long time. I drank like two bottles of water.\"\n\nJamaica's Usain Bolt goes down after pulling up injured in the final of the men's 4x100m relay at the 2017 IAAF World Championships at the London Stadium in London on August 12, 2017 \u00a9 AFP / Jewel SAMAD\n\nTheir criticism echoed that of Justin Gatlin, who led an American 1-2 alongside team-mate Christian Coleman to deny Bolt a farewell gold in the individual 100m.\n\n\"I think it was the elements. I am sorry he got this injury. He is still the best in the world,\" said Gatlin.\n\n\"It was a recipe. I don't want to say this, I understand we need to be ready early, but I think we took our clothes off a little too early.\n\n\"It's a little chilly in here so I think that's where the cramp came from. That's what he suffered with. He was running out there cold.\"\n\nDespite his relatively unsuccessful championships -- in which he will exit with just a single bronze medal -- Bolt will still be accorded a final lap of honour in a tribute ceremony before the curtain comes down on the world championships later on Sunday.\n\nShares", "time": "11:11:00"}

powering down the finishing straight Saturday to qualify Jamaica for the 4\u00d7100-meter relay final at the world championships.\n\nFittingly, he will face Justin Gatlin and the United States in the final chapter of his unparalleled career on the same night.\n\nBoth nations won their heats early Saturday, though the U.S. relay squad got the baton around with more aplomb than Jamaica, which had to rely on Bolt to clinch victory.\n\nAnd Bolt relished the adulation at the 60,000-capacity Olympic Stadium.\n\n\"They've been outstanding so far, and continue to surprise me and give me energy,\" Bolt said.\n\nFor the best part of the past decade, though, Bolt has been 100 percent reliable in getting relay gold for the island nation. The last time Jamaica lost a world championship final was in Bolt's rookie year in 2007, when he ran the second leg and only took silver behind the Americans, in Osaka.\n\nEver since, Bolt has flaunted his power at the end of every major championship, getting the third gold medal for himself and sometimes another world record for Jamaica.\n\nThis year, however, he only got bronze in the 100 behind Gatlin. And the result in the relay is no longer a foregone conclusion.\n\nThe United States, with Gatlin running the second leg, won the first heat in a world leading time of 37.70 seconds. The Americans beat Britain and Japan, both of which also qualified.\n\n\"My team did a great job,\" said Gatlin, the oldest of the squad at 35. \"They're thinking and acting like veterans and I'm proud of them.\"\n\nChristian Coleman took silver in the 100 ahead of Bolt and it gave the U.S. team an added boost.\n\n\"Having the gold and silver medal on the same relay team, which hasn't been done in a long time, it gives us kind of a confidence booster that the speed can get around the track,\" Gatlin said.\n\nBolt stepped out on the track for the second heat, and the Jamaicans needed him. Trailing when he got the baton on the anchor leg, Bolt powered away, quickly swept past his rivals and had time to look to his right before crossing in 37.95 seconds.\n\nStill, Bolt was supportive of his young teammates.\n\n\"They came out here and did the job we wanted them to do, and that's to get us to the finals. They executed and ran well for a young team,\" Bolt said. \"Over the years, this will be the team bringing in the golds.\"\n\nIn the women's heats, both nations are also through.\n\nAllyson Felix stayed in line to become the athlete with the most medals in world championships history when she helped the American relay team qualify.\n\nRunning the second leg, Felix and her teammates crossed first in a season's leading time of 41.84 seconds, beating Britain and Switzerland. They also advanced to the final.\n\nIn the second heat, Germany beat two-time defending champion Jamaica to qualify along with Brazil.\n\nThe Netherlands, with 200-meter champion Dafne Schippers running the second leg, qualified on time.\n\nFelix has won 14 medals at the world championships and can move up to 16 if she runs the 4\u00d7400 relay and the United States wins medals in both events.\n\nIn the decathlon, two-time world champion Trey Hardee of the United States hit the third hurdle and clattered into the next one during the 110-meter hurdles to end his medal chances.\n\nIn the first of five events on the final day of the two-day competition, Kevin Mayer of France set a third personal record to easily stay atop the standings with 5,485 points. Rico Freimuth of Germany was in second place with 5,377 points, while Damian Warner of Canada had the fastest time in the hurdles of 13.63 seconds to move into third.\n\nAlso, British runner Mo Farah will compete in his last race on the track at a major championship when he goes for a fourth straight world title in the 5,000. He won a third 10,000-meter gold on the first day of the championships.", "time": "12:58:00"}

Jamaican great crumpled to the track with a left-leg injury as he was chasing a final gold medal for the Jamaican 4x100-meter relay team on Saturday at the world championships.\n\nHaving to make up lots of ground on the anchor leg, Bolt suddenly screamed, stumbled and somersaulted as he came down, his golden farewell shattered by the first injury he has experienced at a major competition.\n\nThat wasn't the only surprise. Britain went on to beat the United States in a tight finish.\n\nThe 60,000-capacity stadium was primed for one last Bolt show, one last \"To the World\" pose after a victory, but the injury made it blatantly clear why Bolt is ready to retire. His body can no longer hold up.\n\n\"He is still the best in the world,\" said Justin Gatlin, Bolt's American rival who ended up with 100-meter gold and relay silver.\n\nBolt's teammates on the once-fabled Jamaican sprint squad were far from unmatchable, too. Bolt just had too much to make up in the final 100 meters as both Britain and the United States were ahead and even Japan was even.\n\nAs Bolt fell to the ground, the leg with the golden shoe giving way, the crowd still went wild because the home team went on to win gold in 37.47 seconds, .05 seconds ahead of the United States.\n\n\"It's a cramp in his left hamstring, but a lot of the pain is from disappointment from losing the race,\" Jamaican team doctor Kevin Jones said. \"The last three weeks have been hard for him, you know. We hope for the best for him.\"\n\nThe race will certainly be remembered for the gut-wrenching way in which the sport's greatest athlete was forced to end his career.\n\n\"It just happened,\" Jamaican leadoff runner Omar McLeod said. \"Usain Bolt's name will always live on.\"\n\nIt was yet another amazing upset in a championship of so many.\n\nBefore Bolt came onto the track, he was consoling Mo Farah, his long-distance equivalent who had just lost his first major race since 2011 when he failed to get gold in the 5,000 meters.\n\nFarah also was bidding farewell to the track, coming up short of his fifth straight 5,000-10,000 double at major championships in a sprint against Muktar Edris Ethiopia.\n\n\"I gave it all,\" Farah said. \"I didn't have a single bit left at the end.\"\n\nInstead, Tori Bowie was the unlikely first double gold medalist at the championships, anchoring the U.S. team to the 4x100-meter relay title ahead of Britain and Jamaica.\n\nAt the same time, Allyson Felix, running the second leg on the winning team, earned a record 15th medal at the world championships in a career going back to 2005.", "time": "00:40:00"}

Bolt's bid to bring the curtain down on his glittering career with a 15th world gold medal remained on track as Jamaica qualified for the final of the 4x100m relay.\n\nBolt took the unusual step of racing the relay heats, something usually reserved for the more unheralded members of the squad.\n\nTyquendo Tracey, Julian Forte and Michael Campbell safely negotiated the first three legs before Bolt steered his team home in a winning, season's best of 37.95 seconds.\n\n\"It's been brilliant. The energy in the stadium is outstanding,\" Bolt said, hailing the deafening support in the packed-out London Stadium \"not just for me but the whole championships\".\n\nBolt said his emotions were still in check at the thought of bowing out of track and field.\n\n\"For me it's hard to be sad because the energy I'm getting from the crowd is brilliant, I'm just happy.\"\n\nBolt's bid to retain his 100m title went up in smoke as American Justin Gatlin won gold, with Christian Coleman taking silver.\n\nIt was the first time Bolt had been beaten at a major championships since the 4x100m relay at the 2007 worlds in Osaka.\n\nThe 100 and 200m world record holder, who also anchored the Jamaican squad to a world record in the relay of 36.84sec at the 2012 London Olympics, will be back at the track for the final at 2050 GMT.\n\nBolt has amassed eight Olympic golds and 14 world medals, 11 of which are gold, the Jamaican having won two silvers in 2007 before his 100m bronze in London.\n\nNo matter the result of the relay, organisers said Bolt will be afforded a dedicated lap of honour on Sunday in tribute to his amazing track career.\n\nGatlin ran the second leg for the US team, led off by Mike Rodgers, another dope cheat, BeeJay Lee and Coleman on anchor.\n\nThey clocked 37.70 seconds to finish 0.06sec ahead of Britain.\n\nAlso qualifying for the final were France, China, Japan, Turkey and Canada.\n\nGet latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.", "time": "10:55:00"}

In fact Usain said to me 'Yohan, I think this is crazy. Forty minutes and two medal presentations before our run.''\n\nGatlin, who beat Bolt to gold in the 100m last Saturday, agreed with the complaints and laid the blame at the television scheduling for the event.\n\n\"I know it's TV magic, and everybody has to be prepared on time to make everything happen for the viewers at home.\n\n\"(But) I personally think that we were held in the stadium a little too long without our clothes on, and there was a little draught in there. I lost all my sweat and body heat,'' Gatlin said.\n\nWhen asked if he thought that contributed to Bolt's injury, the 35-year-old said: \"I believe so.\n\n\"Knowing how Usain performs, he's always ready, he's always making sure he's not injured and it's very rare to see Usain injured when he comes to performances.''\n\nGatlin ran the second leg for the United States as they finished runners-up behind Britain, who became world champions for the first time.\n\nAmidst the home crowd's jubilation, there was also relief at the sight of Bolt being able to walk off the track after being helped to his feet by his teammates.\n\n\"I'm not sure what the extent of his injury is, but when I saw him go down I thought it was a calf cramp or a hamstring cramp. But he walked off the track, so that's good thing.", "time": "12:03:00"}

himself during the final of the men's 4x100m relay athletics event at the 2017 IAAF World Championships at the London Stadium in London on August 12, 2017. -- AFP picLONDON, Aug 13 -- A sentimental Justin Gatlin hailed Usain Bolt as an \"amazing showman\" whose career would certainly not be defined by him pulling up with cramp in the world 4x100m relay, the Jamaican's final competitive race.\n\nThere was high drama in Saturday's relay as anchor man Bolt received the baton in third place behind eventual gold medallists Britain and runners-up America.\n\nLess than 50 metres down the track, Bolt suddenly pulled up, clutching his left leg, tumbling to the track with what was later diagnosed as a hamstring cramp.\n\n\"This is farewell time, I am sentimental about it already now,\" said Gatlin, who stormed to 100m gold in London, US teammate Christian Coleman taking silver to relegate Bolt to a disappointing bronze in his individual send-off.\n\n\"In the warm-up area we give ourselves respect and greet each other,\" Gatlin said of Bolt, who bows out of competition with a startling haul of eight Olympic gold medals and 14 world medals, nine of which are gold.\n\nGatlin, who has served two doping bans, put the blame for Bolt's cramp partly at the amount of time the athletes spent on the track before the starter's gun went off.\n\n\"There was a cool breeze out there. But the conditions were the same for everybody,\" said the 35-year-old, who won the 100m at the 2004 Olympics in Athens and the 2005 worlds in Helsinki before serving his second ban between 2006-10 for taking testosterone.\n\nChilly conditions unhelpful\n\n\"I think it was the elements. I am sorry he got this injury. He is still the best in the world.\n\n\"It was a recipe. I don't want to say this but I understand we need to be ready early but I think we took our clothes off a little too early. It's a little chilly in here so I think that's where the cramp came from. That's what he suffered with. He was running out there cold.\"\n\nBut Gatlin, who was roundly booed at the London Stadium before both the 100m and relay, insisted: \"Usain Bolt is a great athlete.\n\n\"You can't let this championships define what he's done in the past. He has done amazing things. He's still the man, you know. The was his farewell race and we wish him the best and hope he recovers soon.\"\n\nReferring to Bolt's mooted future ambassadorial role within athletics' world governing body the IAAF, Gatlin added: \"He's coming back in a couple of years. He'll be ready, he has a passion for the sport.\n\n\"He loves the fans and they love him. He loves the sport too much to walk away. He's a showman.\"\n\nJapan snatched a surprise bronze medal, Kenji Fujimitsu moved to comment: \"Thank you, Bolt. He was an inspiration for us.\"\n\nOmar McLeod, the newly-crowned 110m hurdler and Jamaica's lead-off runner in the relay, added: \"Usain Bolt's name will always live on.\" -- AFP", "time": "02:52:00"}

AP/PTI.\n\nUsain Bolt began the countdown to his final race by anchoring Jamaica to the 4x100m relay finals with an easy win in the heats here today.\n\nRunning in his penultimate race of his illustrious career, Bolt eased past the finishing line as he helped the defending champions Jamaica win the second heat in 37.95 seconds, their season's best, to enter the final round with third best time.\n\nThe Jamaican quartet of Tyquendo Tracey, Julian Forte, Micheal Campbell and Bolt led the eight-team second heat from beginning to the end.\n\nExperienced Yohan Blake, who finished fourth in the men's 100m final and failed to qualify for the final round in 200m, did not start in the heats but Bolt later said that he will return in the final race.\n\nIn his trademark style, Bolt grabbed the baton from Campbell, who ran the third leg, and blasted ahead of all his rivals and slowed down while approaching the finish line to conserve energy for the finals.\n\nThe top three from each of the two heats and next two fastest finishers from the remaining qualify for the final round.\n\nThe United States team of Mike Rodgers, Justin Gatlin, Bee Jay Lee and Christian Coleman won the first heat in 37.70 seconds, the world leading time this season, to clock the overall best time going into the final round.\n\nGreat Britain clocked the second best time of 37.76, while France were fourth with their season's best of 38.03.\n\nChina (38.20), who had finished second in the 2015 edition at home, Japan (37.21), who took a surprise silver in the Rio Olympics, Turkey (38.44) and Canada (38.48) -- third in both 2015 World Championships and Rio Olympics -- completed the eight-team final round which will run later tonight.\n\nBolt, who has anchored the gold-winning Jamaican team in both 2015 World Championships and Rio Games, will be seeking his 20th global title and would want to hang up his boots with a yellow metal in his final race of his glittering career.\n\nHe lost the 100m dash last Saturday in his final individual race, settling for a bronze.\n\nHis long-time American rival Gatlin, who has twice served bans for doping, won the gold while Coleman took the silver as the London Olympic stadium and the global television audience were stunned at the turn of events.\n\nWidely considered as the greatest sprinter of all time, Bolt has won eight Olympic and 11 World Championships gold medals beginning with a 100m and 200m double at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\n\nSince then he has dominated the shorter two sprint events like none in athletics history. His Jamaican team had also won the 4x100m relay gold in Beijing but it had to return the medal after one member of the quartet -- Nesta Carter -- tested positive for a prohibited substance.\n\nOn the last day of his international career, fans jostled for space to have a glimpse of Bolt at the warm-up arena, adjacent to the stadium and television cameras were fixed at him to have a shot of the towering Jamaican.\n\nWhenever the giant screen inside the stadium showed him doing the baton exchange practice with his Jamaican team-mates in preparation for the 4x100m relay race at the warm-up arena, the capacity crowd cheered loudly.\n\nThe showman, as usual, entertained the crowd as he acknowledged the cheers as he entered the stadium for the relay heats. He did his routine marking of his starting position and did a few run-downs imitating baton exchange.\n\nAfter easing past the finish line, Bolt ran down the track as he usually does and clapped towards the crowd.\n\n\"There are no words to describe how I am feeling. I get so much support from the crowd. I appreciate that a lot. All the energy I am getting from the crowd. It is brilliant,\" Bolt said after the race.\n\n\"The young runners in our team -- it is just about executing and coming through the race for them. We have been training that relay, there were some camps. Still there were some mistakes. Yohan Blake is coming in for the final is definitely good.\"\n\nIn the women's 4x100m relay, all the medal contenders -- United States, Great Britain, Germany and defending champions Jamaica -- progressed to the final round without much trouble, while the Bahamas quartet failed to finish in the second heat due to a poor second baton change.\n\nOlympic champions United States won the first heat in a world leading time of 41.84 seconds, even in the absence of individual 100m champion Torie Bowie.\n\nGreat Britain finished second in that heat -- and also second overall -- with 41.93, the third fastest time ever produced by a British quartet.\n\nDefending champions Jamaica (42.50) finished second behind Germany (42.34) in the second heat.\n\nSwitzerland (42.50) qualified with the fourth fastest time overall while Netherlands (42.64), Brazil (42.77) and Trinidad and Tobago (42.91) completed the final round line-up.\n\nAmerican runner Allyson Felix later said that Bowie will return in the final round.", "time": "14:00:00"}

Bolt's team mates complained that a 45-minute wait in the call room before the race had hampered their preparations.\n\n\"I think they were holding us too long in the call room,\" Blake told reporters. \"Usain was really cold. In fact Usain said to me 'Yohan, I think this is crazy'. Forty minutes and two medal presentations before our run.\"\n\nGatlin, who beat Bolt to gold in the 100m last Saturday, agreed with the complaints and laid the blame at the television scheduling for the event. \"I know it's TV magic, and everybody has to be prepared on time to make everything happen for the viewers at home. (But) I personally think that we were held in the stadium a little too long without our clothes on, and there was a little draught in there. I lost all my sweat and body heat,\" Gatlin said.\n\nWhen asked if he thought that contributed to Bolt's injury, the 35-year-old said: \"I believe so. Knowing how Usain performs, he's always ready, he's always making sure he's not injured and it's very rare to see Usain injured when he comes to performances.\"\n\nGatlin ran the second leg for the United States as they finished runners-up behind Britain, who became world champions for the first time. Amidst the home crowd's jubilation, there was also relief at the sight of Bolt being able to walk off the track after being helped to his feet by his team mates.\n\n\"I'm not sure what the extent of his injury is, but when I saw him go down I thought it was a calf cramp or a hamstring cramp. But he walked off the track, so that's good thing. I hope that he gets well soon,\"", "time": "05:41:00"}

swan song came crashing to an end when he pulled up injured on the anchor leg of the world 4x100m relay won by Britain on Saturday.\n\nBolt received the baton with Jamaica in third, but halfway down the finishing straight the towering sprinter pulled up clutching his left thigh, eventually doing a forward somersault to the ground, to gasps from the 60,000 sell out London Stadium.\n\nUsain Bolt lies on the track after pulling up injured in the final of the men's 4x100m relay. AFP\n\nThe British quartet of Chijindu Ujah, Adam Gemili, Daniel Talbot and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake claimed gold in 37.47 seconds, with the Justin Gatlin-led US four taking silver at 0.05sec and Japan a surprise bronze (38.04).\n\n\"He didn't tell us exactly what happened but from what I saw, it looked like a strain or a cramp of some sort,\" second leg runner Julian Forte said.\n\n\"He kept apologising to us but we told him there was no need to apologise -- injuries are part of the sport.\"\n\nNewly-crowned 110m hurdles champion Omar McLeod, Jamaica's lead-off runner, added: \"Everybody was jelly, everybody was pumped. (Bolt's injury) just happened. Usain Bolt's name will always live on.\"\n\nBolt missed out on his bid to retain his 100m title earlier in the week, losing out to Gatlin and silver medallist Christian Coleman, who ran relay anchor for the Americans on Saturday.\n\nBut hopes were high for Bolt's final competitive race, with Jamaica also boasting McLeod, Forte and 2011 world champion Yohan Blake in their line-up.\n\nJamaica were afforded a rousing welcome from the crowd, a relaxed-looking Bolt applauding the stands, with pictures of him constantly shown on the stadium's big screens.\n\nGatlin, who has served two doping bans, and the US team also including another convicted doping cheat, Mike Rodgers, and Jaylen Bacon were booed when introduced although the jeering was less pronounced than for the individual 100m event.\n\nA close first three legs saw Britain, the United States and Jamaica, seeking a fifth consecutive world title, level-pegged for the final leg.\n\nHigh drama\n\nBut there was to be high drama as a visibly swearing Bolt pulled up in obvious pain, allowing the Japanese quartet to edge in for third.\n\nThe result means Bolt, 100 and 200m world record holder, finishes his career with 14 world career medals, one behind American Allyson Felix, to go with eight Olympic golds.\n\nAmid wild home celebrations, Bolt was attended to by medics, but refused a ride in a wheelchair off the track, instead finally getting up and limping alongside his teammates through to the finish line and then off into the bowels of the stadium for treatment.\n\nIt was a sad exit for an athlete who has lit up the track when the sport has been dragged through its worst-ever crisis, racked by doping and corruption scandals that went to the very heart of athletics' governing body.\n\nAnd what a gaping hole his absence will leave, no matter how brave a face the IAAF try to put on it.\n\nSince confirming his sprinting dominance with triple gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Bolt spent nine seasons amassing 19 global golds, 13 of which have come in individual events.\n\nAllied with a charismatic personality, it has guaranteed Bolt recognition as one of the world's most successful sportsmen. Last year alone he earned $34.2 million, according to Forbes.\n\nPublished Date: Aug 13, 2017 03:45 am | Updated Date: Aug 13, 2017 03:55 am\n\nTags :#Adam gemili#Allyson felix#Chijindu ujah#Christian coleman#Daniel talbot#Iaaf#Iaaf world athletics championships 2017#Jamaica relay team#Jaylen bacon#Julian forte#Justin gatlin#Mike rodgers#Nethaneel mitchell-blake#Omar mcleod#Usain bolt#Yohan blake", "time": "22:55:00"}

disastrous fashion as he pulled up injured on the final leg of the men's 4x100m relay Saturday.\n\nBolt took the baton for Jamaica in third place but within a few strides he had fallen to the ground, clutching his left leg, as host Britain secured a shock gold ahead of a United States team containing Justin Gatlin.\n\nThe 30-year-old Bolt, beaten into third in the individual 100m behind Gatlin and his US team compatriot Christian Coleman, was comforted by teammates after getting to his feet, his face etched in pain.\n\nThe capacity crowd in the London Stadium was still digesting the shock earlier defeat for home hero Mo Farah in the men's 5,000m final, before the drama of Bolt's last agonizing appearance.\n\nREAD: Bolt in numbers - Why the Jamaican is the greatest\n\nREAD: Gatlin spoils Bolt's individual farewell\n\nHe had been bidding for a 12th world championship gold to bring down the curtain on his glittering career, but instead limped out of the London Stadium arena.\n\nVictory for the British quartet of CJ Ujah, Adam Gemili, who ran a storming second leg, Daniel Talbot and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake was stunning compensation for Farah's earlier defeat.\n\nThey won in 37.47 seconds, with the US taking silver at 0.05sec and Japan with a surprise bronze.\n\nFor his massive global following, the perfect script would have seen the Bolt of old running down Britain and the US for yet another gold, but it was not to be.\n\n\"He didn't tell us exactly what happened but from what I saw, it looked like a strain or a cramp of some sort,\" teammate Julian Forte told IAAF radio.\n\n\"He kept apologizing to us but we told him there was no need to apologize -- injuries are part of the sport.\"\n\nJamaican team doctor Dr Kevin Jones told AFP that Bolt had suffered from \"cramp in his left hamstring\".\n\n\"The last three weeks have been hard for him, you know. We hope for the best for him,\" he added.\n\nJamaica's 110m hurdles champion Omar McLeod, who ran the first leg for the quartet, summed up the feeling of everyone.\n\n\"Usain Bolt's name will always live on,\" he said.\n\nBut another teammate, Yohan Blake, who won Olympic relay gold with Bolt in 2012 and 2016, slammed organizers for the delay in starting the race because of medal ceremonies.\n\n\"Usain was really cold. In fact Usain said to me, 'Yohan, I think this is crazy',\" he said.\n\nFarah, who won the 10,000 title in dramatic fashion of the opening day at the London Stadium, had to settle for silver behind Ethiopian Muktar Edris in his final championship race on the track.\n\nHe edged out American Paul Chelimo in a desperate dash for the line, the last mile of a hitherto slow run race run in just under four minutes.\n\nFarah, 34, will now turn his attention to the marathon after failing in his bid to double up at the Olympics or World Championship for the fifth time, including double gold in London 2012 and the Rio Games last year.\n\nEdris, a former world junior champion, timed his last lap burst to perfection to win in 13 minutes 32.79 seconds, copying Farah's famous Mobot gesture as he crossed the line.\n\nIt was not the farewell Farah wanted, but he pointed to his earlier exertions in a dramatic 10,000m final as reason for lacking his usual devastating finish.\n\n\"The 10,000m took a lot more out of me than I had realized,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\n\"I gave it my all. I didn't have a single thing left to give at the end.\"", "time": "14:26:00"}

ramping into warp speed when suddenly, stunningly, the sprint turned into a somersault.\n\nFifteen steps into the final homestretch of his final race, something gave in his left hamstring. The World's Fastest Man skittered to a stop -- hopping, skipping, jumping, then finally dropping to the ground and tumbling forward before coming to a rest.\n\nWhile the winning team from Britain crossed the finish line, Bolt was writhing on the track, where he eventually wound up chest down with his face pressed into Lane 5. He was certainly every bit as stunned as any of the 60,000-plus who packed the stadium Saturday, or the millions watching one of the world's most entertaining showmen make his final curtain call in the 4x100-meter relay at world championships.\n\nThere was no celebration. No gold, no silver, not even a consolation bronze, the likes of which Bolt received a week earlier in his final 100-meter race.\n\nJamaica closed the night with \"DNF\" by its name: Did Not Finish. Dead last. Bolt was helped into a wheelchair, but eventually got to his feet and, assisted by his teammates, limped gingerly across the finish line. He gave a few waves to the crowd, then left for the trainer's room, and with that, presumably left track and field forever.\n\n\"Injuries are part of our sport and, always, of course, it's sad to see,\" said Wallace Spearmon, the American sprinter who has been close with Bolt for years and was on hand helping the U.S. team. \"So, yeah, it's tragic.\"\n\nThe Jamaican team doctor, Kevin Jones, diagnosed the injury that brought a strange end to Bolt's career as, simply, a cramp in the champion's left hamstring.\n\n\"But a lot of pain is from disappointment from losing the race,\" Jones said. \"The last three weeks have been hard for him, you know. We hope for the best for him.\"\n\nWatching track's No. 1 sprinter and celebrity dropping to the ground was nothing short of jaw-dropping -- so much so that the fact that Britain won the race, outrunning a United States team that, somewhat amazingly, didn't drop the baton, almost seemed like an afterthought.\n\nNethaneel Mitchell-Blake held off U.S. anchorman Christian Coleman down the stretch and the Brits won their first-ever world title in the 4x100 in 37.47 seconds.\n\nWhen Bolt took the baton from Yohan Blake for his final homestretch, he was in third place, but that was no cause for concern. In virtually each of the seven relay golds he's won at the Olympics and world championships, Bolt has reeled in the competition down the stretch and won going away, much the same as all his 100 victories have played out.\n\nFive years and one day earlier, on the very same track, Bolt helped Jamaica set the world record. That run of 36.84 seconds earned Bolt the sixth of nine Olympic victories.\n\nBut last week in the 100, Bolt's extra gear was not enough either to catch Coleman, who finished second, or to hold off Justin Gatlin, the oft-booed American who came from behind to finish first.\n\nCould he have caught his relay competition in this one? Nobody will ever know. Bolt was gaining no ground at the 30-meter mark, which is when he felt the pain in his leg and went tumbling.\n\nAfterward, there was plenty of second-guessing to be done. Most of it came at the expense of the IAAF, which made the sprinters wait about 40 minutes from the time they were summoned from the warm-up room to the time the starting gun went off.\n\n\"I think this is crazy,\" Blake said. \"Forty minutes. Waiting. Warming up. Waiting. Warming up. It just should not happen. To have your champion go out like that. It's crazy.\"\n\nSaid Gatlin, who remains insistent that Bolt will be back someday: \"We lost all of our heat, all of our sweat, and we went out there cold.\"\n\nPart of the wait was for the U.S. women's relay team to finish its victory celebration. Tori Bowie anchored the win and, with one day left in the meet, is the only athlete to win two gold medals in London. Also, a medal ceremony was held for Russian high jump champion Mariya Lasitskene, who is competing as a neutral athlete because of the doping crisis in her country and got to listen not to her own anthem, but to the IAAF's theme song, as she stood on the podium.\n\nOther winners included Kevin Mayer of France in the decathlon and Johannes Vetter, whose victory in the javelin throw gave Germany its first gold of the championships.\n\nIn the undercard to the relays, Muktar Edris held off Mo Farah of Britain in the 5,000. With help of his Ethiopian teammates, Edris won a tactical cat-and-mouse race and denied Farah his fifth straight long-distance double, counting world championships and Olympics.\n\nIt was a fun race to watch.\n\nBut nobody steals the show the way Bolt does.\n\nAs if to prove that point one last time, he did it again -- this time without even finishing the race.\n\n___\n\nMore AP track coverage: https://www.apnews.com/tag/London2017\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

warp speed when suddenly, stunningly, the sprint turned into a somersault.\n\nFifteen steps into the final homestretch of his final race, something gave in his left hamstring. The World's Fastest Man skittered to a stop -- hopping, skipping, jumping, then finally dropping to the ground and tumbling forward before coming to a rest.\n\nWhile the winning team from Britain crossed the finish line, Bolt was writhing on the track, where he eventually wound up chest down with his face pressed into Lane 5. He was certainly every bit as stunned as any of the 60,000-plus who packed the stadium Saturday, or the millions watching one of the world's most entertaining showmen make his final curtain call in the 4x100-meter relay at world championships.\n\nThere was no celebration. No gold, no silver, not even a consolation bronze, the likes of which Bolt received a week earlier in his final 100-meter race.\n\nJamaica closed the night with \"DNF\" by its name: Did Not Finish. Dead last. Bolt was helped into a wheelchair, but eventually got to his feet and, assisted by his teammates, limped gingerly across the finish line. He gave a few waves to the crowd, then left for the trainer's room, and with that, presumably left track and field forever.\n\n\"Injuries are part of our sport and, always, of course, it's sad to see,\" said Wallace Spearmon, the American sprinter who has been close with Bolt for years and was on hand helping the U.S. team. \"So, yeah, it's tragic.\"\n\nThe Jamaican team doctor, Kevin Jones, diagnosed the injury that brought a strange end to Bolt's career as, simply, a cramp in the champion's left hamstring.\n\n\"But a lot of pain is from disappointment from losing the race,\" Jones said. \"The last three weeks have been hard for him, you know. We hope for the best for him.\"\n\nWatching track's No. 1 sprinter and celebrity dropping to the ground was nothing short of jaw-dropping -- so much so that the fact that Britain won the race, outrunning a United States team that, somewhat amazingly, didn't drop the baton, almost seemed like an afterthought.\n\nNethaneel Mitchell-Blake held off U.S. anchorman Christian Coleman down the stretch and the Brits won their first-ever world title in the 4x100 in 37.47 seconds.\n\nWhen Bolt took the baton from Yohan Blake for his final homestretch, he was in third place, but that was no cause for concern. In virtually each of the seven relay golds he's won at the Olympics and world championships, Bolt has reeled in the competition down the stretch and won going away, much the same as all his 100 victories have played out.\n\nFive years and one day earlier, on the very same track, Bolt helped Jamaica set the world record. That run of 36.84 seconds earned Bolt the sixth of nine Olympic victories.\n\nBut last week in the 100, Bolt's extra gear was not enough either to catch Coleman, who finished second, or to hold off Justin Gatlin, the oft-booed American who came from behind to finish first.\n\nCould he have caught his relay competition in this one? Nobody will ever know. Bolt was gaining no ground at the 30-meter mark, which is when he felt the pain in his leg and went tumbling.\n\nAfterward, there was plenty of second-guessing to be done. Most of it came at the expense of the IAAF, which made the sprinters wait about 40 minutes from the time they were summoned from the warm-up room to the time the starting gun went off.\n\n\"I think this is crazy,\" Blake said. \"Forty minutes. Waiting. Warming up. Waiting. Warming up. It just should not happen. To have your champion go out like that. It's crazy.\"\n\nSaid Gatlin, who remains insistent that Bolt will be back someday: \"We lost all of our heat, all of our sweat, and we went out there cold.\"\n\nPart of the wait was for the U.S. women's relay team to finish its victory celebration. Tori Bowie anchored the win and, with one day left in the meet, is the only athlete to win two gold medals in London. Also, a medal ceremony was held for Russian high jump champion Mariya Lasitskene, who is competing as a neutral athlete because of the doping crisis in her country and got to listen not to her own anthem, but to the IAAF's theme song, as she stood on the podium.\n\nOther winners included Kevin Mayer of France in the decathlon and Johannes Vetter, whose victory in the javelin throw gave Germany its first gold of the championships.\n\nIn the undercard to the relays, Muktar Edris held off Mo Farah of Britain in the 5,000. With help of his Ethiopian teammates, Edris won a tactical cat-and-mouse race and denied Farah his fifth straight long-distance double, counting world championships and Olympics.\n\nIt was a fun race to watch.\n\nBut nobody steals the show the way Bolt does.\n\nAs if to prove that point one last time, he did it again -- this time without even finishing the race.\n\n-- -- --\n\nMore AP track coverage: https://www.apnews.com/tag/London2017", "time": "00:15:00"}

In fact Usain said to me 'Yohan, I think this is crazy'. Forty minutes and two medal presentations before our run.\n\nChampion Struggling\n\n\"We keep warming up and waiting, then warming up and waiting. I think it got the better of us,\" he said. \"We were over warm. And to see a true legend, a true champion go out there and struggling like that. It was just crazy.\"\n\nHis sentiment was echoed by Omar McLeod and Julian Forte, who criticised organisers for the 10-minute delay after the medal ceremonies for the men's 5,000m, in which Mo Farah won silver, and then for the women's high jump.\n\n\"It was ridiculous man, we were there around 45 minutes waiting outside, I think they had three medal ceremonies before we went so we were really trying our hardest to stay warm and keep upbeat,\" McLeod told reporters.\n\nRidiculous Wait\n\n\"But it was ridiculous. We waited a really long time. I drank like two bottles of water. It's heart-wrenching. I gave it my all and I really wanted Usain to leave golden, or even if it was just a medal, it was really heart-wrenching.\n\nSaid Forte: \"They kept us in the call room for an extremely long time in our running kits and it's not the warmest over here. They had us around there for really quite a while, so I think they really need to do something about it.\n\nBolt refused to be taken off the track in a wheelchair or stretcher, but it was still a hugely disappointing way for him to end a glittering career that has seen him dominate sprinting for over a decade. He did not stop for interviews.\n\nPain from Losing\n\nIn a statement, the Jamaican team doctor Kevin Jones said Bolt had suffered cramp in his left hamstring but that most his pain ultimately came from the disappointment of losing. He added Bolt had found the last few weeks hard.\n\nJustin Gatlin, who added relay silver to his individual gold from earlier on at the championships, reiterated his belief that Bolt would stage a comeback in time for the 2019 world titles in Doha after a difficult campaign in London.\n\n\"From 2008, Usain Bolt has done amazing things,\" said Gatlin. \"Tonight is not going to define who he is. He's still the man. And this is his farewell tour, his farewell race, so we have to take our hat off to him. I hope he gets well soon.\n\nComing Back\n\n\"I've got to say it, I'm going to win my hundred dollars. He's coming back in a year or two. He'll be ready. He has a passion for the sport, he loves the fans, the fans love him, it's not something you can walk away too easy from.\n\n\"He's a showman. I think he will do a great job if he comes back to track and field. We've got a lot of young guys like [the United States' anchor Christian] Coleman, myself, and we're hungry to go out there for good competition.\"", "time": "23:34:00"}

"ShareTwitGoogle+E-mail\n\nUsain Bolt pulled up with an injury on the anchor leg of the 4\u00d7100 metres relay final at the World Athletics Championships on Saturday as the last race of his unparalleled career ended in high drama.\n\nThe 30-year-old had taken the baton for Jamaica a few metres adrift when, straining hard to catch the leaders, he suddenly suffered a hamstring injury, began hobbling and ended up coming to a halt after doing a forward roll on the track.\n\nAfter a short while, though, he rose gingerly to his feet and limped across the line to huge cheers from the 56,000 crowd.\n\nThat wasn't the only surprise. Britain went on to beat the United States in a tight finish.\n\nREAD MORE: Usain Bolt, from strong child to track king\n\nThe 60,000-capacity stadium was primed for one last Bolt show, one last \"To the World\" pose after a victory, but the injury made it blatantly clear why Bolt is ready to retire. His body can no longer hold up.\n\nHis teammates on the once-fabled Jamaican sprint squad were far from unmatchable, too. Bolt had just too much to make up in the final 100 metres as both Britain and the US were ahead and even Japan was even.\n\nBolt - 100 and 200m world record holder - finishes his career with 14 world career medals [John Sibley/Reuters]\n\nAs Bolt fell to the ground, the leg with the golden shoe giving way, the crowd still went wild because the home team went on to win gold in 37.47 seconds, 0.05 seconds ahead of the US.\n\nThe brilliantly executed race by Chijindu Ujah, Adam Gemili, Danny Talbot and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake gave Britain gold in 37.47 seconds, breaking an 18-year-old national record, and the world title for the first time.\n\nThe result means Bolt, 100 and 200m world record holder, finishes his career with 14 world career medals, one behind American Allyson Felix, to go with eight Olympic golds.\n\nInside Jamaica's running factory: Bolt inspires the next generation\n\nAmid wild home celebrations, Bolt was attended to by medics, but refused a ride in a wheelchair off the track, instead finally getting up and limping alongside his teammates through to the finish line and then off into the stadium for treatment.\n\nIt was a sad exit for an athlete who has lit up the track when the sport has been dragged through its worst-ever crisis, racked by doping and corruption scandals that went to the very heart of athletics' governing body.\n\nSince confirming his sprinting dominance with triple gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Bolt spent nine seasons amassing 19 global golds, 13 of which have come in individual events.\n\nAllied with a charismatic personality, it has guaranteed Bolt recognition as one of the world's most successful sportsmen. Last year alone he earned $34.2m, according to Forbes.\n\nAl Jazeera's Sonia Gallego, reporting from London, said Bolt would be remembered as one of the all time great athletes.\n\n\"It's very unlikely that we're going to see anyone of his ilk very soon,\" she said.\n\n\"So really quite a sad end to Usain Bolt's career but hopefully not the end of him as a personality and as an ambassador for the sport.\"\n\nMo Farah's swansong\n\nBefore Bolt came onto the track, he was consoling Mo Farah, his long-distance equivalent who had just lost his first major race since 2011 when he failed to get gold in the 5,000 metres.\n\nFarah also was bidding farewell to the track, coming up short of his fifth straight 5,000-10,000 double at major championships in a sprint against Muktar Edris of Ethiopia.\n\nFarah, now 34 years old and a six-time world champion, knew the opposition would be gunning for him. And they did.\n\nMo Farah Farah, now 34 years old, is a six-time world champion [Patrick Smith/Getty Images]\n\nThey boxed Farah in. They changed the pace of the race. They made him work hard knowing that his 10,000-metre victory on the opening day of the championships would take something out of his punishing finish.\n\n\"I gave it all,\" Farah said. \"I didn't have a single bit left at the end.\"\n\nAl Jazeera's Sonia Gallego said that Farah's silver was disappointing but that he had made a gracious lap of honour and posed with fans.\n\n\"Certainly a very honourable end for a tremendous athlete and certainly quite sad to see it happen in a place where he had made his name in such spectacular fashion back in the 2012 Olympics,\" said Gallego.\n\nUS takes gold in women's relay\n\nBowie (R) who won the 100 metres this week, ran a strong anchor leg, leaving behind the opposition to finish in 41.82 seconds [Alexander Hassenstein/Getty]\n\nTori Bowie was the unlikely first double gold medalist at the championships, anchoring the US team to the 4\u00d7100-metre relay title ahead of Britain and Jamaica.\n\nAt the same time, Allyson Felix, running the second leg on the winning team, earned a record 15th medal at the world championships in a career going back to 2005.\n\nBowie, who won the 100 metres this week, ran a strong anchor leg, leaving behind the opposition to finish in 41.82 seconds.\n\n\"Two gold medals is amazing for me,\" Bowie said. \"We are on top of the world.\"\n\nBritain took silver in 42.12 and two-time defending champion Jamaica earned bronze in 42.19.\n\nSource: Al Jazeera and news agencies\n\nMore From Our Site\n\nSource Link\n\nShareTwitGoogle+E-mail See Also: Ethiopia club used intel gathered from Supersport TV to frustrate Sundowns", "time": "12:02:00"}

ended in extraordinary drama on Saturday as he pulled up with injury on the anchor leg of his very last race, the 4x100m relay final at the World Championships.\n\nThe 30-year-old had taken the baton for Jamaica a few meters adrift of the two leaders when, straining hard to catch them, he stopped abruptly with a cramp in his left hamstring, began hobbling and tumbled to a halt after a forward roll.\n\nAs Britain went on to win gold, Bolt lay on his back in his lane, his head in hands, being tended to by medics as one waited with a wheelchair to help push him off the track.\n\nYet, the sport's greatest entertainer was determined that one of the finest careers in sport was not going to end with him in a wheelchair.\n\nSo the fastest man of all-time, surrounded by his three worried teammates, Omar McLeod, Julian Forte and Yohan Blake, rose gingerly to his feet and limped the last 30m to the line.\n\nThe official result recorded that the Jamaicans did not finish, but Bolt had been absolutely determined to ensure he completed the last race after a matchless career in which he won 19 major championship gold medals.\n\nTypically, Bolt's only thoughts were with the teammates he felt he had let down.\n\n\"He kept apologizing to us, but we told him there was no need to apologize,\" Forte said. \"Injuries are part of the sport.\"\n\n\"It just happened -- Usain Bolt's name will always live on,\" McLeod added.\n\nJustin Gatlin, the American winner of the individual 100m who had consigned Bolt to third place in his final individual race on Saturday last week, paid tribute to his rival.\n\n\"I think it was the elements [that caused the injury]. I'm sorry he got this injury. He is still the best in the world,\" Gatlin said. \"This is farewell time, I am sentimental about it already now. In the warm-up area, we give ourselves respect and greeted each other. Usain Bolt is a great athlete.\"\n\nJamaican team doctor Kevin Jones said Bolt had suffered a cramp in his left hamstring.\n\nBlake was angry at having to wait for two medal ceremonies to take place before the race.\n\n\"It was 40 minutes and two medal presentations before our run ... we were kept 40 minutes. It was crazy,\" Blake said. \"They were holding us too long.\"\n\n\"We keep warming up and waiting, then warming up and waiting. I think it got the better of us. It hurts to see a true legend, a true champion go out there and struggle like that,\" Blake said.\n\nJamaican team manager Ian Forbes praised Bolt for \"going out there and giving his all\" and added that the squad were \"very saddened.\"\n\n\"The diagnostic work will be done shortly to determine how serious it is. He was able to walk to the team bus so hopefully that signals it's not as serious as it possibly could be,\" Forbes said.\n\nWith the 56,000-strong crowd going wild about the British victory, there was still time for them to hail the sport's favorite performer, who waved to them a mite forlornly while hobbling away from the track.\n\nFive years ago, almost to the very night, British distance running hero Mo Farah had broken into Bolt's lightning bolt pose in this same stadium and the Jamaican had reciprocated with the Briton's trademark \"Mobot\" to mark their joyous supremacy at the London Olympics.\n\nYet, in the same stadium on Saturday, they attempted in vain to reprise that triumphant night, Farah ending up with silver in his final track race, over 5,000m, and Bolt suffering his anti-climactic farewell.", "time": "16:53:00"}

"http://www.dentonrc.com/sports/sports-ap-headlines/2017/08/12/bolt-takes-tumble-complete-final-race-worlds", "body": "LONDON -- Usain Bolt was ramping into warp speed when suddenly, stunningly, the sprint turned into a somersault.\n\nFifteen steps into the final homestretch of his final race, something gave in his left hamstring. The World's Fastest Man skittered to a stop -- hopping, skipping, jumping, then finally dropping to the ground and tumbling forward before coming to a rest.\n\nWhile the winning team from Britain crossed the finish line, Bolt was writhing on the track, where he eventually wound up chest down with his face pressed into Lane 5. He was certainly every bit as stunned as any of the 60,000-plus who packed the stadium Saturday, or the millions watching one of the world's most entertaining showmen make his final curtain call in the 4x100-meter relay at world championships.\n\nThere was no celebration. No gold, no silver, not even a consolation bronze, the likes of which Bolt received a week earlier in his final 100-meter race.\n\nJamaica closed the night with \"DNF\" by its name: Did Not Finish. Dead last. Bolt was helped into a wheelchair, but eventually got to his feet and, assisted by his teammates, limped gingerly across the finish line. He gave a few waves to the crowd, then left for the trainer's room, and with that, presumably left track and field forever.\n\n\"Injuries are part of our sport and, always, of course, it's sad to see,\" said Wallace Spearmon, the American sprinter who has been close with Bolt for years and was on hand helping the U.S. team. \"So, yeah, it's tragic.\"\n\nThe Jamaican team doctor, Kevin Jones, diagnosed the injury that brought a strange end to Bolt's career as, simply, a cramp in the champion's left hamstring.\n\n\"But a lot of pain is from disappointment from losing the race,\" Jones said. \"The last three weeks have been hard for him, you know. We hope for the best for him.\"\n\nWatching track's No. 1 sprinter and celebrity dropping to the ground was nothing short of jaw-dropping -- so much so that the fact that Britain won the race, outrunning a United States team that, somewhat amazingly, didn't drop the baton, almost seemed like an afterthought.\n\nNethaneel Mitchell-Blake held off U.S. anchorman Christian Coleman down the stretch and the Brits won their first-ever world title in the 4x100 in 37.47 seconds.\n\nWhen Bolt took the baton from Yohan Blake for his final homestretch, he was in third place, but that was no cause for concern. In virtually each of the seven relay golds he's won at the Olympics and world championships, Bolt has reeled in the competition down the stretch and won going away, much the same as all his 100 victories have played out.\n\nFive years and one day earlier, on the very same track, Bolt helped Jamaica set the world record. That run of 36.84 seconds earned Bolt the sixth of nine Olympic victories.\n\nBut last week in the 100, Bolt's extra gear was not enough either to catch Coleman, who finished second, or to hold off Justin Gatlin, the oft-booed American who came from behind to finish first.\n\nCould he have caught his relay competition in this one? Nobody will ever know. Bolt was gaining no ground at the 30-meter mark, which is when he felt the pain in his leg and went tumbling.\n\nAfterward, there was plenty of second-guessing to be done. Most of it came at the expense of the IAAF, which made the sprinters wait about 40 minutes from the time they were summoned from the warm-up room to the time the starting gun went off.\n\n\"I think this is crazy,\" Blake said. \"Forty minutes. Waiting. Warming up. Waiting. Warming up. It just should not happen. To have your champion go out like that. It's crazy.\"\n\nSaid Gatlin, who remains insistent that Bolt will be back someday: \"We lost all of our heat, all of our sweat, and we went out there cold.\"\n\nPart of the wait was for the U.S. women's relay team to finish its victory celebration. Tori Bowie anchored the win and, with one day left in the meet, is the only athlete to win two gold medals in London. Also, a medal ceremony was held for Russian high jump champion Mariya Lasitskene, who is competing as a neutral athlete because of the doping crisis in her country and got to listen not to her own anthem, but to the IAAF's theme song, as she stood on the podium.\n\nOther winners included Kevin Mayer of France in the decathlon and Johannes Vetter, whose victory in the javelin throw gave Germany its first gold of the championships.\n\nIn the undercard to the relays, Muktar Edris held off Mo Farah of Britain in the 5,000. With help of his Ethiopian teammates, Edris won a tactical cat-and-mouse race and denied Farah his fifth straight long-distance double, counting world championships and Olympics.\n\nAs if to prove that point one last time, he did it again -- this time without even finishing the race.", "time": "00:34:00"}

suddenly, stunningly, the sprint turned into a somersault.\n\nFifteen steps into the final homestretch of his final race, something gave in his left hamstring. The World's Fastest Man skittered to a stop -- hopping, skipping, jumping, then finally dropping to the ground and tumbling forward before coming to a rest.\n\nWhile the winning team from Britain crossed the finish line, Bolt was writhing on the track, where he eventually wound up chest down with his face pressed into Lane 5. He was certainly every bit as stunned as any of the 60,000-plus who packed the stadium Saturday, or the millions watching one of the world's most entertaining showmen make his final curtain call in the 4x100-meter relay at world championships.\n\nThere was no celebration. No gold, no silver, not even a consolation bronze, the likes of which Bolt received a week earlier in his final 100-meter race.\n\nJamaica closed the night with \"DNF\" by its name: Did Not Finish. Dead last. Bolt was helped into a wheelchair, but eventually got to his feet and, assisted by his teammates, limped gingerly across the finish line. He gave a few waves to the crowd, then left for the trainer's room, and with that, presumably left track and field forever.\n\n\"Injuries are part of our sport and, always, of course, it's sad to see,\" said Wallace Spearmon, the American sprinter who has been close with Bolt for years and was on hand helping the U.S. team. \"So, yeah, it's tragic.\"\n\nThe Jamaican team doctor, Kevin Jones, diagnosed the injury that brought a strange end to Bolt's career as, simply, a cramp in the champion's left hamstring.\n\n\"But a lot of pain is from disappointment from losing the race,\" Jones said. \"The last three weeks have been hard for him, you know. We hope for the best for him.\"\n\nWatching track's No. 1 sprinter and celebrity dropping to the ground was nothing short of jaw-dropping -- so much so that the fact that Britain won the race, outrunning a United States team that, somewhat amazingly, didn't drop the baton, almost seemed like an afterthought.\n\nNethaneel Mitchell-Blake held off U.S. anchorman Christian Coleman down the stretch and the Brits won their first-ever world title in the 4x100 in 37.47 seconds.\n\nWhen Bolt took the baton from Yohan Blake for his final homestretch, he was in third place, but that was no cause for concern.

Bolt suddenly screamed, stumbled and somersaulted as he came down, his golden farewell shattered by the first injury he has experienced at a major competition.\n\nThat wasn't the only surprise. Britain went on to beat the United States in a tight finish.\n\nThe 60,000-capacity stadium was primed for one last Bolt show, one last \"To the World\" pose after a victory, but the injury made it blatantly clear why Bolt is ready to retire. His body can no longer hold up.\n\n\"He is still the best in the world,\" said Justin Gatlin, Bolt's American rival who ended up with 100-meter gold and relay silver.\n\nBolt's teammates on the once-fabled Jamaican sprint squad were far from unmatchable, too. Bolt just had too much to make up in the final 100 meters as both Britain and the United States were ahead and even Japan was even.\n\nAs Bolt fell to the ground, the leg with the golden shoe giving way, the crowd still went wild because the home team went on to win gold in 37.47 seconds, .05 seconds ahead of the United States.\n\n\"It's a cramp in his left hamstring, but a lot of the pain is from disappointment from losing the race,\" Jamaican team doctor Kevin Jones said. \"The last three weeks have been hard for him, you know. We hope for the best for him.\"\n\nThe race will certainly be remembered for the gut-wrenching way in which the sport's greatest athlete ended his career.\n\nBefore Bolt came onto the track, he was consoling Mo Farah, his long-distance equivalent who had just lost his first major race since 2011 when he failed to get gold in the 5,000 meters.\n\nFarah also was bidding farewell to the track, coming up short of his fifth straight 5,000-10,000 double at major championships in a sprint against Muktar Edris of Ethiopia.\n\n\"I gave it all,\" Farah said. \"I didn't have a single bit left at the end.\"", "time": "03:01:00"}

Usain Bolt's unparalleled career ended in extraordinary drama on Saturday as he pulled up with injury on the anchor leg of his very last race, the 4x100 metres relay final at the World Championships.\n\nThe 30-year-old had taken the baton for Jamaica a few metres adrift of the two leaders when, straining hard to catch them, he stopped abruptly with cramp in his left hamstring, began hobbling and tumbled to a halt after a forward roll.\n\nAs Britain went on to win gold, Bolt lay on his back in his lane, his head in hands, being tended to by medics as one waited with a wheelchair to help push him off the track.\n\nYet the sport's greatest entertainer was determined that one of the finest careers in sport was not going to end with him in a wheelchair.\n\nSo the fastest man of all-time, surrounded by his three worried team mates, Omar McLeod, Julian Forte and Yohan Blake, rose gingerly to his feet and limped the last 30 metres to the line.\n\nThe official result recorded that the Jamaicans did not finish but Bolt had been absolutely determined to ensure he completed the last race after a matchless career in which he won 19 major championship gold medals.\n\nTypically, Bolt's only thoughts were with the team mates he felt he had let down.\n\n\"He kept apologising to us but we told him there was no need to apologise,\" Forte said. \"Injuries are part of the sport.\"\n\nMcLeod added: \"It just happened - Usain Bolt's name will always live on.\"\n\nJustin Gatlin, the American winner of the individual 100 metres who had consigned Bolt to third place in his final individual race last Saturday, paid tribute to his rival.\n\n\"I think it was the elements (that caused the injury). I'm sorry he got this injury. He is still the best in the world,\" Gatlin said.\n\n\"This is farewell time, I am sentimental about it already now. In the warm-up area, we give ourselves respect and greeted each other. Usain Bolt is a great athlete.\"\n\nKevin Jones, the Jamaican team doctor, said Bolt had suffered cramp in his left hamstring.\n\nBlake was angry at having to wait for two medal ceremonies to take place before the race.\n\n\"It was 40 minutes and two medal presentations before our run ... we were kept 40 minutes. It was crazy,\" Blake said. \"They were holding us too long.\n\n\"We keep warming up and waiting, then warming up and waiting. I think it got the better of us.\n\n\"It hurts to see a true legend, a true champion go out there and struggle like that.\"\n\nJamaican team manager Ian Forbes praised Bolt for \"going out there and giving his all\" and added that the squad were \"very saddened\".\n\n\"The diagnostic work will be done shortly to determine how serious it is. He was able to walk to the team bus so hopefully that signals it's not as serious as it possibly could be,\" Forbes said.\n\nWith the 56,000-strong crowd going wild about the British victory, there was still time for them to hail the sport's favourite performer, who waved to them a mite forlornly while hobbling away from the track.\n\nFive years ago, almost to the very night, British distance running hero Mo Farah had broken into Bolt's lightning bolt pose in this same stadium and the Jamaican had reciprocated with the Briton's trademark \"Mobot\" to mark their joyous supremacy at the London Olympics.\n\nYet in the same stadium on Saturday, they attempted in vain to reprise that triumphant night, Farah ending up with silver in his final track race, over 5,000 metres, and Bolt suffering his anti-climactic farewell.\n\nTheir leaving of the track scene leaves a void in the sport that does not look like being filled any time soon.", "time": "04:54:00"}

"http://registerguard.com/rg/sports/35856319-81/nothing-but-a-big-bolt-of-pain-in-the-end.html.csp", "body": "LONDON -- Usain Bolt was ramping into warp speed when suddenly, stunningly, the sprint turned into a somersault.\n\nFifteen steps into the final homestretch of his final race, something gave in his left hamstring. The World's Fastest Man skittered to a stop -- hopping, skipping, jumping, then finally dropping to the ground and tumbling forward before coming to a rest.\n\nWhile the winning team from Britain crossed the finish line, Bolt was writhing on the track, where he eventually wound up chest down with his face pressed into Lane 5. He was certainly every bit as stunned as any of the 60,000-plus who packed the stadium Saturday, or the millions watching one of the world's most entertaining showmen make his final curtain call in the 4x100-meter relay at the IAAF World Track & Field Championships.\n\nThere was no celebration. No gold, no silver, not even a consolation bronze, the likes of which Bolt received a week earlier in his final 100-meter race.\n\nJamaica closed the night with \"DNF\" by its name: Did Not Finish. Dead last. Bolt was helped into a wheelchair, but eventually got to his feet and, assisted by his teammates, limped gingerly across the finish line. He gave a few waves to the crowd, then left for the trainer's room, and with that, presumably left track and field forever.\n\n\"Injuries are part of our sport and, always, of course, it's sad to see,\" said Wallace Spearmon, the American sprinter who has been close with Bolt for years and was on hand helping the U.S. team. \"So, yeah, it's tragic.\"\n\nThe Jamaican team doctor, Kevin Jones, diagnosed the injury that brought a strange end to Bolt's career as, simply, a cramp in the champion's left hamstring.\n\n\"But a lot of pain is from disappointment from losing the race,\" Jones said. \"The last three weeks have been hard for him, you know. We hope for the best for him.\"\n\nWatching track's No. 1 sprinter and celebrity dropping to the ground was nothing short of jaw-dropping -- so much so that the fact that Britain won the race, outrunning a United States team that, somewhat amazingly, didn't drop the baton, almost seemed like an afterthought.\n\nNethaneel Mitchell-Blake held off U.S. anchorman Christian Coleman down the stretch and the Brits won their first-ever world title in the 4x100 in 37.47 seconds.\n\nWhen Bolt took the baton from Yohan Blake for his final homestretch, he was in third place, but that was no cause for concern. In virtually each of the seven relay golds he's won at the Olympics and world championships, Bolt has reeled in the competition down the stretch and won going away, much the same as all his 100 victories have played out.\n\nFive years and one day earlier, on the very same track, Bolt helped Jamaica set the world record. That run of 36.84 seconds earned Bolt the sixth of nine Olympic victories.\n\nBut last week in the 100, Bolt's extra gear was not enough either to catch Coleman, who finished second, or to hold off Justin Gatlin, the oft-booed American who came from behind to finish first.\n\nCould he have caught his relay competition in this one? Nobody will ever know. Bolt was gaining no ground at the 30-meter mark, which is when he felt the pain in his leg and went tumbling.\n\nAfterward, there was plenty of second-guessing to be done. Most of it came at the expense of the IAAF, which made the sprinters wait about 40 minutes from the time they were summoned from the warm-up room to the time the starting gun went off.\n\n\"I think this is crazy,\" Blake said. \"Forty minutes. Waiting. Warming up. Waiting. Warming up. It just should not happen. To have your champion go out like that. It's crazy.\"\n\nSaid Gatlin, who remains insistent that Bolt will be back someday: \"We lost all of our heat, all of our sweat, and we went out there cold.\"\n\nPart of the wait was for the U.S. women's relay team to finish its victory celebration. Tori Bowie anchored the win and, with one day left in the meet, is the only athlete to win two gold medals in London.\n\nAlso, a medal ceremony was held for Russian high jump champion Mariya Lasitskene, who is competing as a neutral athlete because of the doping crisis in her country and got to listen not to her own anthem, but to the IAAF's theme song, as she stood on the podium.\n\nOther winners included Kevin Mayer of France in the decathlon and Johannes Vetter, whose victory in the javelin throw gave Germany its first gold of the championships.", "time": "06:47:00"}

with injury on the anchor leg of his very last race, the 4x100 metres relay final at the World Championships.\n\nThe 30-year-old had taken the baton for Jamaica a few metres adrift of the two leaders when, straining hard to catch them, he stopped abruptly with cramp in his left hamstring, began hobbling and tumbled to a halt after a forward roll.\n\nAs Britain went on to win gold, Bolt lay on his back in his lane, his head in hands, being tended to by medics as one waited with a wheelchair to help push him off the track.\n\nYet the sport's greatest entertainer was determined that one of the finest careers in sport was not going to end with him in a wheelchair.\n\nSo the fastest man of all-time, surrounded by his three worried team mates, Omar McLeod, Julian Forte and Yohan Blake, rose gingerly to his feet and limped the last 30 metres to the line.\n\nThe official result recorded that the Jamaicans did not finish but Bolt had been absolutely determined to ensure he completed the last race after a matchless career in which he won 19 major championship gold medals.\n\nTypically, Bolt's only thoughts were with the team mates he felt he had let down.\n\n\"He kept apologising to us but we told him there was no need to apologise,\" Forte said. \"Injuries are part of the sport.\"\n\nMcLeod added: \"It just happened - Usain Bolt's name will always live on.\"\n\nTHIRD PLACE\n\nJustin Gatlin, the American winner of the individual 100 metres who had consigned Bolt to third place in his final individual race last Saturday, paid tribute to his rival.\n\n\"I think it was the elements (that caused the injury). I'm sorry he got this injury. He is still the best in the world,\" Gatlin said.\n\n\"This is farewell time, I am sentimental about it already now. In the warm-up area, we give ourselves respect and greeted each other. Usain Bolt is a great athlete.\"\n\nKevin Jones, the Jamaican team doctor, said Bolt had suffered cramp in his left hamstring.\n\nBlake was angry at having to wait for two medal ceremonies to take place before the race.\n\n\"It was 40 minutes and two medal presentations before our run ... we were kept 40 minutes. It was crazy,\" Blake said. \"They were holding us too long.\n\n\"We keep warming up and waiting, then warming up and waiting. I think it got the better of us.\n\n\"It hurts to see a true legend, a true champion go out there and struggle like that.\"\n\nJamaican team manager Ian Forbes praised Bolt for \"going out there and giving his all\" and added that the squad were \"very saddened\".\n\n\"The diagnostic work will be done shortly to determine how serious it is. He was able to walk to the team bus so hopefully that signals it's not as serious as it possibly could be,\" Forbes said.\n\nWith the 56,000-strong crowd going wild about the British victory, there was still time for them to hail the sport's favourite performer, who waved to them a mite forlornly while hobbling away from the track.\n\nFive years ago, almost to the very night, British distance running hero Mo Farah had broken into Bolt's lightning bolt pose in this same stadium and the Jamaican had reciprocated with the Briton's trademark \"Mobot\" to mark their joyous supremacy at the London Olympics.\n\nYet in the same stadium on Saturday, they attempted in vain to reprise that triumphant night, Farah ending up with silver in his final track race, over 5,000 metres, and Bolt suffering his anti-climactic farewell.\n\nTheir leaving of the track scene leaves a void in the sport that does not look like being filled any time soon.", "time": "09:08:00"}

anchor man Bolt received the baton in third place behind eventual gold medallists Britain and runners-up America.\n\nA sentimental Justin Gatlin hailed Usain Bolt as an \"amazing showman\" whose career would certainly not be defined by him pulling up with cramp in the world 4x100m relay, the Jamaican's final competitive race.\n\nThere was high drama in Saturday's relay as anchor man Bolt received the baton in third place behind eventual gold medallists Britain and runners-up America.\n\nLess than 50 metres down the track, Bolt suddenly pulled up, clutching his left leg, tumbling to the track with what was later diagnosed as a hamstring cramp.\n\n\"This is farewell time, I am sentimental about it already now,\" said Gatlin, who stormed to 100m gold in London, US teammate Christian Coleman taking silver to relegate Bolt to a disappointing bronze in his individual send-off.\n\n\"In the warm-up area we give ourselves respect and greet each other,\" Gatlin said of Bolt, who bows out of competition with a startling haul of eight Olympic gold medals and 14 world medals, nine of which are gold.\n\nGatlin, who has served two doping bans, put the blame for Bolt's cramp partly at the amount of time the athletes spent on the track before the starter's gun went off.\n\n\"There was a cool breeze out there. But the conditions were the same for everybody,\" said the 35-year-old, who won the 100m at the 2004 Olympics in Athens and the 2005 worlds in Helsinki before serving his second ban between 2006-10 for taking testosterone.\n\nChilly conditions unhelpful\n\n\"I think it was the elements. I am sorry he got this injury. He is still the best in the world.\n\n\"It was a recipe. I don't want to say this but I understand we need to be ready early but I think we took our clothes off a little too early. It's a little chilly in here so I think that's where the cramp came from. That's what he suffered with. He was running out there cold.\"\n\nBut Gatlin, who was roundly booed at the London Stadium before both the 100m and relay, insisted: \"Usain Bolt is a great athlete.\n\n\"You can't let this championships define what he's done in the past. He has done amazing things. He's still the man, you know. The was his farewell race and we wish him the best and hope he recovers soon.\"\n\nReferring to Bolt's mooted future ambassadorial role within athletics' world governing body the IAAF, Gatlin added: \"He's coming back in a couple of years. He'll be ready, he has a passion for the sport.\n\n\"He loves the fans and they love him. He loves the sport too much to walk away. He's a showman.\"\n\nJapan snatched a surprise bronze medal, Kenji Fujimitsu moved to comment: \"Thank you, Bolt. He was an inspiration for us.\"\n\nOmar McLeod, the newly-crowned 110m hurdler and Jamaica's lead-off runner in the relay, added: \"Usain Bolt's name will always live on.\"", "time": "02:55:00"}

"LONDON -- Usain Bolt set the stage for his grand farewell, powering down the finishing straight Saturday to qualify Jamaica for the 4x100-meter relay final at the world championships.\n\nFittingly, he will face Justin Gatlin and the US in the final chapter of his unparalleled career.\n\nBoth nations won their heats early Saturday, though the US relay squad got the baton around with more aplomb than Jamaica, which had to rely on Bolt to clinch victory.\n\nAnd Bolt relished the adulation at the 60,000-capacity Olympic Stadium.\n\n\"They've been outstanding so far, and continue to surprise me and give me energy,\" Bolt said.\n\nFor the best part of the past decade, though, Bolt has been 100 percent reliable in getting relay gold for the island nation. The last time Jamaica lost a world championship final was in Bolt's rookie year in 2007, when he ran the second leg and only took silver behind the Americans.\n\nEver since, Bolt has flaunted his power at the end of every major championship, getting the third gold medal for himself and sometimes another world record for Jamaica.\n\nThis year, however, he only got bronze in the 100 behind Gatlin. And the result in the relay is no longer a foregone conclusion.\n\nThe US, with Gatlin running the second leg, won the first heat in a world leading time of 37.70 seconds. The Americans beat Britain and Japan, both of which also qualified.\n\n\"My team did a great job,\" said Gatlin, the oldest of the squad at 35. \"They're thinking and acting like veterans and I'm proud of them.\"\n\nChristian Coleman took silver in the 100 ahead of Bolt and it gave the US team an added boost.\n\n\"Having the gold and silver medal on the same relay team, which hasn't been done in a long time, it gives us kind of a confidence booster that the speed can get around the track,\" Gatlin said.\n\nBolt stepped out on the track for the second heat, and the Jamaicans needed him. Trailing when he got the baton on the anchor leg, Bolt powered away, quickly swept past his rivals and had time to look to his right before crossing in 37.95 seconds.\n\nIn the women's heats, both nations are also through.\n\nAllyson Felix stayed in line to become the athlete with the most medals in world championships history when she helped the American relay team qualify.\n\nRunning the second leg, Felix and her teammates crossed first in a season's leading time of 41.84 seconds, beating Britain and Switzerland. They also advanced to the final.\n\nIn the second heat, Germany beat two-time defending champion Jamaica to qualify along with Brazil.\n\nThe Netherlands, with 200-meter champion Dafne Schippers running the second leg, qualified on time.\n\nFelix has won 14 medals at the world championships and can move up to 16 if she runs the 4x400 relay and the United States wins medals in both events.\n\nIn the decathlon, two-time world champion Trey Hardee of the United States hit the third hurdle and clattered into the next one during the 110-meter hurdles to end his medal chances.\n\nIn the first of five events on the final day of the two-day competition, Kevin Mayer of France set a third personal record to easily stay atop the standings with 5,485 points. Rico Freimuth of Germany was in second place with 5,377 points, while Damian Warner of Canada had the fastest time in the hurdles of 13.63 seconds to move into third. -- AP", "time": "03:38:00"}

stunningly, the sprint turned into a somersault.\n\nFifteen steps into the final homestretch of his final race, something gave in his left hamstring. The World's Fastest Man skittered to a stop -- hopping, skipping, jumping, then finally dropping to the ground and tumbling forward before coming to a rest.\n\nWhile the winning team from Britain crossed the finish line, Bolt was writhing on the track, where he eventually wound up chest down with his face pressed into Lane 5. He was certainly every bit as stunned as any of the 60,000-plus who packed the stadium Saturday, or the millions watching one of the world's most entertaining showmen make his final curtain call in the 4\u00d7100-meter relay at world championships.\n\nThere was no celebration. No gold, no silver, not even a consolation bronze, the likes of which Bolt received a week earlier in his final 100-meter race.\n\nJamaica closed the night with \"DNF\" by its name: Did Not Finish. Dead last. Bolt was helped into a wheelchair, but eventually got to his feet and, assisted by his teammates, limped gingerly across the finish line. He gave a few waves to the crowd, then left for the trainer's room, and with that, presumably left track and field forever.\n\n\"Injuries are part of our sport and, always, of course, it's sad to see,\" said Wallace Spearmon, the American sprinter who has been close with Bolt for years and was on hand helping the U.S. team. \"So, yeah, it's tragic.\"\n\nThe Jamaican team doctor, Kevin Jones, diagnosed the injury that brought a strange end to Bolt's career as, simply, a cramp in the champion's left hamstring.\n\n\"But a lot of pain is from disappointment from losing the race,\" Jones said. \"The last three weeks have been hard for him, you know. We hope for the best for him.\"\n\nWatching track's No. 1 sprinter and celebrity dropping to the ground was nothing short of jaw-dropping -- so much so that the fact that Britain won the race, outrunning a United States team that, somewhat amazingly, didn't drop the baton, almost seemed like an afterthought.\n\nNethaneel Mitchell-Blake held off U.S. anchorman Christian Coleman down the stretch and the Brits won their first-ever world title in the 4\u00d7100 in 37.47 seconds.\n\nWhen Bolt took the baton from Yohan Blake for his final homestretch, he was in third place, but that was no cause for concern. In virtually each of the seven relay golds he's won at the Olympics and world championships, Bolt has reeled in the competition down the stretch and won going away, much the same as all his 100 victories have played out.\n\nFive years and one day earlier, on the very same track, Bolt helped Jamaica set the world record. That run of 36.84 seconds earned Bolt the sixth of nine Olympic victories.\n\nBut last week in the 100, Bolt's extra gear was not enough either to catch Coleman, who finished second, or to hold off Justin Gatlin, the oft-booed American who came from behind to finish first.\n\nCould he have caught his relay competition in this one? Nobody will ever know. Bolt was gaining no ground at the 30-meter mark, which is when he felt the pain in his leg and went tumbling.\n\nAfterward, there was plenty of second-guessing to be done. Most of it came at the expense of the IAAF, which made the sprinters wait about 40 minutes from the time they were summoned from the warm-up room to the time the starting gun went off.\n\n\"I think this is crazy,\" Blake said. \"Forty minutes. Waiting. Warming up. Waiting. Warming up. It just should not happen. To have your champion go out like that. It's crazy.\"\n\nSaid Gatlin, who remains insistent that Bolt will be back someday: \"We lost all of our heat, all of our sweat, and we went out there cold.\"\n\nPart of the wait was for the U.S. women's relay team to finish its victory celebration. Tori Bowie anchored the win and, with one day left in the meet, is the only athlete to win two gold medals in London. Also, a medal ceremony was held for Russian high jump champion Mariya Lasitskene, who is competing as a neutral athlete because of the doping crisis in her country and got to listen not to her own anthem, but to the IAAF's theme song, as she stood on the podium.\n\nOther winners included Kevin Mayer of France in the decathlon and Johannes Vetter, whose victory in the javelin throw gave Germany its first gold of the championships.\n\nIn the undercard to the relays, Muktar Edris held off Mo Farah of Britain in the 5,000. With help of his Ethiopian teammates, Edris won a tactical cat-and-mouse race and denied Farah his fifth straight long-distance double, counting world championships and Olympics.\n\nAs if to prove that point one last time, he did it again -- this time without even finishing the race.", "time": "08:37:00"}

leg of the world 4x100m relay won by Britain on Saturday.\n\nBolt received the baton with Jamaica in third, but halfway down the finishing straight the towering sprinter pulled up clutching his left thigh, eventually doing a forward somersault to the ground, to gasps from the 60,000 sell out London Stadium.\n\nThe British quartet of Chijindu Ujah, Adam Gemili, Daniel Talbot and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake claimed gold in 37.47 seconds, with the Justin Gatlin-led US four taking silver at 0.05sec and Japan a surprise bronze (38.04).\n\nBolt missed out on his bid to retain his 100m title earlier in the week, losing out to Gatlin and silver medallist Christian Coleman, who ran relay anchor for the Americans on Saturday.\n\nBut hopes were high for Bolt's final competitive race, with Jamaica also boasting newly-crowned 110m hurdles champion Omar McLeod, Julian Forte and Yohan Blake in their line-up.\n\nJamaica were afforded a rousing welcome from the crowd, a relaxed-looking Bolt applauding the stands, with pictures of him constantly shown on the stadium's big screens.\n\nGatlin, who has served two doping bans, and the US team also including another convicted doping cheat, Mike Rodgers, and Jaylen Bacon were booed when introduced although the jeering was less pronounced than for the individual 100m event.\n\nA close first three legs saw Britain, the United States and Jamaica, seeking a fifth consecutive world title, level-pegged for the final leg.\n\nHigh drama\n\nBut there was to be high drama as a visibly swearing Bolt pulled up in obvious pain, allowing the Japanese quartet to edge in for third.\n\nThe result means Bolt, 100 and 200m world record holder, finishes his career with 14 world career medals, one behind American Allyson Felix, to go with eight Olympic golds.\n\nAmid wild home celebrations, Bolt was attended to by medics, but refused a ride in a wheelchair off the track, instead finally getting up and limping alongside his teammates through to the finish line and then off into the bowels of the stadium for treatment.\n\nIt was a sad exit for an athlete who has lit up the track when the sport has been dragged through its worst-ever crisis, racked by doping and corruption scandals that went to the very heart of athletics' governing body.\n\nAnd what a gaping hole his absence will leave, no matter how brave a face the IAAF try to put on it.\n\nSince confirming his sprinting dominance with triple gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Bolt spent nine seasons amassing 19 global golds, 13 of which have come in individual events.\n\nAllied with a charismatic personality, it has guaranteed Bolt recognition as one of the world's most successful sportsmen. Last year alone he earned $34.2 million, according to Forbes.", "time": "07:12:00"}

hands, being tended to by medics as one waited with a wheelchair to help push him off the track.\n\nUsain Bolt's unparalleled career ended in extraordinary drama on Saturday as he pulled up with injury on the anchor leg of his very last race, the 4x100 metres relay final at the World Championships.\n\nThe 30-year-old had taken the baton for Jamaica a few metres adrift of the two leaders when, straining hard to catch them, he stopped abruptly with cramp in his left hamstring, began hobbling and tumbled to a halt after a forward roll.\n\nAs Britain went on to win gold, Bolt lay on his back in his lane, his head in hands, being tended to by medics as one waited with a wheelchair to help push him off the track.\n\nYet the sport's greatest entertainer was determined that one of the finest careers in sport was not going to end with him in a wheelchair.\n\nSo the fastest man of all-time, surrounded by his three worried team mates, Omar McLeod, Julian Forte and Yohan Blake, rose gingerly to his feet and limped the last 30 metres to the line.\n\nThe official result recorded that the Jamaicans did not finish but Bolt had been absolutely determined to ensure he completed the last race after a matchless career in which he won 19 major championship gold medals.\n\nTypically, Bolt's only thoughts were with the team mates he felt he had let down.\n\n\"He kept apologising to us but we told him there was no need to apologise,\" Forte said. \"Injuries are part of the sport.\"\n\nMcLeod added: \"It just happened - Usain Bolt's name will always live on.\"\n\nThird place\n\nJustin Gatlin, the American winner of the individual 100 metres who had consigned Bolt to third place in his final individual race last Saturday, paid tribute to his rival.\n\n\"I think it was the elements (that caused the injury). I'm sorry he got this injury. He is still the best in the world,\" Gatlin said.\n\n\"This is farewell time, I am sentimental about it already now. In the warm-up area, we give ourselves respect and greeted each other. Usain Bolt is a great athlete.\"\n\nKevin Jones, the Jamaican team doctor, said Bolt had suffered cramp in his left hamstring.\n\nBlake was angry at having to wait for two medal ceremonies to take place before the race.\n\n\"It was 40 minutes and two medal presentations before our run ... we were kept 40 minutes. It was crazy,\" Blake said. \"They were holding us too long.\n\n\"We keep warming up and waiting, then warming up and waiting. I think it got the better of us.\n\n\"It hurts to see a true legend, a true champion go out there and struggle like that.\"\n\nJamaican team manager Ian Forbes praised Bolt for \"going out there and giving his all\" and added that the squad were \"very saddened\".\n\n\"The diagnostic work will be done shortly to determine how serious it is. He was able to walk to the team bus so hopefully that signals it's not as serious as it possibly could be,\" Forbes said.\n\nWith the 56,000-strong crowd going wild about the British victory, there was still time for them to hail the sport's favourite performer, who waved to them a mite forlornly while hobbling away from the track.\n\nFive years ago, almost to the very night, British distance running hero Mo Farah had broken into Bolt's lightning bolt pose in this same stadium and the Jamaican had reciprocated with the Briton's trademark \"Mobot\" to mark their joyous supremacy at the London Olympics.\n\nYet in the same stadium on Saturday, they attempted in vain to reprise that triumphant night, Farah ending up with silver in his final track race, over 5,000 metres, and Bolt suffering his anti-climactic farewell.\n\nTheir leaving of the track scene leaves a void in the sport that does not look like being filled any time soon.

He suddenly stumbled and hobbled a few strides before falling down on the track in pain and agony.\n\nBlake said the lengthy wait in cold conditions contributed to Bolt's injury. The final race of Saturday's evening session started later than initially planned, following medal ceremonies for the men's 5000m and women's high jump.\n\n\"They were holding us too long...it was atrocious. That long wait contributed (to Bolt's injury). Inside it was cold. We keep warming up and waiting, then warming up and waiting. I think it got the better of us,\" Blake said.\n\n\"You have to think about the athletes because we were in the mixed zone too long, over 40 minutes. A hero of the sport to go down like that? As a true friend, I didn't like it one bit. He was saying he was sorry, but there was nothing to be sorry for, he's done it for us (during his career).\n\n\"It was cold and there was 40 minutes and two medal presentations before our run. It was crazy,\" added the 2011 world 100m champion Blake. Justin Gatlin, who snatched a gold in 100m dash to spoil Bolt's individual farewell race, suggested the same.\n\n\"I think it was the elements. I am sorry he (Bolt) got this injury. I understand the magic of TV and that everything has to happen for viewers at home but we were held a little long before we went out. We were out of our clothes and it was quite cold. I lost all my heat and sweat. I think if that hadn't happened, may be we would have run quicker, as would other teams,\" Gatlin said.\n\n\"It was a recipe (for possible injury). I don't want to say this but I understand we need to be ready early but I think we took our clothes off a little too early. It's a little chilly in here so I think that's where the cramp came from. That's what he (Bolt) suffered with. He was running out there cold,\" added Gatlin who ran the second leg for silver- winning American team.\n\nBolt was his long-time rival and he lost five successive Olympic and World Championship races to him. Nonetheless, Gatlin paid tribute to the Jamaican.\n\n\"No one wants to see Usain go out like that, with an injury. All of us up here have been inspired by his career in some way. If we look past what happened at this championship, he has had an incredible career and that should be celebrated,\" Gatlin said.\n\n\"He has done so much for athletics, from 2008 until now. Everything has happened so fast. Congratulations on his legendary career,\" he added.\n\nChristian Coleman, who ran the anchor leg for USA, said, \"Usain Bolt is a legend, he has inspired us. I was just blessed to be here, to be on the line with him. I will tell my grandkids about this one day.\"\n\nIn fact, he had beaten Bolt thrice in this championships - in 100m semi-finals, finals (where he took a silver) and the sprint relay.", "time": "13:42:00"}

up injured on the anchor leg of the world 4x100m relay won by Britain on Saturday.\n\nBolt received the baton with Jamaica in third, but halfway down the finishing straight the towering sprinter pulled up clutching his left thigh, eventually doing a forward somersault to the ground, to gasps from the 60,000 sell out London Stadium.\n\nThe British quartet of Chijindu Ujah, Adam Gemili, Daniel Talbot and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake claimed gold in 37.47 seconds, with the Justin Gatlin-led US four taking silver at 0.05sec and Japan a surprise bronze (38.04).\n\nBolt missed out on his bid to retain his 100m title earlier in the week, losing out to Gatlin and silver medallist Christian Coleman, who ran relay anchor for the Americans on Saturday.\n\nBut hopes were high for Bolt's final competitive race, with Jamaica also boasting newly-crowned 110m hurdles champion Omar McLeod, Julian Forte and Yohan Blake in their line-up.\n\nJamaica were afforded a rousing welcome from the crowd, a relaxed-looking Bolt applauding the stands, with pictures of him constantly shown on the stadium's big screens.\n\nGatlin, who has served two doping bans, and the US team also including another convicted doping cheat, Mike Rodgers, and Jaylen Bacon were booed when introduced although the jeering was less pronounced than for the individual 100m event.\n\nA close first three legs saw Britain, the United States and Jamaica, seeking a fifth consecutive world title, level-pegged for the final leg.\n\nHigh drama\n\nBut there was to be high drama as a visibly swearing Bolt pulled up in obvious pain, allowing the Japanese quartet to edge in for third.\n\nThe result means Bolt, 100 and 200m world record holder, finishes his career with 14 world career medals, one behind American Allyson Felix, to go with eight Olympic golds.\n\nAmid wild home celebrations, Bolt was attended to by medics, but refused a ride in a wheelchair off the track, instead finally getting up and limping alongside his teammates through to the finish line and then off into the bowels of the stadium for treatment.\n\nIt was a sad exit for an athlete who has lit up the track when the sport has been dragged through its worst-ever crisis, racked by doping and corruption scandals that went to the very heart of athletics' governing body.\n\nAnd what a gaping hole his absence will leave, no matter how brave a face the IAAF try to put on it.\n\nSince confirming his sprinting dominance with triple gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Bolt spent nine seasons amassing 19 global golds, 13 of which

"body": "LONDON, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Usain Bolt's unparalleled career ended in extraordinary drama on Saturday as he pulled up with injury on the anchor leg of his very last race, the 4x100 metres relay final at the World Championships.\n\nThe 30-year-old had taken the baton for Jamaica a few metres adrift of the two leaders when, straining hard to catch them, he stopped abruptly with cramp in his left hamstring, began hobbling and tumbled to a halt after a forward roll.\n\nAs Britain went on to win gold, Bolt lay on his back in his lane, his head in hands, being tended to by medics as one waited with a wheelchair to help push him off the track.\n\nYet the sport's greatest entertainer was determined that one of the finest careers in sport was not going to end with him in a wheelchair.\n\nSo the fastest man of all-time, surrounded by his three worried team mates, Omar McLeod, Julian Forte and Yohan Blake, rose gingerly to his feet and limped the last 30 metres to the line.\n\nThe official result recorded that the Jamaicans did not finish but Bolt had been absolutely determined to ensure he completed the last race after a matchless career in which he won 19 major championship gold medals.\n\nTypically, Bolt's only thoughts were with the team mates he felt he had let down.\n\n\"He kept apologising to us but we told him there was no need to apologise,\" Forte said. \"Injuries are part of the sport.\"\n\nMcLeod added: \"It just happened - Usain Bolt's name will always live on.\"\n\nJustin Gatlin, the American winner of the individual 100 metres who had consigned Bolt to third place in his final individual race last Saturday, paid tribute to his rival.\n\n\"I think it was the elements (that caused the injury). I'm sorry he got this injury. He is still the best in the world,\" Gatlin said.\n\n\"This is farewell time, I am sentimental about it already now. In the warm-up area, we give ourselves respect and greeted each other. Usain Bolt is a great athlete.\"\n\nKevin Jones, the Jamaican team doctor, said Bolt had suffered cramp in his left hamstring.\n\nBlake was angry at having to wait for two medal ceremonies to take place before the race.\n\n\"It was 40 minutes and two medal presentations before our run ... we were kept 40 minutes. It was crazy,\" Blake said. \"They were holding us too long.\n\n\"We keep warming up and waiting, then warming up and waiting. I think it got the better of us.\n\n\"It hurts to see a true legend, a true champion go out there and struggle like that.\"\n\nJamaican team manager Ian Forbes praised Bolt for \"going out there and giving his all\" and added that the squad were \"very saddened\".\n\n\"The diagnostic work will be done shortly to determine how serious it is. He was able to walk to the team bus so hopefully that signals it's not as serious as it possibly could be,\" Forbes said.\n\nWith the 56,000-strong crowd going wild about the British victory, there was still time for them to hail the sport's favourite performer, who waved to them a mite forlornly while hobbling away from the track.\n\nFive years ago, almost to the very night, British distance running hero Mo Farah had broken into Bolt's lightning bolt pose in this same stadium and the Jamaican had reciprocated with the Briton's trademark \"Mobot\" to mark their joyous supremacy at the London Olympics.\n\nYet in the same stadium on Saturday, they attempted in vain to reprise that triumphant night, Farah ending up with silver in his final track race, over 5,000 metres, and Bolt suffering his anti-climactic farewell.\n\nTheir leaving of the track scene leaves a void in the sport that does not look like being filled any time soon.

He suddenly stumbled and hobbled a few strides before falling down on the track in pain and agony.\n\nBlake said the lengthy wait in cold conditions contributed to Bolt's injury. The final race of Saturday's evening session started later than initially planned, following medal ceremonies for the men's 5000m and women's high jump.\n\n\"They were holding us too long...it was atrocious. That long wait contributed (to Bolt's injury). Inside it was cold. We keep warming up and waiting, then warming up and waiting. I think it got the better of us,\" Blake said.\n\n\"You have to think about the athletes because we were in the mixed zone too long, over 40 minutes. A hero of the sport to go down like that? As a true friend, I didn't like it one bit. He was saying he was sorry, but there was nothing to be sorry for, he's done it for us (during his career).\n\n\"It was cold and there was 40 minutes and two medal presentations before our run. It was crazy,\" added the 2011 world 100m champion Blake.\n\nJustin Gatlin, who snatched a gold in 100m dash to spoil Bolt's individual farewell race, suggested the same.\n\n\"I think it was the elements. I am sorry he (Bolt) got this injury. I understand the magic of TV and that everything has to happen for viewers at home but we were held a little long before we went out. We were out of our clothes and it was quite cold. I lost all my heat and sweat. I think if that hadn't happened, may be we would have run quicker, as would other teams,\" Gatlin said.\n\n\"It was a recipe (for possible injury). I don't want to say this but I understand we need to be ready early but I think we took our clothes off a little too early. It's a little chilly in here so I think that's where the cramp came from. That's what he (Bolt) suffered with. He was running out there cold,\" added Gatlin who ran the second leg for silver- winning American team.\n\nBolt was his long-time rival and he lost five successive Olympic and World Championship races to him. Nonetheless, Gatlin paid tribute to the Jamaican.\n\n\"No one wants to see Usain go out like that, with an injury. All of us up here have been inspired by his career in some way. If we look past what happened at this championship, he has had an incredible career and that should be celebrated,\" Gatlin said.\n\n\"He has done so much for athletics, from 2008 until now. Everything has happened so fast. Congratulations on his legendary career,\" he added.\n\nChristian Coleman, who ran the anchor leg for USA, said, \"Usain Bolt is a legend, he has inspired us. I was just blessed to be here, to be on the line with him. I will tell my grandkids about this one day.\"\n\nIn fact, he had beaten Bolt thrice in this championships -- in 100m semifinals, finals (where he took a silver) and the sprint relay.", "time": "10:34:00"}

whose career would certainly not be defined by him pulling up with a cramp in the world 4x100m relay, the Jamaican's final competitive race.\n\nThere was high drama in yesterday's relay as anchor -man Bolt received the baton in third place behind eventual gold medallists Britain and runners-up America.\n\nLess than 50 metres down the track, Bolt suddenly pulled up, clutching his left leg, tumbling to the track with what was later diagnosed as a hamstring cramp.\n\n\"This is farewell time, I am sentimental about it already now,\" said Gatlin, who stormed to 100m gold in London, US teammate Christian Coleman taking silver, to relegate Bolt to a disappointing bronze in his individual send-off.\n\n\"In the warm-up area we give ourselves respect and greet each other,\" Gatlin said of Bolt, who bows out of competition with a startling haul of eight Olympic gold medals and 14 world medals, nine of which are gold.\n\nGatlin, who has served two doping bans, put the blame for Bolt's cramp partly at the amount of time the athletes spent on the track before the starter's gun went off.\n\n\"There was a cool breeze out there, but the conditions were the same for everybody,\" said the 35-year-old, who won the 100m at the 2004 Olympics in Athens and the 2005 worlds in Helsinki before serving his second ban between 2006-10 for taking testosterone.\n\n\"I think it was the elements. I am sorry he got this injury. He is still the best in the world.\n\n\"It was a recipe. I don't want to say this, but I understand we need to be ready early. but I think we took our clothes off a little too early. It's a little chilly in here so I think that's where the cramp came from. That's what he suffered with. He was running out there cold.\"\n\nBut Gatlin, who was roundly booed at the London Stadium before both the 100m and relay, insisted: \"Usain Bolt is a great athlete.\n\n\"You can't let this championships define what he's done in the past. He has done amazing things. He's still the man, you know. This was his farewell race and we wish him the best and hope he recovers soon.\"\n\nReferring to Bolt's mooted future ambassadorial role within athletics' world governing body the IAAF, Gatlin added: \"He's coming back in a couple of years. He'll be ready; he has a passion for the sport.\n\n\"He loves the fans and they love him. He loves the sport too much to walk away. He's a showman.\"\n\nJapan snatched a surprise bronze medal, and Kenji Fujimitsu moved to comment: \"Thank you, Bolt. He was an inspiration for us.\"\n\nOmar McLeod, the newly crowned 110m hurdler and Jamaica's lead-off runner in the relay, added: \"Usain Bolt's name will always live on.\"", "time": "03:24:00"}

Saturday as he pulled up with injury on the anchor leg of his very last race, the 4x100 metres relay final at the World Championships.\n\nThe 30-year-old had taken the baton for Jamaica a few metres adrift of the two leaders when, straining hard to catch them, he stopped abruptly with cramp in his left hamstring, began hobbling and tumbled to a halt after a forward roll.\n\nAs Britain went on to win gold, Bolt lay on his back in his lane, his head in hands, being tended to by medics as one waited with a wheelchair to help push him off the track.\n\nYet the sport's greatest entertainer was determined that one of the finest careers in sport was not going to end with him in a wheelchair.\n\nSo the fastest man of all-time, surrounded by his three worried team mates, Omar McLeod, Julian Forte and Yohan Blake, rose gingerly to his feet and limped the last 30 metres to the line.\n\nThe official result recorded that the Jamaicans did not finish but Bolt had been absolutely determined to ensure he completed the last race after a matchless career in which he won 19 major championship gold medals.\n\nTypically, Bolt's only thoughts were with the team mates he felt he had let down.\n\n\"He kept apologising to us but we told him there was no need to apologise,\" Forte said. \"Injuries are part of the sport.\"\n\nMcLeod added: \"It just happened - Usain Bolt's name will always live on.\"\n\nTHIRD PLACE\n\nJustin Gatlin, the American winner of the individual 100 metres who had consigned Bolt to third place in his final individual race last Saturday, paid tribute to his rival.\n\n\"I think it was the elements (that caused the injury). I'm sorry he got this injury. He is still the best in the world,\" Gatlin said.\n\n\"This is farewell time, I am sentimental about it already now. In the warm-up area, we give ourselves respect and greeted each other. Usain Bolt is a great athlete.\"\n\nKevin Jones, the Jamaican team doctor, said Bolt had suffered cramp in his left hamstring.\n\nBlake was angry at having to wait for two medal ceremonies to take place before the race.\n\n\"It was 40 minutes and two medal presentations before our run ... we were kept 40 minutes.

A sentimental Justin Gatlin hailed Usain Bolt as an \"amazing showman\" whose career would certainly not be defined by him pulling up with cramp in the world 4x100m relay, the Jamaican's final competitive race.\n\nThere was high drama in Saturday's relay as anchor man Bolt received the baton in third place behind eventual gold medallists Britain and runners-up America.\n\nLess than 50 metres down the track, Bolt suddenly pulled up, clutching his left leg, tumbling to the track with what was later diagnosed as a hamstring cramp.\n\n\"This is farewell time, I am sentimental about it already now,\" said Gatlin, who stormed to 100m gold in London, US team-mate Christian Coleman taking silver to relegate Bolt to a disappointing bronze in his individual send-off.\n\n\"In the warm-up area we give ourselves respect and greet each other,\" Gatlin said of Bolt, who bows out of competition with a startling haul of eight Olympic gold medals and 14 world medals, nine of which are gold.\n\nGatlin, who has served two doping bans, put the blame for Bolt's cramp partly at the amount of time the athletes spent on the track before the starter's gun went off.\n\n\"There was a cool breeze out there. But the conditions were the same for everybody,\" said the 35-year-old, who won the 100m at the 2004 Olympics in Athens and the 2005 worlds in Helsinki before serving his second ban between 2006-10 for taking testosterone.\n\n\"I think it was the elements. I am sorry he got this injury. He is still the best in the world.\n\n\"It was a recipe. I don't want to say this but I understand we need to be ready early but I think we took our clothes off a little too early. It's a little chilly in here so I think that's where the cramp came from. That's what he suffered with. He was running out there cold.\"\n\nBut Gatlin, who was roundly booed at the London Stadium before both the 100m and relay, insisted: \"Usain Bolt is a great athlete.\n\n\"You can't let this championships define what he's done in the past. He has done amazing things. He's still the man, you know. The was his farewell race and we wish him the best and hope he recovers soon.\"\n\nReferring to Bolt's mooted future ambassadorial role within athletics' world governing body the IAAF, Gatlin added: \"He's coming back in a couple of years. He'll be ready, he has a passion for the sport.\n\n\"He loves the fans and they love him. He loves the sport too much to walk away. He's a showman.\"\n\nJapan snatched a surprise bronze medal, Kenji Fujimitsu moved to comment: \"Thank you, Bolt. He was an inspiration for us.\"\n\nOmar McLeod, the newly-crowned 110m hurdler and Jamaica's lead-off runner in the relay, added: \"Usain Bolt's name will always live on.\"", "time": "10:10:00"}

unparalleled career ended in extraordinary drama on Saturday as he pulled up with injury on the anchor leg of his very last race, the 4x100 metres relay final at the World Championships.\n\nThe 30-year-old had taken the baton for Jamaica a few metres adrift of the two leaders when, straining hard to catch them, he stopped abruptly with a cramp in his left hamstring, began hobbling, and tumbled to a halt after a forward roll.\n\nAs Britain went on to win gold, Bolt lay on his back in his lane, his head in hands, being tended to by medics as one waited with a wheelchair to help push him off the track.\n\nYet the sport's greatest entertainer was determined that one of the finest careers in the sport was not going to end with him in a wheelchair.\n\nSo the fastest man of all-time, surrounded by his three worried team mates, Omar McLeod, Julian Forte, and Yohan Blake, rose gingerly to his feet and limped the last 30 metres to the line.\n\nThe official result recorded that the Jamaicans did not finish but Bolt had been absolutely determined to ensure he completed the last race after a matchless career in which he won 19 major championship gold medals.\n\nTypically, Bolt's only thoughts were with the team mates he felt he had let down.\n\n\"He kept apologising to us but we told him there was no need to apologise,\" Forte said. \"Injuries are part of the sport.\"\n\nMcLeod added: \"It just happened - Usain Bolt's name will always live on.\"\n\nJustin Gatlin, the American winner of the individual 100 metres who had consigned Bolt to third place in his final individual race last Saturday, paid tribute to his rival.\n\n\"I think it was the elements (that caused the injury). I'm sorry he got this injury. He is still the best in the world,\" Gatlin said.\n\n\"This is farewell time, I am sentimental about it already now. In the warm-up area, we give ourselves respect and greeted each other. Usain Bolt is a great athlete.\"\n\nKevin Jones, the Jamaican team doctor, said Bolt had suffered cramp in his left hamstring.\n\n\"But a lot of pain is from disappointment from losing the race,\" he said. \"The last three weeks have been hard for him. We hope for the best for him.\"\n\nJamaican team manager Ian Forbes praised Bolt for \"going out there and giving his all\" and added that the squad were \"very saddened\".\n\n\"The diagnostic work will be done shortly to determine how serious it is.

He suddenly stumbled and hobbled a few strides before falling down on the track in pain and agony.\n\nBlake said the lengthy wait in cold conditions contributed to Bolt's injury. The final race of Saturday s evening session started later than initially planned, following medal ceremonies for the men's 5000m and women's high jump.\n\n\"They were holding us too long...it was atrocious. That long wait contributed (to Bolt's injury). Inside it was cold.\n\nWe keep warming up and waiting, then warming up and waiting. I think it got the better of us,\" Blake said.\n\n\"You have to think about the athletes because we were in the mixed zone too long, over 40 minutes. A hero of the sport to go down like that? As a true friend, I didn't like it one bit. He was saying he was sorry, but there was nothing to be sorry for, he's done it for us (during his career).\n\n\"It was cold and there was 40 minutes and two medal presentations before our run. It was crazy,\" added the 2011 world 100m champion Blake.\n\nJustin Gatlin, who snatched a gold in 100m dash to spoil Bolt's individual farewell race, suggested the same.\n\n\"I think it was the elements. I am sorry he (Bolt) got this injury. I understand the magic of TV and that everything has to happen for viewers at home but we were held a little long before we went out. We were out of our clothes and it was quite cold. I lost all my heat and sweat. I think if that hadn't happened, may be we would have run quicker, as would other teams,\" Gatlin said.\n\n\"It was a recipe (for possible injury). I don't want to say this but I understand we need to be ready early but I think we took our clothes off a little too early. It's a little chilly in here so I think that's where the cramp came from. That's what he (Bolt) suffered with. He was running out there cold,\" added Gatlin who ran the second leg for silver- winning American team.\n\nBolt was his long-time rival and he lost five successive Olympic and World Championship races to him. Nonetheless, Gatlin paid tribute to the Jamaican.\n\n\"No one wants to see Usain go out like that, with an injury. All of us up here have been inspired by his career in some way. If we look past what happened at this championship, he has had an incredible career and that should be celebrated,\" Gatlin said.\n\n\"He has done so much for athletics, from 2008 until now.\n\nEverything has happened so fast. Congratulations on his legendary career,\" he added.\n\nChristian Coleman, who ran the anchor leg for USA, said, \"Usain Bolt is a legend, he has inspired us. I was just blessed to be here, to be on the line with him. I will tell my grandkids about this one day.\"\n\nIn fact, he had beaten Bolt thrice in this championships -- in 100m semifinals, finals (where he took a silver) and the sprint relay.\n\n(This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)", "time": "10:14:00"}

(Getty Images) Justin Gatlin agreed with the complaints of the Jamaican relay team that a long wait before their 4x100m final at the World Championships on Saturday contributed to the injury suffered by Usain Bolt in his last race.\n\nBolt, having been passed the baton by Yohan Blake, was in third behind Great Britain and the United States, who eventually won gold and silver, but pulled up almost 50 metres from the line and fell to the track.\n\nJamaica's team doctor later said that the 30-year-old had suffered a hamstring cramp.\n\nBolt's team mates complained that a 45-minute wait in the call room before the race had hampered their preparations.\n\n\"I think they were holding us too long in the call room,\" Blake told reporters. \"Usain was really cold. In fact Usain said to me 'Yohan, I think this is crazy'. Forty minutes and two medal presentations before our run.\"\n\nGatlin, who beat Bolt to gold in the 100m last Saturday, agreed with the complaints and laid the blame at the television scheduling for the event.\n\n\"I know it's TV magic, and everybody has to be prepared on time to make everything happen for the viewers at home.\n\n\"(But) I personally think that we were held in the stadium a little too long without our clothes on, and there was a little draught in there. I lost all my sweat and body heat,\" Gatlin said.\n\nWhen asked if he thought that contributed to Bolt's injury, the 35-year-old said: \"I believe so.\n\n\"Knowing how Usain performs, he's always ready, he's always making sure he's not injured and it's very rare to see Usain injured when he comes to performances.\"\n\nGatlin ran the second leg for the United States as they finished runners-up behind Britain, who became world champions for the first time.\n\nAmidst the home crowd's jubilation, there was also relief at the sight of Bolt being able to walk off the track after being helped to his feet by his team mates.\n\n\"I'm not sure what the extent of his injury is, but when I saw him go down I thought it was a calf cramp or a hamstring cramp. But he walked off the track, so that's good thing.\n\n\"I hope that he gets well soon,\" Gatlin added.", "time": "06:08:00"}

He suddenly stumbled and hobbled a few strides before falling down on the track in pain and agony.\n\nBlake said the lengthy wait in cold conditions contributed to Bolt's injury. The final race of Saturday's evening session started later than initially planned, following medal ceremonies for the men's 5000m and women's high jump.\n\n\"They were holding us too long...it was atrocious. That long wait contributed (to Bolt's injury). Inside it was cold. We keep warming up and waiting, then warming up and waiting. I think it got the better of us,\" Blake said.\n\n\"You have to think about the athletes because we were in the mixed zone too long, over 40 minutes. A hero of the sport to go down like that? As a true friend, I didn't like it one bit. He was saying he was sorry, but there was nothing to be sorry for, he's done it for us (during his career).\n\n\"It was cold and there was 40 minutes and two medal presentations before our run. It was crazy,\" added the 2011 world 100m champion Blake.\n\nJustin Gatlin, who snatched a gold in 100m dash to spoil Bolt's individual farewell race, suggested the same.\n\n\"I think it was the elements. I am sorry he (Bolt) got this injury. I understand the magic of TV and that everything has to happen for viewers at home but we were held a little long before we went out. We were out of our clothes and it was quite cold. I lost all my heat and sweat. I think if that hadn't happened, may be we would have run quicker, as would other teams,\" Gatlin said.\n\n\"It was a recipe (for possible injury). I don't want to say this but I understand we need to be ready early but I think we took our clothes off a little too early. It's a little chilly in here so I think that's where the cramp came from. That's what he (Bolt) suffered with. He was running out there cold,\" added Gatlin who ran the second leg for silver- winning American team.\n\nBolt was his long-time rival and he lost five successive Olympic and World Championship races to him. Nonetheless, Gatlin paid tribute to the Jamaican.\n\n\"No one wants to see Usain go out like that, with an injury. All of us up here have been inspired by his career in some way. If we look past what happened at this championship, he has had an incredible career and that should be celebrated,\" Gatlin said.\n\n\"He has done so much for athletics, from 2008 until now. Everything has happened so fast. Congratulations on his legendary career,\" he added.\n\nChristian Coleman, who ran the anchor leg for USA, said, \"Usain Bolt is a legend, he has inspired us.

The 30-year-old had taken the baton for Jamaica a few meters adrift of the two leaders when, straining hard to catch them, he stopped abruptly with cramp in his left hamstring, began hobbling and tumbled to a halt after a forward roll.\n\nAs Britain went on to win gold, Bolt lay on his back in his lane, his head in hands, being tended to by medics as one waited with a wheelchair to help push him off the track. Yet the sport's greatest entertainer was determined that one of the finest careers in sport was not going to end with him in a wheelchair. So the fastest man of all-time, surrounded by his three worried team mates, Omar McLeod, Julian Forte and Yohan Blake, rose gingerly to his feet and limped the last 30 meters to the line.\n\nThe official result recorded that the Jamaicans did not finish but Bolt had been absolutely determined to ensure he completed the last race after a matchless career in which he won 19 major championship gold medals.\n\nTypically, Bolt's only thoughts were with the team mates he felt he had let down. \"He kept apologizing to us but we told him there was no need to apologize,\" Forte said. \"Injuries are part of the sport.\"\n\nMcLeod added: \"It just happened - Usain Bolt's name will always live on.\"\n\nTHIRD PLACE\n\nJustin Gatlin, the American winner of the individual 100 meters who had consigned Bolt to third place in his final individual race last Saturday, paid tribute to his rival. \"I think it was the elements (that caused the injury). I'm sorry he got this injury. He is still the best in the world,\" Gatlin said. \"This is farewell time, I am sentimental about it already now. In the warm-up area, we give ourselves respect and greeted each other. Usain Bolt is a great athlete.\"\n\nKevin Jones, the Jamaican team doctor, said Bolt had suffered cramp in his left hamstring.\n\nBlake was angry at having to wait for two medal ceremonies to take place before the race.\n\n\"It was 40 minutes and two medal presentations before our run ... we were kept 40 minutes. It was crazy,\" Blake said. \"They were holding us too long.\n\n\"We keep warming up and waiting, then warming up and waiting. I think it got the better of us.\n\n\"It hurts to see a true legend, a true champion go out there and struggle like that.\"\n\nJamaican team manager Ian Forbes praised Bolt for \"going out there and giving his all\" and added that the squad were \"very saddened.\" \"The diagnostic work will be done shortly to determine how serious it is. He was able to walk to the team bus so hopefully that signals it's not as serious as it possibly could be,\" Forbes said.\n\nWith the 56,000-strong crowd going wild about the British victory, there was still time for them to hail the sport's favorite performer, who waved to them a mite forlornly while hobbling away from the track. Five years ago, almost to the very night, British distance running hero Mo Farah had broken into Bolt's lightning bolt pose in this same stadium and the Jamaican had reciprocated with the Briton's trademark \"Mobot\" to mark their joyous supremacy at the London Olympics.\n\nYet in the same stadium on Saturday, they attempted in vain to reprise that triumphant night, Farah ending up with silver in his final track race, over 5,000 meters, and Bolt suffering his anti-climactic farewell.\n\nTheir leaving of the track scene leaves a void in the sport that does not look like being filled any time soon.", "time": "08:30:00"}

championship races that Usain Bolt has not topped the podium. (Tim Ireland/AP)\n\nIt was a heartbreaking ending to an outstanding track and field career for Usain Bolt on Saturday at the IAAF World Championships in London.\n\nSlated to run the final leg of the men's 4\u00d7100 relay for Jamaica, Bolt failed to finish after an injury led him to pull up just after teammate Yohan Blake handed him the baton.\n\nBolt collapsed on the track, as the British, American and Japanese teams soared ahead to secure their first, second and third podium spots, respectively. This is the first time since 2008 that a team other than Jamaica has won the event at a major meet.\n\nIt's unclear what exactly happened to Bolt. He managed to get up with the help of his teammates Blake, Omar McLeod and Julian Forte to eventually limp across the finish line and offer the crowd a tearful wave. Bolt also appeared to apologize to his teammates, who looked on with understanding.\n\nYohan Blake, left, and Omar McLeod console Bolt on the track. (Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nBolt, 31, had run the qualifying legs for Team Jamaica without incident earlier in the day. This may have taken a toll on his muscles by the time the final rolled around at nearly 10 p.m. local time.\n\nHaving run 23 championship races since 2008, this was only the fourth time Bolt failed to win, the first time due to injury. Previously, he didn't win because of a false start, a disqualification after the fact due to a teammate's failed doping test, and last Saturday, because of an uncharacteristic performance -- Bolt came in third in the 100-meter final.\n\n[Not fake news: Usain Bolt loses back-to-back races]\n\nMeanwhile, the top of the podium has continued to evade Team USA, which finished second to Great Britain on Saturday with a time of 37.52 seconds, just five-hundredths of a second behind the leaders.\n\nBolt's longtime rival Justin Gatlin, who won the 100-meter final last Saturday, ran the second leg, but did not appear happy with the result. Before the start of the race, he called past U.S. foibles in the event \"frustrating\" and \"embarrassing.\"\n\n\"It gets to the point where it kind of fuels you,\" he said. \"You don't want to let down your country anymore.\"\n\nWhile Gatlin and the other Team USA sprinters, including Mike Rodgers, Jaylen Bacon and 100-meter silver medalist Christian Coleman, appeared disappointed with second place, it sure beats last summer's Olympic performance that saw Team USA disqualified for mishandling the baton.\n\nThe U.S. women, meanwhile, had better luck. The team of Aaliya Brown, Allyson Felix, Morolake Akinosun and Tori Bowie won gold with a time of 41.82 seconds. Great Britain came in second with a time of 42.12 seconds and Jamaica pulled in third, seven-hundredths of a second later.\n\nRead more:\n\nUsain Bolt blames starting blocks for 'very bad' first-round sprint at worlds\n\nAfter qualifying in rarely seen solo heat, Isaac Makwala fails to medal at worlds\n\nA meme is born: Norwegian sprinter has amazing reaction to win at worlds, sports viking helmet\n\nNBC Sports criticized for interviewing hurdler as she's doubled over trying to catch her breath\n\nNorovirus outbreak hits hotel housing track athletes at world championships in London", "time": "22:07:00"}

I'm sorry he got this injury. He is still the best in the world,\" Gatlin said.\n\n\"This is farewell time, I am sentimental about it already now. In the warm-up area, we give ourselves respect and greeted each other. Usain Bolt is a great athlete.\"\n\nKevin Jones, the Jamaican team doctor, said Bolt had suffered cramp in his left hamstring.\n\n\"But a lot of pain is from disappointment from losing the race,\" he said. \"The last three weeks have been hard for him. We hope for the best for him.\"\n\nJamaican team manager Ian Forbes praised Bolt for \"going out there and giving his all\" and added that the squad were \"very saddened\".\n\n\"The diagnostic work will be done shortly to determine how serious it is. He was able to walk to the team bus so hopefully that signals it's not as serious as it possibly could be,\" Forbes said.\n\nWith the 56,000-strong crowd going wild about the British victory, there was still time for them to hail the sport's favourite performer, who waved to them a mite forlornly while hobbling away from the track.\n\nFive years ago, almost to the very night, British distance running hero Mo Farah had broken into Bolt's lightning bolt pose in this same stadium and the Jamaican had reciprocated with the Briton's trademark \"Mobot\" to mark their joyous supremacy at the London Olympics.\n\nYet in the same stadium on Saturday, they attempted in vain to reprise that triumphant night, Farah ending up with silver in his final track race, over 5,000 metres, and Bolt suffering his anti-climactic farewell.\n\nTheir leaving of the track scene leaves a void in the sport that does not look like being filled any time soon.\n\nGet latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.", "time": "23:25:00"}

with an easy win in the heats here today.\n\nRunning in his penultimate race of his illustrious career, Bolt eased past the finishing line as he helped the defending champions Jamaica win the second heat in 37.95 seconds, their season's best, to enter the final round with third best time.\n\nThe Jamaican quartet of Tyquendo Tracey, Julian Forte, Micheal Campbell and Bolt led the eight-team second heat from beginning to the end.\n\nExperienced Yohan Blake, who finished fourth in the men's 100m final and failed to qualify for the final round in 200m, did not start in the heats but Bolt later said that he will return in the final race.\n\nIn his trademark style, Bolt grabbed the baton from Campbell, who ran the third leg, and blasted ahead of all his rivals and slowed down while approaching the finish line to conserve energy for the finals.\n\nThe top three from each of the two heats and next two fastest finishers from the remaining qualify for the final round.\n\nThe United States team of Mike Rodgers, Justin Gatlin, Bee Jay Lee and Christian Coleman won the first heat in 37.70 seconds, the world leading time this season, to clock the overall best time going into the final round.\n\nGreat Britain clocked the second best time of 37.76, while France were fourth with their season's best of 38.03.\n\nChina (38.20), who had finished second in the 2015 edition at home, Japan (37.21), who took a surprise silver in the Rio Olympics, Turkey (38.44) and Canada (38.48) -- third in both 2015 World Championships and Rio Olympics -- completed the eight-team final round which will run later tonight.\n\nBolt, who has anchored the gold-winning Jamaican team in both 2015 World Championships and Rio Games, will be seeking his 20th global title and would want to hang up his boots with a yellow metal in his final race of his glittering career.\n\nHe lost the 100m dash last Saturday in his final individual race, settling for a bronze.\n\nHis long-time American rival Gatlin, who has twice served bans for doping, won the gold while Coleman took the silver as the London Olympic stadium and the global television audience were stunned at the turn of events.\n\nWidely considered as the greatest sprinter of all time, Bolt has won eight Olympic and 11 World Championships gold medals beginning with a 100m and 200m double at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\n\nSince then he has dominated the shorter two sprint events like none in athletics history. His Jamaican team had also won the 4x100m relay gold in Beijing but it had to return the medal after one member of the quartet -- Nesta Carter -- tested positive for a prohibited substance.\n\nOn the last day of his international career, fans jostled for space to have a glimpse of Bolt at the warm-up arena, adjacent to the stadium and television cameras were fixed at him to have a shot of the towering Jamaican.\n\nWhenever the giant screen inside the stadium showed him doing the baton exchange practice with his Jamaican team-mates in preparation for the 4x100m relay race at the warm-up arena, the capacity crowd cheered loudly.\n\nThe showman, as usual, entertained the crowd as he acknowledged the cheers as he entered the stadium for the relay heats. He did his routine marking of his starting position and did a few run-downs imitating baton exchange.\n\nAfter easing past the finish line, Bolt ran down the track as he usually does and clapped towards the crowd.\n\n\"There are no words to describe how I am feeling. I get so much support from the crowd. I appreciate that a lot. All the energy I am getting from the crowd. It is brilliant,\" Bolt said after the race.\n\n\"The young runners in our team -- it is just about executing and coming through the race for them. We have been training that relay, there were some camps. Still there were some mistakes. Yohan Blake is coming in for the final is definitely good.\"\n\nIn the women's 4x100m relay, all the medal contenders -- United States, Great Britain, Germany and defending champions Jamaica -- progressed to the final round without much trouble, while the Bahamas quartet failed to finish in the second heat due to a poor second baton change.\n\nOlympic champions United States won the first heat in a world leading time of 41.84 seconds, even in the absence of individual 100m champion Torie Bowie.\n\nGreat Britain finished second in that heat -- and also second overall -- with 41.93, the third fastest time ever produced by a British quartet.\n\nDefending champions Jamaica (42.50) finished second behind Germany (42.34) in the second heat.\n\nSwitzerland (42.50) qualified with the fourth fastest time overall while Netherlands (42.64), Brazil (42.77) and Trinidad and Tobago (42.91) completed the final round line-up.\n\nAmerican runner Allyson Felix later said that Bowie will return in the final round.\n\n(This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)", "time": "13:34:00"}

finishes his career with 14 world medals to go with eight Olympic golds.\n\nUsain Bolt's glittering career swansong came crashing to an end when he pulled up on the anchor leg of the world 4x100m relay won by Britain on Saturday.\n\nBolt received the baton with Jamaica in third, but halfway down his leg the towering sprinter pulled up clutching his left thigh, eventually doing a forward roll to the ground, to gasps from the 60,000 sell out London Stadium.\n\nThe British quartet of Chijindu Ujah, Adam Gemili, Daniel Talbot and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake claimed gold in 37.47 seconds, with the Justin Gatlin-led US four taking silver at 0.05sec and Japan a surprise bronze (38.04).\n\nBolt missed out on his bid to retain his 100m title earlier in the week, losing out to Gatlin and silver medallist Christian Coleman, who ran relay anchor for the Americans on Saturday.\n\nBut hopes were high for Bolt's final competitive race, with Jamaica also boasting newly-crowned 110m hurdles champion Omar McLeod, Julian Forte and Yohan Blake in their line-up.\n\nJamaica were afforded a rousing welcome from the crowd, Bolt applauding the stands, with pictures of him constantly shown on the stadium's big screens.\n\nGatlin and the US team also including another convicted doping cheat, Mike Rodgers, and Jaylen Bacon were booed when introduced although the jeering was less than for the individual 100m event.\n\nA close first three legs saw Britain, the United States and Jamaica level-pegged for the final leg.\n\nBut there was to be drama as a visibly swearing Bolt pulled up, allowing the Japanese quartet to nip in for third.\n\nThe result means Bolt, 100 and 200m world record holder, finishes his career with 14 world medals to go with eight Olympic golds.", "time":

Yet the sport's greatest entertainer was determined that one of the finest careers in sport was not going to end with him in a wheelchair.\n\nSo the fastest man of all-time, surrounded by his three worried team mates, Omar McLeod, Julian Forte and Yohan Blake, rose gingerly to his feet and limped the last 30 metres to the line.\n\nThe official result recorded that the Jamaicans did not finish but Bolt had been absolutely determined to ensure he completed the last race after a matchless career in which he won 19 major championship gold medals.\n\nTypically, Bolt's only thoughts were with the team mates he felt he had let down. \"He kept apologising to us but we told him there was no need to apologise,\" Forte said. \"Injuries are part of the sport.\"\n\nMcLeod added, \"It just happened - Usain Bolt's name will always live on.\"\n\nThird place\n\nJustin Gatlin, the American winner of the individual 100 metres who had consigned Bolt to third place in his final individual race last Saturday, paid tribute to his rival. \"I think it was the elements (that caused the injury). I'm sorry he got this injury. He is still the best in the world,\" Gatlin said. \"This is farewell time, I am sentimental about it already now. In the warm-up area, we give ourselves respect and greeted each other. Usain Bolt is a great athlete.\"\n\nKevin Jones, the Jamaican team doctor, said Bolt had suffered cramp in his left hamstring. Blake was angry at having to wait for two medal ceremonies to take place before the race. \"It was 40 minutes and two medal presentations before our run ... we were kept 40 minutes. It was crazy,\" Blake said. \"They were holding us too long.\n\n\"We keep warming up and waiting, then warming up and waiting. I think it got the better of us. It hurts to see a true legend, a true champion go out there and struggle like that.\"\n\nJamaican team manager Ian Forbes praised Bolt for \"going out there and giving his all\" and added that the squad were \"very saddened\".\n\n\"The diagnostic work will be done shortly to determine how serious it is. He was able to walk to the team bus so hopefully that signals it's not as serious as it possibly could be,\" Forbes said.\n\nWith the 56,000-strong crowd going wild about the British victory, there was still time for them to hail the sport's favourite performer, who waved to them a mite forlornly while hobbling away from the track.\n\nFive years ago, almost to the very night, British distance running hero Mo Farah had broken into Bolt's lightning bolt pose in this same stadium and the Jamaican had reciprocated with the Briton's trademark \"Mobot\" to mark their joyous supremacy at the London Olympics.\n\nYet in the same stadium on Saturday, they attempted in vain to reprise that triumphant night, Farah ending up with silver in his final track race, over 5,000 metres, and Bolt suffering his anti-climactic farewell.\n\nTheir leaving of the track scene leaves a void in the sport that does not look like being filled any time soon.", "time": "05:44:00"}

A sentimental Justin Gatlin hailed Usain Bolt as an \"amazing showman\" whose career would certainly not be defined by him pulling up with cramp in the world 4x100m relay, the Jamaican's final competitive race.\n\nThere was high drama in Saturday's relay as anchor man Bolt received the baton in third place behind eventual gold medallists Britain and runners-up America.\n\nLess than 50 metres down the track, Bolt suddenly pulled up, clutching his left leg, tumbling to the track with what was later diagnosed as a hamstring cramp.\n\n\"This is farewell time, I am sentimental about it already now,\" said Gatlin, who stormed to 100m gold in London, US teammate Christian Coleman taking silver to relegate Bolt to a disappointing bronze in his individual send-off.\n\n\"In the warm-up area we give ourselves respect and greet each other,\" Gatlin said of Bolt, who bows out of competition with a startling haul of eight Olympic gold medals and 14 world medals, nine of which are gold.\n\nGatlin, who has served two doping bans, put the blame for Bolt's cramp partly at the amount of time the athletes spent on the track before the starter's gun went off.\n\n\"There was a cool breeze out there. But the conditions were the same for everybody,\" said the 35-year-old, who won the 100m at the 2004 Olympics in Athens and the 2005 worlds in Helsinki before serving his second ban between 2006-10 for taking testosterone.\n\n- Chilly conditions unhelpful -\n\n\"I think it was the elements. I am sorry he got this injury. He is still the best in the world.\n\n\"It was a recipe. I don't want to say this but I understand we need to be ready early but I think we took our clothes off a little too early. It's a little chilly in here so I think that's where the cramp came from. That's what he suffered with. He was running out there cold.\"\n\nBut Gatlin, who was roundly booed at the London Stadium before both the 100m and relay, insisted: \"Usain Bolt is a great athlete.\n\n\"You can't let this championships define what he's done in the past. He has done amazing things. He's still the man, you know. The was his farewell race and we wish him the best and hope he recovers soon.\"\n\nReferring to Bolt's mooted future ambassadorial role within athletics' world governing body the IAAF, Gatlin added: \"He's coming back in a couple of years. He'll be ready, he has a passion for the sport.\n\n\"He loves the fans and they love him. He loves the sport too much to walk away. He's a showman.\"\n\nJapan snatched a surprise bronze medal, Kenji Fujimitsu moved to comment: \"Thank you, Bolt.

competition with a startling haul of eight Olympic gold medals and 14 world medals, nine of which are gold.\n\nGatlin, who has served two doping bans, put the blame for Bolt's cramp partly at the amount of time the athletes spent on the track before the starter's gun went off.\n\n\"There was a cool breeze out there. But the conditions were the same for everybody,\" said the 35-year-old, who won the 100m at the 2004 Olympics in Athens and the 2005 worlds in Helsinki before serving his second ban between 2006-10 for taking testosterone.\n\n- Chilly conditions unhelpful -\n\n\"I think it was the elements. I am sorry he got this injury. He is still the best in the world.\n\n\"It was a recipe. I don't want to say this but I understand we need to be ready early but I think we took our clothes off a little too early. It's a little chilly in here so I think that's where the cramp came from. That's what he suffered with. He was running out there cold.\"\n\nBut Gatlin, who was roundly booed at the London Stadium before both the 100m and relay, insisted: \"Usain Bolt is a great athlete.\n\n\"You can't let this championships define what he's done in the past. He has done amazing things. He's still the man, you know. The was his farewell race and we wish him the best and hope he recovers soon.\"\n\nReferring to Bolt's mooted future ambassadorial role within athletics' world governing body the IAAF, Gatlin added: \"He's coming back in a couple of years. He'll be ready, he has a passion for the sport.\n\n\"He loves the fans and they love him. He loves the sport too much to walk away. He's a showman.\"\n\nJapan snatched a surprise bronze medal, Kenji Fujimitsu moved to comment: \"Thank you, Bolt. He was an inspiration for us.\"\n\nOmar McLeod, the newly-crowned 110m hurdler and Jamaica's lead-off runner in the relay, added: \"Usain Bolt's name will always live on.\"", "time": "12:17:00"}

pulled up with injury on the anchor leg of his very last race, the 4\u00d7100 metres relay final at the World Championships.\n\nThe 30-year-old had taken the baton for Jamaica a few metres adrift of the two leaders when, straining hard to catch them, he stopped abruptly with a cramp in his left hamstring, began hobbling, and tumbled to a halt after a forward roll.\n\nAs Britain went on to win gold, Bolt lay on his back in his lane, his head in hands, being tended to by medics as one waited with a wheelchair to help push him off the track.\n\nYet the sport's greatest entertainer was determined that one of the finest careers in the sport was not going to end with him in a wheelchair.\n\nSo the fastest man of all-time, surrounded by his three worried team mates, Omar McLeod, Julian Forte, and Yohan Blake, rose gingerly to his feet and limped the last 30 metres to the line.\n\nThe official result recorded that the Jamaicans did not finish but Bolt had been absolutely determined to ensure he completed the last race after a matchless career in which he won 19 major championship gold medals.\n\nTypically, Bolt's only thoughts were with the team mates he felt he had let down.\n\n\"He kept apologising to us but we told him there was no need to apologise,\" Forte said. \"Injuries are part of the sport.\"\n\nMcLeod added: \"It just happened - Usain Bolt's name will always live on.\"\n\nThird place\n\nJustin Gatlin, the American winner of the individual 100 metres who had consigned Bolt to third place in his final individual race last Saturday, paid tribute to his rival.\n\n\"I think it was the elements (that caused the injury). I'm sorry he got this injury. He is still the best in the world,\" Gatlin said.\n\n\"This is farewell time, I am sentimental about it already now. In the warm-up area, we give ourselves respect and greeted each other. Usain Bolt is a great athlete.\"\n\nKevin Jones, the Jamaican team doctor, said Bolt had suffered cramp in his left hamstring.\n\n\"But a lot of pain is from disappointment from losing the race,\" he said. \"The last three weeks have been hard for him. We hope for the best for him.\"\n\nJamaican team manager Ian Forbes praised Bolt for \"going out there and giving his all\" and added that the squad were \"very saddened\".\n\n\"The diagnostic work will be done shortly to determine how serious it is. He was able to walk to the team bus so hopefully that signals it's not as serious as it possibly could be,\" Forbes said.\n\nWith the 56,000-strong crowd going wild about the British victory, there was still time for them to hail the sport's favourite performer, who waved to them a mite forlornly while hobbling away from the track.\n\nFive years ago, almost to the very night, British distance running hero Mo Farah had broken into Bolt's lightning bolt pose in this same stadium and the Jamaican had reciprocated with the Briton's trademark \"Mobot\" to mark their joyous supremacy at the London Olympics.\n\nYet in the same stadium on Saturday, they attempted in vain to reprise that triumphant night, Farah ending up with silver in his final track race, over 5,000 metres, and Bolt suffering his anti-climactic farewell.\n\nTheir leaving the track scene leaves a void in the sport that does not look like being filled anytime soon.", "time": "06:25:00"}

The Americans were seen as the favourites, with Bolt showing signs of weakness in the individual 100 meters and most expecting him to start his leg with a large deficit.\n\nThe race played out exactly like that, although the Brits came out of nowhere to snatch the gold from the Americans. But by the time the hosts finished, many of the fans in London had their eyes fixed further back.\n\nThe hugely popular Bolt was given a standing ovation after the individual 100-meters final, when a bitterly disappointed crowd watched as Gatlin took the gold. Saturday's reaction was more mixed, with many noting the incredible achievement by the hosts, including MP Jess Phillips:\n\nBolt will end his career on the track with 11 World Championships gold medals.

He is the best sprinter of all time.\" -Former International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Jacques Rogge, who was chided at the 2012 London Olympics for refusing to say he was a legend. Former Olympic yachtsman Rogge instead opted to nominate British yachting icon Ben Ainslie as his star of the Games.\n\n\"Nobody's ever been faster than this guy! Ever! Of all the billions of people.\" - Then-US President Barack Obama reflects on the global nature of Bolt's stardom after meeting with him in Jamaica and then performing the lightning bolt pose with him.\n\n\"Usain Bolt is now Jamaica's biggest ambassador. His personality, his ability to draw people to him (and) his showmanship have really given a boost to Brand Jamaica.\" -Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness neatly sums up Bolt's gift to the Caribbean island.\n\nBolt on himself\n\n\"I am Lightning Bolt! I am not Flash Gordon or anybody. My name is Bolt, Lightning Bolt.\" - Bolt after smashing Michael Johnson's 200m world record in the 2008 Beijing Olympic final to complete his first of three individual Olympic sprint doubles.\n\n\"Manners is the key thing. Say for instance when you're growing up you're walking down the street you've got to tell everybody good morning. Everybody. You can't pass one person.\" - Bolt displaying why he has charmed everyone along the way, never forgetting the strict but grounded way he was brought up by his parents, father Wellesley and mother Jennifer.\n\n\"People come to see you run fast, but they also come to see a show, a performance... that's what I give them.\" - Bolt savvy as ever and why athletics will miss him so much: not just for his jaw-dropping brilliance but also his ability to entertain.\n\n\"I'm now a legend, I'm also the greatest athlete to live. I am in the same category as Michael Johnson.\" - Bolt after winning the 2012 Olympic 200m title to complete the individual sprint double double.\n\n\"If Queen Elizabeth knighthooded me and I would get the title Sir Usain Bolt.

Usain Bolt's unparalleled career ended in extraordinary drama on Saturday as he pulled up with injury on the anchor leg of his very last race, the 4x100 metres relay final at the World Championships.\n\nThe 30-year-old had taken the baton for Jamaica a few metres adrift of the two leaders when, straining hard to catch them, he stopped abruptly with cramp in his left hamstring, began hobbling and tumbled to a halt after a forward roll.\n\nAs Britain went on to win gold, Bolt lay on his back in his lane, his head in hands, being tended to by medics as one waited with a wheelchair to help push him off the track.\n\nYet the sport's greatest entertainer was determined that one of the finest careers in sport was not going to end with him in a wheelchair.\n\nSo the fastest man of all-time, surrounded by his three worried team mates, Omar McLeod, Julian Forte and Yohan Blake, rose gingerly to his feet and limped the last 30 metres to the line.\n\nThe official result recorded that the Jamaicans did not finish but Bolt had been absolutely determined to ensure he completed the last race after a matchless career in which he won 19 major championship gold medals.\n\nTypically, Bolt's only thoughts were with the team mates he felt he had let down.\n\n\"He kept apologising to us but we told him there was no need to apologise,\" Forte said. \"Injuries are part of the sport.\"\n\nMcLeod added: \"It just happened - Usain Bolt's name will always live on.\"\n\nTHIRD PLACE\n\nJustin Gatlin, the American winner of the individual 100 metres who had consigned Bolt to third place in his final individual race last Saturday, paid tribute to his rival.\n\n\"I think it was the elements (that caused the injury). I'm sorry he got this injury. He is still the best in the world,\" Gatlin said.\n\n\"This is farewell time, I am sentimental about it already now. In the warm-up area, we give ourselves respect and greeted each other. Usain Bolt is a great athlete.\"\n\nKevin Jones, the Jamaican team doctor, said Bolt had suffered cramp in his left hamstring.\n\n\"But a lot of pain is from disappointment from losing the race,\" he said. \"The last three weeks have been hard for him. We hope for the best for him.\"\n\nJamaican team manager Ian Forbes praised Bolt for \"going out there and giving his all\" and added that the squad were \"very saddened\".\n\n\"The diagnostic work will be done shortly to determine how serious it is. He was able to walk to the team bus so hopefully that signals it's not as serious as it possibly could be,\" Forbes said.\n\nWith the 56,000-strong crowd going wild about the British victory, there was still time for them to hail the sport's favourite performer, who waved to them a mite forlornly while hobbling away from the track.\n\nFive years ago, almost to the very night, British distance running hero Mo Farah had broken into Bolt's lightning bolt pose in this same stadium and the Jamaican had reciprocated with the Briton's trademark \"Mobot\" to mark their joyous supremacy at the London Olympics.\n\nYet in the same stadium on Saturday, they attempted in vain to reprise that triumphant night, Farah ending up with silver in his final track race, over 5,000 metres, and Bolt suffering his anti-climactic farewell.\n\nTheir leaving of the track scene leaves a void in the sport that does not look like being filled any time soon.

inglorious end to his top level career was the fault of world championship organisers, his furious teammates claimed.\n\nThe 30-year-old 100 metres and 200m world record-holder collapsed on the London Stadium track whilst anchoring Jamaica in the final of the 4x100m on Saturday as cramp gripped his leg.\n\nBolt lay prone on the track but waved away the offer of a wheelchair and eventually, aided by his three team-mates, limped across the line before making a hasty exit -- not the way the man who had won triple Olympic gold at the same stadium in 2012 would have wished his competitive career in championships to finish.\n\nJamaica's Usain Bolt lies on the track after injuring himself during the men's 4x100m final at the World Athletics Championships in London. AP\n\nBut his team-mates complained that his problem was caused by organisers keeping the relay teams waiting in the cold before their race as several medal ceremonies were held.\n\n\"I think they were holding us too long in the call room. The walk was too long. Usain was really cold. In fact Usain said to me, 'Yohan, I think this is crazy. 40 minutes and two medal presentations before our run',\" said Yohan Blake, who branded the wait as \"crazy\".\n\n\"We kept warming up and waiting, then warming up and waiting,\" added the 2011 100m world champion, who also won Olympic relay gold in 2012 and 2016 with Bolt.\n\n\"I think it got the better of us. We were over warm.\n\n\"To see a true legend, a true champion go out there and struggling like that.\n\n\"The race was 10 minutes late and we were kept 40 minutes.\"\n\nBolt may not have led Jamaica to a glorious finale anyway, though, as he took the baton well behind eventual winners Great Britain and the US.\n\nBut Jamaica's 110m hurdles world champion Omar McLeod -- who ran the first leg -- likewise pointed the finger at organisers for denying his country's greatest star a more fitting swansong.\n\n\"It's heart wrenching,\" said McLeod, who is also the Olympic champion.\n\n\"It was ridiculous man, we were there around 45 minutes waiting outside, I think they had three medal ceremonies before we went out so we were really trying our hardest to stay warm and keep upbeat.\n\n\"But it was ridiculous. We waited a really long time. I drank like two bottles of water.\"\n\nTheir criticism echoed that of Justin Gatlin, who led an American 1-2 alongside team-mate Christian Coleman to deny Bolt a farewell gold in the individual 100m.\n\n\"I think it was the elements. I am sorry he got this injury. He is still the best in the world,\" said Gatlin.\n\n\"It was a recipe. I don't want to say this, I understand we need to be ready early, but I think we took our clothes off a little too early.\n\n\"It's a little chilly in here so I think that's where the cramp came from. That's what he suffered with. He was running out there cold.\"\n\nDespite his relatively unsuccessful championships -- in which he will exit with just a single bronze medal -- Bolt will still be accorded a final lap of honour in a tribute ceremony before the curtain comes down on the world championships later on Sunday.\n\nPublished Date: Aug 13, 2017 03:55 pm | Updated Date: Aug 13, 2017 03:56 pm\n\nTags :#Athletics#Christian coleman#Iaaf world championships 2017#Jamaica#Justin gatlin#Omar mcleod#Usain bolt#Yohan blake", "time": "10:37:00"}

final race, something gave in his left hamstring. The World's Fastest Man skittered to a stop -- hopping, skipping, jumping, then finally dropping to the ground and tumbling forward before coming to a rest.\n\nWhile the winning team from Britain crossed the finish line, Bolt was writhing on the track, where he eventually wound up chest down with his face pressed into Lane 5. He was certainly every bit as stunned as any of the 60,000-plus who packed the stadium Saturday, or the millions watching one of the world's most entertaining showmen make his final curtain call in the 4x100-meter relay at world championships.\n\nThere was no celebration. No gold, no silver, not even a consolation bronze, the likes of which Bolt received a week earlier in his final 100-meter race.\n\nJamaica closed the night with \"DNF\" by its name: Did Not Finish. Dead last. Bolt was helped into a wheelchair, but eventually got to his feet and, assisted by his teammates, limped gingerly across the finish line. He gave a few waves to the crowd, then left for the trainer's room, and with that, presumably left track and field forever.\n\n\"Injuries are part of our sport and, always, of course, it's sad to see,\" said Wallace Spearmon, the American sprinter who has been close with Bolt for years and was on hand helping the U.S. team. \"So, yeah, it's tragic.\"\n\nThe Jamaican team doctor, Kevin Jones, diagnosed the injury that brought a strange end to Bolt's career as, simply, a cramp in the champion's left hamstring.\n\n\"But a lot of pain is from disappointment from losing the race,\" Jones said. \"The last three weeks have been hard for him, you know. We hope for the best for him.\"\n\nWatching track's No. 1 sprinter and celebrity dropping to the ground was nothing short of jaw-dropping -- so much so that the fact that Britain won the race, outrunning a United States team that, somewhat amazingly, didn't drop the baton, almost seemed like an afterthought.\n\nNethaneel Mitchell-Blake held off U.S. anchorman Christian Coleman down the stretch and the Brits won their first-ever world title in the 4x100 in 37.47 seconds.\n\nWhen Bolt took the baton from Yohan Blake for his final homestretch, he was in third place, but that was no cause for concern. In virtually each of the seven relay golds he's won at the Olympics and world championships, Bolt has reeled in the competition down the stretch and won going away, much the same as all his 100 victories have played out.\n\nFive years and one day earlier, on the very same track, Bolt helped Jamaica set the world record. That run of 36.84 seconds earned Bolt the sixth of nine Olympic victories.\n\nBut last week in the 100, Bolt's extra gear was not enough either to catch Coleman, who finished second, or to hold off Justin Gatlin, the oft-booed American who came from behind to finish first.\n\nCould he have caught his relay competition in this one? Nobody will ever know. Bolt was gaining no ground at the 30-meter mark, which is when he felt the pain in his leg and went tumbling.\n\nAfterward, there was plenty of second-guessing to be done. Most of it came at the expense of the IAAF, which made the sprinters wait about 40 minutes from the time they were summoned from the warm-up room to the time the starting gun went off.\n\n\"I think this is crazy,\" Blake said. \"Forty minutes. Waiting. Warming up. Waiting. Warming up. It just should not happen. To have your champion go out like that. It's crazy.\"\n\nSaid Gatlin, who remains insistent that Bolt will be back someday: \"We lost all of our heat, all of our sweat, and we went out there cold.\"\n\nPart of the wait was for the U.S. women's relay team to finish its victory celebration. Tori Bowie anchored the win and, with one day left in the meet, is the only athlete to win two gold medals in London. Also, a medal ceremony was held for Russian high jump champion Mariya Lasitskene, who is competing as a neutral athlete because of the doping crisis in her country and got to listen not to her own anthem, but to the IAAF's theme song, as she stood on the podium.\n\nOther winners included Kevin Mayer of France in the decathlon and Johannes Vetter, whose victory in the javelin throw gave Germany its first gold of the championships.\n\nIn the undercard to the relays, Muktar Edris held off Mo Farah of Britain in the 5,000. With help of his Ethiopian teammates, Edris won a tactical cat-and-mouse race and denied Farah his fifth straight long-distance double, counting world championships and Olympics.\n\nAs if to prove that point one last time, he did it again -- this time without even finishing the race.", "time": "02:58:00"}

homestretch of his final race, something gave in his left hamstring. The World's Fastest Man skittered to a stop - hopping, skipping, jumping, then finally dropping to the ground and tumbling forward before coming to a rest.\n\nWhile the winning team from Britain crossed the finish line, Bolt was writhing on the track, where he eventually wound up chest down with his face pressed into Lane 5. He was certainly every bit as stunned as any of the 60,000-plus who packed the stadium Saturday, or the millions watching one of the world's most entertaining showmen make his final curtain call in the 4x100-meter relay at world championships.\n\nThere was no celebration. No gold, no silver, not even a consolation bronze, the likes of which Bolt received a week earlier in his final 100-meter race.\n\nJamaica closed the night with \"DNF\" by its name: Did Not Finish. Dead last. Bolt was helped into a wheelchair, but eventually got to his feet and, assisted by his teammates, limped gingerly across the finish line.

crashing to an end when he pulled up on the anchor leg of the world 4x100m relay won by Britain on Saturday.\n\nBolt received the baton with Jamaica in third, but halfway down his leg the towering sprinter pulled up clutching his left thigh, eventually doing a forward roll to the ground, to gasps from the 60,000 sell out London Stadium.\n\nThe British quartet of Chijindu Ujah, Adam Gemili, Daniel Talbot and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake claimed gold in 37.47 seconds, with the Justin Gatlin-led US four taking silver at 0.05sec and Japan a surprise bronze (38.04).\n\nBolt missed out on his bid to retain his 100m title earlier in the week, losing out to Gatlin and silver medallist Christian Coleman, who ran relay anchor for the Americans on Saturday.\n\nBut hopes were high for Bolt's final competitive race, with Jamaica also boasting newly-crowned 110m hurdles champion Omar McLeod, Julian Forte and Yohan Blake in their line-up.\n\nJamaica were afforded a rousing welcome from the crowd, Bolt applauding the stands, with pictures of him constantly shown on the stadium's big screens.\n\nGatlin and the US team also including another convicted doping cheat, Mike Rodgers, and Jaylen Bacon were booed when introduced although the jeering was less than for the individual 100m event.\n\nA close first three legs saw Britain, the United States and Jamaica level-pegged for the final leg.\n\nBut there was to be drama as a visibly swearing Bolt pulled up, allowing the Japanese quartet to nip in for third.\n\nThe result means Bolt, 100 and 200m world record holder, finishes his

The walk was too long. Usain was really cold. In fact Usain said to me, 'Yohan, I think this is crazy. 40 minutes and two medal presentations before our run',\" said Yohan Blake, who branded the wait as \"crazy\".\n\n\"We kept warming up and waiting, then warming up and waiting,\" added the 2011 100m world champion, who also won Olympic relay gold in 2012 and 2016 with Bolt.\n\n\"I think it got the better of us. We were over warm.\n\n\"To see a true legend, a true champion go out there and struggling like that.\n\n\"The race was 10 minutes late and we were kept 40 minutes.\"\n\nBolt may not have led Jamaica to a glorious finale anyway, though, as he took the baton well behind eventual winners Great Britain and the US.\n\nBut Jamaica's 110m hurdles world champion Omar McLeod -- who ran the first leg -- likewise pointed the finger at organisers for denying his country's greatest star a more fitting swansong.\n\n\"It's heart wrenching,\" said McLeod, who is also the Olympic champion.\n\n\"It was ridiculous man, we were there around 45 minutes waiting outside, I think they had three medal ceremonies before we went out so we were really trying our hardest to stay warm and keep upbeat.\n\n\"But it was ridiculous. We waited a really long time. I drank like two bottles of water.\"\n\nTheir criticism echoed that of Justin Gatlin, who led an American 1-2 alongside team-mate Christian Coleman to deny Bolt a farewell gold in the individual 100m.\n\n\"I think it was the elements. I am sorry he got this injury. He is still the best in the world,\" said Gatlin.\n\n\"It was a recipe. I don't want to say this, I understand we need to be ready early, but I think we took our clothes off a little too early.\n\n\"It's a little chilly in here so I think that's where the cramp came from. That's what he suffered with. He was running out there cold.\"\n\nDespite his relatively unsuccessful championships -- in which he will exit with just a single bronze medal -- Bolt will still be accorded a final lap of honour in a tribute ceremony before the curtain comes down on the world championships later on Sunday.", "time": "11:16:00"}

fashion as he pulled up injured on the final leg of the men's 4x100m relay Saturday.\n\nBolt took the baton for Jamaica in third place but within a few strides he had fallen to the ground, clutching his left leg, as host Britain secured a shock gold ahead of a United States team containing Justin Gatlin.\n\nBolt beaten into third in the individual 100m behind Gatlin and his US team compatriot Christian Coleman, was comforted by teammates after getting to his feet, his face etched in pain.\n\nThe capacity crowd in the London Stadium was still digesting the shock earlier defeat for home hero Mo Farah in the men's 5,000m final, before the drama of Bolt's last agonizing appearance.\n\nHe had been bidding for a 12th world championship gold to bring down the curtain on his glittering career, but instead limped out of the London Stadium arena.\n\nVictory for the British quartet of CJ Ujah, Adam Gemili, who ran a storming second leg, Daniel Talbot and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake was stunning compensation for Farah's earlier defeat.\n\nThey won in 37.47 seconds, with the US taking silver and Japan with a surprise bronze.\n\nFor his massive global following, the perfect script would have seen the Bolt of old running down Britain and the US for yet another gold, but it was not to be.\n\n\"He didn't tell us exactly what happened but from what I saw, it looked like a strain or a cramp of some sort,\" teammate Julian Forte told IAAF radio.\n\n\"He kept apologizing to us but we told him there was no need to apologize -- injuries are part of the sport.\"\n\nJamaican team doctor Kevin Jones told AFP that Bolt had suffered from \"cramp in his left hamstring.\"\n\n\"The last three weeks have been hard for him, you know. We hope for the best for him,\" he added.\n\nJamaica's 110m hurdles champion Omar McLeod, who ran the first leg for the quartet, summed up the feeling of everyone.\n\n\"Usain Bolt's name will always live on,\" he said.\n\nBut another teammate, Yohan Blake, who won Olympic relay gold with Bolt in 2012 and 2016, slammed organizers for the delay in starting the race because of medal ceremonies.\n\n\"Usain was really cold. In fact Usain said to me, 'Yohan, I think this is crazy',\" he said.\n\nFarah bows out with silver\n\nFarah, who won the 10,000 title in dramatic fashion of the opening day at the London Stadium, had to settle for silver behind Ethiopian Muktar Edris in his final championship race on the track.\n\nHe edged out American Paul Chelimo in a desperate dash for the line, the last mile of a hitherto slow run race run in just under four minutes.\n\nFarah, 34, will now turn his attention to the marathon after failing in his bid to double up at the Olympics or World Championship for the fifth time, including double gold in London 2012 and the Rio Games last year.\n\nEdris, a former world junior champion, timed his last lap burst to perfection to win in 13 minutes 32.79 seconds, copying Farah's famous Mobot gesture as he crossed the line.\n\nIt was not the farewell Farah wanted, but he pointed to his earlier exertions in a dramatic 10,000m final as reason for lacking his usual devastating finish.\n\n\"The 10,000m took a lot more out of me than I had realized,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\n\"I gave it my all. I didn't have a single thing left to give at the end.\"", "time": "23:58:00"}

Bolt's dramatic final race at the World Championships.\n\nEight-time Olympic champion Bolt sensationally pulled up injured with 50 metres to go of the 4x100 metres relay and fell to the track with Great Britain taking gold just ahead of the USA and Japan.\n\nThe race started 10 minutes later than scheduled with two medal ceremonies for the 5,000m - with Sir Mo Farah getting his silver medal - and the high jump taking place before.\n\nBolt's sudden injury ended his career in sorry style after he planned to retire from the track following the championships, having already won bronze in the 100m last weekend.\n\n#bolt In case you missed it. pic.twitter.com/X1qJnjS4V0 -- Ross Tucker (@Scienceofsport)\n\nAugust 12, 2017\n\nAnd Blake, who won Olympic 4x100m relay gold with Bolt and Jamaica in 2012 and 2016, believes the lengthy build-up caused Bolt's injury in London on Saturday night.\n\n\"I think they were holding us too long in the call room. The walk was too long. Usain was really cold. In fact Usain said to me, 'Yohan, I think this is crazy',\" said the 100m world champion from 2011.\n\n\"It was 40 minutes and two medal presentations before our run. We keep warming up and waiting, then warming up and waiting. I think it got the better of us.\n\n\"We were over warm. And to see a true legend, a true champion go out there and struggling like that...\n\n\"The race was 10 minutes late, we were kept 40 minutes and it was a 300 metre walk. It was crazy.\"\n\nTeam-mate Omar McLeod echoed Blake and criticised the organisation with his heart going out to Bolt.\n\nHe said: \"It's heart-wrenching. I gave it my all and I really wanted Usain to leave golden, or even if it was just a medal, it was really heart-wrenching.\n\n\"I couldn't believe it, I'm in shock, utter disbelief.\n\n\"It was ridiculous, man. We were there around 45 minutes waiting outside, I think they had three medal ceremonies before we went out so we were really trying our hardest to stay warm and keep upbeat.\n\n\"But it was ridiculous. We waited a really long time. I drank like two bottles of water.\"\n\nTeam-mate Julian Forte, running in his first World Championships, added: \"I really wanted to be a part of the team that sends Usain off in style. Unfortunately it's one of those things, it's part of sport.\n\n\"They kept us in the call room for an extremely long time in our running kits, and it's not the warmest over here and they had us around there for quite a while, so I think they really need to look into that and do something about it.\n\n\"We were excited, we were ready, we had been doing some hand offs and everybody was feeling good, but they kept us hanging around for a long time, you know. So it's just really crazy.\"\n\nDr Kevin Jones, Jamaica's team doctor, confirmed Bolt's injury.\n\nHe said: \"It's cramp in his left hamstring but a lot of pain is from disappointment from losing the race. The last three weeks have been hard for him, you know. We hope for the best for him.\"\n\nThe USA's 100m champion, Justin Gatlin, had sympathy for Bolt and still expects him to return to the track, with the pair even having a bet.\n\nHe said: \"You can't really have this night or championship define what he's done in the past. From 2008 on, Usain Bolt has done amazing things. Tonight is not going to define who he is. He is still the man.\n\n\"This is a farewell tour, we take our hats off to him and we hope he gets better.\n\n\"I'm going to win my 100, he's coming back in a year or two. He'll be ready. He has a passion for the sport, he loves the fans, the fans love him. It's something you can't walk away too easy from.\"", "time": "07:24:00"}

pipped the United States to victory in a new European record and world-leading 37.47 seconds, but only after Bolt had pulled up on his anchor leg and collapsed to the track.\n\nTheir career successes dictated that they should both leave with gold medals hanging around their neck but there were a number of party-poopers on hand to steal a portion of the limelight.\n\nNo matter the result of the relay, organisers said Bolt will be afforded a dedicated lap of honour on Sunday in tribute to his awesome track career. Rico Freimuth took silver with 8,564 points, while German teammate Kai Kazmirek was third with 8,488.\n\nHe hobbled and went down in agony as Britain kept on going to hold off the U.S. and take gold. The 30-year-old posted the fastest time in the semi-finals in stark contrast to the 1/6 on favourite world record-holder Kendra Harrison who squeezed into the final as the second and last fastest loser.\n\nAs expected, the United States also qualified.\n\nUsain Bolt will take part in the final of 4 X 100 metres relay which will be the closing act of the night at 21.50 local time or 02.20 AM (August 13, Sunday morning).\n\nAfter winning the 4x100m title in Brazil, Bolt confirmed that the 2017 world championships would be his final event. Britain gladly bagged a silver in 42.12, and defending champions Jamaica clocked 42.19 for the bronze.\n\nOlympic great Usain Bolt reacts in despair after injury cost him a relay medal at the world athletics championships in London. If he wins he will be the first athlete to have swept the event at youth, junior and senior level.\n\nJohannes Vetter of Germany won the javelin title with an opening throw of 89.89 meters.\n\nSince that gold medal in 2007, the USA men had only won one other medal in the event, a silver in 2013.\n\nExperienced Yohan Blake, who finished fourth in the mens 100m final and failed to qualify for the final round in 200m, did not start in the heats but Bolt later said that he will return in the final race.\n\nAlso, British runner Mo Farah will compete in his last race on the track at a major championship when he goes for a fourth straight world title in the 5,000.", "time": "01:59:00"}

He has a passion for the sport, the fans love him, it's something you just can't walk away from that easy,\" said Gatlin.\n\n\"He's a showman, he wants to come out and I think he'll do a great job if he comes back to track and field. We've got a lot of young guys like Coleman, like [Jaylen] Bacon, myself, we're hungry to go out there for good competition.\"\n\nGatlin and Bolt on Sunday. Image: Getty\n\nRegardless of whether he returns to the track, Bolt is sure to be remembered as an all-time great - having secured 100m and 200m doubles at three successive Olympic Games, as well as setting new world records in each event.\n\n\"You can't really have this night define what he's done in the past,\" Gatlin added. \"From 2008 on, Usain Bolt has done amazing things and tonight is not going to define who he is.\n\n\"He's still the man, and this is farewell so we take our hat off to him, hope he gets well soon.\"\n\nGatlin was one of many competitors who suggested a lengthy wait ahead of Saturday's relay may have contributed to Bolt's injury.\n\n\"We were in the stadium for a while, you guys know how chilly it is down here,\" he said. \"We had a cool breeze in the back and I think with that a lot of our muscles were cramping up from having our clothes off a little too early.\n\n\"Hopefully it's just a cramp and it'll go away, but I hope he doesn't dwell on it.\"", "time": "02:34:00"}

cut down in his final race.\n\nThe gargantuan Usain Bolt said goodbye to his gigantic athletics career by rejecting a wheelchair proferred by concerned officials, rolling up his shorts and hobbling in pain across the finish line with his Jamaican 4x100m teammates in support.\n\nIf Bolt had managed to chase down US anchor Christian Coleman and British anchor Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake at the London Stadium, a victory would have brought about his 21st world, Olympic or Commonwealth Games gold medal. But instead it was the chilly weather of midsummer London, the officials' desire to have the athletes ready well before time, and the delayed start of the mens 4x100m relay that was blamed for Bolt's screaming and hopping down the final straight as his hamstring cramped into a blinding spasm.\n\nThink back to Bolt's explosion onto the world scene at the 2008 Beijing Olympics when he was so supreme, so confident, so thin, and so damn fast and it is almost incomprehensible to say goodbye as pain is etched across his face, limping to the medical centre, rather than playing to the crowd in a special farewell lap.\n\nThe ultimate good-time speedster is supposed to be supernatural, beyond the frailties of mere mortals who can only glance below 10 seconds.\n\nJamaica team doctor Kevin Jones said: \"It's cramp in his left hamstring but a lot of pain is from disappointment from losing the race.\n\n\"The last three weeks have been hard for him, you know. We hope for the best for him.\"\n\nWorld champion Justin Gatlin said the delay before the relay started was a recipe for disaster.\n\n\"Aw man, you know. It was a recipe ... I understand TV magic, and I understand that we have to be ready on the time. But I think we took our clothes off a little too early in the back, under the stadium. It's chilly out here, and I think that's where the cramp came from. He suffered that by having his clothes off too early. We lost all of our heat, all of our sweat and we went out there cold.''\n\nBolt's Jamaican teammate Yohan Blake said Bolt had been complaining before the race about the time delays.\n\nThe schedule fell behind after the men's 5000m when British distance star Mo Farah finished second behind Ethiopian Mutkar Edris but went on a journey around the track in a farewell of sorts as he now intends to run in marathons.\n\nThere were delays as several medal presentations were made and the relays started about 10 minutes behind schedule.\n\nJamaican team member Omar McLeod said: \"It's heart-wrenching, I gave it my all and I really wanted Usain to leave golden, or even if it was just a medal, it was really heart-wrenching.\n\n\"I couldn't believe it, I'm in shock, utter disbelief. It was ridiculous man, we were there around 45 minutes waiting outside, I think they had three medal ceremonies before we went out so we were really trying our hardest to stay warm and keep upbeat. But it was ridiculous. We waited a really long time.''\n\nNo one was anticipating such an excruciatingly painful goodbye to his career, which has left the global track and field community with a huge void to fill.\n\nUS star Allyson Felix, who added to her bulging collection of world and Olympic medals with another gold when the US team won the women's 4x100m relay, said: \"It's just really tough to see, especially on his kind of farewell tour. We never want to see someone get hurt, but especially him. So just hoping that he's all right.''\n\nBefore the race, Bolt was in a jovial mood, boxing with the championship mascot Hero the Hedgehog in the warm-up room, and then emerging onto the track to a standing ovation.\n\nWith a pre-planned shoulder roll with his team, he warmed up on the home straight, waving and cheering and clapping to the crowd. The moment was a little overwhelming, even for Bolt, as he realised this was it: his final sprint on the biggest of stages, but he wasn't to know he would end up in the medical room, rather than on a farewell lap.\n\nYet the mood in the stadium quickly turned to joy as the British team won the gold medal ahead of the US. Japan claimed the bronze.\n\nThe capacity crowd of 55,000 also roared for Bolt, this time in a chorus of gratefulness, thanks and a huge dollop of sadness.\n\nBolt seared himself onto the consciousness of the world when his braggadocio antics and playful enthusiasm at the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games elevated him well beyond being the fastest man in the world. He continued to dominate the sprints -- only a failed drug test by a relay teammate ultimately denied him the triple-triple Olympic golds across the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay. Many have commented that Bolt stayed a year too long: that he should have retired at the Rio Olympics, but he had always committed to the London 2017 organisers that he would support their event and he wanted to return to the Olympic track where the crowds had given him so much love.\n\nBolt would often train in southwest London, not far from the home of his agent Ricky Sims, and has long appreciated that the locals would leave him alone.\n\nEven now, Bolt is linked to the successful Nitro Athletics in Australia and is likely to make a guest appearance at next year's series, perhaps in the relay, or in one of the odd distances. That decision may hinge on how much partying he enjoys in his retirement, or if his intent to take up professional soccer is a serious one.\n\nBolt wanted to retire as unbeatable -- and while his bronze here from the 100m and his hobble in the relay was not the farewell he intended, he can be comforted that he will remain unbeatable as an athletics personality and his numerous records will stand for some time.\n\nHis 100m (9.58sec) and 200m (19.19sec) world records, set four days apart in Berlin in 2009, remain at the zenith of the sport, and well beyond the gravitational pull of the current generation of sprinters.", "time": "14:19:00"}

with Sir Mo Farah getting his silver medal - and the high jump taking place before.\n\nThe Jamaicans were expected to be amongst the medals\n\nBolt's sudden injury ended his career in sorry style after he planned to retire from the track following the championships, having already won bronze in the 100m last weekend.\n\nAnd Blake, who won Olympic 4x100m relay gold with Bolt and Jamaica in 2012 and 2016, believes the lengthy build-up caused Bolt's injury in London on Saturday night.\n\n\"I think they were holding us too long in the call room. The walk was too long. Usain was really cold.

Unfortunately it's one of those things, it's part of sport.\n\n\"They kept us in the call room for an extremely long time in our running kits, and it's not the warmest over here and they had us around there for quite a while, so I think they really need to look into that and do something about it.\n\n\"We were excited, we were ready, we had been doing some hand offs and everybody was feeling good, but they kept us hanging around for a long time, you know. So it's just really crazy.\"\n\nDr Kevin Jones, Jamaica's team doctor, confirmed Bolt's injury.\n\nHe said: \"It's cramp in his left hamstring but a lot of pain is from disappointment from losing the race.

that a long wait before their 4x100m final at the World Championships on Saturday contributed to the injury suffered by Usain Bolt in his last race.\n\nBolt, having been passed the baton by Yohan Blake, was in third behind Great Britain and the United States, who eventually won gold and silver, but pulled up almost 50 metres from the line and fell to the track.\n\nJamaica's team doctor later said that the 30-year-old had suffered a hamstring cramp.\n\nBolt's team mates complained that a 45-minute wait in the call room before the race had hampered their preparations.\n\n\"I think they were holding us too long in the call room,\" Blake told reporters. \"Usain was really cold. In fact Usain said to me 'Yohan, I think this is crazy'. Forty minutes and two medal presentations before our run.\"\n\nGatlin, who beat Bolt to gold in the 100m last Saturday, agreed with the complaints and laid the blame at the television scheduling for the event.\n\n\"I know it's TV magic, and everybody has to be prepared on time to make everything happen for the viewers at home.\n\n\"(But) I personally think that we were held in the stadium a little too long without our clothes on, and there was a little draught in there. I lost all my sweat and body heat,\" Gatlin said.\n\nWhen asked if he thought that contributed to Bolt's injury, the 35-year-old said: \"I believe so.\n\n\"Knowing how Usain performs, he's always ready, he's always making sure he's not injured and it's very rare to see Usain injured when he comes to performances.\"\n\nGatlin ran the second leg for the United States as they finished runners-up behind Britain, who became world champions for the first time.\n\nAmidst the home crowd's jubilation, there was also relief at the sight of Bolt being able to walk off the track after being helped to his feet by his team mates.\n\n\"I'm not sure what the extent of his injury is, but when I saw him go down I thought it was a calf cramp or a hamstring cramp. But he walked off the track, so that's good thing.", "time": "23:55:00"}

pulled up injured in the 4\u00d7100 metres relay, meaning he finishes with 19 global titles in the greatest career athletics has ever seen.\n\nHere, Press Association Sport takes a look at five of his most memorable moments.\n\nBeijing arrival\n\nUsain Bolt\n\nA 21-year-old Bolt announced himself as track and field's newest superstar with a brilliant world record to win 100m gold at the 2008 Olympics. Fuelled by a diet of chicken nuggets, he clocked 9.69 seconds, despite crossing the line with a shoelace undone and spreading his arms and slapping his chest in celebration before the finish. International Olympic Committee president Jacques Rogge criticised his showboating as disrespectful. No-one agreed.\n\nBerlin brilliance\n\nBolt won the men's 100m final in a new world record time of 9.58 seconds during the IAAF World Championships in Berlin (John Giles/PA)\n\nBolt cemented his status as the world's greatest ever sprinter with two more eye-watering world records over 100m and 200m at the 2009 World Championships. He blazed to 9.58secs in the 100m - the biggest ever improvement in the 100m world record since electronic timing was introduced - and then took 0.11s off his 200m mark too, winning another gold in 19.19.\n\nDaegu disappointment\n\nBolt celebrates winning the men's 200 metres in Daegu, South Korea (Dave Thompson/PA)\n\nBolt's hopes of defending his world 100m title in 2011 were dashed by a dramatic false start in the final. He knew immediately what he had done, ripping his top off in frustration. The mistake was proof he was human after all. His response - gold in the 200m and 4x100m relay - was inevitable and emphatic.\n\n'Legend' in London\n\nBolt kisses his gold medal after winning the men's 100 meters at the 2012 London Olympic Games (Matt Slocum/AP)\n\nBolt arrived at the 2012 Olympics looking to become the first man in history to defend both 100m and 200m titles and, in his words, become a \"legend\" of the sport. He blitzed to 100m glory in 9.63 - the second fastest time in history - and added 200m gold in 19.32. \"I am a living legend,\" Bolt told the world's press afterwards. \"Bask in my glory.\"\n\nThe 'Saviour'\n\nUsain Bolt\n\nAs doping and corruption scandals involving those at the very top of the sport left its credibility shredded, Bolt found himself cast as athletics' 'saviour' in his sprint battles with two-time drug offender Justin Gatlin. The American went into the 2015 World Championships in Beijing with the four fastest times of the year over 100m, but Bolt defied the doubters to pip him to gold when it mattered, winning by just one hundredth of a second. He defeated him too in the 200m and then repeated the feat the following year at the Olympics in Rio.", "time": "17:18:00"}

Mills made a deal with Bolt. For instance, first place in the biennial World Championships is worth $60,000, and world records carry bonuses of $100,000 in that event, according to Forbes.\n\nOn the question about the disappointing bronze in the final 100m of his career, Bolt was all but praises for Justin Gatlin.\n\nBut could fans handle it if we found, for example, that as charming as Bolt, the best known and most popular athlete in the world, is, he was no better than the majority of his Jamaican team-mates when it came to using drugs?\n\nA few minutes after that, he stepped onto the track, kneeled down and kissed the finish line that he crossed in Lane 4. Since then, he has collected nine gold medals in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m in three Olympic games.\n\nThrough most of the race, it looked as if Bolt would be trying to reel in Coleman, the NCAA champion, who was in Lane 5, and got out faster than anyone in the field. Bolt is not the one that was crushing everything in its path with chronos from elsewhere, but this outcome was finally like a relief to an athlete who has dedicated his life to his sport from a very young age. I wasn't booed in 2012, '11, and '12- which was still in London- '13 or '14 or '15 and not that much in '16.\n\nIt was the first time Bolt had lost a World Championships 100m final he had started, having been disqualified for a false start in Daegu in 2011. Bear in mind that Lance Armstrong managed to end his career without getting caught ... too.\n\nThe rest of the six events of the decathlon will take place with the 1,500 metres bringing to close the multi-discipline event.\n\nBolt seems to enjoy his fame and fortune. So Bolt was rewarded with about $30,000 for his haul of three gold medals that year. Bolt graciously settled for a bronze. \"I've done all I can for the sport and myself\". Say, for instance, when you're growing up, you're walking down the street, you've got to tell everybody good morning.\n\nThe Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics at the University of Oslo did a scientific analysis of that run and estimated that Bolt could have finished with a time of 9.55 seconds if he hadn't slowed down to celebrate.\n\nThough van Niekerk could eventually prove to match Bolt's ability, his reserved personality means he'll likely never reach the heights of Bolt's legendary persona.\n\nUsain Bolt is one of the greatest athletes of all time, there is no doubting that.\n\nHis legendary achievements were well recognized by the sports world as he was named IAAF Athlete of The Year six times and was a four-time Laureus Awards victor.", "time": "21:34:00"}

was one that certainly forgot to follow the script. For Usain Bolt, these World Championships had been touted as his farewell party; a chance for the eight-time Olympian to sign off his illustrious career in style. But much to the horror of the Jamaican's adoring masses, this was a send-off that ended with red wine on the carpet, smashed plates on the floor and thousands of pounds worth in damages.\n\nEnter culprit No 1: Justin Gatlin. Living up to his villainous billing all too literally, the American gatecrashed the main event with a degree of impertinence that left a bitter aftertaste in the mouth.\n\nWith a single, admonishing finger raised to his lips, having just run the race of his life to claim a third world title and leave Bolt ruminating with bronze, the 35-year-old made a mockery of the sporting narrative that insists virtue and honesty will always triumph over the dark arts.\n\nRead more Jamaica furious over Bolt injury as they blame delays for relay agony\n\nEdging to victory by the smallest of margins last weekend - 0.03 seconds to be precise - Gatlin momentarily reduced a deafening wall of noise to a stunned, stomach-turning silence as the home crowd registered what they had just witnessed.\n\nUp next on the interloper line-up: Great Britain's very own men's relay team. Positioned in the outer lanes at the London Stadium on Saturday night, as Gatlin had been, it was now the turn of the hosts to rip up the script.\n\nPutting together a well-executed combination of changeovers and sprints, GB stormed to victory in 37.47 seconds to claim the nation's first major gold since Athens 2004. It was a victory the British quartet earned and deserved - and not one borne out by the shortcomings of their rivals.\n\nBritain's relay team deserve their success (Getty)\n\nIn contract to the hostile reception it had put on for Gatlin seven days prior, the London crowd embraced its homegrown heroes with a frenzied, gold-induced euphoria.\n\nAs Nathaneel Mitchell-Blake roared with delight after confirmation of victory, London roared back. It had been the 23-year-old, born and raised in the capital, who anchored his team to victory, pipping USA to first place on the finishing line with a well-timed dip of the head. Making the most of their big night, Mitchell-Blake and his team-mates revelled in their new-found status as world champions, lapping up every moment of it.\n\nWhich brings us to the man himself. Having spent the last nine years in defiance of the stopwatch, it seems Father Time has finally caught up with the world's fastest man - as last night all too painfully demonstrated.\n\nBolt was stunned by longtime rival Gatlin in the 100m final (Getty)\n\nStretched out on the track, clutching his hamstring in agony, here was athletics' Goliath in a moment of rare vulnerability, caught like a rabbit in the bright lights of the London Stadium. Offset against the unexpected success of Great Britain's relay team, it was an image that added to the emotional overload of the evening. Struck down on the final straight with 50m to go, Bolt's farewell was brought to a close in agonising fashion.\n\nHis team-mates were left searching for an explanation, and eventually turned to the organisers themselves as they blamed a delay in proceedings for Bolt's injury. \"I think they were holding us too long in the call room,\" Yohan Blake insisted. \"Usain was really cold. In fact Usain said to me, 'Yohan, I think this is crazy'.\"\n\nBut the painful reality of the matter is that, ultimately, Bolt should never have competed at this year's Championships.\n\nUsain Bolt's best moments 10 show all Usain Bolt's best moments 1/10 Beijing 2008 100m final (9.69 seconds, 2008 Beijing Olympics)\n\nBolt wins his first Olympic gold after destroying the competition in Beijing.\n\nGetty\n\n2/10 Beijing 2008 200m final (19.30 seconds, 2008 Beijing Olympics)\n\nBolt doubles up in China after wining the 200m with a new world record time.\n\nGetty\n\n3/10 Beijing 2008 4x100m final (37.10 seconds, 2008 Beijing Olympics)\n\nThe Jamiacan 4x100m relay team make it a hat-trick in Beijing for Bolt.\n\nGetty\n\n4/10 Berlin 2009 100m final (9.58 seconds 2009 Berlin World Championships)\n\nBold sets a 100m world record of 9.58s at the Berlin World Athletics Championships, a feat that still stands today.\n\nGetty\n\n5/10 Berlin 2009 200m final (19.19 seconds, 2009 Berlin World Championships)\n\nBolt doubles up again with a new world record in the 200m final.\n\nGetty\n\n6/10 London 2012 100m final (9.63 seconds, 2012 London Olympics)\n\nOlympic gold medal No 4 arrives in London with 100m success.\n\nGetty\n\n7/10 London 2012 200m final (19.32 seconds, 2012 London Olympics)\n\nA fifth Olympic gold quickly follows as Bolt wins the 200m.\n\nGetty\n\n8/10 London 2012 4x100m final (36.64 seconds, 2012 London Olympics)\n\nJamaica continue their dominance of men's sprinting with 4x100m relay gold in London.\n\nGetty\n\n9/10 Rio 2016 100m final (9.81 seconds, 2016 Rio Olympics)\n\nDespite fears over his form, Bolt retains his Olympic gold medal in Rio after winning the 100m final.\n\nGetty\n\n10/10 Rio 2016 200m final (19.78 second, Rio 2016 Olympics)\n\nBolt celebrates crossing the line for his eighth Olympic gold in the 200m final\n\nGetty\n\nMake no doubt, the events of the past week barely scratch the surface of the Jamaican's glorious career. After all, this is a man whose charisma, affability and mind-boggling performances on the track injected new life into a sport that, prior to his arrival, was in desperate need of star-studded appeal. Those with the broadest shoulders carry the greatest weight, goes the saying, and Bolt embraced this responsibility with an air of boyish insouciance that has come to embody his career and persona over the years.\n\nAfter the highs of Beijing, London and Rio, coupled with his dominance at the Worlds, the 30-year-old's legend and legacy had long been secured. Why, then, risk ending his career with the disappointment of a missed gold medal or, worse, the ignominy of an unfinished race?\n\nThe Jamaican was carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders (Getty)\n\nAs mosts athlete at the top of their game will attest to, the desire to compete and taste glory can prove infuriatingly addictive. \"I live for competition,\" Bolt said earlier in his career. \"I thrive on competition. I live to compete against the best.\"\n\nBut, in truth, the aim had in fact been to exit centre stage after Rio 2016. \"That was the initial plan [to sign off after Rio],\" he revealed in 2015. \"But my sponsor has asked me to go on for another year; to 2017 and London. But I'll be doing one event, the 100m. I can concentrate on that, and on retiring on a winning note.\"\n\nBolt's admission may have come two years ago before the Beijing World Championships and Rio Games, but it's somewhat uncomfortable to hear that commercial pressure determined the Jamaican's retirement date.\n\nBolt's London finale ended in disappointment (Getty)\n\nOf course, Bolt was not to know that one year on after making these comments he would claim three more gold medals in Brazil - but that should have been the point at which the sprinter called it a day.\n\nA victim of his own success, the truth is that the Jamaican didn't need these Championships. If anything, we needed him. An athlete without parallel in his discipline, and a sportsman who has drawn comparisons with the likes of Mohammed Ali and Pele, the 30-year-old had little to prove this summer.\n\nGatlin's gold may have shaken the sport, while GB's victory reaffirmed our love for it, but this past week will do nothing to diminish Bolt's legend - it was, instead, a timely reminder that he is human after all.\n\nMore about: World Athletics Championships Usain Bolt Justin Gatlin London Stadium Reuse content", "time": "11:42:00"}

AFP\n\nBolt, having been passed the baton by Yohan Blake, was in third behind Great Britain and the United States, who eventually won gold and silver, but pulled up almost 50 metres from the line and fell to the track.\n\nJamaica's team doctor later said that the 30-year-old had suffered a hamstring cramp.\n\nBolt's team mates complained that a 45-minute wait in the call room before the race had hampered their preparations.\n\n\"I think they were holding us too long in the call room,\" Blake told reporters. \"Usain was really cold. In fact Usain said to me 'Yohan, I think this is crazy'. Forty minutes and two medal presentations before our run.\"\n\nGatlin, who beat Bolt to gold in the 100m last Saturday, agreed with the complaints and laid the blame at the television scheduling for the event.\n\n\"I know it's TV magic, and everybody has to be prepared on time to make everything happen for the viewers at home.\n\n\"(But) I personally think that we were held in the stadium a little too long without our clothes on, and there was a little draught in there. I lost all my sweat and body heat,\" Gatlin said.\n\nWhen asked if he thought that contributed to Bolt's injury, the 35-year-old said: \"I believe so.\n\n\"Knowing how Usain performs, he's always ready, he's always making sure he's not injured and it's very rare to see Usain injured when he comes to performances.\"\n\nGatlin ran the second leg for the United States as they finished runners-up behind Britain, who became world champions for the first time.\n\nAmidst the home crowd's jubilation, there was also relief at the sight of Bolt being able to walk off the track after being helped to his feet by his team mates.\n\n\"I'm not sure what the extent of his injury is, but when I saw him go down I thought it was a calf cramp or a hamstring cramp. But he walked off the track, so that's good thing.\n\n\"I hope that he gets well soon,\" Gatlin added.\n\nPublished Date: Aug 13, 2017 06:08 pm | Updated Date: Aug 13, 2017 06:08 pm\n\nTags :#100 metres#4x100m relay#Athletics#Iaaf world championships 2017#Jamaica#Justin gatlin#London#United states#Usain bolt#Yohan blake", "time": "13:00:00"}

race at the world championships ended in him getting injured and hobbling on the track, whimpering in agony.\n\nThe 4x100m relay witnessed the disaster, as Bolt crumpled on the race track clutching his leg in visible pain and tears, reports CNN.\n\nBolt took the baton for Jamaica in third place but within a few strides he was on the ground, clutching his left leg, as host Britain secured gold ahead of the United States team which had Justin Gatlin.\n\nBolt, who came third in the individual 100m behind Gatlin and his fellow teammate Christian Coleman, was comforted by his teammates after getting to his feet, his face marked with pain.\n\nNevertheless, Twitter was filled with praises and cheerful messages for Bolt, as they hailed him for being a legend on track.\n\nSport can be uplifting and cruel, generous and mean. Because it is real, it tells the greatest stories. As it has with the great Usain Bolt -- Harsha Bhogle (@bhogleharsha)\n\nAugust 13, 2017\n\nThe capacity crowd in the London Stadium was still digesting the shock earlier defeat for home hero Mo Farah in the men's 5,000m final, before Bolt's final disappointing appearance who limped out of the London Stadium arena.\n\n\"He didn't tell us exactly what happened but from what I saw, it looked like a strain or a cramp of some sort. He kept apologizing to us but we told him there was no need to apologize -- injuries are part of the sport,\" teammate Julian Forte told IAAF radio.\n\nJamaican team doctor Dr Kevin Jones told AFP that Bolt had suffered from \"cramp in his left hamstring\".\n\n\"The last three weeks have been hard for him, you know. We hope for the best for him,\" he added.\n\nFarah, who won the 10,000 title in the opening day at the London Stadium, settled for silver behind Ethiopian Muktar Edris in his final championship race on the track.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "time": "09:31:00"}

4x100m final at the World Championships on Saturday contributed to the injury suffered by Usain Bolt in his last race.\n\nBolt, having been passed the baton by Yohan Blake, was in third behind Great Britain and the United States, who eventually won gold and silver, but pulled up almost 50m from the line and fell to the track.\n\nJamaica's team doctor later said that the 30-year-old had suffered a hamstring cramp.\n\nBolt's teammates complained that a 45-minute wait in the call room before the race had hampered their preparations.\n\n\"I think they were holding us too long in the call room,'' Blake told reporters. \"Usain was really cold. In fact Usain said to me 'Yohan, I think this is crazy. Forty minutes and two medal presentations before our run.''\n\nGatlin, who beat Bolt to gold in the 100m last Saturday, agreed with the complaints and laid the blame at the television scheduling for the event.\n\n\"I know it's TV magic, and everybody has to be prepared on time to make everything happen for the viewers at home.\n\n\"(But) I personally think that we were held in the stadium a little too long without our clothes on, and there was a little draught in there. I lost all my sweat and body heat,'' Gatlin said.\n\nWhen asked if he thought that contributed to Bolt's injury, the 35-year-old said: \"I believe so.\n\n\"Knowing how Usain performs, he's always ready, he's always making sure he's not injured and it's very rare to see Usain injured when he comes to performances.''\n\nGatlin ran the second leg for the United States as they finished runners-up behind Britain, who became world champions for the first time.\n\nAmidst the home crowd's jubilation, there was also relief at the sight of Bolt being able to walk off the track after being helped to his feet by his teammates.\n\n\"I'm not sure what the extent of his injury is, but when I saw him go down I thought it was a calf cramp or a hamstring cramp. But he walked off the track, so that's good thing.", "time": "10:52:00"}

championships in London.\n\nUnfortunately there was to be no fairytale as he pulled up and collapsed injured on the track running the anchor leg.\n\nHere AFP Sports looks at his glittering career in numbers.\n\n1 - world bronze, after being beaten in the 100m in London 2017 by Americans Justin Gatlin and Christian Coleman\n\n3 - the number of Olympic treble sprint doubles, in Beijing 2008, London 2012 and Rio 2016. It should have been a treble treble including all three relay titles, but teammate Nesta Carter tested positive for doping in the Chinese capital\n\n4 - times Bolt has been named Laureus World Sportsman of the Year: 2009, 2010, 2013, 2017\n\n5 - the number of sprinters to have beaten Bolt over 100m: Gatlin, Coleman, Jamaica's Asafa Powell, American Tyson Gay and Antigua's Daniel Bailey\n\n6 - times Bolt has won the IAAF Male Athlete of the Year: 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2016\n\n9.63 - the second fastest time ever run, when Bolt scorched to 100m gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics\n\n14 - world medals amassed since making his debut in Helsinki in 2005, when he finished eighth and last in the 200m final\n\n14.35 - the world best Bolt set over 150 metres in Manchester, England, in 2009. He ran the final 100 metres in a startling 8.70sec, the fastest time ever recorded\n\n30.97 - his best time over the rarely-run 300m, set in 2010. Only South African Wayde van Niekerk and American Michael Johnson have gone faster\n\n31 - the Jamaican turns 31 on August 21\n\n36.84 - the world record for the 4x100m relay set at the London Olympics, Bolt anchoring a team also comprising Nesta Carter, Michael Frater and Yohan Blake. Bolt had been part of two previous world relay records, in Beijing in 2008 (though this was later voided) and at the 2011 Daegu worlds\n\n37.58 - Bolt's average speed in km/h (23.35mph) in his 100m world record race. Should you subtract his reaction time of 0.15sec, his time is actually 9.43sec, making his average speed 38.18km/h (23.72mph)\n\n41 - the number of strides it took for Bolt to cover the 100m on his record-setting run in the German capital\n\n44.72 - top speed in km/h (27.79mph) reached during his 100m run in Berlin in 2009, between the 60 to 80-metre mark\n\n53 - the number of times Bolt has run sub-10 second 100m races\n\n34.2 million - dollars earned by Bolt last year according to a list of the world's richest sportspeople by Forbes magazine.", "time": "05:40:00"}

world bronze, after being beaten in the 100m in London 2017 by Americans Justin Gatlin and Christian Coleman\n\n3 - the number of Olympic treble sprint doubles, in Beijing 2008, London 2012 and Rio 2016. It should have been a treble treble including all three relay titles, but teammate Nesta Carter tested positive for doping in the Chinese capital\n\n4 - times Bolt has been named Laureus World Sportsman of the Year: 2009, 2010, 2013, 2017\n\n5 - the number of sprinters to have beaten Bolt over 100m: Gatlin, Coleman, Jamaica's Asafa Powell, American Tyson Gay and Antigua's Daniel Bailey\n\n6 - times Bolt has won the IAAF Male Athlete of the Year: 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2016\n\n8 - Olympic gold medals: 100, 200m (2008, 2012, 2016); 4x100m relay (2012, 2016)\n\n9.58 - the world record he set for the 100m at the 2009 worlds in Berlin\n\n9.63 - the second fastest time ever run, when Bolt scorched to 100m gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics\n\n14 - world medals amassed since making his debut in Helsinki in 2005, when he finished eighth and last in the 200m final\n\n14.35 - the world best Bolt set over 150 metres in Manchester, England, in 2009. He ran the final 100 metres in a startling 8.70sec, the fastest time ever recorded\n\n19 - major global medals\n\n19.19 - the world record he set for the 200m at the 2009 worlds in Berlin\n\n30.97 - his best time over the rarely-run 300m, set in 2010.

What would've been a dream finish turned into a nightmare quickly when Jamiaca's native son suffered a pulled hamstring during his last ever race. In what was billed as his final competition, Bolt lost twice in the space of a week shattering his aura of invincibility.\n\nAfter losing to Justin Gatlin in the individual 100m race, many were hoping that Bolt could make it up by winning his country a gold medal in the relay. But while he at least won a bronze in his first race, he started limping after his first few strides following the changeover.\n\nEven though the crowd got to witness a victory for their home country, Bolt got a bigger reception than them, and most people were watching him with great concern as he was walking around the track with tears.\n\nDespite the sour taste this likely leaves in everyone's mouths, Usain Bolt shouldn't be considered anything less than the GOAT. Realistically, his legacy was already set coming into the World Championships, and he only competed so that he could leave with one last gold medal. But after seeing him struggle throughout the week, he probably should've retired after the Olympics.\n\nIt's easy to say Father Time caught up to Bolt, but he's still only 30 years old. While he probably won't compete in 2020, it's easy to think he'll come out of retirement in order to leave a more lasting image than this. But if he does that, he could end up falling even further out of favor by piling up even more losses to track's future stars.\n\nWhether or not he'll come back is sure to be a hot-button topic in the sports world.", "time": "20:36:00"}

The Americans were seen as the favourites, with Bolt showing signs of weakness in the individual 100 meters and most expecting him to start his leg with a large deficit.\n\nThe race played out exactly like that, although the Brits came out of nowhere to snatch the gold from the Americans. But by the time the hosts finished, many of the fans in London had their eyes fixed further back.\n\nThe hugely popular Bolt was given a standing ovation after the individual 100-meters final, when a bitterly disappointed crowd watched as Gatlin took the gold. Saturday's reaction was more mixed, with many noting the incredible achievement by the hosts, including MP Jess Phillips:\n\nBolt ended his career on the track with 11 World Championships gold medals.

Gangly sprinter from humble beginnings bursts onto the scene in Beijing, demolishing three world records as athletics crowns a new king. Armed with the perfect concoction of attributes - speed, swagger and an unavoidably-excellent surname - Usain Bolt has ruled the sport ever since.\n\nBut as his tale enters its final chapter going into the World Athletics Championships in London, little is still known about the mentality behind his ruthless win streak. How has the sport's jester held the mental edge for nine years in events that last a few fleeting seconds? Tiger Woods, Michael Jordan, Michael Phelps and Serena Williams are some of the great names who have dominated their sport with unerring discipline. Bolt, by constrast, is in his element clowning around on the startline.\n\n\"It is only when the starter says 'on your marks' that I focus in on the race,\" Bolt exclusively tells Eurosport, as he takes us inside the mind of a sporting great. At 21:45pm on Saturday August 5, the starter will utter those words to the Jamaican one final time. The 30-year-old will pause his theatrics, lock into race mode and - almost certainly - claim victory in the last race of his incredible career.\n\nBut how can he stay so calm when his legacy is one mistake from unravelling? What is unique about the mindset which has spurred him onto unimaginable heights? And how on earth can athletics prosper once the curtain falls on Bolt's career?\n\nWhen Bolt triumphantly drummed his chest and eased to a brisk jog in Beijing, not only was he making a mockery of the Olympics' flagship event, he was also ripping up the sprint manual forever. Such was his impact that day, athletics has marched to his beat ever since. It was the first time in history that a 100m sprinter had shown such apathy for sprinting the full 100m... and yet he still obliterated the world record. The combined winning margins from Barcelona 1992 to Athens 2004 sat at 0.16 seconds; Bolt's clocking in 2008 put him 0.2 seconds clear of his closest rival. All on a nutritious diet of chicken nuggets. 'Anything can happen' was a phrase now redundant in men's sprinting, all because of Bolt's extraordinary 9.69s run-turned-victory-jog.\n\nAnd boy did athletics need it. Fresh from the debacle in Athens, which saw proposed Olympic flame lighter Konstantinos Kenteris' missed doping test on the eve of the Opening Ceremony set the tone for a drug-ravaged Games, the sport needed rescuing - and it would be, by the most eccentric of characters.\n\n*LUCA'S VIDEO OF ALL BOLT'S OLYMPIC GOLDS*\n\nFor five years, Bolt's dominance was such that he could afford his pre-race theatrics, with only a solitary DQ in the 100m final at the World Championships in Daegu, 2011, blighting his clean sweep in major championships. Nobody could get near him - and it defied all logic. Sprinters were supposed to conform to a stereotype: muscular, explosive and not far north of six foot. The start was where the race was won and lost, so what hope did Bolt have of harnessing his surname and blasting from the blocks with his 6'5\" frame acting as a giant parachute?\n\nNothing could stop him in those early years, as he set about redefining a sport. But as Bolt's youth slipped away, so did his frightening advantage. By the time the 2015 World Championships arrived, dissenting voices had emerged - so too had a clear rival to the sport's golden boy: the reviled double drug cheat Justin Gatlin. For the first time in his career, Bolt was under fire from inside and outside his sport. A race which took on a moral dimension - almost becoming a parable of good versus evil - had everything riding on it, and Gatlin was in imperious form, unbeaten in 29 races.\n\nNot that you could tell. With his legacy one defeat from crumbling, Bolt arrived for the 100m final with his typical swagger and looked completely relaxed as the athletes were introduced to the crowd. It wasn't his raw pace that won the final, but his mental hold on his rivals as Gatlin - an Olympic gold medallist - forgot how to run in the final 15m. This was no fluke. This was the Bolt effect. Thinking you can beat him, and actually beating him, are two very different beasts. It is a tension that none of his rivals have ever been able to resolve, a constant thread running through his career.\n\n* START LINE ANTICS READ-IT VIDEO *\n\nNo one had ever seen anything like it. In WWE, perhaps, but certainly not in athletics. When Bolt lined up for the 100m in Beijing in 2008 his rivals were taken aback, as were fans around the world. It was striking, almost shocking in a wonderful way. His fellow sprinters were focused, stern and unflinching while Bolt preened like a peacock; he effectively roared 'Look! I've arrived! This is how we do things now!'.\n\nNo athlete had ever before celebrated victory prior to a race so convincingly; no one had dared to make the 100m a one-man party, only interrupted very fleetingly by the main event. The race itself was only a very small part of a wider celebration, not only of talent, but of personality.\n\nBolt had arrived, and his world-record run was sandwiched between selfies, lightning bolts and rampant, uninhibited posing. It was how a young athlete might play out their moment of triumph in front of a full-length mirror while dancing for joy. It played out like a dream for the young Jamaican. He was the only one not surprised by the swagger; he was the only one not surprised by the success. Athletics had been changed forever, all the space of 30 stunning, unforgettable minutes.\n\n\"I've never seen anybody compete with such a carefree attitude and a sense of enjoyment, a celebration of his talent,\" triple jump world-record holder Jonathan Edwards tells Eurosport. \"For me that makes him stand out as much as his talent in itself and what he's achieved.\"\n\n\"It is just showing my personality,\" Bolt himself explains. \"I did it a few times and the crowd liked it so I kept doing it. I love when a stadium has a lot of energy, it inspires me to perform better.\"\n\nIt is for this reason that the swagger doesn't grind, the posing doesn't drag: because this is Bolt being completely himself, the unbridled, unchecked version of himself. It's the authenticity of his antics that makes them relatable for his millions of fans, because this is how he behaves around his friends and at home. The opposite of being contrived and designed for the cameras, he is simply showing the world the real him.\n\nProfessor Steve Peters, author of the Chimp Paradox and celebrated sports psychiatrist, tells Eurosport how Bolt has mastered the art of being completely relaxed before hitting the blocks by \"managing to either learn how to focus at the appropriate moment or having little fear about failure or underperformance, or feeling totally prepared\". It is an almost perfect recipe for pre-race psychology, and we may never see it utilised to the same extent again.\n\nThe 100m start line, most commonly a place of crippling nerves and unbearable tension, has been turned into a dance floor and a catwalk rolled into one by the incomparable Bolt.\n\nWhat does Bolt think about, when the heart is pounding and the tension is unbearable before the start of an Olympic 100m final? Where does the elite mind go in moments of such extreme stress, with adrenaline coursing through the veins? The answer is an unexpected one.\n\n\"I try to think about random things,\" Bolt reveals. \"What I will have for dinner, what I need to do the next day.\" Not even random things related to the race, or the fact that he is on the start line with millions of fans around the world watching every twitch of his muscles. It seems incredible that the greatest sprinter of all-time is not even thinking about his upcoming race until that 'on your marks' moment. And just like that, he snaps into his state of focus, he jolts into a different persona altogether; it is only at that point that the smile fades, the posing halts and a ruthless, clinical winning machine is switched on.\n\n*INSIDE BOLT'S HEAD - GRAPHICAL VIDEO*\n\nDuring a 100m or 200m race, there is little time for thought. But what goes through the mind of the Jamaican as he is pounding the track is still a point of fascination. \"There isn't a lot of time to think about things but I generally have things I need to focus on, from the start to the drive phrase to the transition into top speed running,\" Bolt says.\n\nAs anyone who has ever watched him perform - and win - knows full well, the after-race party is often as big of a deal as the race itself, something he is very well aware of as he reveals his process.\n\n\"The most important thing is always to get the win, then I check the time to see how fast it was. After this it is about thanking the fans for their support. I usually do a victory lap which involves a lot of selfies and autographs.\"\n\nAthletics was never this way before: the sport has changed, for the better. You may have thought Bolt was just having fun with his antics but it's the ultimate facade: there's a perfectly-timed steely focus behind that smile.\n\nBelief is an athlete's best friend. Sprinters, in particular, carry belief like a badge. If you don't have belief, goes the assumption on the start line of a 100m race, there is no point in taking off the oversized headphones and stripping down to the lycra. When competing against Bolt, however, belief has never seemed as futile, as unconvincing, as imperceptible.\n\nIt is extremely difficult to get any athlete to talk about the challenge of facing Bolt, the intimidation factor so often hinted at but never conceded publicly. While you will find many athletes who accept that Bolt is the greatest, 2003 world champion and sprinting legend Kim Collins, who remarkably will be competing again in London at the age of 41, dismisses the subject out of hand, with an emphatic \"No!\". Try telling Collins that facing Bolt is something to be feared.\n\n\"A competitor is a competitor; he is no different to my five-year-old son,\" he responds in animated fashion. \"When I race my five-year-old I refuse to let him win and let him feel as though he's better than me, so when you're a competitor you compete against everybody to beat them, not to let them win. So when we lose, we didn't just stand back and let them win.\"\n\nCollins remains impressively defiant, with the perspective a world title and a wealth of experience lends him. \"I've been around real intimidators: Carl Lewis, Linford Christie, Dennis Mitchell, Donovan Bailey and all those guys, they were totally different. So these guys now, they can't move me.\"\n\nIntimidation? Perhaps not. But the swagger is something else.\n\n*CENTRAL TV PRODUCTION: THE MECHANICS OF BOLT'S DOMINANCE*\n\n\"If his rivals choose to focus on him then they can expect a reaction,\" Professor Peters explains. \"For some it might result in a negative outcome. For 100m runners they must accept that there is no room for error.\" And that is why racing Bolt comes down to a unique and wholly demoralising challenge: to accept that even the perfect race may not be enough. It will almost certainly not be enough.\n\nRoger Black once described racing the great Michael Johnson as \"racing for second place\". For sprinters, the agony of competing for second is compounded by the heartbreaking, ego-piercing truth that is almost inescapable on the start line: the idea that the remainder of the field effectively represent a sideshow, a parade of dejected also-rans. It may sound harsh to portray competing against Bolt in these terms, but when you consider the sacrifices, the dedication and the commitment required to compete as an elite athlete, this psychological truth is simply devastating, and effectively crippling.\n\nFor Bolt himself, of course, different rules apply. No pressure, no negativity; total assurance; total belief. \"I don't really feel pressure,\" Bolt declares with an ease that must be infuriating for his rivals. \"Of course the World Championship is the biggest race of the year so it is important to get it right but I like to be relaxed as I run better when I am relaxed.\"\n\nThe mentality of certain defeat: an unacceptable mindset for a sprinter, but almost inevitable when coming up against a man who simply knows he is going to win. If he wants to be relaxed he will be relaxed; if he wants to win he will win. Perhaps never before has an athlete appeared to be in such complete control. Whether or not his fellow competitors recognise or perceive an intimidation factor, the fact remains that Bolt has a hold over his rivals when it comes to the defining events of his era, one which goes beyond purely talent and speed.\n\n\"When I say I've beaten Bolt, the response is always the same: 'No way! You're kidding!'. I have to show the videos, because nobody believes me...\"\n\nMuch is made of Bolt's perfect Olympic record: nine events; nine victories. It's also a lie. It's August 24, 2004. Athens is staging the Games of the XXVIII Olympiad, with heat four of the men's 200m featuring a rising star. The camera is fixated on lane five as world junior champion Bolt, three days after his 18th birthday, gestures to someone in the crowd just moments before \"on your marks\" is uttered. Around him, his competitors puff out their cheeks in full-on intimidation mode.\n\nBarely 60 seconds later, the Jamaican is out after finishing fifth. Little-known Polish athlete Marcin Jedrusinski, then 22, is acknowledging the crowd after taking victory. Jedrusinski would later bow out at the semi-final stage and retire with just a solitary European silver medal to show for his labours. But as another career drifts into the twilight zone, he can now brag about his unique claim to fame - he was the man who triumphed in Bolt's sole Olympic failure.\n\n\"At that time, I didn't think I had beaten someone big,\" Jedrusinski relives to Eurosport Poland. \"Usain was a sprinter who had already run under 20 seconds, but he was not yet world class and to be honest, I was keeping an eye on the other sprinters. I beat Usain and got back to the daily routine. Only later did it turn out that the world had never had somebody like him. It turned out I had beaten the legend.\"\n\n*THE DAY BOLT LOST - READ-IT*\n\nJedrusinski finished his career with modest personal bests of 10.26s (100m) and 20.31s (200m), with his gangly 6ft 2in frame prompting calls that his future lied outside sprinting - opinions Bolt demolished when he finally burst onto the mainstream four years later in Beijing.\n\n\"When I saw him, it reminded me of how others treated me when I was a youngster,\" Jedrusinski adds. \"People used to tell me, 'you're too tall, stop wasting your time and focus on a different sport'. But I thought 'he's taller than me and runs under 20 seconds. Why can't I?'\n\n\"Usain looks like a genuine sprinter now, but in 2004 he was like a walking pole: tall and very thin. In my day, we had Shawn Crawford and Maurice Greene. They were not so tall, but were muscular. Then suddenly we got somebody like Usain who denied all of that.\n\nHowever, despite the scalp of a future multiple world champion, Jedrusinski, now back in the army, insists that while it's a wonderful tale, it's not the highlight of his career. \"Even after all these years, I don't find beating Bolt my biggest success,\" he adds. \"It was not the fastest run of my life and I didn't win a medal in Athens. It's simply a funny story. It was my best Olympics, but not because of beating Bolt. But I have downloaded the videos to show my kids in the future...\"\n\nEven the greatest need help. Bolt's absence of invincibility was short-lived, with coach Glen Mills taking him under his wing at the end of 2004. Mills completely revamped his technique and instilled a firm work ethic - and the rest, as they say, is history...\n\n\"In athletics he is the greatest, and outside athletics he is up there with the legends of sport like Pele, Maradona and Muhamad Ali,\" Mo Farah tells Eurosport.\n\nBoil down Usain Bolt's career to the simple process of running and it's initially tough to agree with the assertion. Fourteen minutes and 28.33 seconds - the time Farah would take to plod through an unusually pedestrian 5,000m race - is the total time Bolt has spent on track during individual events at Olympic and World Championship level, dating from Athens 2004 to Rio 2016. Even if you include his relay exploits at a generous 10 seconds per race, Bolt's total input from 62 global heats and finals stretches to just 16 minutes and eight seconds. One sixth of a football match; barely five rounds in the ring.\n\nTrue, Bolt has run sporadically in Diamond League meets, national championships and even the Commonwealth Games, but his brand was built in those 16 minutes - few care what happened in sparsely-attended events in Doha and Kingston.\n\nUnlike the giants of sport mentioned by Farah, though, every single second counted in Bolt's ascent to greatness. Pele's copybook was slightly stained by his inability to win a Golden Boot at the World Cup, as well as suffering injuries in 1962 and 1966; Diego Maradona was engulfed in drug and gun scandals and the 'Hand of God'; Muhammad Ali lost the 'Fight of the Century'. Those low-points were not legacy ending, but Bolt was never afforded the luxury of mini failures. Any mistake, any defeat, in a major final would have bitten at his aura - seven Olympic gold medals and a silver doesn't quite have the same ring to it. It was a full complement of nine Olympic golds before his 2008 relay title was retroactively stripped from him due to Nesta Carter's positive drugs test.\n\nSure, Bolt showed fallibility with his disqualification in Daegu. But even that false start, his only failure in a major final post-2008, helped fuel a myth that the only man who could stop him was himself. With potential gains outweighed tenfold by the damage of defeat, Bolt's consistency under the most intense pressure has rarely been witnessed in sport. Nor has it been more welcome.\n\nBolt was anointed as the saviour of athletics after the turmoil of Athens 2004, a tough gig for anyone, let alone a prankster who was still coming to grips with his generation-defining talent. But bear the responsibility he did, proving a willing distraction to the seemingly ceaseless and damning doping stories sweeping the sport.\n\nEvery tale with a hero also needs a villain. Or villains, as it transpired in athletics, as Bolt's chief rivals Gatlin, Tyson Gay and Asafa Powell became boo boys due to their drug-blotted pasts. It was Bolt's head-to-head with the former that garnered most publicity, with Gatlin only too willing to play the role of Public Enemy No.1. The American's unapologetic stance may have sparked outrage, but it also inadvertently built a platform for Bolt to assert himself as athletics' riposte to cheating. And the Jamaican did exactly that, time and time again.\n\nIn fact, a minor blemish on Bolt's record is that he didn't push the world records further. If only he had squeezed in bonus races in the aftermath of Berlin 2009, praying for the optimal +1.9m/s tailwind, he may have pushed the world record further into uncharted territory: 9.4 seconds for 100m and sub-19 seconds for 200m both felt attainable in his pomp.\n\n* LUCA'S READ-IT ON BOLT'S WORLD RECORDS FROM 2009*\n\nPerhaps it's selfish to want more, but that's the feeling that will spread around the London Stadium when the batons are retired following the men's 4x100m relay, his final event. PT Barnum was credited with coining the phrase, 'always leave them wanting more', and with Bolt the feeling will never be stronger. Athletics is losing its greatest entertainer.\n\nForget the medals and world records. If Bolt's legacy is anything, it's that he transformed a sport from stony-faced stares to cheeky grins - bringing the fans closer than ever. He introduced the concept of the after party, proving that the show can go on long after the race has finished. He's also crushed the notion that champions have to hold an omnipresent focus and be serious 24-7. His startline smile may be infectious, but it's also one of his most brutal weapons. It's message? 'No one can stop me.'\n\nFrom the torso-beating kid to the ruthless-but-aging guardian, Bolt's impact - both on and off the track - has been rivalled by few. Farah is surely right: the Jamaican belongs among sport's greatest figures. After all, who else can boast of a golden career forged from a little over 15 minutes of foundations? And as Bolt prepares to depart the stage for the final time, there's just one more question to answer...\n\nDon't ask. Just don't ask. It's the question athletics doesn't want to answer, and yet after the curtain falls on the World Championships in London, it somehow must. When Bolt and his friend Farah leave the track, an unmistakeable void will have been left in their wake. Bolt as he goes into retirement and Farah as he focuses on marathons. No one is more acutely aware of athletes' responsibilities to interact and engage with the very fans who make them superstars than the latter, who recognises that the after-race shows are as important as the pure running feats before them.\n\n\"We grew up together in the sport so we have known each other for a long time,\" Farah tells Eurosport. \"I have seen the way he interacts with the fans and spends a lot of time signing autographs, taking selfies etc. which is something that we as athletes have a responsibility to do.\"\n\nBolt could not agree more about the value of personality and giving the fans what they want: winning, then performing. In surprisingly blunt terms, Bolt made it abundantly clear to his sprinting heirs what will be demanded of them, in addition to simply running fast.\n\n\"I've said to a few athletes that I know personally, 'You guys need to show your personality, not just performance,\" Bolt said. \"Listen to me, I'm not trying to say you should try and do weird things, but people want to see personality and something different. Hopefully they'll trust me and try to change. I said to de Grasse last season, 'Listen to me, yes you're doing well, but you guys are too quiet. Look at the attention you got because we were having fun.' People were like, 'De Grasse is so cool'.\"\n\nTriple jump world-record holder Jonathan Edwards tells Eurosport there is no debate about Bolt's greatness, both as an athlete and a superstar - and athletics will be left reeling by his departure from the sport.\n\n\"Certainly, he is the greatest ever - I don't think anyone could dispute that,\" concludes Edwards. \"In my view he is, and not just because of his performances but also for what he brings to the sport with his personality. You would have to put him along with the likes of [Cristiano] Ronaldo, [Lionel] Messi, Neymar - the most popular sportsmen in the world. Bolt, by the force of not only his performances but also his personality, is as big of a name as Ronaldo or Messi without any question. Probably the only other athlete who has been in his league was Carl Lewis, at a time when athletics was maybe vying with football as the number one sport. Athletics is very lucky to have him.\"\n\nSo where does this leave athletics, with its most decorated and celebrated star leaving the fray? Edwards adds: \"You do wonder where athletics would be without him - he is a shining light. I don't think there's another Bolt out there, someone who could grab the world's attention in the way that he did, not that I see at the moment - even though there are some very, very talented athletes. Competition is obviously great for sport, but there is something about seeing a dominant champion who is almost superhuman.\"\n\nBolt himself says he thrives on his status as the greatest athlete the world has ever seen. \"It gives me confidence. I have worked hard for all that I have achieved and it is always great to get recognition for my achievements.\"\n\nThere may never be an athlete who achieves such dominance on the track and adoration off it, but maybe that is okay. With the dominant champion, who is almost superhuman, leaving the stage, perhaps it is time for true competition to return to the world's biggest races, for unpredictability to replace the wonder of celebrating a single man's greatness. The fear for athletics, though, is that sport is now more focused on individuals than ever before.\n\nThe criteria has never been greater as athletics shops for its next global superstar. Legendary performances, undisputed greatness and a uniquely unforgettable personality: is that really too much to ask for?", "time": "08:23:00"}

The Jamaican looked rusty in the Heats, blaming the equipment, and the semifinals. But in the finals, he was edged by Justin Gatlin and Christian Coleman of the USA despite Bolt running his season best of 9.96 seconds was not good enough to beat the former Olympic medallist Gatlin who ran 9.92 seconds with young and upcoming star Coleman clocking 9.95 seconds.\n\nThankfully, Bolt could still finish on the up. With the swansong complete in individual races, he has the opportunity to finish on a high with the support of his teammates and by, hopefully, blitzing past the field in the relay race in London at the World Championship. Jamaica recorded a season best time of 37.95 seconds in the 4 X 100 m relay Heats on Saturday and in the finals, Bolt and the rest of the Jamaican team comprising Tyquendo Tracey, Julian Forte and Micheal Campbell will aim to do better than the United States or Great Britain. US team recorded 37.370 seconds (world leading) and will arguably be the top contenders for the gold medal.\n\nUsain Bolt going into the relay events: \"We'll see, we haven't done any baton changes as yet with the guys, but I feel we are ready. I have talked to Julian Forte (100m semi-finalist) a little bit. I haven't really talked to the youngsters so we'll see when it comes to the baton changes, but I'm always excited to run relays and we see what the guys are prepared and ready to do.

I haven't really talked to the youngsters so we'll see when it comes to the baton changes, but I'm always excited to run relays and we see what the guys are prepared and ready to do.\"\n\nWhen is Usain Bolt's last race?\n\nUsain Bolt's final race before he calls time on his career will be for Jamaica in the 4 X 100 metres relay. Other countries vying for a bite of the yellow metal will be United States, Great Britain, Japan, Turkey, France, China and Canada. The final of the relay event in the men's category will be the closing act of the night at 21.50 local time or 02.20 AM (August 13, Sunday morning).\n\nWhere is Usain Bolt's last race?\n\nUsain Bolt's final race will be at the Olympic Stadium in London. The relay race will be the final event of the evening's proceedings at the penultimate day of the Athletics World Championship.\n\nWhat TV channel will air Usain Bolt's last race live?\n\nUsain Bolt's last race will be broadcast live on Star Sports Select 2. The entire programme of the World Athletics Championship is being broadcast on Star Sports Select 2 and Select 2 HD.\n\nWhere to live stream Usain Bolt's final race?\n\nUsain Bolt's last race of his glorious career can be streamed live through the Hotstar App - Star Network's digital media property.\n\nFor all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App\n\nTags: Usain Bolt", "time": "11:55:00"}

Photograph: Matthias Hangst/Getty Images\n\nJustin Gatlin agreed with the complaints of the Jamaican relay team that a long wait before their 4x100m final at the World Championships on Saturday contributed to the injury suffered by Usain Bolt in his last race.\n\nBolt, having been passed the baton by Yohan Blake, was in third behind Great Britain and the United States, who eventually won gold and silver, but pulled up almost 50 metres from the line and fell to the track.\n\nJamaica's team doctor later said that the 30-year-old had suffered a hamstring cramp.\n\nBolt's team mates complained that a 45-minute wait in the call room before the race had hampered their preparations.\n\n\"I think they were holding us too long in the call room,\" Blake told reporters. \"Usain was really cold. In fact Usain said to me 'Yohan, I think this is crazy'. Forty minutes and two medal presentations before our run.\"\n\nGatlin, who beat Bolt to gold in the 100m last Saturday, agreed with the complaints and laid the blame at the television scheduling for the event.\n\n\"I know it's TV magic, and everybody has to be prepared on time to make everything happen for the viewers at home.\n\n\"(But) I personally think that we were held in the stadium a little too long without our clothes on, and there was a little draught in there. I lost all my sweat and body heat,\" Gatlin said.\n\nIMAGE: Usain Bolt is helped up by his Jamaica teammmates Tyquendo Tracey, Julian Forte and Michael Campbell after his injury. Photograph: Matthias Hangst/Getty Images\n\nWhen asked if he thought that contributed to Bolt's injury, the 35-year-old said: \"I believe so.\n\n\"Knowing how Usain performs, he's always ready, he's always making sure he's not injured and it's very rare to see Usain injured when he comes to performances.\"\n\nGatlin ran the second leg for the United States as they finished runners-up behind Britain, who became world champions for the first time.\n\nAmidst the home crowd's jubilation, there was also relief at the sight of Bolt being able to walk off the track after being helped to his feet by his team mates.\n\n\"I'm not sure what the extent of his injury is, but when I saw him go down I thought it was a calf cramp or a hamstring cramp. But he walked off the track, so that's good thing.\n\n\"I hope that he gets well soon,\" Gatlin added.", "time": "05:22:00"}

before their 4x100m final at the World Championships on Saturday contributed to the injury suffered by Usain Bolt in his last race.\n\nBolt, having been passed the baton by Yohan Blake, was in third behind Great Britain and the United States, who eventually won gold and silver, but pulled up almost 50 metres from the line and fell to the track.\n\nJamaica's team doctor later said that the 30-year-old had suffered a hamstring cramp.\n\nBolt's team mates complained that a 45-minute wait in the call room before the race had hampered their preparations.\n\n\"I think they were holding us too long in the call room,\" Blake told reporters. \"Usain was really cold. In fact Usain said to me 'Yohan, I think this is crazy'. Forty minutes and two medal presentations before our run.\"\n\nGatlin, who beat Bolt to gold in the 100m last Saturday, agreed with the complaints and laid the blame at the television scheduling for the event.\n\n\"I know it's TV magic, and everybody has to be prepared on time to make everything happen for the viewers at home.\n\n\"(But) I personally think that we were held in the stadium a little too long without our clothes on, and there was a little draught in there.

But he walked off the track, so that's good thing.\n\n\"I hope that he gets well soon,\" Gatlin added.\n\n(This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)", "time": "01:45:00"}

behind eventual gold medallists Britain and runners-up America.\n\nLess than 50 metres down the track, Bolt suddenly pulled up, clutching his left leg, tumbling to the track with what was later diagnosed as a hamstring cramp.\n\n\"This is farewell time, I am sentimental about it already now,\" said Gatlin, who stormed to 100m gold in London, US teammate Christian Coleman taking silver to relegate Bolt to a disappointing bronze in his individual send-off.\n\n\"In the warm-up area we give ourselves respect and greet each other,\" Gatlin said of Bolt, who bows out of competition with a startling haul of eight Olympic gold medals and 14 world medals, nine of which are gold.\n\nGatlin, who has served two doping bans, put the blame for Bolt's cramp partly at the amount of time the athletes spent on the track before the starter's gun went off.\n\n\"There was a cool breeze out there. But the conditions were the same for everybody,\" said the 35-year-old, who won the 100m at the 2004 Olympics in Athens and the 2005 worlds in Helsinki before serving his second ban between 2006-10 for taking testosterone.\n\n- Chilly conditions unhelpful -\n\n\"I think it was the elements. I am sorry he got this injury. He is still the best in the world.\n\n\"It was a recipe. I don't want to say this but I understand we need to be ready early but I think we took our clothes off a little too early. It's a little chilly in here so I think that's where the cramp came from. That's what he suffered with. He was running out there cold.\"\n\nBut Gatlin, who was roundly booed at the London Stadium before both the 100m and relay, insisted: \"Usain Bolt is a great athlete.\n\n\"You can't let this championships define what he's done in the past. He has done amazing things. He's still the man, you know. The was his farewell race and we wish him the best and hope he recovers soon.\"\n\nReferring to Bolt's mooted future ambassadorial role within athletics' world governing body the IAAF, Gatlin added: \"He's coming back in a couple of years. He'll be ready, he has a passion for the sport.\n\n\"He loves the fans and they love him. He loves the sport too much to walk away. He's a showman.\"\n\nJapan snatched a surprise bronze medal, Kenji Fujimitsu moved to comment: \"Thank you, Bolt.

with Sir Mo Farah getting his silver medal - and the high jump taking place before.\n\nBolt's sudden injury ended his career in sorry style after he planned to retire from the track following the championships, having already won bronze in the 100m last weekend.\n\nAnd Blake, who won Olympic 4x100m relay gold with Bolt and Jamaica in 2012 and 2016, believes the lengthy build-up caused Bolt's injury in London on Saturday night.\n\n\"We keep warming up and waiting, then warming up and waiting. I think it got the better of us.\"\n\n\"I think they were holding us too long in the call room. The walk was too long. Usain was really cold. In fact Usain said to me, 'Yohan, I think this is crazy',\" said the 100m world champion from 2011.\n\n\"It was 40 minutes and two medal presentations before our run. We keep warming up and waiting, then warming up and waiting. I think it got the better of us.\n\n\"We were over warm.

It was crazy.\"\n\nTeam-mate Omar McLeod echoed Blake and criticised the organisation with his heart going out to Bolt.\n\nHe said: \"It's heart-wrenching. I gave it my all and I really wanted Usain to leave golden, or even if it was just a medal, it was really heart-wrenching.\n\n\"I couldn't believe it, I'm in shock, utter disbelief.\n\n\"It was ridiculous, man. We were there around 45 minutes waiting outside, I think they had three medal ceremonies before we went out so we were really trying our hardest to stay warm and keep upbeat.\n\n\"But it was ridiculous. We waited a really long time. I drank like two bottles of water.\"\n\nTeam-mate Julian Forte, running in his first World Championships, added: \"I really wanted to be a part of the team that sends Usain off in style. Unfortunately it's one of those things, it's part of sport.\n\n\"They kept us in the call room for an extremely long time in our running kits, and it's not the warmest over here and they had us around there for quite a while, so I think they really need to look into that and do something about it.\n\n\"We were excited, we were ready, we had been doing some hand offs and everybody was feeling good, but they kept us hanging around for a long time, you know. So it's just really crazy.\"\n\nThe last three weeks have been hard for him, you know. We hope for the best for him.\"\n\nDr Kevin Jones, Jamaica's team doctor, confirmed Bolt's injury.\n\nHe said: \"It's cramp in his left hamstring but a lot of pain is from disappointment from losing the race. The last three weeks have been hard for him, you know. We hope for the best for him.\"\n\nThe USA's 100m champion, Justin Gatlin, had sympathy for Bolt and still expects him to return to the track, with the pair even having a bet.\n\nHe said: \"You can't really have this night or championship define what he's done in the past. From 2008 on, Usain Bolt has done amazing things. Tonight is not going to define who he is. He is still the man.\n\n\"This is a farewell tour, we take our hats off to him and we hope he gets better.\n\n\"I'm going to win my 100, he's coming back in a year or two. He'll be ready. He has a passion for the sport, he loves the fans, the fans love him. It's something you can't walk away too easy from.\"", "time": "10:16:00"}

race of his career, led Jamaica safely through their semifinal in the 4x100 metres relay at the IAAF\u2009World Athletics Championships on Saturday while United States ran the fastest time of the year.\n\nBolt, who announced on Monday that he would also run in the heats, will race for the last time in the final on Saturday when he hopes to bow out with his 20th global championship title.\n\nRunning the last leg, Bolt eased home, looking over his shoulder, as Jamaica won the second of the two semi-final heats in 37.95 seconds, ahead of France (38.03) and China (38.20).\n\nJamaica are aiming for a fifth successive world title in the event but will face a stiff challenge from the US who won the first heat in 37.70 seconds, with Christian Coleman, silver medallist in the 100 metres, running the anchor leg.\n\n\"It feels like second nature because we work well together. We are confident we can win. We will go and prepare well for tonight,\" said Michael Rogers, who ran the first leg for the United States.\n\nBritain were second in the first heat in 37.76, also faster than Jamaica's time, while Japan were third. Canada and Turkey also qualified as the fastest losers.\n\nBolt's presence ensured a capacity crowd for the morning session. \"It's hard to be sad because of the energy I'm getting from the crowd,\" said the Jamaican, who suffered a rare defeat in the 100 metres when he took bronze.", "time": "12:34:00"}

beaten in the 100m in London 2017 by Americans Justin Gatlin and Christian Coleman\n\n3 - the number of Olympic treble sprint doubles, in Beijing 2008, London 2012 and Rio 2016.

"body": "Related Story: Bolt shocked in 100m swansong as Gatlin takes out world title\n\nUsain Bolt's final appearance on the track ended in agony as he pulled up injured running the final leg of the 4x100 metres relay at the World Championships in London.\n\nBolt, who had to settle for bronze in the individual 100 metres, had been hoping to sign off from the sport by leading Jamaica to a fifth successive relay gold, but they were struggling in third place when he collected the baton.\n\nAs he tried to gain ground, Bolt pulled up and fell to the floor with what looked like a hamstring injury.\n\nThe 60,000 in the stadium who had come to farewell sport's greatest showman had only a split second to absorb what was happening as up ahead a new chapter was being written.\n\n\"It's a cramp in his left hamstring, but a lot of the pain is from disappointment from losing the race,\" Jamaican team doctor Kevin Jones said.\n\n\"The last three weeks have been hard for him, you know. We hope for the best for him.\"\n\nThe US, with individual gold and silver medallists Justin Gatlin and Christian Coleman running the second and fourth legs, had been expected to push the Jamaicans all the way but they were always trailing the slick Great Britain team.\n\nThe brilliantly executed race by Chijindu Ujah, Adam Gemili, Danny Talbot and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake gave Britain gold in 37.47 seconds, breaking an 18-year-old national record, and the world title for the first time.\n\nThe US had to settle for silver.\n\n\"I wasn't sure if I had won or not, I gave it my all but I could see Christian Coleman out of the corner of my eye,\" said Mitchell-Blake.\n\n\"The feeling of euphoria was from infinity. I can't register it. We smashed the British record to pieces.\"\n\nBritain's only other men's global sprint relay golds came in the 1912 and 2004 Olympics.\n\nIt completed a great night for the host nation's sprinters after their women had earlier taken silver behind the Americans in the sprint relay, their best performance since the first championships in 1983.\n\nThe US men took silver in 37.52 but for a nation that used to be totally dominant in the event, it was only their second medal in the last eight global finals after a series of world championship and Olympic disqualifications. Japan took advantage of Jamaica's travails to take third in 38.04.", "time": "22:42:00"}

Justin Gatlin agreed with the complaints of the Jamaican relay team that a long wait before their 4x100m final at the World Championships on Saturday contributed to the injury suffered by Usain Bolt in his last race.\n\nBolt, having been passed the baton by Yohan Blake, was in third behind Great Britain and the United States, who eventually won gold and silver, but pulled up almost 50 metres from the line and fell to the track.\n\nJamaica's team doctor later said that the 30-year-old had suffered a hamstring cramp.\n\nBolt's team mates complained that a 45-minute wait in the call room before the race had hampered their preparations.\n\n\"I think they were holding us too long in the call room,\" Blake told reporters. \"Usain was really cold. In fact Usain said to me 'Yohan, I think this is crazy\u00b4. Forty minutes and two medal presentations before our run.\"\n\nGatlin, who beat Bolt to gold in the 100m last Saturday, agreed with the complaints and laid the blame at the television scheduling for the event.\n\n\"I know it\u00b4s TV magic, and everybody has to be prepared on time to make everything happen for the viewers at home.\n\n\"(But) I personally think that we were held in the stadium a little too long without our clothes on, and there was a little draught in there. I lost all my sweat and body heat,\" Gatlin said.\n\nWhen asked if he thought that contributed to Bolt's injury, the 35-year-old said: \"I believe so.\n\n\"Knowing how Usain performs, he\u00b4s always ready, he\u00b4s always making sure he\u00b4s not injured and it\u00b4s very rare to see Usain injured when he comes to performances.\"\n\nGatlin ran the second leg for the United States as they finished runners-up behind Britain, who became world champions for the first time.\n\nAmidst the home crowd's jubilation, there was also relief at the sight of Bolt being able to walk off the track after being helped to his feet by his team mates.\n\n\"I\u00b4m not sure what the extent of his injury is, but when I saw him go down I thought it was a calf cramp or a hamstring cramp. But he walked off the track, so that\u00b4s good thing.\n\n\"I hope that he gets well soon,\" Gatlin added. (Editing by Peter Rutherford; )", "time": "01:49:00"}

The walk was too long. Usain was really cold. In fact Usain said to me, 'Yohan, I think this is crazy. 40 minutes and two medal presentations before our run',\" said Yohan Blake, who branded the wait as \"crazy\".\n\n\"We kept warming up and waiting, then warming up and waiting,\" added the 2011 100m world champion, who also won Olympic relay gold in 2012 and 2016 with Bolt.\n\n\"I think it got the better of us. We were over warm.\n\n\"To see a true legend, a true champion go out there and struggling like that.\n\n\"The race was 10 minutes late and we were kept 40 minutes.\"\n\nBolt may not have led Jamaica to a glorious finale anyway, though, as he took the baton well behind eventual winners Great Britain and the US.\n\nBut Jamaica's 110m hurdles world champion Omar McLeod -- who ran the first leg -- likewise pointed the finger at organisers for denying his country's greatest star a more fitting swansong.\n\n\"It's heart wrenching,\" said McLeod, who is also the Olympic champion.\n\n\"It was ridiculous man, we were there around 45 minutes waiting outside, I think they had three medal ceremonies before we went out so we were really trying our hardest to stay warm and keep upbeat.\n\n\"But it was ridiculous. We waited a really long time. I drank like two bottles of water.\"\n\nTheir criticism echoed that of Justin Gatlin, who led an American 1-2 alongside team-mate Christian Coleman to deny Bolt a farewell gold in the individual 100m.\n\n\"I think it was the elements. I am sorry he got this injury. He is still the best in the world,\" said Gatlin.\n\n\"It was a recipe. I don't want to say this, I understand we need to be ready early, but I think we took our clothes off a little too early.\n\n\"It's a little chilly in here so I think that's where the cramp came from. That's what he suffered with. He was running out there cold.\"\n\nDespite his relatively unsuccessful championships -- in which he will exit with just a single bronze medal -- Bolt will still be accorded a final lap of honour in a tribute ceremony before the curtain comes down on the world championships later on Sunday.", "time": "10:19:00"}

But it can happen to the best as well. That is exactly what the world witnessed at the IAAF World Championships in London on Saturday. The loudest cheer was reserved for the last race of the world's fastest man on planet till date, Usain Bolt. The event was Usain Bolt's favored 4\u00d7100-meter men's relay, where Jamaica was starting as outright favourites. They had star runners in their lineups like Yohan Blake, Omar McLeod and Julian Forte.\n\nDue to a lapse from Jamaica, the dark horse Brits went on to win the title.\n\nUsain Bolt, having run a whopping 23 championship races since 2008, this was only the fourth time Bolt failed to win, the first time due to injury, that goes on to show the fitness levels he maintained for this period. Previously, he didn't win because of a false start, a disqualification after the fact due to a teammate's failed doping test, and last Saturday, because of an uncharacteristic performance - Bolt came in third in the 100-meter final.\n\nBolt is not someone the world is used to see losing, but age gets to even the best of them.\n\nBolt finishes his career with a staggering 14 career medals in the world championships, 11 of them gold, and with eight Olympic gold medals. These are achievements even a continent put together in Olympics fails to achieve, that shows the stature of the Jamaican.\n\nBut there was no final flourish for a man who has been not only one of global sport's great athletes, but one of its great entertainers as well.", "time": "03:26:00"}

was the fault of world championship organisers, his furious teammates claimed.\n\nThe 30-year-old 100 metres and 200m world record-holder collapsed on the London Stadium track whilst anchoring Jamaica in the final of the 4x100m on Saturday (Aug 12) as cramp gripped his leg.\n\nBolt lay prone on the track but waved away the offer of a wheelchair and eventually, aided by his three teammates, limped across the line before making a hasty exit - not the way the man who had won triple Olympic gold at the same stadium in 2012 would have wished his competitive career in championships to finish.\n\nBut his teammates complained that his problem was caused by organisers keeping the relay teams waiting in the cold before their race as several medal ceremonies were held.\n\n\"I think they were holding us too long in the call room. The walk was too long. Usain was really cold. In fact Usain said to me, 'Yohan, I think this is crazy. 40 minutes and two medal presentations before our run',\" said Yohan Blake, who branded the wait as \"crazy\".\n\n\"We kept warming up and waiting, then warming up and waiting,\" added the 2011 100m world champion, who also won Olympic relay gold in 2012 and 2016 with Bolt.\n\n\"I think it got the better of us. We were over warm.\n\n\"To see a true legend, a true champion go out there and struggling like that.\n\n\"The race was 10 minutes late and we were kept 40 minutes.\"\n\nBolt may not have led Jamaica to a glorious finale anyway, though, as he took the baton well behind eventual winners Great Britain and the US.\n\nBut Jamaica's 110m hurdles world champion Omar McLeod - who ran the first leg - likewise pointed the finger at organisers for denying his country's greatest star a more fitting swansong.\n\n\"It's heart wrenching,\" said McLeod, who is also the Olympic champion.\n\n\"It was ridiculous man, we were there around 45 minutes waiting outside, I think they had three medal ceremonies before we went out so we were really trying our hardest to stay warm and keep upbeat.\n\n\"But it was ridiculous. We waited a really long time. I drank like two bottles of water.\"\n\nTheir criticism echoed that of Justin Gatlin, who led an American 1-2 alongside teammate Christian Coleman to deny Bolt a farewell gold in the individual 100m.\n\n\"I think it was the elements. I am sorry he got this injury. He is still the best in the world,\" said Gatlin.\n\n\"It was a recipe. I don't want to say this, I understand we need to be ready early, but I think we took our clothes off a little too early.\n\n\"It's a little chilly in here so I think that's where the cramp came from. That's what he suffered with. He was running out there cold.\"\n\nDespite his relatively unsuccessful championships - in which he will exit with just a single bronze medal - Bolt will still be accorded a final lap of honour in a tribute ceremony before the curtain comes down on the world championships later on Sunday.", "time": "11:14:00"}

will exit with just a single bronze medal -- Bolt will still be accorded a final lap of honour in a tribute ceremony before the curtain comes down on the world championships later on Sunday.\n\nUsain Bolt's dramatic and inglorious end to his top level career was the fault of world championship organisers, his furious team-mates claimed.\n\nThe 30-year-old 100 metres and 200m world record-holder collapsed on the London Stadium track whilst anchoring Jamaica in the final of the 4x100m on Saturday as cramp gripped his leg.\n\nBolt lay prone on the track but waved away the offer of a wheelchair and eventually, aided by his three team-mates, limped across the line before making a hasty exit -- not the way the man who had won triple Olympic gold at the same stadium in 2012 would have wished his competitive career in championships to finish.\n\nBut his team-mates complained that his problem was caused by organisers keeping the relay teams waiting in the cold before their race as several medal ceremonies were held.\n\n\"I think they were holding us too long in the call room. The walk was too long. Usain was really cold. In fact Usain said to me, 'Yohan, I think this is crazy. 40 minutes and two medal presentations before our run',\" said Yohan Blake, who branded the wait as \"crazy\".\n\n\"We kept warming up and waiting, then warming up and waiting,\" added the 2011 100m world champion, who also won Olympic relay gold in 2012 and 2016 with Bolt.\n\n\"I think it got the better of us. We were over warm.\n\n\"To see a true legend, a true champion go out there and struggling like that.\n\n\"The race was 10 minutes late and we were kept 40 minutes.\"\n\nBolt may not have led Jamaica to a glorious finale anyway, though, as he took the baton well behind eventual winners Great Britain and the US.\n\nBut Jamaica's 110m hurdles world champion Omar McLeod -- who ran the first leg -- likewise pointed the finger at organisers for denying his country's greatest star a more fitting swansong.\n\n\"It's heart wrenching,\" said McLeod, who is also the Olympic champion.\n\n\"It was ridiculous man, we were there around 45 minutes waiting outside, I think they had three medal ceremonies before we went out so we were really trying our hardest to stay warm and keep upbeat.\n\n\"But it was ridiculous. We waited a really long time. I drank like two bottles of water.\"\n\nTheir criticism echoed that of Justin Gatlin, who led an American 1-2 alongside team-mate Christian Coleman to deny Bolt a farewell gold in the individual 100m.\n\n\"I think it was the elements. I am sorry he got this injury. He is still the best in the world,\" said Gatlin.\n\n\"It was a recipe. I don't want to say this, I understand we need to be ready early, but I think we took our clothes off a little too early.\n\n\"It's a little chilly in here so I think that's where the cramp came from. That's what he suffered with. He was running out there cold.\"\n\nDespite his relatively unsuccessful championships -- in which he will exit with just a single bronze medal -- Bolt will still be accorded a final lap of honour in a tribute ceremony before the curtain comes down on the world championships later on Sunday.", "time": "11:06:00"}

settle for second place in the 5,000 metres and Usain Bolt pulled up injured during the final leg of the men's 4 x 100-metre relay at the IAAF World Championships.\n\nFarah claimed gold in the 10,000 metres earlier in the week, but competing in the last major track race of his illustrious career Mo was denied the double that he has become so accustom to winning on the biggest stages by Ethiopia's Muktar Edris.\n\nBritain may have missed out on an expected gold in the 5,000m, but they rather surprisingly claimed another later in the evening as Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake beat Christian Coleman of the United States to the line to end a rousing 4 x 100m relay final. The big story of the event, however, was Bolt's sad farewell.\n\nLike Farah, the great sprinter was competing in his last major race. He had been left disappointed by a rare bronze in the individual event but this was his chance to bow out with one final gold. Unfortunately, Bolt pulled up with what appeared to be a hamstring injury shortly after he was handed the baton on the anchor leg of the race.\n\nThe sight of Bolt lying on the track amidst the chaos was a sad one.\n\nAfter the race, Bolt's Jamaican teammates laid the blame for the great sprinter's untimely injury at the feet of the championships' organisers, who they claim forced the runners to wait for forty minutes in a cold call room prior to the race.\n\n\"They were holding us too long in the call room,\" Yohan Blake told the media. \"Usain was really cold. In fact Usain said to me: 'Yohan, I think this is crazy. Forty minutes and two medal presentations before our run.'\n\n\"We keep warming up and waiting, then warming up and waiting. Then we saw a true legend, a true champion go out there and struggling like that(via The Guardian).\"\n\n\"It's heart-wrenching, I gave it my all and I really wanted Usain to leave golden - even if it was just a medal,\" added 23-year-old Omar McLeod. \"It was really heart-wrenching. I couldn't believe it, I'm in shock, utter disbelief.\n\n\"It was ridiculous. We were there around 45 minutes waiting outside, I think they had three medal ceremonies before we went out so we were really trying our hardest to stay warm and keep upbeat. But it was ridiculous. We waited a really long time.\"\n\nAs the days, week and months pass, however, so will the memory of this sad farewell. Bolt had already secured his legacy as one of the great track and field athletes of all time - if not the greatest - long before the London championships, with an astounding haul of major medals that included eleven world golds and eight at the Olympic games, as well a host world-record-breaking runs.", "time": "07:28:00"}

Just days after winning the 100m in a then-world record 9.69sec, the Jamaican won over legions of new fans by sprinting to victory in 19.30sec, beating American Michael Johnson's long-standing world record. \"I worked so hard to become champion and I will work harder to stay at the top,\" Bolt said.\n\nAug 16, 2009. Berlin 100m\n\nAfter overcoming a false start in the semifinal, Bolt delivered his best-ever performance in the 100m. Covering the first 60 metres in an unprecedented 6.31 seconds, Bolt did not ease up and in 41 strides streaked through the finish line in an amazing world record of 9.58sec, a mark that will likely be unchallenged for many years to come. He followed that up by bettering his 200m to 19.19sec just days later. \"For me, anything is possible,\" Bolt said.\n\nAug 28, 2011. 100m Daegu\n\nThe defining moment of the world championships in South Korea was a false start by Bolt, gifting the 100m title to teammate Yohan Blake. The non-result is Bolt's sole hiccup on the world stage. \"Looking for tears?\" Bolt asked. \"Not going to happen, I'm okay.\"\n\nAug 14, 2016. 100m Rio de Janeiro\n\nAfter winning two more world golds in the blue riband event, Bolt raced through to an unprecedented treble of three consecutive Olympic 100m golds, an astonishing achievement in an event where injury often puts pay to a long string of victories. After winning the opening 100m in Rio, Bolt said: \"Somebody said I can become immortal. Two more medals to go and I can sign off. Immortal.\" Needless to say, he bagged two more golds.\n\nAug 5, 2017. 100m London\n\nBolt opted to compete solely in the 100m at the London worlds in his swansong season. But the dream of a fourth title was broken by American arch rival Justin Gatlin, who has served two bans for doping. Gatlin's teammate Christian Coleman snatched silver, with Bolt taking bronze.\n\nBut it was Bolt who was received like a hero at the London Stadium while Gatlin was roundly booed and jeered. \"It's not the perfect script,\" admitted IAAF president Sebastian Coe. Bolt was incredibly gracious in defeat, which saw Gatlin bow down on one knee before him after the race. \"The first thing he did was congratulate me and say that I didn't deserve the boos. He is an inspiration,\" Gatlin said of Bolt.", "time": "20:24:00"}

We hope for the best for him.\"\n\nThe organisers brought on a wheelchair but Bolt shrugged them aside and he limped across the line, grimacing.\n\nJamaica's 110m hurdles champion Omar McLeod and relay team-mate said nothing had changed with regard to the reputation of Bolt. \"Usain Bolt's name will always live on,\" he said.\n\nBriton Mo Farah, who had won the first of his four global double doubles of 5,000m and 10,000m to deafening cheers in London in 2012, put up a spirited and courageous effort but for the first time in six years of global championship competition, he had to settle for silver behind Muktar Edris of Ethiopia.\n\nFarah, who started the championships in grand style by winning the 10,000m, had been left by Edris as the bell went and as hard as he tried he just didn't quite have the legs to pass his younger rival in the finishing straight.\n\n\"It's been amazing. It's been a long journey but it's been incredible,\" said Farah who was embraced by his fans as he made his way around the stadium on a lap of honour, stopping to sign autographs and pose for 'selfies'.\n\nAnd here's how the Internet reacted:\n\nUsain Bolt and Mo Farah two of the worlds greatest heroes You both have given the world so much pleasure and inspired the children of today pic.twitter.com/AD6WGNYlxm -- Pravin Chavda (@ChavdaTororo)\n\nAugust 12, 2017\n\nHey Usain Bolt and Mo Farah you guys should do an exhibition 600m race after the meet, we'd all appreciate it. -- Patrick Casey (@patkc13)\n\nAugust 12, 2017\n\nBe so grateful we have witnessed the career of Usain Bolt and Mo Farah.

running the relays.\n\nThe Jamaican bowed from his 100-metre career during the week falling to shock third place behind Justin Gatlin and Christian Coleman. \"I enjoy relays more than anything\".\n\nFor the best part of the past decade, though, Bolt has been 100 percent reliable in getting relay gold for the island nation.\n\nIt was the first time Bolt had lost a World Championships 100m final he had started, having been disqualified for a false start in Daegu in 2011.\n\nAmerican sprinter, Justin Gatlin, has accused the media of sensationalizing his rivalry with 8-time Olympic champion, Usain Bolt. Subsequently, Thompson has patently been the pre-eminent sprint figure on the women's circuit, including running 10.71, the world's fastest women's 100 this year, at the Jamaican national championships in late June. And the result in the relay is no longer a foregone conclusion.\n\n\"My team did a great job\", said Gatlin, the oldest of the squad at 35. \"I did 18 years of track and field and I've been retired five years, and they're still talking about me, so I guess I still have it\".\n\nChristian Coleman took silver in the 100 ahead of Bolt and it gave the U.S. team an added boost.\n\nThe Elaine Thompson-led Jamaica, Germany and Trinidad and Tobago are among the favourites to advance from the second heat.\n\nBolt anchored the quartet to victory in 37.95 seconds in their heat at London Stadium. For he is just one of a suspicious number of Bolt's Jamaican teammates who, like Gatlin, have returned to competition after testing positive for PEDs.\n\n\"They came out here and did the job we wanted them to do, and that's to get us to the finals\".\n\nSpectators again jeered once it was clear that the 2004 Olympic champion had won gold and ruined Bolt's farewell. \"Over the years, this will be the team bringing in the golds\". Jamaica's team missed out on the final.\n\nThe 27-year-old clocked 13 minute 35.69 second, almost one second better than his earlier personal best of 13:36.62, in the first round heat number one which earned him a 15th spot in a top class field, featuring defending champion Mo Farah from Great Britain. It's also probably easier now than ever to get caught consuming them.\n\nJamaica, Germany, Italy and Ukraine are the main candidates for the top spots in Heat 2.\n\nThe Caribbean's medal count at the IAAF World Championship yesterday ticked to six with two bronze wins by two Caribbean athletes yesterday, August 10, 2017.\n\nFelix has won 14 medals at the world championships and can move up to 16 if she runs the 4\u00d7400 relay and the United States wins medals in both events. His 9.85-second run was the third fastest in Olympic history.", "time": "19:24:00"}

Love what you do, and don't be afraid to have fun along the way\n\nThe way Bolt enjoyed running, he made it look effortless.\n\nIt was as much part of his appeal as the fun moments he gave fans.\n\nNo celebration is complete without the 'Bolt' pose, which he debuted at the Beijing Olympics in 2008.\n\nEven then US President Barack Obama tried it. Such is Bolt's charisma.\n\n2. Be gracious in defeat\n\nAt the world stage we haven't seen Bolt lose. But when he did, he was gracious.\n\nThe stage was set for Bolt to exit with a truimphant swansong, but Justin Gatlin spoilt his party.\n\nAnd Bolt was the first to congratulate his dope tainted competitor.\n\n3. It's never about how you start, but how you finish\n\nThat's how he ran his 100m races.\n\nHis reaction time wasn't great, and hence always a stumbling block, but he always finished ahead.\n\nHe made sure to recover and finish the race in style.\n\nEvery time.\n\n4. Have crazy goals, have realistic goals\n\nCrazy and realistic rarely go hand-in-hand, but Bolt had the audacity to pair them up.\n\nHe declared before the Rio Olympics that he would bow out as the greatest athlete.\n\nMany questioned his fitness, but Bolt proved to be a man of his word.\n\nHe completed a rare double -- won both the 100m and 200m -- and was the first to seal the triple-triple (three gold medals in a row across three different Olympic track events)!\n\n5. Consistent isn't boring\n\nThe Jamaican is a champion of consistency.\n\nBolt had not lost in a decade apart from his last 100m race.\n\n6. Know when to peak\n\nCometh the hour, cometh the man!\n\nBolt is a big game man. He knows when to perform.\n\nHe gave an on-field lesson to Canada's Andre De Grasse during the Rio Olympics semi-finals.\n\nWhen Bolt started slowing down at the finish line, De Grasse ran full speed.\n\nBolt wagged his finger at De Grasse hinting it is not the final.\n\nBolt, however, was not happy about being pushed, reportedly saying after the race, 'I don't know why he did that. You don't need to run that fast.'\n\nNeedless to say, Bolt raced ahead in the final.\n\n7. Retain your sense of humour\n\nBolt was celebrating his 200m gold with the crowd in Beijing in 2015 when an overzealous cameraman lost control of his segway and swept the Jamaican off his feet.\n\nThe incident looked nasty at the time, but Bolt got up and laughed it off.\n\nAt his press conference after the race, he jokingly blamed it all on Justin Gatlin.\n\n'The rumour I'm trying to start right now is that Justin Gatlin paid him off.'\n\nAnd Gatlin quipped, 'I want my money back.'\n\nWork hard, party harder: The unbelievably fabulous life of Usain Bolt!", "time": "04:00:00"}

double - Usain Bolt pulling up injured in what was his last ever race on the track, while Great Britain won the gold medal - only their second of these World Championships.\n\nThey say anything can happen in the 4x100m relay but truth is no one expected this: Bolt looked certain to add a medal of some colour to his already 11 World Championship gold medals won over the last decade, two silvers, and not forgetting the bronze medal won in the 100m final last weekend.\n\nNot forgetting his eight Olympic gold medals either.\n\nInstead Bolt ended up flat on the track, pulling up with that appeared to be a hamstring injury about halfway down the anchor leg.\n\nTruth is the British were already well clear, winning gold in 37.47, the fastest in the world this year, ahead of the USA's 37.52, with Japan in third in 38.04, a season best.\n\nBritain's gold came from a brilliant lead off from Chijindu Ujah, who passed off to Adam Gemili; another perfect pass from Daniel Talbot to Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake on the anchor leg and gold was theirs.\n\nMore booing too for 100m gold medal winner Justin Gatlin on his entry, who ran the second leg with the American team along with Mike Rodgers, Jaylen Bacon and Christian Coleman, who won the individual gold.\n\nThe carnival atmosphere continued in London's Olympic Stadium despite Bolt's collapse to the track even though the Jamaican team of Omar McLeod, Julian Forte, Yohan Blake and then Bolt never made it across the line.\n\nJamaica had only qualified in 37.95 seconds, slower than Great Britain and the USA from the first heat - but had been expected to challenge for the podium in Saturday evening's final - Bolt's last race of his career.\n\nDefinitely not the farewell he or anyone else was expecting.\n\nEarlier, the British 4x100m relay women won silver, only the third medal for the hosts after the gold and silver of Mo Farah; their squad of Asha Philip, Desiree Henry, Dina Asher-Smith, and Daryll Neita finished second to the USA, who clocked 41.81 to Britain's 42.12 - with the Jamaicans run down by both of those in third. However there was an appeal Britain had run out of their lane, which was still being heard.", "time": "21:56:00"}

pulled off a stunning win in the sprint relay\n\nGreat Britain's men's 4x100 metres relay team claimed a stunning gold medal amid chaotic scenes at the World Championships in London as Usain Bolt's glorious career ended in injury and agony.\n\nThe British quartet of CJ Ujah, Adam Gemili, Danny Talbot and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake pipped the United States to gold in a world-leading 37.47 seconds, but only after Bolt had pulled up on his anchor leg and collapsed to the track.\n\nThe USA took silver in 37.52secs and Japan the bronze.\n\n\"This is the best feeling in the world, world champions,\" said Gemili, overlooked for individual selection for the championships.\n\nMitchell-Blake, who had to settle for fourth in the individual 200m, roared with delight at the finish in scenes similar to Mark Lewis-Francis' cries of delight when he crossed the line at the 2004 Athens Olympics to earn Britain sprint relay gold.\n\nThe tale since then for Britain has been one of missed chances and baton blunders. But no more, and the joy amongst the team was evident at the finish.\n\n\"We're world champions, world champions,\" Mitchell-Blake said through tears of happiness.\n\nWhile Britain celebrated, though, there were contrasting emotions for Bolt in the final race of his career.\n\nThe 30-year-old pulled up on the home straight as he sought to chase down the United States and Britain, hobbling for a few strides before falling to the track.\n\nHis team-mates gathered round him and the 19-time global champion was helped to his feet and limped over the line, applauding the crowd as he did so.\n\nIt was a sad way for Bolt to bring the curtain down on the greatest athletics career the world has ever seen, a man who has dominated, delighted and delivered ever since his record-breaking runs and gold medals at the 2008 Olympics.\n\nA golden farewell was what he deserved.\n\nBut last weekend, when Bolt had to settle for 100m bronze and drug cheat Justin Gatlin took his title, was proof enough that sport does not do fairy tales, not even for Bolt.\n\nAs if we needed any further indication that Bolt was special, he is due to perform one final lap of honour round the London Stadium on Sunday night.\n\nAs well as his 100m and 200m world records, he also surely holds the one for most laps of honour performed too.\n\nBut, after four successive sprint relay golds at the World Championships, Jamaica's reign is over.\n\nBritain's winning time, a combination of Ujah's perfect reactions, flawless changeovers and a superbly-timed dip from Mitchell-Blake to cross the line ahead of 100m silver medallist Christian Coleman, was a new national record, erasing the 18-year-old mark of 37.73.\n\n\"An amazing and outstanding performance from that British team,\" Michael Johnson said on BBC Sport.\n\n\"They beat everyone fair and square.\n\n\"They delivered on a night when everyone was here - not necessarily to see this.\n\n\"Adam Gemili was just ridiculous down the back stretch. He opened up a gap that was always going to be hard for anyone to chase down.\"", "time": "22:44:00"}

injury dramatically ruined his farewell in the 4x100 metres relay final in London on Saturday.\n\nBolt looked set to head into retirement with a record-equalling 15th IAAF World Championships medal but pulled up with an apparent hamstring injury and failed to finish the final leg of the race.\n\nGreat Britain snatched the gold medal from the United States as the 30-year-old lay prone on the track, Christian Coleman beaten to the line by Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake.\n\nGatlin, who beat Coleman and Bolt to 100m gold last weekend, has previously expressed his opinion that his long-time rival will return to the sport in the future and reiterated those thoughts following an unbecoming farewell for the eight-time Olympic champion.\n\n\"He's coming back in a year or two, he'll be ready. He has a passion for the sport, the fans love him, it's something you just can't walk away from that easy,\" said Gatlin.\n\n\"He's a showman, he wants to come out and I think he'll do a great job if he comes back to track and field. We've got a lot of young guys like Coleman, like [Jaylen] Bacon, myself, we're hungry to go out there for good competition.\"\n\nNot the way you want to see a legend like end his #IAAFWorlds career. Heal soon, @usainbolt. -- USATF (@usatf)\n\nAugust 12, 2017\n\nRegardless of whether he returns to the track, Bolt is sure to be remembered as an all-time great - having secured 100m and 200m doubles at three successive Olympic Games as well as setting new world records in each event.\n\n\"You can't really have this night define what he's done in the past,\" Gatlin added. \"From 2008 on, Usain Bolt has done amazing things and tonight is not going to define who he is.\n\n\"He's still the man, and this is farewell so we take our hat off to him, hope he gets well soon.\"\n\nGatlin was one of many competitors who suggested a lengthy wait ahead of Saturday's relay may have contributed to Bolt's injury.\n\n\"We were in the stadium for a while, you guys know how chilly it is down here,\" he said. \"We had a cool breeze in the back and I think with that a lot of our muscles were cramping up from having our clothes off a little too early.\n\n\"Hopefully it's just a cramp and it'll go away, but I hope he doesn't dwell on it.\"", "time": "20:36:00"}

2017 11:50 am Justin Gatlin, who beat Bolt to gold in the 100m last Saturday, agreed with the complaints and laid the blame at the television scheduling for the event.

See photosDisney CEO sees a future without Netflix, Comcast or DirecTV\n\nJustin Gatlin agreed with the complaints of the Jamaican relay team that a long wait before their 4x100m final at the World Championships on Saturday contributed to the injury suffered by Usain Bolt in his last race.\n\nBolt, having been passed the baton by Yohan Blake, was in third behind Great Britain and the United States, who eventually won gold and silver, but pulled up almost 50 metres from the line and fell to the track.\n\nJamaica's team doctor later said that the 30-year-old had suffered a hamstring cramp.\n\nBolt's team mates complained that a 45-minute wait in the call room before the race had hampered their preparations.\n\n\"I think they were holding us too long in the call room,\" Blake told reporters. \"Usain was really cold. In fact Usain said to me 'Yohan, I think this is crazy'. Forty minutes and two medal presentations before our run.\"\n\nGatlin, who beat Bolt to gold in the 100m last Saturday, agreed with the complaints and laid the blame at the television scheduling for the event.\n\n\"I know it's TV magic, and everybody has to be prepared on time to make everything happen for the viewers at home. \"(But) I personally think that we were held in the stadium a little too long without our clothes on, and there was a little draught in there. I lost all my sweat and body heat,\" Gatlin said.\n\nWhen asked if he thought that contributed to Bolt's injury, the 35-year-old said: \"I believe so.\n\n\"Knowing how Usain performs, he's always ready, he's always making sure he's not injured and it's very rare to see Usain injured when he comes to performances.\"\n\nGatlin ran the second leg for the United States as they finished runners-up behind Britain, who became world champions for the first time.\n\nAmidst the home crowd's jubilation, there was also relief at the sight of Bolt being able to walk off the track after being helped to his feet by his team mates.\n\n\"I'm not sure what the extent of his injury is, but when I saw him go down I thought it was a calf cramp or a hamstring cramp. But he walked off the track, so that's good thing. \"I hope that he gets well soon,\" Gatlin added.\n\nFor all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App", "time": "06:29:00"}

the greatest sprinter ever, suffered a hamstring injury, in the concluding race of his career, while on the anchor leg of the 4X100m race at the World Athletics championships in London.\n\nTHEWILL recalls that Bolt, who was hoping to ride off into the sunset with a successful showing at this year's world championships in London, met an unexpected anti-climax when he finished in third place at last week's 100-meter dash final as Justin Gatlin beat him to the title.\n\nOn Saturday, Bolt, 33-year-old, was unable to finish the 4\u00d7100 relay final for his country making it an agonizing end for the former world champion, who has set world records in the 100m and 200m sprints and taken home an astonishing eight Olympic gold medals, 11 World Championship gold medals, with two silver and a bronze medals.\n\nBolt pulled up with an apparent cramp to his left hamstring, limped for a few moments before falling to a heap on the track. His fellow teammates came to his assistance and Bolt eventually was able to get back on his feet and limp off the track.\n\nHe was later assisted by his team-mates to cross the finish line, applauding the crowd as he did so.\n\nThe host country, Great Britain, in a brilliantly executed race by Chijindu Ujah, Adam Gemili, Danny Talbot and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake, finished first in 37.47 seconds, followed by the United States (37.52) and Japan (38.04).\n\n\"It's a cramp in his left hamstring, but a lot of the pain is from disappointment from losing the race,\" Jamaican team doctor Kevin Jones said.\n\n\"The last three weeks have been hard for him, you know. We hope for the best for him.\"", "time": "06:34:00"}

Usain Bolt's final appearance on the track ended in agony on Saturday as he pulled up injured running the final leg of the World Championships 4x100 metres relay as Britain beat the United States for a shock gold medal.\n\nBolt, who had to settle for bronze in the individual 100 metres, had been hoping to sign off from the sport by leading Jamaica to a fifth successive relay gold but they were already struggling in third when he collected the baton.\n\nAs he tried to gain ground, Bolt pulled up and fell to the floor with what looked like a hamstring injury.\n\nThe United States, with individual gold and silver medallists Justin Gatlin and Christian Coleman running the second and fourth legs, had been expected to push the Jamaicans all the way.\n\nInstead, a brilliantly executed race by Chijindu Ujah, Adam Gemili, Danny Talbot and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake gave Britain gold in 37.47 seconds, the best time in the world this year.\n\nThe US took silver in 37.52 with Japan third in 38.04.

So bad did his injury appear a wheelchair was brought out to assist him, although he was eventually able to get to his feet.\n\nBut rather than the crowd being in shock as they were when he came third in the 100m final, they were too busy celebrating as Britain won gold, the second for the hosts of these Championships.\n\nIt was an incredible race from CJ Ujah, Adam Gemili, Daniel Talbot and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake who looked in disbelief as they celebrated their victory.\n\nTonight was meant to go some way to softening the blow of disappointment for Bolt in the 100m final.\n\nLast weekend everyone packed into the London Stadium to witness his final solo appearance only to see him beaten into third by American duo Justin Gatlin and Christian Coleman\n\nIt seems this is most certainly the right time for Bolt to bow out - and that perhaps he should have done at the Rio Olympics last summer. But despite the disappointment of these World Championships he leaves the sport a legend.\n\nMORE: 5,000m winner Muktar Edris labelled a disgrace for trolling Mo Farah with The Mobot\n\nMORE: Usain Bolt: The numbers, the quotes and the races that made a legend", "time": "21:28:00"}

"London, Aug 13 (IANS) Jamaican superstar Usain Bolt suffered a injury midway into his anchor leg of the men's 4x100 meters relay and pulled out of the last race of career at the World Athletics Championships here.\n\nBolt, who had suffered his first 100m defeat in nine years on August 5, apparently had a pulled a muscle in his leg only 30 meters into the race on Saturday night. He limped to the finish line in agony, Xinhua news agency reported.\n\nBolt had only taken a few strides when he appeared to suffer an injury to his left leg and fell to the track in pain. He stayed down for a couple of minutes before standing up and walking to the finish line.\n\nBritain won the gold in 37.47 seconds, the US took silver in 37.52 and Japan was third in 38.04.\n\nChina, the silver medalist two years ago, finished fourth in 38.34.\n\nThe British team of Chijindu Ujah, Adam Gemili, Danny Talbot and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake broke a European record that had stood since 1999, Efe news reported.\n\nBolt, who had announced prior to the World Athletics Championships that it would be his last major competition, is one of the all-time legends of track and field.\n\nHe first burst on the scene with his performance at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, where he set new world records in winning both the 100-meter and 200-meter finals.\n\nBolt then lost virtually no race of consequence for nine years, the lone exception coming when he was disqualified for a false start at the 100-meter final at the 2011 World Championships in Daegu, South Korea.\n\nBut time finally caught up with the 30-year-old Jamaican at his final event, in which he finished third in the 100 meters last Saturday and then was unable to finish his final race.\n\n--IANS\n\najb/pgh/\n\nSEARCH", "time": "09:28:00"}

A man gifted with unimaginable talent, the likes of which the world has never seen before. On 13th of August, 2017, Bolt will run his last competitive race at the 2017 World Championships as he calls time on an illustrious career. He will don the Jamaican colors one last time as he runs the 4 x 100 meter relay.\n\nBolt has ruled the world of track and field for almost 10 years. His breathtaking performances in Beijing catapulted him into the history books. In a 100 meter race, which usually lasts a shy under 10 seconds, it's just not fair that he can open up a 5 meter lead over his nearest opponent and start to showboat before he crosses the finish line.\n\nSuch was the extent of his God given ability and his nearest rival usually finished meters behind.\n\nBarring the one false start in Daegu in 2011 during the World Championships, Bolt's career has hardly had a single blemish. We live in an era where it's probably easier now than ever to source and consume performance enhancing drugs. It's also probably easier now than ever to get caught consuming them. Bolt however would have none of it. Who does he have to beat other thank himself?\n\nDoping in athletics rampant even at the grass root level. Young athletes are resorting to ingenious ways to abuse performance enhancing substances just to secure a college scholarship. The list of banned substances is only getting bigger and bigger. So, it's not uncommon for an athlete to consume a 'prescription drug' that is also a performance enhancer.\n\nSome athletes have consumed substances that they did not know where banned while others have been victim to sabotage by having their meals spiked.\n\nYet, not one single formal drug related accusation was thrown at Bolt. Ask any track and field athlete and they'll tell you how hard that is. Not only did he maintain a clean reputation, he also undid some of the damage his predecessors did by producing one breathtaking performance after another. While the sport is far from being clean, Bolt did what one #Usain Bolt could do. Unfortunately for athletics, it may never see another Usain Bolt.\n\nHowever, when it comes to competition, Bolt's presence surely brought about a sense of imbalance. Some say that we live in the 'Golden Age' of sprinting. Athletics is blessed to have the likes of #Justin Gatlin, Tyson Gay, Asafa Powell, and of course Bolt's training partner, Yohan Blake all running in the same era. All these athletes have two things in common.\n\n1) Wishing they did not run in the same era as Bolt and 2) a drug charge! Barring Blake, all of these sprinters have held the World 100 meter record at some point. Did Bolt raise the bar to a degree where it's just not humanly possible to compete? Yes he did!\n\nThough sporting fans around the world are mourning the retirement of the legend, several sprinters are undoubtedly happy to bid the legend farewell. Whenever Bolt laced up his boots, you knew he was going to win. His opponents knew he was going to win. The spotlight was always on him and hardly ever on the athlete that came in second. Even when bolt didn't win, the cameras were always on him after the race.\n\nWithout Bolt; Powell, Gay, Gatlin and Blake could have been much bigger stars than they are now. Bolt raised the competition that made these athletes look sub-standard. They couldn't beat Bolt even on their best day. The writing was always on the wall when Bolt ran the field and for this very reason, I believe several sprinters around the world are happy to see him off. It's almost like Bolt's retirement has shifted the balance in favor of other sprinters and in a lot of ways, made the sport unpredictable.\n\nThe track and field world will forever be indebted to Bolt for bringing the spotlight back on the sport. The sport has always been in the news for all of the wrong reasons. Constantly being plagued with charges of drug abuse, the sport needed a larger than life, insanely talented and highly charismatic \"clean\" athlete to lift the sport from shambles. The boos that Justin Gatlin had to endure on winning Bolt's final race is testimony to the fact that the world is not ready to forgive him.\n\nBolt entered the sport at the right time. He gave the sport hope. He gave other athletes hope. He gave the tiny island nation of Jamaica more than they could have ever expected. He single-handedly did what nobody else before him was able to do. The world will be eager to watch him strike his lightning bolt celebratory pose as he's ready to take center stage this week one last time.", "time": "22:36:00"}

a painful and shocking note at the IAAF World Championships, the iconic sprinter pulling up with an injury as Great Britain claimed a shock gold in the men's 4x100m relay.\n\nMORE: Sally Pearson claims gold at world championships\n\nBolt set off on the final leg behind the United States' Christian Coleman and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake of Great Britain and pushed too hard to reach the front, appearing to pull a hamstring and falling to the ground as he failed to finish.\n\nWhile the Jamaican lay prone, it was Britain who crossed the line first in a world-leading time of 37.47 seconds, the US - booed upon entry with 100m champion Justin Gatlin on the second leg - second with 37.52secs and Japan taking the bronze.\n\nThe crocked Bolt was soon joined by his team-mates Omar McLeod, Julian Forte and Yohan Blake, who helped him to his feet and across the line before departing down the tunnel.\n\nRather than bemoaning a far from fitting end to the 30-year-old's distinguished career, the crowd inside London Stadium were lost in celebration for the victorious home nation.\n\nPANDEMONIUM! @BritAthletics men banish their relay hoodoo at home in front of a home crowd and claim WORLD #BeTheNext hometown heroes pic.twitter.com/TKlrtLaljY -- IAAF World Champs (@IAAFWorldChamps)\n\nAugust 12, 2017\n\nIt means Bolt misses out on matching Allyson Felix's record World Championships medal haul of 15, sending him into retirement in disappointing fashion.\n\nMcLeod got Jamaica off to a good start, but Gatlin helped close the gap on the back straight.\n\nHowever, Blake - who missed out on a medal in the 100m, failed to make the 200m final and was an injury doubt in the hours leading up to the race - was overtaken around the bend by Jaylen Bacon and Daniel Talbot.\n\nThe US were joined in a battle for first by Britain, and Mitchell-Blake showed sensational pace to get to the line first, with Bolt pulling up before dropping to the deck.\n\nThe Jamaican left the track with a wave, but largely unnoticed as London Stadium celebrated what had appeared an unlikely gold and the host nation's first in this event since Athens 2004.\n\nWatch the dramatic end to Bolt's athletic's career in the video player above.", "time": "22:55:00"}

to the track with a left-leg injury as he was chasing a final gold medal for the Jamaican 4x100-meter relay team on Saturday at the world championships.\n\nHaving to make up lots of ground on the anchor leg, Bolt suddenly screamed and stumbled as he came down with his golden farewell shattered by the first injury he has experienced at a major competition.\n\nThat wasn't the only surprise. Britain went on to beat the United States in a tight finish.\n\nThe 60,000-capacity stadium was primed for one last Bolt show, one last \"To the World\" pose after a victory, but the injury made it blatantly clear why Bolt is ready to retire. His body can no longer hold up.\n\nHis teammates on the once-fabled Jamaican sprint squad were far from unmatchable, too. Bolt had just too much to make up in the final 100 metres as both Britain and the United States were ahead and even Japan was even.\n\nAs Bolt fell to the ground, the leg with the golden shoe giving way, the crowd still went wild because the home team went on to win gold in 37.47 seconds, .05 seconds ahead of the United States.\n\nIt was yet another amazing upset in a championship of so many.\n\nBefore Bolt came onto the track, he was consoling Mo Farah, his long-distance equivalent who had just lost his first major race since 2011 when he failed to get gold in the 5,000 metres.\n\nFarah also was bidding farewell to the track, coming up short of his fifth straight 5,000-10,000 double at major championships in a sprint against Muktar Edris Ethiopia.\n\n\"I gave it all,\" Farah said. \"I didn't have a single bit left at the end.\"\n\nInstead, Tori Bowie was the unlikely first double gold medallist at the championships, anchoring the U.S. team to the 4x100-meter relay title ahead of Britain and Jamaica.\n\nAt the same time, Allyson Felix, running the second leg on the winning team, earned a record 15th medal at the world championships in a career going back to 2005.\n\nBowie, who won the 100 metres this week, ran a strong anchor leg, leaving behind the opposition to finish in 41.82 seconds.\n\n\"Two gold medals is amazing for me,\" Bowie said. \"We are on top of the world.\"\n\nBritain took silver in 42.12 and two-time defending champion Jamaica earned bronze in 42.19.\n\nIf Bolt and Farah were about farewells, the decathlon was about renewal in the wake of the retirement of two-time Olympic and world champion Ashton Eaton. And Kevin Mayer is the new \"world's greatest athlete.\"\n\nThe Frenchman produced a dominant performance over two days and 10 events, ending with a celebratory 1,500 metres.\n\nMayer won with 8,768 points. Rico Freimuth took silver with 8,564 points, while German teammate Kai Kazmirek was third with 8,488.\n\nMayer is the first Frenchman to win the title. He had only one scare during the two days of competition -- when he scaled his opening mark of 5.10 metres in the pole vault on his third and last attempt.\n\nJohannes Vetter of Germany won the javelin title with an opening throw of 89.89 metres. The German beat Jakub Vadlejch of the Czech Republic by 16 centimetres. Another Czech, Petr Frydrych, took bronze with a last throw of 88.32 metres.\n\nIn the high jump, Mariya Lasitskene of Russia cleared 2.03 metres to win ahead of Yulia Levchenko of Ukraine and Kamila Licwinko of Poland.\n\nThere was at least one veteran who did produce Saturday as Sally Pearson got another gold medal at the Olympic Stadium in London after missing much of the past two seasons because of injury.\n\nFive years after winning the 100-meter hurdles at the London Games, Pearson won the world title in 12.59 seconds.\n\nDawn Harper-Nelson of the United States was second, .04 seconds behind, and Pamela Dutiewicz of Germany took bronze in 12.72.", "time": "22:10:00"}

This is why everyone was so anxious for him to go out on a high note.\n\nThunderclap over London: the superstar of sprint Usain Bolt has missed his farewell with the 100-m being deprived of a final world title by the bad, loved Justin Gatlin, income from a suspension of four years for doping and sacred under the jeers of the public.\n\nBolt admitted he was disappointed but would never change his idea of retiring because the new life ahead is more inviting. Reese won the Olympic gold medal in the same stadium five years ago.\n\nHis legendary achievements were well recognized by the sports world as he was named IAAF Athlete of The Year six times and was a four-time Laureus Awards victor.\n\nIt was a disappointing end for Bolt and his legions of fans, as past year he announced that London would be his retirement party. \"He is an inspiration\", Gatlin said of Bolt.\n\nBut God help him if foolish pride compels him to forego retirement to redeem himself.\n\nAs Coe put it, what the crowd is going to miss is the personality, an athlete with humor, good grace as well as nearly insurmountable sprinting achievements. \"Looking for tears?\" Bolt asked. \"That was stupid\", he said, and straight away I could see Mick's point.\n\nThen came Bolt, and the Jamaicans needed him. But hey, who knew? \"To be honest, it is about staying hungry, staying humble, being nice, being normal, being who you are\", he said.\n\n\"Two gold medals is wonderful for me\", Bowie said. I think we have introduced him as a villain. Bear in mind that Lance Armstrong managed to end his career without getting caught ... too.\n\nBolt acknowledged that Yohan Blake would likely come in for the final, all the while praising his less experienced relay teammates. On Saturday, it felt surreal to anyone who's been at one of these Bolt victories before. Not Bolt; he just made it seem like a bit of fun. The legend of the sprint has released its lineup to commune one last time with the spectators. They will be vying for a second successive World Championships medal. Bolt brought a pure, clear simplicity to the sport, rich in entertainment, delivered with a smile - and on a diet of chicken nuggets.\n\nPolicing drugs in professional sports is not only Orwellian; it's utterly futile.\n\nWhilst the authorities say they are doing everything they can in respect of cleaning the sport up, you sometimes wonder if they are fighting a losing battle. And if what they do or take poses no harm to anyone except themselves, who cares?!\n\nOn the question about the disappointing bronze in the final 100m of his career, Bolt was all but praises for Justin Gatlin.\n\nOther commentaries like \"Jones Admits Using Steroids: Why Marion, Why...?\"\n\nMeanwhile, Gatlin served that suspension at the peak of his career (ages 24-28). \"I work closely with them, I have worked closely with them in the past and will continue to do so\".", "time": "23:24:00"}

And an end it did see. But in such a way, probably none had expected. Two legends, two race...two heartbreaks! Two greatest sprinters of the generation, Usain Bolt and Mo Farah were denied a perfect swansong with both ending in dismay. But the one that Bolt faced, was beyond the wildest dreams of any athletics or even a sports lover. The Jamaican sprinter limped out with a cram on his left hamstring as the team failed to finish the 4X100 metre relay.\n\nIt was 8:20 into the night. The London crowd at the Olympics stadium waited in anticipation for their hero. Mo Farah was all geared up for his final race of his career - 5000 metres race. Having previously won the 10,000 metres race in London, a few days earlier, Farah was definitely the favourite. Not because of the English crowd, well he had history to back himself up.\n\nSix years of dominance in the long distance track with 10 global titles and four double golds (10,000 and the 5000 metres race). He had clinched the double in the 2012 London Olympics and successfully defended it in Rio 2016, becoming the second person to do so and had emulated the same in the World Championships too. Apart from that he also has an unbroken streak - 5000m in 2011, the 10,000m in 2017 and the double in 2012, 2013, 2015 and 2016. The streak was yet to be broken and he was defending it yesterday in front of his nation, for one final time.\n\nBut 56,000 sports fans present at the Olympics Stadium stood in absolute astonishment as the 34-year-old dropped down in tears. He finished second. For the first time in six years. Mo Farah, who was aiming for a mythical 'quintuple-double' at home was shocked by young Ethiopian Muktar Edris. While the former champion finished with 13:33.22 on the clock, Muktar timed 13:32.79.\n\nWATCH: Usain Bolt limps out with cramp in final race of his career at IAAF World Championships\n\n\"I had tears in my eyes,\" he said after the race. \"Never had that before.\n\n\"I felt, 'Wow'. It's been an amazing journey. To achieve what I have achieved through the years has been incredible.\n\n\"And to end it in London, what a way. This is where it all started and I got little emotional because I look at my family, I look at what I've done and it gets to you because, at the end of the day, I'm just a human.\"\n\nThe London crowd had one last hope left in them. Another legend loosened himself up for his final, final race. They were once left traumatised when Bolt finished third in the 100 metres final, for the first time in his career at Worlds stage. But fans had ample hope and so did Usain Bolt that he would give his swansong a glittering goodbye.\n\nREAD: Bolt from the blue - The journey from Jamaica to his Olympic three-peat\n\nBang! Went the gun shot as the sprinters soared off their starting blocks. Great Britain took off with real pace, the Japanese followed behind. But the Jamaicans were slowly catching up. Yohan Blake blazed away to pass the baton to his final teammate, Bolt.\n\nGreat Britain was still leading then, followed by the Americans and the Jamaican team. Bolt clutched onto the baton and took off. Another sluggish start, but made an effort to tune up his speed. And just when it seemed he was catching up the hosts, he limped down the track as he had pulled a cramp on his left hamstring, sat down agonising in pain as Great Britain roared away with the gold. The team USA finished second, followed by Japan. Bolt sat there, tears rolled down his eyes as his teammates ran to console him.\n\nJamaica finished the night with DNF written beside their name. It was for the first time since their shot to dominance in 2008. Afterward, there were a lot of speculations made as to what lead to this heartbreaking moment and IAAF seemed to be at blame. The Sprinters complained that they were kept waiting for about 40 minutes from the time they stepped onto the track from the warm-up room.\n\n\"I think this is crazy,\" Blake said. \"Forty minutes. Waiting. Warming up. Waiting. Warming up. It just should not happen. To have your champion go out like that, it's crazy.\"\n\nThe all these....they do remind people of some past events. Bradman walked out on zero in the final innings of his career, Zidane had received a red card in his final game for France, Pele failed to score in his last game donning the Brazil jersey and the 'Greatest' Muhammad Ali lost in his final bout of his career. And now its Bolt and Farah. Probably that's how legends part.", "time": "05:06:00"}

We hope for the best for him.\"\n\nBolt's team mate Yohan Blake criticised the organisation of the sprint relay final, telling Sky Sports News that the treatment of the runners was \"atrocious\".\n\nBlake said: \"I'm very distraught.\n\n\"There was a 300m walk to the zone. The race was 10 minutes later.\n\n\"It was cold. Usain said to me 'I don't like this', because we keep on warming up, and sitting, and warming up.\n\n\"They had to make two presentations before that.\n\n\"To see a hero like that, a champion of the sport go down like that, that's a true friend, I didn't like it one bit. They were holding us too long.\n\n\"They must know that it is silly and we are not used to these conditions. To be holding us so long, it was atrocious. There was too many presentations. The race was 10 minutes late.\n\n\"The sport is going to drop a bit (following the departure of Bolt) but we still have guys for Jamaica to fill that void that he will leave.\n\n\"He is going to mentor me, come to training, and make sure everything is all right.\"\n\nAlso See: Gold for Britain as Bolt pulls up Silver for Farah in 5,000m", "time": "21:24:00"}

what was later diagnosed as a hamstring cramp.\n\n\"This is farewell time, I am sentimental about it already now,\" said Gatlin, who stormed to 100m gold in London, US teammate Christian Coleman taking silver to relegate Bolt to a disappointing bronze in his individual send-off.\n\n\"In the warm-up area we give ourselves respect and greet each other,\" Gatlin said of Bolt, who bows out of competition with a startling haul of eight Olympic gold medals and 14 world medals, nine of which are gold.\n\nGatlin, who has served two doping bans, put the blame for Bolt's cramp partly at the amount of time the athletes spent on the track before the starter's gun went off.\n\n\"There was a cool breeze out there. But the conditions were the same for everybody,\" said the 35-year-old, who won the 100m at the 2004 Olympics in Athens and the 2005 worlds in Helsinki before serving his second ban between 2006-10 for taking testosterone.\n\n- Chilly conditions unhelpful -\n\n\"I think it was the elements. I am sorry he got this injury. He is still the best in the world.\n\n\"It was a recipe. I don't want to say this but I understand we need to be ready early but I think we took our clothes off a little too early. It's a little chilly in here so I think that's where the cramp came from. That's what he suffered with. He was running out there cold.\"\n\nBut Gatlin, who was roundly booed at the London Stadium before both the 100m and relay, insisted: \"Usain Bolt is a great athlete.\n\n\"You can't let this championships define what he's done in the past. He has done amazing things. He's still the man, you know. The was his farewell race and we wish him the best and hope he recovers soon.\"\n\nReferring to Bolt's mooted future ambassadorial role within athletics' world governing body the IAAF, Gatlin added: \"He's coming back in a couple of years. He'll be ready, he has a passion for the sport.\n\n\"He loves the fans and they love him. He loves the sport too much to walk away. He's a showman.\"\n\nJapan snatched a surprise bronze medal, Kenji Fujimitsu moved to comment: \"Thank you, Bolt. He was an inspiration for us.\"\n\nOmar McLeod, the newly-crowned 110m hurdler and Jamaica's lead-off runner in the relay, added: \"Usain Bolt's name will always live on.\"", "time": "00:08:00"}

Saturday, as the athletics star pulled up with an injury during the 4x100-meter final at the 2017 IAAF World Championships in London.\n\nNBC Olympics shared this image of the 30-year-old, as he failed to finish the race:\n\nHosts Great Britain took the gold medal with a time of 37.47 seconds.\n\nBolt was already chasing the British and American teams when he started the final leg of the race, and he didn't even come close to the finish line before pulling up.\n\nAs FloTrack shared, he did eventually cross the finish line:\n\nJamaica started with Yohan Blake in third and Bolt as the final man, while the USA opted for Christian Coleman as their final runner, with Justin Gatlin taking the second leg. The Americans were seen as the favourites, with Bolt showing signs of weakness in the individual 100 meters and most expecting him to start his leg with a large deficit.\n\nThe race played out exactly like that, although the Brits came out of nowhere to snatch the gold from the Americans. But by the time the hosts finished, many of the fans in London had their eyes fixed further back.\n\nProfessional footballer Yannick Bolasie voiced what many likely felt:\n\nThe hugely popular Bolt was given a standing ovation after the individual 100-meter final, when a bitterly disappointed crowd watched as Gatlin took the gold. Saturday's reaction was more mixed, with many noting the incredible achievement by the hosts, including MP Jess Phillips:", "time": "21:31:00"}

gold medal after he led Jamaica home to reach the 4x100 metre relay final at the IAAF World Championships.\n\nMORE: Streaker invades Bolt's final 100m run |\n\nThe sprint superstar was left disappointed in the concluding chapter of his individual career a week ago, forced to settle for bronze as the controversial Justin Gatlin took gold in the 100m.\n\nBut there were no such problems for Bolt at London Stadium on Saturday as, following legs by Tyquendo Tracey, Julian Forte and Michael Campbell, he cruised home to send Jamaica to victory in their heat in a season's best 37.95 seconds.\n\nThe result means Bolt will bring down the curtain on a stunning career in the final later on Saturday as he goes for a record 15th medal at the Championships and what he hopes will be a 12th gold.\n\n\"The crowd was wonderful, we did what we had to do and that was qualify,\" Bolt told BBC Sport. \"I enjoy relays more than anything.\n\nDid you know... ?#IAAFworlds

It's hard to be sad, it's wonderful and it's been brilliant. It's going to be outstanding, there are no words to explain how the crowd makes me feel.\"\n\nFrance and China followed Jamaica home to reach the final, while United States won the first heat in a world-leading time of 37.70 seconds, clear of Great Britain and Japan. Turkey and Canada took the fastest loser's spots for Saturday's showpiece.\n\nAlso bowing out from the track on Saturday will be four-time Olympic champion Mo Farah, who is looking to add 5,000m gold to his 10,000m title for the third successive Worlds.\n\n\"Mo has proven himself over and over again,\" Bolt said. \"I'm shocked he's actually going, he's got a lot more years in those legs and it'll be sad to see him go also.\"", "time": "21:36:00"}

But no more, and the joy amongst the team was evident at the finish.\n\n\"We're world champions, world champions,\" Mitchell-Blake said through tears of happiness.\n\nWhile Britain celebrated, though, there were contrasting emotions for Bolt in the final race of his career.\n\nThe 30-year-old pulled up on the home straight as he sought to chase down the United States and Britain, hobbling for a few strides before falling to the track.\n\nHis team-mates gathered round him and the 19-time global champion was helped to his feet and limped over the line, applauding the crowd as he did so.\n\nIt was a sad way for Bolt to bring the curtain down on the greatest athletics career the world has ever seen, a man who has dominated, delighted and delivered ever since his record-breaking runs and gold medals at the 2008 Olympics.\n\nA golden farewell was what he deserved.\n\nBut last weekend, when Bolt had to settle for 100m bronze and drug cheat Justin Gatlin took his title, was proof enough that sport does not do fairy tales, not even for Bolt.\n\nElsewhere, Mo Farah missed out on his dream double after coming second in the 5000 metres at the World Championships.\n\nThe four-time Olympic champion failed to mount a third defence of the 5000m as Ethiopia's Muktar Edris claimed gold in London.\n\nFarah had already won the 10,000m last week.\n\nFarah, who had not lost a final in 2,176 days, having also won the 10,000m and 5,000m at the 2013 and 2015 World Championships, crossed the line in 13 minutes 33.22 seconds.\n\nBut he was defeated after failing to mount a recovery in the last 200m in a frantic sprint finish.\n\nEdris finished in 13mins 32.79secs, with the United States' Paul Chelimo third.\n\nAn emotional Farah collapsed on the track after the race and appeared almost inconsolable as he held his arms over his face.", "time": "22:01:00"}

hamstring in his final race, just 21 strides into the final leg of the World Championship 4x100m relay.\n\nIn one of the saddest scenes seen at the London Stadium, Bolt appeared in trouble about 40m after receiving the baton - just as he sought to accelerate and try to catch the British runner Nathaneel Mitchell-Blake and American runner Christian Coleman who were just ahead of him. But by the 50m mark he suddenly hopped in agony, screaming ''oh f...k'' and then collapsing to the track. After officials raced to his assistance, including one with a wheelchair, Bolt eventually got up, and in some pain hobbled across the finish line.\n\nNo one was anticipating such a excruciatingly painful goodbye to Bolt's international athletics career, which has left the global track and field community with a huge void to fill.\n\nBefore the race Bolt was in a jovial mood, boxing with the Championship mascot Hero the Hedgehog in the warmup room, and then emerging onto the track to a standing ovation. With a pre-planned shoulder roll with his team, he warmed up down the home straight, waving and cheering and clapping to the crowd. The moment was a little overwhelming, even for Bolt, as he realised this was it: his final sprint on the biggest of stages, but he wasn't to know he would end up in the medical room, rather than on a farewell lap of the stadium.\n\nYet the mood in the stadium, while stunned at Bolt's injury, turned to joy as the British team won the gold medal ahead of the United States. Japan won the bronze.\n\nThe capacity crowd of 55,000 also roared for Bolt, this time in a chorus of gratefulness, thanks and a huge dollop of sadness.\n\nBolt seared himself onto the consciousness of the world when his braggadocio antics and playful enthusiasm at the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games elevated him well beyond being the fastest man in the world. He continued to dominate the sprints - only a failed drug test by a relay team mate ultimately denied him the triple triple Olympic golds across the 100m,200m and 4x100m relay. Many have commented that Bolt stayed a year too long: that he should have retired at the Rio Olympics, but he had always committed to the London 2017 organisers that he would support their event and he wanted to return to the Olympic track where the crowds had given him so much love.\n\nBolt would often train in the south-west London, not far from the home of his agent Ricky Sims, and Both has long appreciated that the locals would leave him alone.\n\nEven now Bolt is linked to the successful Nitro Athletics in Australia and is likely to make a guest appearance at next year's series, perhaps in the relay, or in one of the odd distances. That decision may hinge on how much partying he enjoys in his retirement, or if his intent to take up professional football is a serious one.\n\nBolt wanted to retire as unbeatable - and while his bronze here from the 100m and his hobble in the relay was not the farewell he intended, he can be comforted that he will remain unbeatable as athletics' personality and his numerous records will stand for some time.\n\nHis 100m (9.58s) and 200m (19.19s) world records, set four days apart in Berlin in 2009 remains the zenith of the sport, and well beyond the gravitational pull of the current generation of sprinters.\n\nIn the past week the winning times in the sprints have been so slow the historians have had to go back 14 or 15 years to find comparable victory efforts.\n\nThe South African Wayde Van Niekerk is being promoted as his heir apparent, but he is too retiring, too sensitive and not nearly tough enough, or indeed talented enough, to consume the track in the way Bolt did.\n\nIn any case, such lofty promotion is something that will occur organically, despite the desperate efforts of athletics officials.\n\nThat point was rammed home when the 5000m send off for local hero Mo Farah was ruined by Ethiopian Mutkar Edris. Farah will compete in the Zurich Diamond League next month and then concentrate solely on marathons.\n\nIn the race, largely expected to be a procession for Farah, Edris took off from afar with his compatriot Yomif Kejelcha. Despite a desperate sprint finish Farah was unable to haul Edris back, claiming o have been boxed in, although the inside track opened up for him in the last 60m.\n\n''I gave 110 per cent. I don't think there was anything more I could have done,'' said Farah, 34, as he lost his first major race since 2011, before adding: ''They worked as a team. The better man won.''\n\nEdris, 23, won in 13minutes 32.79secs, with Farah 13minutes 33.22secs and Paul Chelimo picking the bronze in 13minutes 33.30secs.\n\n\"I was highly prepared for this race and I knew I was going to beat Mo Farah. After the 10km he was maybe tired so he did not have enough for the last kick. I was stronger.'' he said.\n\nAustralia's Patrick Tiernan had tried to force the pace and disrupt Farah's well honed late sprinting tactics, leading for three laps, but he couldn't match the final pace and faded to 11th in 13minutes 40.01secs.\n\nFor the first time in the Championships the IAAF anthem was played as defending world champion Maria Lasitkene won the high jump with 2.03m, not representing Russia, but competing as a neutral athlete.\n\nIn the womens 4x100m, world 100m champion Torrie Bowie took three grabs at the final changeover and was close to being disqualified, but she successfully anchored the victorious United States team in 41.82sec ahead of Great Britain and Northern Ireland 42.12sec and Jamaica 42.19sec.", "time": "22:19:00"}

excruciating pain.\n\nThe Jamaican great crumpled to the track with a left-leg injury as he was chasing a final gold medal for the Jamaican 4\u00d7100-meter relay team on Saturday at the world championships.\n\nHaving to make up lots of ground on the anchor leg, Bolt suddenly screamed and stumbled as he came down with his golden farewell shattered by the first injury he has experienced at a major competition.\n\nThat wasn't the only surprise. Britain went on to beat the United States in a tight finish.\n\nThe 60,000-capacity stadium was primed for one last Bolt show, one last \"To the World\" pose after a victory, but the injury made it blatantly clear why Bolt is ready to retire. His body can no longer hold up.\n\nHis teammates on the once-fabled Jamaican sprint squad were far from unmatchable, too. Bolt had just too much to make up in the final 100 metres as both Britain and the United States were ahead and even Japan was even.\n\nAs Bolt fell to the ground, the leg with the golden shoe giving way, the crowd still went wild because the home team went on to win gold in 37.47 seconds, .05 seconds ahead of the United States.\n\nIt was yet another amazing upset in a championship of so many.\n\nBefore Bolt came onto the track, he was consoling Mo Farah, his long-distance equivalent who had just lost his first major race since 2011 when he failed to get gold in the 5,000 metres.\n\nFarah also was bidding farewell to the track, coming up short of his fifth straight 5,000-10,000 double at major championships in a sprint against Muktar Edris Ethiopia.\n\n\"I gave it all,\" Farah said. \"I didn't have a single bit left at the end.\"\n\nInstead, Tori Bowie was the unlikely first double gold medallist at the championships, anchoring the U.S. team to the 4\u00d7100-meter relay title ahead of Britain and Jamaica.\n\nAt the same time, Allyson Felix, running the second leg on the winning team, earned a record 15th medal at the world championships in a career going back to 2005.\n\nBowie, who won the 100 metres this week, ran a strong anchor leg, leaving behind the opposition to finish in 41.82 seconds.\n\n\"Two gold medals is amazing for me,\" Bowie said. \"We are on top of the world.\"\n\nBritain took silver in 42.12 and two-time defending champion Jamaica earned bronze in 42.19.\n\nIf Bolt and Farah were about farewells, the decathlon was about renewal in the wake of the retirement of two-time Olympic and world champion Ashton Eaton. And Kevin Mayer is the new \"world's greatest athlete.\"\n\nThe Frenchman produced a dominant performance over two days and 10 events, ending with a celebratory 1,500 metres.\n\nMayer won with 8,768 points. Rico Freimuth took silver with 8,564 points, while German teammate Kai Kazmirek was third with 8,488.\n\nMayer is the first Frenchman to win the title. He had only one scare during the two days of competition -- when he scaled his opening mark of 5.10 metres in the pole vault on his third and last attempt.\n\nJohannes Vetter of Germany won the javelin title with an opening throw of 89.89 metres. The German beat Jakub Vadlejch of the Czech Republic by 16 centimetres. Another Czech, Petr Frydrych, took bronze with a last throw of 88.32 metres.\n\nIn the high jump, Mariya Lasitskene of Russia cleared 2.03 metres to win ahead of Yulia Levchenko of Ukraine and Kamila Licwinko of Poland.\n\nThere was at least one veteran who did produce Saturday as Sally Pearson got another gold medal at the Olympic Stadium in London after missing much of the past two seasons because of injury.\n\nFive years after winning the 100-meter hurdles at the London Games, Pearson won the world title in 12.59 seconds.\n\nDawn Harper-Nelson of the United States was second, .04 seconds behind, and Pamela Dutiewicz of Germany took bronze in 12.72.\n\n-- --\n\nMore AP track coverage: https://www.apnews.com/tag/London2017", "time": "21:51:00"}

Usain Bolt, the 'fastest human in the world,' runs his last race on Aug. 12, as he takes part in the 4\u00d7100 relay. Coverage begins at 3:00 PM ET so tune in to see him run one last time.\n\nWith eight Olympic gold medals and numerous world records under his belt, the career of Usain Bolt, 30, will come to a close in front of a crowded Olympic Stadium in London, England. The man considered the greatest sprinter of all time will run his last race as part of the 2017 IAAF World Championships. He'll join his fellow countrymen to run as part of the 4x100m relay team. After a heartbreaking finish to his last solo race, this is his last chance to go out on a high note. Will he do it? Fans better watch, as this will be the final time to see \"Lightning Bolt\" in action.\n\nIt was his first loss in over ten years, but Usain watched as the gold medal in the 100m slipped through his fingers on Aug. 6. While racing for his 12th World Championship, the man favored to win came in third place, behind second-place Christian Coleman and race winner, Justin Gatlin. Justin's time of 9.92 seconds was still .34 seconds slower than the world record, set by - you guessed it - Usain Bolt. Christian barely beat Usain, finishing at 9.94, a .01 faster than Bolt's 9.95.\n\n\"It's well-deserved. You know, I've said it over the years that he's a great competitor, you know what I mean?\" Usain said of Justin, per The Daily Beast, a man he barely beat in the 2016 Olympics in Rio. \"If you don't show up on the night, he will beat you. For me, I didn't show up tonight.\"\n\n\"A little bit disappointed but such is life,\" Usain said while reflecting on his last solo race, according to Reuters. \"I've done my best as always; went out there and gave my all and I'm just happy to be here and looking forward to the 4\u00d7100.\" Usain will run in the relay heats, despite still feeling sore after racing for the 100m gold. \"Physically I am alright, there is a little bit of pain, but nothing a massage can't cure, I'm taking it easy.\"", "time": "16:23:00"}

injury.\n\nLONDON: Usain Bolt's final appearance on the track ended in agony on Saturday as he pulled up injured running the final leg of the World Championships 4\u00d7100 metres relay as Britain stunned the United States to win a shock gold medal.\n\nBolt, who had to settle for bronze in the individual 100 metres, had been hoping to sign off from the sport by leading Jamaica to a fifth successive relay gold but they were struggling in third place when he collected the baton.\n\nAs he tried to gain ground, Bolt pulled up and fell to the floor with what looked like a hamstring injury.\n\nThe 60,000 in the stadium who had come to mark the farewell sport's greatest showman had only a split second to absorb what was happening as up ahead a new chapter was being written.\n\nThe US, with individual gold and silver medallists Justin Gatlin and Christian Coleman running the second and fourth legs, had been expected to push the Jamaicans all the way but they were always trailing the slick Britons.\n\nThe brilliantly executed race by Chijindu Ujah, Adam Gemili, Danny Talbot and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake gave Britain gold in 37.47 seconds, breaking an 18-year-old national record, and the world title for the first time.\n\n\"I wasn't sure if I had won or not, I gave it my all but I could see Christian Coleman out of the corner of my eye,\" said Mitchell-Blake.\n\n\"The feeling of euphoria was from infinity. I can't register it. We smashed the British record to pieces.\"\n\nBritain's only other men's global sprint relay golds came in the 1912 and 2004 Olympics.\n\nIt completed a great night for the host nation's sprinters after their women had earlier taken silver behind the Americans in the sprint relay, their best performance since the first championships in 1983.\n\nThe US men took silver in 37.52 but for a nation that used to be totally dominant in the event, it was only their second medal in the last eight global finals after a series of world championship and Olympic disqualifications. Japan took advantage of Jamaica's travails to take third in 38.04.", "time": "23:38:00"}

"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/aug/13/greatness-usain-bolt-burnished-injury-final-appearance", "body": "Usain Bolt, who has captivated our attention for nine years, hobbled over the finish line with a pulled hamstring in the 4x100m and won't thank the IAAF\n\nThis is how it ends then, with Usain Bolt face down on the track, 10 metres out from the finish line. Just when you wondered whether Bolt was going to accelerate counter-clockwise around the earth to reverse time, or announce that he had to return to his home planet and then fly off into the night sky, or disappear with the princess into the happily-ever-after, all the dragons dead behind him, he gave us a last reminder that he's only human after all. His hamstring went before he'd made it halfway home. He slowed to a halt while the field sped past him, then stumbled into a roll. It meant he crossed the line alone, and last. His first world championship final, in the 200m in 2005, finished the very same way.\n\nAfter the race, Bolt's three Jamaican team-mates all spoke about how long they had been made to wait in the call room before the race. Yohan Blake, Bolt's friend and training partner, was furious, Omar McLeod distraught. \"Ridiculous\" was the word he used. After all the buildup, the International Assocation of Athletics Federations somehow managed to bungle Bolt's farewell to the sport. The relay runners were made to wait 45 minutes backstage, while everyone in the stadium sat through the medal ceremonies and anthems for the men's 5,000m and the women's high jump. At this point, you wouldn't trust the IAAF's officials to fire a start gun without shooting themselves in the foot.\n\nPart of the reason Bolt was made to wait so long was because Mo Farah was busy making his own farewell. The organisers had made a video montage of Farah's greatest moments, intercut with a series of tributes from little kids, which they played on the big screens after the 5,000m was over. Farah, utterly spent after his desperate sprint to the line, seemed too busy sucking in fresh air to be moved by it. And for everyone else the effect was spoiled by the fact that Muktar Edris, who had dipped his hands to his head in imitation of Farah's usual celebrations when he won the race, was dancing a merry jig up by the finish line at the time.\n\nStill, Farah will be back, it's just that next season he won't be on the track because he'll be on the road instead. But's he's running again in Birmingham on 20 August. Bolt had said he might run another race or two this season as well. But he'll have to scrap that now. He's gone for good. The IAAF has seen to that. Or at least, he will be come Monday. The IAAF has arranged a \"special presentation\" for him here on Sunday night, when he'll get one last victory lap of the track, and, presumably, some profound apologies too. No doubt they'll have a montage ready. But it won't be a patch on the one that started playing in the memory the minute Bolt stepped out on to the track.\n\nThat first Saturday night in the Bird's Nest in Beijing, when he spread his arms and seemed almost to stop to look around while he was 20 metres from the line, the giddy exhilaration that followed the first look at the clock stopped on 9.69sec. Then the 200m final days later, when Bolt dipped for the line, even though there was no one near him. He wasn't competing against the field, but Michael Johnson's untouchable world record. He turned 22 the next day, but was mischievous as a kid, and cheerfully admitted he'd eaten chicken nuggets for breakfast, lunch and dinner 10 days in a row.\n\nThen August in Berlin a year later, when Bolt broke both his own records, so fast now that he stretched the outer limits of possibility, as if we had to draw new maps to reflect our understanding of how far, and how fast, human beings can go. Or Daegu in 2011, when we finally saw him flustered. He was disqualified for a false start. It was the only way anyone was going to beat him. At the London Olympics a year later, he had a real rival, Yohan Blake. At least, that's what we told ourselves before the Games.\n\nA fortnight later, when Bolt crossed the line first in the 200m, he held his finger to his lips, admonishing everyone who doubted him. Then he dropped to the track and started doing push-ups while Dizzee Rascal's Bonkers blasted out over the stadium PA. It was the iconic image of his Games. Well, that and the selfie he posted with the Swedish women's handball team at 3am in his hotel room the night after he won the 100m. \"I'm now a legend,\" he said that night, \"I'm also the greatest athlete to live.\" Who was going to argue? Justin Gatlin tried. He spent the next three years coming for Bolt, in Moscow and then again in Beijing. But he didn't catch him.\n\nIn 2016, there was the triple-triple, his third set of three Olympic gold medals and that photo of him cocking his head to shoot a grin at the camera as he finished his 100m semi-final, the roadrunner taunting seven coyotes. And then last Saturday, when Gatlin finally beat him in a big race. And even that, in its bittersweet way, burnished his legend. Bolt could have quit in 2016. He had no reason to be at these world championships. He had nothing left to prove, and nothing left to win, but he came anyway, to put it all on the line one last time. He was willing to gamble, and he lost, twice. There's something to admire in that, too. Truth is, the IAAF doesn't deserve him, and never did.", "time": "09:00:00"}

for home hero Mo Farah in the men's 5,000m final, before the drama of Bolt's last agonizing appearance.\n\nHe had been bidding for a 12th world championship gold to bring down the curtain on his glittering career, but instead limped out of the London Stadium arena.\n\nVictory for the British quartet of CJ Ujah, Adam Gemili, who ran a storming second leg, Daniel Talbot and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake was stunning compensation for Farah's earlier defeat.\n\nThey won in 37.47 seconds, with the US taking silver at 0.05sec and Japan with a surprise bronze.\n\nFor his massive global following, the perfect script would have seen the Bolt of old running down Britain and the US for yet another gold, but it was not to be.\n\n\"He didn't tell us exactly what happened but from what I saw, it looked like a strain or a cramp of some sort,\" teammate Julian Forte told IAAF radio.\n\n\"He kept apologizing to us but we told him there was no need to apologize -- injuries are part of the sport.\"\n\nJamaican team doctor Dr Kevin Jones told AFP that Bolt had suffered from \"cramp in his left hamstring\".\n\n\"The last three weeks have been hard for him, you know. We hope for the best for him,\" he added.\n\nJamaica's 110m hurdles champion Omar McLeod, who ran the first leg for the quartet, summed up the feeling of everyone.\n\nFarah, who won the 10,000 title in dramatic fashion of the opening day at the London Stadium, had to settle for silver behind Ethiopian Muktar Edris in his final championship race on the track.\n\nHe edged out American Paul Chelimo in a desperate dash for the line, the last mile of a hitherto slow run race run in just under four minutes.\n\nFarah, 34, will now turn his attention to the marathon after failing in his bid to double up at the Olympics or World Championship for the fifth time, including double gold in London 2012 and the Rio Games last year.\n\nEdris, a former world junior champion, timed his last lap burst to perfection to win in 13 minutes 32.79 seconds, copying Farah's famous Mobot gesture as he crossed the line.\n\nIt was not the farewell Farah wanted, but he pointed to his earlier exertions in a dramatic 10,000m final as reason for lacking his usual devastating finish.\n\n\"The 10,000m took a lot more out of me than I had realized,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\n\"I gave it my all. I didn't have a single thing left to give at the end.\"", "time": "22:50:00"}

Bolt came in third place with a time of 9.95 seconds (Christian Coleman finished second at 9.94).\n\n\"I dreamed about this day,\" said Gatlin after the race, per Matt Bonesteel and Bryan Flaherty of The Washington Post. \"I worked hard for this day. And it took for me to not be selfish and think about myself and think about others to give me that fight.\"\n\nBolt was very congratulatory to Gatlin afterward.\n\n\"The first thing he did was congratulate me and say that I didn't deserve the boos,\" said Gatlin. \"He is an inspiration.\"\n\nGatlin, who has been suspended for doping issues in the past, insisted that his win over Bolt was entirely clean and that any claims that he cheated are \"False, with a capital F,\" according to TMZ Sports.\n\nBack in 2006, Gatlin was suspended for eight years from track and field, but was able to get the punishment knocked down to four years after appealing.\n\nHe was also hit with a two-year ban after testing positive for amphetamines back in 2001.\n\nRelated Items:FRS News", "time": "10:36:00"}

winning 4x100m women's team (from left): Jura Levy, Natasha Morrison, Sashalee Forbes and Simone Facey.\n\nThe last image was painful, but his lasting image is covered in gold.\n\nFifteen years after his golden introduction, Usain Bolt's farewell from athletics did not come with the fairytale ending that his glorious career deserved.\n\nInstead, in a heap of pain after suffering an injury to his left hamstring during the 4x100m relay final, Bolt's final run at a major international championship quite eerily mirrored his first: the 2004 Olympics, where injury also crippled his campaign.\n\nFor the London Stadium crowd, confusion as they struggled to decide whether to celebrate Great Britain's first 4x100m gold medal at the World Championships or suffer with their hero, the sport's hero; who was saying goodbye after a generation-defining spell.\n\nEight Olympic titles, 11 world titles, 50 sub-10 second clocking in the 100m, and eight world-record-breaking performances and a lifetime of memorable performances propelled him to the forefront of global sporting celebrity.\n\nBolt would walk off the track to thunderous applause, with team doctor Dr Kevin Jones confirming the extent of the damage.\n\n\"It's a cramp in his left hamstring, but a lot of the pain is from the disappointment from losing the race. The last three weeks have been hard for him, you know. We hope for the best for him,\" said Jones.\n\nHowever, The Sunday Gleaner was later informed that it was worse than a cramp and that he is to undergo an MRI today before being honoured at the stadium.\n\nJamaican sprint hurdler Omar McLeod was a picture of devastation. The gold medal winner requested a leg on the relay team specifically because he wanted to help ensure that Bolt received what he termed \"a golden sendoff\".\n\nMcLeod rushed out of the blocks on the opening leg, showing a bit of that 9.99 seconds speed over 100m, with Julian Forte powering down the backstretch after a smooth exchange. Yohan Blake's third leg was not as dominating, but when the baton settled in Bolt's left hand, the stage was set for another epic Bolt finish.\n\nAs was the case in the 100m final, it was not to be, as Bolt grabbed his hamstring and pulled up some 20 metres into his run.\n\n\"I felt like it happened to me,\" said teammate Forte, shaking his head. \"I was at the corner when it happened, and I just didn't want to believe it. It is devastating. I wanted to be a part of the team that sent Usain Bolt off in style. It's unfortunate, and it's one of the things that can happen in sports,\" added Forte.\n\n\"It's heart-wrenching. I gave it my all, and I wanted Usain to leave golden. We wanted to win. It was really heart-wrenching. I don't know what to say, really,\" said an emotional McLeod. \"I could not believe. I was shocked. I was in disbelief.\"\n\nIt was the first time since the 2007 World Championships that Jamaica was not winning the men's 4x100m relay.\n\nGreat Britain and Northern Ireland, 37.47, anchored by former Jamaica College schoolboy Nathaniel Mitchell-Blake, outlasted the United States' Christian Coleman to win his country's first gold in the event, with the Americans finishing second in 37.52. Japan was third in 38.04 seconds.\n\nThe women's 4x100m relay team of Jura Levy, Natasha Morrison, Simone Facey, and Sashalee Forbes was solid in securing bronze in a time of 42.19 seconds, finishing behind winners the United States, 41.82, and Great Britain and Northern Ireland, 42.12.\n\nKemoy Campbell finished 10th in 13:39.74 in the men's 5000m final, which saw hometown favourite Mo Farah, 13:33.22, beaten by Ethiopia's Muktar Edris, 13:32.79, with USA's Paul Chelimo, 13:33.30, in third.\n\nThe women's 4x400m relay team will compete in the final at 8:55 p.m. British time (2:55 p.m. in Jamaica) after winning their heat in 3:23.64 and with hopes of adding another medal to Jamaica's tally.", "time": "05:21:00"}

Farah experienced some of their greatest moments in their careers at the 2012 Olympics in London but five years on and back in the same stadium, misery replaced joy on Saturday.\n\nBolt, who won the individual 100 and 200m and the 4x100m relay in London in 2012, collapsed to the track injured anchoring the Jamaica 4x100 metres relay team.\n\nJamaican team doctor Dr Kevin Jones said Bolt had suffered from \"cramp in his left hamstring\".\n\n\"But a lot of pain is from disappointment from losing the race,\" Jones said.\n\n\"The last three weeks have been hard for him, you know. We hope for the best for him.\"\n\nThe organisers brought on a wheelchair but Bolt shrugged them aside and he limped across the line, grimacing.\n\nJamaica's 110m hurdles champion Omar McLeod and relay teammate said nothing had changed with regard to the reputation of Bolt.\n\n\"Usain Bolt's name will always live on,\" he said.\n\nBriton Farah, who had won the first of his four global double doubles of 5 000m and 10 000m to deafening cheers in London in 2012, put up a spirited and courageous effort but for the first time in six years of global championship competition he had to settle for silver behind Muktar Edris of Ethiopia.\n\nFarah, who started the championships in grand style by winning the 10,000m, had been left by Edris as the bell went and as hard as he tried he just didn't quite have the legs to pass his younger rival in the finishing straight.\n\n\"It's been amazing. It's been a long journey but it's been incredible,\" said Farah who was embraced by his fans as he made his way around the stadium on a lap of honour, stopping to sign autographs and pose for 'selfies'.\n\n\"It doesn't quite sink in until you compete here and cross the line -- I had a couple of minutes to myself -- that this is it.\"\n\nThe despair and disappointment of Bolt and Farah was in stark contrast to another hero from 2012 -- Australia's 100m hurdling great Sally Pearson.\n\nThe 30-year-old's grit and determination to come back from two years of injury hell -- she feared that she would have to have her hand amputated when she suffered a bone explosion in her wrist in 2015 -- was rewarded with her second world title.\n\nThe Australian celebrated in exuberant style, her mouth spread in a broad grin as she charged to the stands.\n\nShe tried to find her English mother Anne McLellan -- who had taken two jobs when she was raising her daughter as a single parent so she could go to training and achieve her dream -- and husband, childhood sweetheart Kieran, but without success.\n\n\"Far out, that was bloody hard,\" gasped Pearson.\n\n\"It's been a long journey back from injury, but to get this moment and go and celebrate in front of my family is unreal.\"\n\nBolt's dramatic failure to medal permitted American great Allyson Felix to sit on top of the overall career world medals table with 15 after she was part of the women's 4x100m relay gold-winning team.\n\nThe Americans had to fight hard to edge out the British team but in Bolt's relay it was the reverse as the host nation pulled off an impressive but shock win over the United States -- for whom 100m world champion two-time drugs cheat Justin Gatlin was booed by large sections of the stadium as he had been in the 100m even after he won the gold.\n\nElsewhere there was a gold for Russian Maria Lasitskene, competing as a neutral, who defended the women's high jump title and extended her winning streak to 25.\n\nIt was the first gold for Russian athletes competing at the championships but whose federation are still banned due to the doping scandal that affected all sports in the country.", "time": "22:49:00"}

times, said he plans on retiring after running his final races this week at the world championships in London.\n\nLast Saturday, in what everyone expects was his final individual race, Bolt had a bad start in the 100m and had to settle for a bronze medal. On Saturday, August 12, Bolt is slated to run in his last race overall, representing Jamaica in the 4x100m relay finals.\n\nBolt has easily been the most celebrated and highest-earning track star for a decade. So how much has he earned during his career?\n\nThe 30-year-old Bolt will pull in $34.2 million this year, according to Forbes, making him the 23rd-highest-paid athlete in the world. His latest ranking puts him ahead of any baseball player, and just behind golfer Jordan Spieth and basketball player Derrick Rose. There is no other track star in the top 100.\n\nAlmost all of Bolt's money comes from endorsements, including deals with Puma, Sprint, and Advil, Forbes says. Only $2.5 million of his earnings in the past 12 months are reportedly from race winnings and appearance fees at track events.\n\nThe $34.2 million for 2017 tracks slightly higher than 2016, when Forbes pegged Bolt's earnings at $32.5 million.\n\nAccording to CNBC, Bolt has been with Puma since 2002, when the sprinter was just 16. Prior to the 2016 Olympics, the deal was paying him $10 million a year. It's not clear how much the deal is worth now. Before his $10 million contract, Puma was said to be paying him $1.5 million a year, according to the Financial Times.\n\nBolt took home gold medals in all three Olympics appearances during his career, starting in 2008 in Beijing, in both the 100m and 200m.\n\nAfter Beijing, Bolt signed deals with Gatorade, Hublot, Virgin, and Visa.\n\nBolt's annual earnings have crept up steadily over the years, and increased significantly as he began piling up his collection of eight gold medals. In a 2009 RunBlogRun post, Bolt's earnings were said to be up to $3 million. His 2012 earnings were estimated at $20 million, and by 2014 he was up to $23 million, according to Forbes, good enough to make him the 63rd and 45th richest athlete in the world in those respective years.\n\nBeing fairly conservative, we can estimate that over the past decade Bolt has made more than $100 million, and perhaps even over $150 million.\n\nThere is unlikely to ever be a track star as rich as Bolt, because athletics earnings generally pay so little even to those at the top of their field. For instance, first place in the biennial World Championships is worth $60,000, and world records carry bonuses of $100,000 in that event, according to Forbes.\n\nMany countries also pay their athletes for competing and winning at the Olympics, and Jamaica is no exception. But the medal payouts are a pittance compared to decent endorsement deals: In 2016, Jamaica paid roughly $10,000 for each gold medal an athlete brought home. So Bolt was rewarded with about $30,000 for his haul of three gold medals that year.\n\nBolt seems to enjoy his fame and fortune. He reportedly owns a black Nissan GT-R worth $105,000, according to Business Insider, and a large mansion near Jamaica's capital.\n\nBolt is also known to love a great party. But not everyone is fond of his lifestyle.\n\n\"Between the bikes, loud, horrid music, parties and screams, I honestly wish he would go back to where he came from,\" his neighbor-model Jodi Stewart-Henriques wrote on Facebook in 2015. \"He's a horrible neighbor.\"", "time": "22:00:00"}

modern times, said he plans on retiring after running his final races this week at the world championships in London.\n\nLast Saturday, in what everyone expects was his final individual race, Bolt had a bad start in the 100m and had to settle for a bronze medal. On Saturday, August 12, Bolt is slated to run in his last race overall, representing Jamaica in the 4x100m relay finals.\n\nBolt has easily been the most celebrated and highest-earning track star for a decade. So how much has he earned during his career?\n\nThe 30-year-old Bolt will pull in $34.2 million this year, according to Forbes, making him the 23rd-highest-paid athlete in the world. His latest ranking puts him ahead of any baseball player, and just behind golfer Jordan Spieth and basketball player Derrick Rose. There is no other track star in the top 100.\n\nAlmost all of Bolt's money comes from endorsements, including deals with Puma, Sprint, and Advil, Forbes says. Only $2.5 million of his earnings in the past 12 months are reportedly from race winnings and appearance fees at track events.\n\nThe $34.2 million for 2017 tracks slightly higher than 2016, when Forbes pegged Bolt's earnings at $32.5 million.\n\nAccording to CNBC, Bolt has been with Puma since 2002, when the sprinter was just 16. Prior to the 2016 Olympics, the deal was paying him $10 million a year. It's not clear how much the deal is worth now. Before his $10 million contract, Puma was said to be paying him $1.5 million a year, according to the Financial Times.\n\nBolt took home gold medals in all three Olympics appearances during his career, starting in 2008 in Beijing, in both the 100m and 200m.\n\nAfter Beijing, Bolt signed deals with Gatorade, Hublot, Virgin, and Visa.\n\nBolt's annual earnings have crept up steadily over the years, and increased significantly as he began piling up his collection of eight gold medals. In a 2009 RunBlogRun post, Bolt's earnings were said to be up to $3 million. His 2012 earnings were estimated at $20 million, and by 2014 he was up to $23 million, according to Forbes, good enough to make him the 63rd and 45th richest athlete in the world in those respective years.\n\nBeing fairly conservative, we can estimate that over the past decade Bolt has made more than $100 million, and perhaps even over $150 million.\n\nThere is unlikely to ever be a track star as rich as Bolt, because athletics earnings generally pay so little even to those at the top of their field. For instance, first place in the biennial World Championships is worth $60,000, and world records carry bonuses of $100,000 in that event, according to Forbes.\n\nMany countries also pay their athletes for competing and winning at the Olympics, and Jamaica is no exception. But the medal payouts are a pittance compared to decent endorsement deals: In 2016, Jamaica paid roughly $10,000 for each gold medal an athlete brought home. So Bolt was rewarded with about $30,000 for his haul of three gold medals that year.\n\nBolt seems to enjoy his fame and fortune. He reportedly owns a black Nissan GT-R worth $105,000, according to Business Insider, and a large mansion near Jamaica's capital.\n\nBolt is also known to love a great party. But not everyone is fond of his lifestyle.\n\n\"Between the bikes, loud, horrid music, parties and screams, I honestly wish he would go back to where he came from,\" his neighbor-model Jodi Stewart-Henriques wrote on Facebook in 2015. \"He's a horrible neighbor.\"", "time": "06:52:00"}

showing.\n\nAs was to be expected, the Jamaican legend joked with the World Athletics Championship mascot before posing for his adoring fans inside the London Stadium.\n\nBut inside his head, long before the baton touched his palm, Bolt knew there was something wrong.\n\nScheduled for a 9.50pm start, the men's 4x100m relay final didn't start until after 10pm. Now that may not sound like much but athletes involved in sports which require explosive bursts will know all too well the importance of warming up.\n\nBolt was trusted with the final sprint of the Jamaican team's relay effort and he took off well when teammate Yohan Blake thrust the baton into his grasp but, just seconds later, Bolt was forced to pull up and a career of coasting to the finish line ended with the greatest sprinter of all time unable to even cross.\n\nAthletics fans would have felt that they'd had their fill of heartbreak an hour earlier, when Mo Farah was brought to tears after being forced to settle for silver in his last track race, but they quickly found out how cruel sport can be when Bolt had to limp away from his career in agony.\n\nFollowing the race, which was won by Great Britain, Bolt's teammates suggested the reason for the 30-year-old's hamstring injury.\n\n\"The race was 10 minutes late, we were kept 40 minutes. It was crazy,\" Blake said, via the BBC.\n\nAll those involved in the men's 4x100m relay final were forced to warm up several times because the delay resulted in their bodies cooling down.\n\n\"It was 40 minutes and two medal presentations before our run,\" 2011 world 100m champion Blake continued.\n\n\"We keep warming up and waiting, then warming up and waiting. I think it got the better of us.\n\n\"It hurts to see a true legend, a true champion go out there and struggle like that.\"\n\nSaturday night was not exactly a warm one in London and Omar McLeod, who began Jamaica's effort, echoed Blake's frustration with the organisers.\n\n\"It was ridiculous. We were there waiting, and we were really trying to stay warm, but it was really ridiculous, we waited a really long time,\" McLeod said, via Jamaica-Gleaner.\n\nMo Farah's lengthy lap of honour and two medal presentation ceremonies were responsible for the postponement which, according to the second Jamaican runner, Julian Forte, may have resulted in Bolt's muscles being too cold come race time.\n\n\"They kept us in the call room extremely long in our running kits, we were getting cold and it's not the warmest weather over here and they kept us a while. I think they really need to look into that and do something about it,\" Forte said.", "time": "06:59:00"}

A complete moment of heartbreak! Usain Bolt was all set to run the final race of his career - the 4x100 meters relay. But no one would have anticipated, not even in their wildest dreams that the greatest sprinter of all time would see such an end to his illustrious career. He pulled a cramp on his left hamstring as Jamaica Did Not Finish the race.\n\nIt was 9:50 into the night. London crowd waited with much anticipation for Bolt's final race of his career. Bang! Went the gun shot as the sprinters soared off their starting blocks. Great Britain took off with real pace, the Japanese followed behind. But the Jamaicans were slowly catching up. Yohan Blake blazed away to pass the baton to his final teammate, Bolt.\n\nGreat Britain was still leading then, followed by the Americans and the Jamaican team. Bolt clutched onto the baton and took off. Another sluggish start, but made an effort to tune up his speed. And just when it seemed he was catching up the hosts, he limped down the track as he had pulled a cramp on his left hamstring, sat down agonising in pain as Great Britain roared away with the gold. The team USA finished second, followed by Japan. Bolt sat there, tears rolled down his eyes as his teammates ran to console him.\n\nTwo moments of history at one time. Great Britain won their first 4x100m relay gold at World Athletics Championships. Silver twice, but gold for first time. The last time they had grabbed the top podium was in Olympics 2004 at Athens when they breezed past the then great Maurice Greene by one-hundreth of a second. Also, this was Jamaica's first defeat in this event since their shot to dominance in 2008. Not only did they miss out on their gold medal, but they failed to finish the race.\n\nJust one hundred meteres of space and now it has been inked in the pages of history. For Great Britain it was a moment to be applauded, to be cheered and for Bolt it was just consolation. But the crowd did salute as the Greatest Sprinter of all time waved with still tears running down his eyes, for one last time.", "time": "03:51:00"}

championships ended in disastrous fashion as he pulled up injured on the final leg of the men's 4x100m relay Saturday.\n\nBolt took the baton for Jamaica in third place but within a few strides he had fallen to the ground, clutching his left leg, as host Britain secured a shock gold ahead of a United States team containing Justin Gatlin.\n\nBolt beaten into third in the individual 100m behind Gatlin and his US team compatriot Christian Coleman, was comforted by teammates after getting to his feet, his face etched in pain.\n\nThe capacity crowd in the London Stadium was still digesting the shock earlier defeat for home hero Mo Farah in the men's 5,000m final, before the drama of Bolt's last agonizing appearance.\n\nHe had been bidding for a 12th world championship gold to bring down the curtain on his glittering career, but instead limped out of the London Stadium arena.\n\nVictory for the British quartet of CJ Ujah, Adam Gemili, who ran a storming second leg, Daniel Talbot and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake was stunning compensation for Farah's earlier defeat.\n\nThey won in 37.47 seconds, with the US taking silver at 0.05sec and Japan with a surprise bronze.\n\nFor his massive global following, the perfect script would have seen the Bolt of old running down Britain and the US for yet another gold, but it was not to be.\n\n\"He didn't tell us exactly what happened but from what I saw, it looked like a strain or a cramp of some sort,\" teammate Julian Forte told IAAF radio.\n\n\"He kept apologizing to us but we told him there was no need to apologize -- injuries are part of the sport.\"\n\nJamaican team doctor Dr Kevin Jones told AFP that Bolt had suffered from \"cramp in his left hamstring\".\n\n\"The last three weeks have been hard for him, you know. We hope for the best for him,\" he added.\n\nJamaica's 110m hurdles champion Omar McLeod, who ran the first leg for the quartet, summed up the feeling of everyone.\n\nFarah, who won the 10,000 title in dramatic fashion of the opening day at the London Stadium, had to settle for silver behind Ethiopian Muktar Edris in his final championship race on the track.\n\nHe edged out American Paul Chelimo in a desperate dash for the line, the last mile of a hitherto slow run race run in just under four minutes.\n\nFarah, 34, will now turn his attention to the marathon after failing in his bid to double up at the Olympics or World Championship for the fifth time, including double gold in London 2012 and the Rio Games last year.\n\nEdris, a former world junior champion, timed his last lap burst to perfection to win in 13 minutes 32.79 seconds, copying Farah's famous Mobot gesture as he crossed the line.\n\nIt was not the farewell Farah wanted, but he pointed to his earlier exertions in a dramatic 10,000m final as reason for lacking his usual devastating finish.\n\n\"The 10,000m took a lot more out of me than I had realized,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\n\"I gave it my all. I didn't have a single thing left to give at the end.\"\n\nTM & \u00a9 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved.", "time": "13:43:00"}

Mo Farah experienced some of their greatest moments in their careers at the 2012 Olympics in London but five years on and back in the same stadium, misery replaced joy on Saturday.\n\nBolt, who won the individual 100 and 200m and the 4x100m relay in London in 2012, collapsed to the track injured anchoring the Jamaica 4x100 metres relay team.\n\nIt was not the fairytale ending that fans of Usain Bolt and Mo Farah had imagined.\n\nJamaican team doctor Dr Kevin Jones said Bolt had suffered from \"cramp in his left hamstring\".\n\n\"But a lot of pain is from disappointment from losing the race,\" Jones said.\n\n\"The last three weeks have been hard for him, you know. We hope for the best for him.\"\n\nThe organisers brought on a wheelchair but Bolt shrugged them aside and he limped across the line, grimacing.\n\nJamaica's 110m hurdles champion Omar McLeod and relay team-mate said nothing had changed with regard to the reputation of Bolt.\n\n\"Usain Bolt's name will always live on,\" he said.\n\nBriton Farah, who had won the first of his four global double doubles of 5,000m and 10,000m to deafening cheers in London in 2012, put up a spirited and courageous effort but for the first time in six years of global championship competition, he had to settle for silver behind Muktar Edris of Ethiopia.\n\nFarah, who started the championships in grand style by winning the 10,000m, had been left by Edris as the bell went and as hard as he tried he just didn't quite have the legs to pass his younger rival in the finishing straight.\n\n\"It's been amazing. It's been a long journey but it's been incredible,\" said Farah who was embraced by his fans as he made his way around the stadium on a lap of honour, stopping to sign autographs and pose for 'selfies'.\n\n\"It doesn't quite sink in until you compete here and cross the line -- I had a couple of minutes to myself -- that this is it.\"\n\nThe despair and disappointment of Bolt and Farah was in stark contrast to another hero from 2012 -- Australia's 100m hurdling great Sally Pearson.\n\nThe 30-year-old's grit and determination to come back from two years of injury hell -- she feared that she would have to have her hand amputated when she suffered a bone explosion in her wrist in 2015 -- was rewarded with her second world title.\n\nThe Australian celebrated in exuberant style, her mouth spread into a broad grin as she charged into the stands.\n\nShe tried to find her English mother Anne McLellan -- who had taken two jobs when she was raising her daughter as a single parent so she could go to training and achieve her dream -- and husband, childhood sweetheart Kieran but without success.\n\n\"Far out, that was bloody hard,\" gasped Pearson.\n\n\"It's been a long journey back from injury, but to get this moment and go and celebrate in front of my family is unreal.\"\n\nBolt's dramatic failure to medal permitted American great Allyson Felix to sit on top of the overall career world medals table with 15 after she was part of the women's 4x100m relay gold-winning team.\n\nThe Americans had to fight hard to edge out the British team but in Bolt's relay it was the reverse as the host nation pulled off an impressive but shock win over the United States -- for whom 100m world champion two-time drugs cheat Justin Gatlin was booed by large sections of the stadium as he had been in the 100m even after he won the gold.\n\nElsewhere there was a gold for Russian Maria Lasitskene, competing as a neutral, who defended the women's high jump title and extended her winning streak to 25.\n\nIt was the first gold for Russian athletes competing at the championships but whose federation are still banned due to the doping scandal that affected all sports in the country.\n\nPublished Date: Aug 13, 2017 04:21 am | Updated Date: Aug 13, 2017 04:21 am\n\nTags :#000m race#100m sprint#2012 london olympics#5#Allyson felix#Athletics#Iaaf world athletics championships 2017#Justin gatlin#Maria lasitskene#Mo farah#Muktar edris#Sally pearson#Usain bolt", "time": "22:55:00"}

Usain Bolt's unparalleled career ended in extraordinary drama on Saturday as he pulled up with injury on the anchor leg of his very last race, the 4\u00d7100 metres relay final at the World Championships.\n\nThe 30-year-old had taken the baton for Jamaica a few metres adrift of the two leaders when, straining hard to catch them, he stopped abruptly with cramp in his left hamstring, began hobbling and tumbled to a halt after a forward roll.\n\nAs Britain went on to win gold, Bolt lay on his back in his lane, his head in hands, being tended to by medics as one waited with a wheelchair to help push him off the track.\n\nYet the sport's greatest enteartainer was determined that one of the finest careers in sport was not going to end with him in a wheelchair. So the fastest man of all-time, surrounded by his three worried team mates, Omar McLeod, Julian Forte and Yohan Blake, rose gingerly to his feet and limped the last 30 metres to the line.\n\nThe official result recorded that the Jamaicans did not finish but Bolt had been absolutely determined to ensure he completed the last race after a matchless career in which he won 19 major championship gold medals.\n\nTypically, Bolt's only thoughts were with the team mates he felt he had let down.\n\n\"He kept apologising to us but we told him there was no need to apologise,\" Forte said. \"Injuries are part of the sport.\"\n\nMcLeod added: \"It just happened - Usain Bolt's name will always live on.\"\n\nKevin Jones, the Jamaican team doctor, said Bolt had suffered cramp in his left hamstring.\n\n\"But a lot of pain is from disappointment from losing the race,\" he said. \"The last three weeks have been hard for him. We hope for the best for him\n\nWith the 56,000-strong crowd going wild about the British victory, there was still time for them to hail the sport's favourite performer, who waved to them a mite forlornly while hobbling away from the track.\n\nFive years ago, almost to the very night, British distance running hero Mo Farah had broken into Bolt's lightning bolt pose in this same stadium and the Jamaican had reciprocated with the Briton's trademark \"Mobot\" to mark their joyous supremacy at the London Olympics. Yet in the same stadium on Saturday, they attempted in vain to reprise that triumphant night, Farah ending up with silver in his final track race, over 5,000 metres, and Bolt suffering his anti-climactic farewell.\n\nTheir leaving of the track scene leaves a void in the sport that does not look like being filled any time soon.", "time": "07:06:00"}

in agony on Saturday as he pulled up injured running the final leg of the World Championships 4x100 metres relay as Britain stunned the United States to win a shock gold medal.\n\nBolt, who had to settle for bronze in the individual 100 metres, had been hoping to sign off from the sport by leading Jamaica to a fifth successive relay gold but they were struggling in third place when he collected the baton.\n\nAs he tried to gain ground, Bolt pulled up and fell to the floor with what looked like a hamstring injury.\n\nThe 60,000 in the stadium who had come to mark the farewell sport's greatest showman had only a split second to absorb what was happening as up ahead a new chapter was being written.\n\nThe U.S., with individual gold and silver medallists Justin Gatlin and Christian Coleman running the second and fourth legs, had been expected to push the Jamaicans all the way but they were always trailing the slick Britons.\n\nThe brilliantly executed race by Chijindu Ujah, Adam Gemili, Danny Talbot and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake gave Britain gold in 37.47 seconds, breaking an 18-year-old national record, and the world title for the first time.\n\n\"I wasn't sure if I had won or not, I gave it my all but I could see Christian Coleman out of the corner of my eye,\" said Mitchell-Blake.\n\n\"The feeling of euphoria was from infinity. I can't register it.

Bolt's predecessor as an athletics superstar, Michael Johnson, whose 200 metres world record Bolt broke in the 2008 Olympic final.\n\n\"You can compare us as sprinters, but the thing I am most proud of is that I did multiple events and I long-jumped.\" - Damned with faint and grudging praise by American legend Carl Lewis who also cast aspersions as to the Jamaican doping system to which Bolt retorted: \"Carl Lewis, I have no respect for him.\"\n\n\"He is an icon. He is the best sprinter of all time.\" - Former International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Jacques Rogge, who was chided at the 2012 London Olympics for refusing to say he was a legend. Former Olympic yachtsman Rogge instead opted to nominate British yachting icon Ben Ainslie as his star of the Games.\n\n\"Nobody's ever been faster than this guy! Ever! Of all the billions of people.\" - Then-US President Barack Obama reflects on the global nature of Bolt's stardom after meeting with him in Jamaica and then performing the lightning bolt pose with him.\n\n\"Usain Bolt is now Jamaica's biggest ambassador. His personality, his ability to draw people to him (and) his showmanship have really given a boost to Brand Jamaica.\" - Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness neatly sums up Bolt's gift to the Caribbean island.\n\n- Bolt on himself -\n\n*****\n\n\"I am Lightning Bolt! I am not Flash Gordon or anybody. My name is Bolt, Lightning Bolt.\" - Bolt after smashing Michael Johnson's 200m world record in the 2008 Beijing Olympic final to complete his first of three individual Olympic sprint doubles.\n\n\"Manners is the key thing. Say for instance when you're growing up you're walking down the street you've got to tell everybody good morning. Everybody. You can't pass one person.\" - Bolt displaying why he has charmed everyone along the way, never forgetting the strict but grounded way he was brought up by his parents, father Wellesley and mother Jennifer.\n\n\"People come to see you run fast, but they also come to see a show, a performance... that's what I give them.\" - Bolt savvy as ever and why athletics will miss him so much: not just for his jaw-dropping brilliance but also his ability to entertain.\n\n\"I'm now a legend, I'm also the greatest athlete to live. I am in the same category as Michael Johnson.\" - Bolt after winning the 2012 Olympic 200m title to complete the individual sprint double double.\n\n\"If Queen Elizabeth knight hooded me and I would get the title Sir Usain Bolt. That would sound very nice.\" - Bolt on the possibility of joining Mo Farah as a knight of the Realm. Not wholly implausible as he has been athletics' knight in shining armour for nearly a decade.", "time": "21:28:00"}

a pre-race holding area - for over 30 minutes in their running gear, making it difficult to stay warm.\n\n\"I knew something bad would happen to someone. It was madness,\" Gatlin said.\n\nForte believes that the organisers should look seriously into the delay and have it addressed.\n\n\"They kept us in the Call Room extremely long in our running kits. We were getting cold, and it's not the warmest weather over here, and they kept us a while. I think they really need to look into that and do something about it,\" said Forte.\n\nThe race itself went off close to 10 minutes after its scheduled 9:50 p.m. start.\n\n\"It was ridiculous! We were there waiting. I think they had, like, three minutes, and we were really trying to stay warm, but it was really ridiculous. We waited a really long time,\" added an emotional McLeod, who said that he was desperate to help send off Bolt with another gold medal. \"I drank like two bottles of water.\"\n\nThe event was won by Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 37.47 seconds, with the USA taking the silver in 37.52. Japan were third in 38.04.\n\n\"It's tragic,\" Blake lamented. \"Everything didn't go according to plan. They were holding us too long in the Call Room. The race was 10 minutes late, inside was really cold, and Usain said to me 'Yohan, I don't like this'.\"\n\n\"We kept warning up, jumping up and down. I think the weather got the better of us. We were waiting too long, and there was a hell of a walk as well. It was just crazy and to see a true legend of the sport to go down like that, and we as Jamaicans and the world don't like to see that. We wanted him to go out in style, and we went out there to give it our all, and it came to that,\" Blake added.\n\nIt was Jamaica's first loss in a Men's 4x100m relay at the World Championships since 2007.", "time": "06:42:00"}

Farah experienced some of their greatest moments in their careers at the 2012 Olympics in London but five years on and back in the same stadium, misery replaced joy on Saturday.\n\nBolt, who won the individual 100 and 200m and the 4x100m relay in London in 2012, collapsed to the track injured anchoring the Jamaica 4x100 metres relay team.\n\nJamaican team doctor Dr Kevin Jones said Bolt had suffered from \"cramp in his left hamstring\".\n\n\"But a lot of pain is from disappointment from losing the race,\" Jones said.\n\n\"The last three weeks have been hard for him, you know. We hope for the best for him.\"\n\nThe organisers brought on a wheelchair but Bolt shrugged them aside and he limped across the line, grimacing.\n\nJamaica's 110m hurdles champion Omar McLeod and relay team-mate said nothing had changed with regard to the reputation of Bolt.\n\n\"Usain Bolt's name will always live on,\" he said.\n\nBriton Farah, who had won the first of his four global double doubles of 5,000m and 10,000m to deafening cheers in London in 2012, put up a spirited and courageous effort but for the first time in six years of global championship competition he had to settle for silver behind Muktar Edris of Ethiopia.\n\nFarah, who started the championships in grand style by winning the 10,000m, had been left by Edris as the bell went and as hard as he tried he just didn't quite have the legs to pass his younger rival in the finishing straight.\n\n\"It's been amazing. It's been a long journey but it's been incredible,\" said Farah who was embraced by his fans as he made his way around the stadium on a lap of honour, stopping to sign autographs and pose for 'selfies'.\n\n\"It doesn't quite sink in until you compete here and cross the line - I had a couple of minutes to myself - that this is it.\"\n\nThe despair and disappointment of Bolt and Farah was in stark contrast to another hero from 2012 - Australia's 100m hurdling great Sally Pearson.\n\nThe 30-year-old's grit and determination to come back from two years of injury hell - she feared that she would have to have her hand amputated when she suffered a bone explosion in her wrist in 2015 - was rewarded with her second world title.\n\nThe Australian celebrated in exuberant style, her mouth spread in a broad grin as she charged to the stands.\n\nShe tried to find her English mother Anne McLellan - who had taken two jobs when she was raising her daughter as a single parent so she could go to training and achieve her dream - and husband, childhood sweetheart Kieran but without success.\n\n\"Far out, that was bloody hard,\" gasped Pearson.\n\n\"It's been a long journey back from injury, but to get this moment and go and celebrate in front of my family is unreal.\"\n\nBolt's dramatic failure to medal permitted American great Allyson Felix to sit on top of the overall career world medals table with 15 after she was part of the women's 4x100m relay gold-winning team.\n\nThe Americans had to fight hard to edge out the British team but in Bolt's relay it was the reverse as the host nation pulled off an impressive but shock win over the United States - for whom 100m world champion two-time drugs cheat Justin Gatlin was booed by large sections of the stadium as he had been in the 100m even after he won the gold.\n\nElsewhere there was a gold for Russian Maria Lasitskene, competing as a neutral, who defended the women's high jump title and extended her winning streak to 25.\n\nIt was the first gold for Russian athletes competing at the championships but whose federation are still banned due to the doping scandal that affected all sports in the country. - Nampa-AFP", "time": "23:08:00"}

much more cheers and applause than the winner.\n\nJamaican \"lightning\" Usain Bolt lost his first-ever world championships final to his rivals, in the last 100m race of his career last Saturday, while 35-year-old American Justin Gatlin, 2005 world champion, emerged the surprise winner in 9.92 seconds, 0.03 seconds ahead of Bolt.\n\n\"The place is wonderful and I appreciated this crowd so much. It is just one of those things, thank you to London for all your love and appreciation,\" said Bolt, who was treated by the capacity crowd and the organizers as a winner, receiving undimished cheers and applause from the adoring spectators and doing the lap of honor as if he had won.\n\nAfter the race, Gatlin bowed down to Bolt as if saluting a king or being remorseful for ruining the Jamaican's chance of ending his career with a record fourth gold medal in the blue-ribbon 100m.\n\nBolt admitted he was disappointed but would never change his idea of retiring because the new life ahead is more inviting.\n\n\"I told you guys whatever happens this season I'd come out and do my best. I did it for the fans. I worked hard, I'm definitely disappointed I didn't win, but no one is going to be happy to not win,\" said Bolt after the race.\n\n\"It doesn't change anything, for me. I think I lost to a great competitor and a young kid who is coming up and is very talented, with a great future ahead of him. No regrets, I came out and did my best; win lose or draw. I was always going to walk away. I've done all I can for the sport, so it's time to go,\" he added.\n\n\"I'm excited to just live normally and get up and know that I have no training for once and can do what I want. I will miss the sport for sure, but I get a chance to live and travel when I want. I don't know where I will go or where my career will go, but it's exciting,\" he said.\n\nAlthough missing out on a golden finish in the individual race, Bolt, turning 31 next week, will still stand as the greatest sprinter in history.\n\nFor a decade, he has been this intimidating figure on the track for his opponents -- winning all the Olympic or world championship finals he was in, except one hiccup when he false started in the 100m final in Daegu world championships in 2011.\n\nAs his career extends, Bolt keeps making history, storming to eight Olympic golds and 11 world titles and holds the world records of 9.58 seconds in the 100m and 19.19 seconds in the 200m.\n\nHis legendary achievements were well recognized by the sports world as he was named IAAF Athlete of The Year six times and was a four-time Laureus Awards winner.\n\nAthletics' world governing body head Sebastian Coe lavished with praises for him.\n\n\"He is the best sprinter of all time,\" the British said a few days ago. \"Usain Bolt is a genius. I can't think, other than Muhammad Ali, of anybody that has so had an impact inside or beyond their sport.\n\n\"You can have the Friday-night-in-the-pub conversations about who is best footballer or tennis player, but there is no argument about this guy in sprinting.\"\n\nAdmirations also come from Bolt's peers. World and Olympic champion Allyson Felix spoke highly of the Jamaican.\n\n\"I think he's really changed the sport, he's brought a lot of excitement, he's a performer and we can all just appreciate it, everything he's done and given to this sport,\" she said at a pre-competition conference.\n\nBolt has won the affection of so many not just with his feats but also a charismatic personality.\n\nGrowing a goatee may give him a touch of maturity while he would still give the big innocent grin at the cameras on the starting line, joke with Hero the Hedgehog and flash thumbs-up sign to the crowd and make his trademark pose of shooting off invisible arrows despite the third place finish.\n\nAs Coe put it, what the crowd is going to miss is the personality, an athlete with humor, good grace as well as almost insurmountable sprinting achievements.\n\n\"We do want athletes with personality. It's nice to have someone who has a view and fills the room and fills a stadium,\" Coe said about Bolt who has 4,762,800 followers on Twitter and 18,775,000 followers on Facebook.\n\nNow Bolt is officially retiring, and the sport is left with a huge void for losing its most dazzling star.", "time": "17:48:00"}

In the warm-up area, we give ourselves respect and greeted each other. Usain Bolt is a great athlete.\"\n\nKevin Jones, the Jamaican team doctor, said Bolt had suffered cramp in his left hamstring.\n\nJamaican team manager Ian Forbes praised Bolt for \"going out there and giving his all\" and added that the squad were \"very saddened\".\n\n\"The diagnostic work will be done shortly to determine how serious it is.

"body": "By Mitch Phillips\n\nLONDON, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Usain Bolt's final appearance on the track ended in agony on Saturday as he pulled up injured running the final leg of the World Championships 4x100 metres relay as Britain stunned the United States to win a shock gold medal.\n\nBolt, who had to settle for bronze in the individual 100 metres, had been hoping to sign off from the sport by leading Jamaica to a fifth successive relay gold but they were struggling in third place when he collected the baton.\n\nAs he tried to gain ground, Bolt pulled up and fell to the floor with what looked like a hamstring injury.\n\nThe 60,000 in the stadium who had come to mark the farewell sport's greatest showman had only a split second to absorb what was happening as up ahead a new chapter was being written.\n\nThe U.S., with individual gold and silver medallists Justin Gatlin and Christian Coleman running the second and fourth legs, had been expected to push the Jamaicans all the way but they were always trailing the slick Britons.\n\nThe brilliantly executed race by Chijindu Ujah, Adam Gemili, Danny Talbot and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake gave Britain gold in 37.47 seconds, breaking an 18-year-old national record, and the world title for the first time.\n\n\"I wasn't sure if I had won or not, I gave it my all but I could see Christian Coleman out of the corner of my eye,\" said Mitchell-Blake.\n\n\"The feeling of euphoria was from infinity. I can't register it. We smashed the British record to pieces.\"\n\nBritain's only other men's global sprint relay golds came in the 1912 and 2004 Olympics.\n\nIt completed a great night for the host nation's sprinters after their women had earlier taken silver behind the Americans in the sprint relay, their best performance since the first championships in 1983.\n\nThe U.S. men took silver in 37.52 but for a nation that used to be totally dominant in the event, it was only their second medal in the last eight global finals after a series of world championship and Olympic disqualifications. Japan took advantage of Jamaica's travails to take third in 38.04. (Editing by Ed Osmond)", "time": "21:59:00"}

I think they really need to look into that and do something about it,\" said Forte.\n\nThe race began close to 10 minutes after it's scheduled 9:50 p.m. start and took place after a couple medal ceremonies.\n\n\"It was ridiculous. We were there waiting, and we were really trying to stay warm, but it was really ridiculous, we waited a really long time,\" added an emotional McLeod, who said he was desperate to help send off Bolt with another gold medal.\n\nThe event was won by Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 37.47 seconds with the USA taking the silver in 37.52.

final of the men's 4x100m relay final at the 2017 IAAF World Championships in London yesterday.\n\nUsain Bolt's glittering career swansong came crashing to an end when he pulled up on the anchor leg of the world 4x100m relay won by Britain yesterday.\n\nBolt received the baton with Jamaica in third, but halfway down his leg the towering sprinter pulled up clutching his left thigh, eventually doing a forward roll to the ground, to gasps from the 60,000 sell out London Stadium.\n\nThe British quartet of Chijindu Ujah, Adam Gemili, Daniel Talbot and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake claimed gold in 37.47 seconds, with the Justin Gatlin-led US four taking silver at 0.05sec and Japan a surprise bronze (38.04).\n\nEarlier, Tori Bowie became the first double gold medallist at the world championships, anchoring the US team to the 4x100-meter relay title ahead of Britain and Jamaica.\n\nAt the same time, Allyson Felix, running the second leg on the winning team, earned a record 15th medal at the world championships in a career going back to 2005.\n\nBowie, who won the 100 meters this week, ran a strong anchor leg, leaving behind the opposition to finish in 41.82 seconds.\n\nBritain took silver in 42.12 and two-time defending champion Jamaica earned bronze in 42.19.\n\nGermany's Johannes Vetter won the javelin yesterday as his great rival and Olympic champion Thomas Rohler missed out on the podium.\n\nVetter's opening throw of 89.89 metres was enough to win the gold and the 24-year-old was overcome with emotion after clinching the title, mopping his tears on a German flag.\n\nCzech Republic pair Jakub VaQatar's Ahmed Budair finished 10th with a best throw of 81.77 metres.", "time": "23:54:00"}

In the warm-up area, we give ourselves respect and greeted each other. Usain Bolt is a great athlete.\"\n\nKevin Jones, the Jamaican team doctor, said Bolt had suffered cramp in his left hamstring.\n\nJamaican team manager Ian Forbes praised Bolt for \"going out there and giving his all\" and added that the squad were \"very saddened\".\n\n\"The diagnostic work will be done shortly to determine how serious it is. He was able to walk to the team bus so hopefully that signals it's not as serious as it possibly could be,\" Forbes said.\n\nWith the 56,000-strong crowd going wild about the British victory, there was still time for them to hail the sport's favourite performer, who waved to them a mite forlornly while hobbling away from the track.\n\nFive years ago, almost to the very night, British distance running hero Mo Farah had broken into Bolt's lightning bolt pose in this same stadium and the Jamaican had reciprocated with the Briton's trademark \"Mobot\" to mark their joyous supremacy at the London Olympics.\n\nYet in the same stadium on Saturday, they attempted in vain to reprise that triumphant night, Farah ending up with silver in his final track race, over 5,000 metres, and Bolt suffering his anti-climactic farewell.\n\nTheir leaving of the track scene leaves a void in the sport that does not look like being filled any time soon.\n\nReuters", "time": "02:58:00"}

"LONDON (Reuters) - Usain Bolt's final track appearance ended with pain and frustration on Saturday as he pulled up injured running the final leg of the World Championships 4x100 metres relay as Britain stunned the United States to win a shock gold medal.\n\nBolt, who had to settle for bronze in the individual 100 metres, had been hoping to sign off from the sport by leading Jamaica to a fifth successive world relay title but they were struggling in a distant third place when he collected the baton.\n\nAs he tried to gain ground, Bolt pulled up and fell to the floor midway down the home straight with what was later described as cramp in his left hamstring.\n\nHowever, the 60,000 in the stadium who had come to mark the farewell of sport's greatest showman had only a split second to absorb what was happening as up ahead history was being made by the host nation.\n\nThe United States, with individual 100m gold and silver medallists Justin Gatlin and Christian Coleman running the second and fourth legs, had been expected to push the Jamaicans all the way but they were always trailing the slick Britons.\n\nBrilliantly executed exchanges by Chijindu Ujah, Adam Gemili, Danny Talbot and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake gave Britain gold in 37.47 seconds, breaking an 18-year-old national record and European record and securing the world title for the first time.\n\n\"I wasn't sure if I had won or not, I gave it my all but I could see Christian Coleman out of the corner of my eye,\" said Mitchell-Blake.\n\n\"The feeling of euphoria was from infinity. I can't register it. We smashed the British record to pieces.\"\n\nFive years ago Talbot and the 18-year-old Gemili messed up a changeover as Britain were disqualified in the semi-finals of their own Olympics on the same London track so it was a particularly sweet moment for the two.\n\n\"To run it with Danny Talbot after such disappointment in London 2012, it is so special to come back,\" said Gemili, who was not selected for the individual races and missed an Olympic 200m bronze by three thousandths of a second last year.\n\n\"It's crazy. Honestly a dream and a reality tonight.\"\n\nBritain's only other men's global sprint relay golds came in the 1912 and 2004 Olympics while their winning time that beat their 1999 best of 37.73 has only been bettered by Jamaica and the U.S.\n\nIt completed a great night for the host nation's sprinters after their women had earlier taken silver behind the Americans in the sprint relay, their best performance since the first championships in 1983.\n\nThe U.S. men took silver in 37.52 but for a nation that used to be totally dominant in the event, it was only their second medal in the last eight global finals after a series of world and Olympic disqualifications.\n\n\"After DQs in recent years we knew we had to get the baton round and to finish the night smoothly is a fantastic achievement and we'll enjoy our moment on the podium,\" said Gatlin.\n\n\"The Brits had a hell of a race. You can't take it from them. They had the pressure of running on home soil and they delivered.\"\n\nOn his old rival Bolt he said: \"This is farewell time, I am sentimental about it already now.\"\n\nJapan took advantage of Jamaica's travails to take third in 38.04, just holding off China (38.34).", "time": "22:32:00"}

dramatic fashion as he collapsed injured on the track anchoring Jamaica's 4\u00d7100 metres relay in the world championship final.\n\nHere AFP Sports picks out five of his best quotes and five about him since he first light up the championship track at the 2008 Beijing Olympics:\n\n- What they said about him -\n\n\"There is no athlete that can compete with him... he's a global superstar.\" -- Bolt's predecessor as an athletics superstar, Michael Johnson, whose 200 metres world record Bolt broke in the 2008 Olympic final.\n\n\"You can compare us as sprinters, but the thing I am most proud of is that I did multiple events and I long-jumped.\" -- Damned with faint and grudging praise by American legend Carl Lewis who also cast aspersions as to the Jamaican doping system to which Bolt retorted: \"Carl Lewis, I have no respect for him.\"\n\n\"He is an icon. He is the best sprinter of all time.\" -- Former International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Jacques Rogge, who was chided at the 2012 London Olympics for refusing to say he was a legend. Former Olympic yachtsman Rogge instead opted to nominate British yachting icon Ben Ainslie as his star of the Games.\n\n\"Nobody's ever been faster than this guy! Ever! Of all the billions of people.\" - Then-US President Barack Obama reflects on the global nature of Bolt's stardom after meeting with him in Jamaica and then performing the lightning bolt pose with him.\n\n\"Usain Bolt is now Jamaica's biggest ambassador. His personality, his ability to draw people to him (and) his showmanship have really given a boost to Brand Jamaica.\" - Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness neatly sums up Bolt's gift to the Caribbean island.\n\n\"I am Lightning Bolt! I am not Flash Gordon or anybody. My name is Bolt, Lightning Bolt.\" - Bolt after smashing Michael Johnson's 200m world record in the 2008 Beijing Olympic final to complete his first of three individual Olympic sprint doubles.\n\n\"Manners is the key thing. Say for instance when you're growing up you're walking down the street you've got to tell everybody good morning. Everybody. You can't pass one person.\" - Bolt displaying why he has charmed everyone along the way, never forgetting the strict but grounded way he was brought up by his parents, father Wellesley and mother Jennifer.\n\n\"People come to see you run fast, but they also come to see a show, a performance... that's what I give them.\" - Bolt savvy as ever and why athletics will miss him so much: not just for his jaw-dropping brilliance but also his ability to entertain.\n\n\"I'm now a legend, I'm also the greatest athlete to live. I am in the same category as Michael Johnson.\" - Bolt after winning the 2012 Olympic 200m title to complete the individual sprint double double.\n\n\"If Queen Elizabeth knighthooded me and I would get the title Sir Usain Bolt. That would sound very nice.\" - Bolt on the possibility of joining Mo Farah as a knight of the Realm. Not wholly implausible as he has been athletics' knight in shining armour for nearly a decade.", "time": "06:40:00"}

I'm sorry he got this injury. He is still the best in the world,\" Gatlin said.\n\n\"This is farewell time, I am sentimental about it already now. In the warm-up area, we give ourselves respect and greeted each other. Usain Bolt is a great athlete.\"\n\nKevin Jones, the Jamaican team doctor, said Bolt had suffered cramp in his left hamstring.\n\nJamaican team manager Ian Forbes praised Bolt for \"going out there and giving his all\" and added that the squad were \"very saddened\".\n\n\"The diagnostic work will be done shortly to determine how serious it is. He was able to walk to the team bus so hopefully that signals it's not as serious as it possibly could be,\" Forbes said.\n\nWith the 56,000-strong crowd going wild about the British victory, there was still time for them to hail the sport's favourite performer, who waved to them a mite forlornly while hobbling away from the track.\n\nFive years ago, almost to the very night, British distance running hero Mo Farah had broken into Bolt's lightning bolt pose in this same stadium and the Jamaican had reciprocated with the Briton's trademark \"Mobot\" to mark their joyous supremacy at the London Olympics.\n\nYet in the same stadium on Saturday, they attempted in vain to reprise that triumphant night, Farah ending up with silver in his final track race, over 5,000 metres, and Bolt suffering his anti-climactic farewell.\n\nTheir leaving of the track scene leaves a void in the sport that does not look like being filled any time soon.\n\nReuters", "time": "06:44:00"}

his hamstring and failed to finish the IAAF World Championships 4x100 metres relay final.\n\nBolt, whose final individual event was the 100m decider last weekend and in which he could only take bronze, bowed out in distressing fashion, laying in pain on the ground and failing to finish as Great Britain took gold from the United States.\n\nThe Jamaican - an eight-time Olympic champion and 14-time World Championships medallist - was helped up by his team-mates and hobbled off the track as the crowd inside London Stadium celebrated a first GB gold in the event since Athens 2004.\n\nThere was a slice of history for Allyson Felix as she picked up a 15th medal on this stage with the US taking gold in the women's 4x100m, while Mo Farah's final track race at this level failed to bring a fifth-straight distance double and Sally Pearson returned to her throne as the 100m hurdles champion.\n\nJamaica were third when Bolt took the baton from Yohan Blake, an injury doubt before the race, and his eagerness to catch Christian Coleman and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake proved his undoing.\n\nThe 30-year-old cramped up and failed to finish, with Britain ending up the unlikely winners ahead of a US team that included 100m champion Justin Gatlin and Japan.\n\nIt provided a disappointing end to the iconic sprinter's career, but 110m hurdles champion Omar McLeod, who ran the first leg for Jamaica, assured Bolt will always be remembered as one of the all-time greats.\n\n\"Everybody was jelly, everybody was pumped. Usain Bolt's name will always live on,\" he told reporters.\n\nAn injury sustained while diving across the line to take gold in the 100m final last weekend forced Tori Bowie to withdraw from the 200m.\n\nAfter skipping the 4x100m heat, Bowie showed the electric pace that secured her individual medal by holding off Great Britain's Daryll Neita on the final leg, with Jamaica - who did not have Elaine Thompson in their line-up - coming third.\n\nTheir time of 41.82s was the fastest of the year and the gold provided Felix with a record-breaking 15th medal at the World Championships, taking her past the hauls of Merlene Ottey and Bolt.\n\nShe has a chance of adding to her unprecedented tally in the 4x400m relay on Sunday.\n\nFarah has dominated distance racing on the track since his first of four straight 5000m and 10,000m doubles at the 2012 Olympics, but he could not make it five on the trot back at the site of his first.\n\nThe 34-year-old led the pack for the majority of the race and reeled in the final breakaway from Patrick Tiernan with 600m remaining. However, Muktar Edris had more left in his legs down the home straight and the 23-year-old forced the 10,000m champion to settle for silver as he celebrated with his rival's trademark 'Mobot' celebration.\n\nFarah set off on a lap of honour to wave goodbye to the home crowd who have supported him so brilliantly throughout the Championships, with his future laying on the tarmac after the Diamond League final in Zurich later this month.\n\n\"It's been amazing. It's been a long journey but it's been incredible. It doesn't quite sink in until you compete here and cross the line - I had a couple of minutes to myself - that this is it,\" he said.\n\nAfter missing the 2015 World Championships due to a horror wrist injury and Rio 2016 with a hamstring tear, Pearson reclaimed her throne at the site of her greatest triumph with a time of 12.59s.\n\n\"It's been a long journey back from injury, but to get this moment and go and celebrate in front of my family is unreal,\" said Pearson. \"My husband is in the crowd there somewhere, I'll try and find him and give him a hug soon. This is just so incredible to be a world champion again.\"\n\nMassive congrats to @sallypearson on an amazing comeback from injury. We're all better when Sally is in the blocks next to us. #IAAFWorlds -- USATF (@usatf)\n\nAugust 12, 2017\n\nDawn Harper Nelson took silver with a season's best 12.63s while Pamela Dutkiewicz edged world-record holder Harrison out by two hundredths.\n\nAfter a strong start Harrison clipped the second and third hurdles, providing more disappointment after she missed out on a spot at last year's Olympics.", "time": "21:59:00"}

down in his final race at the world athletics championships in London.\n\nThe Jamaican great brought the curtain down on his glittering career by limping across the line injured in the 4x100 metres relay at the world athletics championships in London.\n\nFor a man who has won 19 global titles, who has transformed athletics, it was a sorry way to go. But dramatic too. And Bolt does drama in big time.\n\nNine years after exploding onto the world stage with two jaw-dropping world records at the Beijing Olympics, five after he declared himself a \"living legend\" by retaining his titles in London, and one after lighting up yet another Games in Rio, Bolt waved goodbye to the crowd as he hobbled down the home straight at the London Stadium.\n\nThe greatest career athletics has even seen - over.\n\nBut the 30-year-old was so much more than a medal machine.\n\nThe saviour of athletics: it is a tag Bolt has lived with through the dark days of doping scandals during which it sometimes seemed that only he could keep the sport from going under.\n\nThe task of how to fill the void his departure will leave is a gargantuan one.\n\nBolt appeared destined for greatness since becoming, aged 15 in 2002, the youngest world junior champion by taking 200m gold on home soil in Kingston.\n\nIf that set the teenager from Trelawny on the road to stardom, his performances at the Beijing Olympics six years later sealed it.\n\nFuelled by a diet of chicken nuggets, he set a 100m world record of 9.69, despite celebrating well before crossing the line, spreading his arms and slapping his chest.\n\nInternational Olympic Committee president Jacques Rogge branded his showboating disrespectful. He could not have been more out of touch.\n\nHere was a man to take athletics into a new stratosphere.\n\nThe following year he set world records - 9.58secs over 100m, 19.19s over 200m - which look set to stand for years.\n\nThey were mind-boggling marks from a sprinter who looked different too.\n\nAt 6ft 5in he towered over his rivals and, once he had recovered from his always troublesome start, his speed was awesome.\n\nBut it has always been about so much more than the race with Bolt. It is the whole show. He has made athletics fun like no one else.\n\nBe it his dancing, his joking, his celebrating, his 'Lightning Bolt' pose - no one does it better.\n\nEnergy, excitement, humour, charisma - it is all there, even in the briefest of moments.\n\nSprinters of the past used to prowl around the start line, sporting their best menacing looks, before a race. Bolt has made them all look just a little bit foolish.\n\nBolt has, somehow, managed to tread the line between arrogance and humility exactly right.\n\nHe knows he is special and he is not afraid to say it.\n\nBut he is also aware of his responsibility to the sport, particularly in an age of repeated doping scandals, and when his biggest rival, Justin Gatlin, is a two-time drug cheat.\n\nBolt has been directly affected by doping. He is no longer a nine-time Olympic champion, having lost his 4x100m gold from the 2008 Olympics when teammate Nesta Carter failed a retrospective drugs test.\n\nThat fact will not affect his legacy, though.\n\nNor will the fact he had to settle for 100m bronze, behind champion Gatlin and young American Christian Coleman, in the 100m in London, the final individual race of his career.\n\nHis hero status is secure.\n\nBolt has hailed South Africa's 400m world record holder Wayde van Niekerk as the man to inherit his mantle.\n\nYet the pair are contrasting characters and expecting Van Niekerk to fill the void left by the larger-than-life, one-of-a-kind Jamaican is hugely unfair.\n\nIf athletics chiefs want a new Bolt, they could be in for a long wait.", "time": "00:00:00"}

However, even as Usain Bolt folded onto the track in agony from a hamstring cramp while anchoring the Jamaican 4x100m team in his final competitive race, it was clear that global athletics will miss him.\n\nAlthough the tumble denied Bolt one final medal, the sprint legend, after apologising to his teammates, refused a wheelchair and limped across the finish line at the 16th IAAF World Championships in London to end what has been an outstanding career.\n\nIt's the nature of the man who left the world wide-eyed and O-mouthed when he broke the 100m and 200m records at the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, then lowered both marks at the Berlin World Championships in 2009.\n\nOver the past decade Bolt has won 156 of his 168 races and now has eight Olympic gold, 11 World Championship gold and a Commonwealth gold.\n\nIn his column posted on the Daily Telegraph website last night, the newspaper's Chief Sports Feature Writer Oliver Brown stated: \"Losing Usain Bolt to athletics is like losing the air. He is an elemental presence; the one figure capable of elevating a humble foot race to a mid-summer blockbuster.\n\n\"When he begins life on Sunday as an ex-athlete, his last race run, he stands to be missed more than even he, with his carefree Caribbean swagger, can comprehend.\"\n\nPointing out that Bolt takes 41 strides to cover 100m when most of his rivals needed 44, Brown stated emphatically that \"Bolt saved athletics at a time when few realised it needed saving. He became supra-national, belonging as much to Jamaica as to the world.\"\n\nIndeed, Brown pointed to a most appropriate quote from IAAF President Sebastian Lord Coe to describe Bolt: \"I can't think of anybody else besides Muhammad Ali who has captured the public imagination or a global audience like Bolt,\" Lord Coe said. \"He has gone way, way beyond athletics.\"", "time": "03:28:00"}

career\n\nUsain Bolt ended his stellar career in excruciating pain.\n\nThe Jamaican great crumpled to the track with a left-leg injury as he was chasing a final gold medal for the Jamaican 4x100-meter relay team Saturday at the world championships in London.\n\nHaving to make up lots of ground on the anchor leg, Bolt suddenly screamed and stumbled as he came down with his farewell shattered by the first injury he has experienced at a major competition.\n\nJamaican team doctor Kevin Jones said Usain Bolt had a cramp in his left hamstring.\n\n\"A lot of the pain is from disappointment from losing the race,\" Jones said.\n\nThat wasn't the only surprise. Britain went on to beat the United States in a tight finish.\n\nThe 60,000-seat stadium was primed for one last Bolt show, one last \"To the World\" pose after a victory, but the injury made it blatantly clear why Bolt is ready to retire. His body can no longer hold up.\n\nAs Bolt fell to the ground, the leg with the golden shoe giving way, the crowd still went wild because the home team went on to win gold in 37.47 seconds, .05 seconds ahead of the United States.\n\nIt was yet another amazing upset in a championship of so many.\n\nBefore Bolt came onto the track, he was consoling Mo Farah, his long-distance equivalent who had just lost his first major race since 2011 when he failed to get gold in the 5,000 meters.\n\nFarah also was bidding farewell to the track.\n\nTori Bowie was the unlikely first double gold medalist at the championships, anchoring the U.S. team to the 4x100-meter relay title ahead of Britain and Jamaica.\n\nAt the same time, Allyson Felix, running the second leg on the winning team, earned a record 15th medal at the world championships in a career going back to 2005.\n\nBowie also won the 100 meters.\n\nIn the 100-meter hurdles, East St. Louis native Dawn Harper-Nelson was second to Australia's Sally Pearson. Harper-Nelson was the 2008 Beijing Games champion, with Pearson taking silver. Four years later at the London Olympics, the order was reversed.\n\nFormer NHL coach Murray dies * Bryan Murray, the longtime coach and general manager who worked in the NHL for 35 consecutive seasons, has died at 74.\n\nHe was diagnosed in 2014 with incurable colon cancer. Murray worked that season and another as general manager of the Ottawa Senators, who confirmed his death Saturday.\n\nOne of the most respected and well-liked figures in hockey, Murray served as general manager in Anaheim, Florida, Detroit and Ottawa and coached in Washington, Detroit, Florida, Anaheim and Ottawa. He won the Jack Adams Award as NHL coach of the year with the Capitals in 1983-84 and reached the Stanley Cup Finals with the Senators in 2007.\n\nFederer advances to Rogers Cup final * Roger Federer advanced to the Rogers Cup final with a 6-3, 7-6 (5) victory over unseeded Robin Haase of the Netherlands Saturday in Montreal.\n\nThe second-seeded Federer is seeking a third Rogers Cup title to go with wins in 2004 and 2006. The 36-year-old is on a 16-match winning streak, his longest since 2012. In Sunday's final, Federer will face 20-year-old Alexander Zverev of Germany.\n\nThe women's final Sunday in Toronto will feature fifth-seeded Elina Svitolina and sixth-seeded Caroline Wozniacki.\n\nAssociated Press", "time": "03:24:00"}

In fact Usain said to me: 'Yohan, I think this is crazy. Forty minutes and two medal presentations before our run.'\n\n\"We keep warming up and waiting, then warming up and waiting. Then we saw a true legend, a true champion go out there and struggling like that.\"\n\nBolt picked up the baton on the final leg with Jamaica in third place but he barely made it halfway down the track before beginning hopping in agony then collapsing to the floor with cramp in his left hamstring.\n\nOmar McLeod, who led off the Jamaican team, said: \"It's heart-wrenching, I gave it my all and I really wanted Usain to leave golden - even if it was just a medal. It was really heart-wrenching. I couldn't believe it, I'm in shock, utter disbelief.\n\n\"It was ridiculous,\" he added. \"We were there around 45 minutes waiting outside, I think they had three medal ceremonies before we went out so we were really trying our hardest to stay warm and keep upbeat. But it was ridiculous. We waited a really long time.\"\n\nHis team-mate Julian Forte was also shocked. \"I felt like it happened to me, I was on the corner at the time when it happened, it's devastating,\" he said.\n\nBritain's men set a national record of 37.47sec to take gold, with the United States second in 37.52 and Japan third in 38.04. Adam Gemili, who proved his fitness beyond doubt after being controversially left out of the individual 200m, called it \"the best feeling in the world\".", "time": "22:41:00"}

Bolt was the most exciting thing to happen to track-and-field since at least Michael Johnson and his gold shoes, and even that would only be from the perspective of American fans. There's never been a non-American track star capable of pulling this kind of weight here, even as Bolt is proudly Jamaica's own.\n\nAnd for casual track fans, it all started with the 2008 Beijing Olympics. And his unbelievable brilliance. And that turn and that smile and those arms thrown wide.\n\nThe amazing thing here is Bolt set a world record of 9.69 seconds in that 100m run -- despite his showboating. Despite a huge lead, he saved the showboating in the 200m for after his record-setting performance of 19.30 seconds:\n\nBolt actually broke both of his world records the following year, at the world championships in Berlin. American Tyson Gay, who had been injured for the 2008 Olympics, pushed him harder in the 100m, which helped that.\n\nBut Bolt's 200m performance was even more dominant than in Beijing.\n\nWe may never again see an athlete like Usain Bolt.

Yohan Blake was missing from the team, but Bolt magic proved enough for Jamaica.\n\nDespite the horrific end to Bolt's race, the London crowd cheered one of the greatest sporting heroes.\n\nWATCH VIDEO\n\nGREAT BRITAIN WINS GOLD 4X100M RELAYS USAIN BOLT PULLS UP #iaafworlds #usainbolt pic.twitter.com/gWsqPuuJ17 -- KNUCKLE-UP TV (@Knuckleuptv)\n\nAugust 12, 2017\n\nThe sprint legend, who had won the 100m, 200m and 4x100m Gold at the same venue during the 2012 Olympics, might not have had a perfect end to his career, but his records over the years will definitely make him a once-in-a-lifetime athlete.\n\nCheck out how Twitterati reacted to Bolt's final race.\n\nDevastating way for #UsainBolt to end his incredible career.

bronze medal in his last individual race, last weekend's 100m final, Bolt had hoped to bow out with a 12th World Championships gold.\n\nSUPER SALLY: Pearson seals comeback with gold in 100m

women's high jump.\n\n\"They were holding us too long,\" said Blake. \"To be holding us so long was atrocious.\n\n\"That long wait contributed.

As a true friend, I didn't like it one bit.\n\n\"He was saying he was sorry, but there was nothing to be sorry for, he's done it for us [over his career].\"\n\nDr Kevin Jones, the Jamaica team doctor, said of Bolt's injury: \"It's cramp in his left hamstring but a lot of pain is from the disappointment from losing the race.\n\n\"The last three weeks have been hard for him.

"http://xnewspress.com/2017/08/athletics-usain-bolt-anchors-jamaican-4x100-to-victory/", "body": "Now Bolt is officially retiring, and the sport is left with a huge void for losing its most dazzling star. This is why everyone was so anxious for him to go out on a high note.\n\nJustin Gatlin, who many assume to be Bolt's arch-nemesis, thundered home ahead of the 6ft 5inch Jamaican, with his United States teammate Christian Coleman pipping Bolt to the line as well. Despite this shortcoming, he never complained and carried on and became the legend that he is. Now, for the rest of his life, he'll be thinking himself foolish for not doing so. A 21-year-old Christian Coleman too went past the Jamaican by a hundredth of a second.\n\nIt wasn't the tone of a man who had made athletics more popular. Bolt has been running on the IAAF \"circuit\" since 2001 when he ran in the IAAF World Youth Championships, but it wasn't until the 2008 Summer Olympics that the entire world learned about him.\n\nThe USA should be rivals, though in Rio previous year they were disqualified after Gatlin received the baton outside the first change-over zone.\n\nBut God help him if foolish pride compels him to forego retirement to redeem himself. \"Off the last hurdle I gave everything and threw myself for a dip just in case\".\n\nBolt, meanwhile, was insistent that neither Gatlin's win nor his own loss were disasters for track. \"And Gatlin will always be the Man Who Beat Bolt\", read ESPN's article.\n\n\"You guys call it losses, losses, losses\", Gatlin said. Because those jeers foreshadowed critics bringing up his four-year suspension in 2006 for performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) either to qualify his feat or to mollify Bolt's defeat. Working in the Press Office has allowed me to be fortunate enough to observe some of these stories first hand, and where better to start than the \"media loop\"?\n\nNow Bolt finds himself at the end of his career.\n\nFinally, to see so many other athletes being awarded medals at these championships in respect of previous games is most definitely just desserts for all concerned and great to see British athletes Jessica Ennis Hill and Jo Pavey being awarded gold and bronze medals which goes back to the Championships of 2011 and 2007. Granted, this was because a member of his relay team tested positive. \"Usain Bolt is a genius\".\n\nBirds of a feather stick together.\n\nBolt acknowledged that Yohan Blake would likely come in for the final, all the while praising his less experienced relay teammates.\n\nBolt will be joined in the heats by a supporting cast of Tyquendo Tracey, Julian Forte and Michael Campbell - a few of the athletes who will be charged with keeping the island in the forefront of global sprinting in the years to come.\n\nThere was a build up before Gatlin and Bolt had a showdown at the Championship. As always, Bolt delivered. Quite unlike the sprint races, it gives ample scope to enact the \"us against him\" battles. \"It's ridiculous. Who cares?\"\n\nFarah, who is switching to the marathon from next year, competes in his final major track event at the scene of his 2012 Olympic triumph, with a fervent sell-out crowd at the London Stadium ready to roar on their hero in the 5,000m.\n\nOther commentaries like \"Jones Admits Using Steroids: Why Marion, Why...?\" L'affaires Marion Jones and Justin Gatlin - to name just two - had dragged the sport into the pits.

the turf with what appeared to be a hamstring injury.\n\nGreat Britain upset the apple cart in 37.47 seconds, pipping the USA into second with 37.52 seconds, while Japan grabbed bronze in 38.04 seconds.\n\nBolt was just about to get into top gear when he grimaced, held the baton up in his right hand, before falling over front ways, as his long-time partner Blake went on his knees in disbelief.\n\nThe packed Olympic Stadium was in a state of confusion as british fans celebrated their team's success while their much beloved global star was left writhing in pain. It was not the image fans wanted to remember but, sadly, it was the last one of the legend.\n\nBolt was helped to his feet by his teammates and medical personnel and limped away to applause as fans said goodbye to the fastest man that ever lived.\n\nNugent Walker, his lifetime best friend and executive manager, who was there at the beginning, was also there at the end. He raced onto the track to assist.\n\nThe applause kept going until Bolt was no longer visible as he made his way to the medical area for treatment.\n\nBlake, who had the distinction of handing the final relay baton to Bolt, was just as distraught, and disappointment was evident on his face as he and teammates blamed the officials for holding the athletes for far too long in the call room.\n\n\"Well, he didn't get to do what he wanted to do; things didn't go his way. He was feeling really good and we were feeling in high spirits. I think they were holding us too long. It was a long walk as well, and inside was really cold, and two medal presentations before we run,\" bemoaned Blake.\n\n\"I didn't like it to see Usain, the world's fastest man, struggling like that. His muscle froze on him and we were so distraught. He is my true friend and training partner and I felt it,\" he added.\n\nJulian Forte, who ran a scorcher on the backstretch, also speculated that Bolt's injury could have been due to the long waiting period before the race.\n\n\"They kept us in the call room extremely long, so we were getting cold. It's not the warmest weather over here, and they had us around there for quite a while, so I think they really need to look into that and do something about it,\" he argued.\n\n\"I was on the corner when it happened and I didn't want to believe it; it was devastating,\" said Forte.\n\nHe continued: \"I really wanted to be a part of the team that sent Usain off in style. But, unfortunately, it's just one of those things that happen. It's a part of the sport.\"\n\nThe 110m hurdles champion, Omar McLeod, who was brought in to start the relay and actually got the better of Mike Rodgers on the opening leg, was distraught and in tears.\n\n\"I gave it my all and I really wanted especially Usain to leave golden. It was really hard,\" said an emotional McLeod.\n\nMcLeod also bashed the long waiting period before the race. \"It was ridiculous. We were there like four to five minutes. I think they had like two to three medal ceremonies before we went out. We tried our hardest to try and stay warm,\" McLeod pointed out.\n\nMeanwhile, Jamaica won bronze in the women's 4x100m relay in a season's best 42.19 seconds. Running without Elaine Thompson, Jamaica started with Jura Levy, followed by Natasha Morrison, Simone Facey, and Sashalee Forbes, and they were right there with winners, the USA before Tori Bowie sprinted away for victory in 41.82 seconds. Great Britain were second in 42.12 seconds, with Germany fourth in 42.36 seconds.\n\nTeam manager Ian Forbes told the Jamaica Observer that the coach thought that Elaine Thompson was \"not in the kind of condition to run\", hence her omission.\n\nLevy said Thompson's absence didn't really affect the team as they produced a season's best and was right there in the mix.\n\n\"I am pretty pleased because we went out there and gave our best. We got a medal, so I couldn't be more pleased,\" said the diminutive runner.\n\nNatasha Morrison, who ran a brilliant second leg, was still draped in the national flag when she spoke to the media. \"I am very pleased. I just went out there with a positive mind just to stay focused and get the baton around safely to get team in the top three.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Kemoy Campbell finished 10th in the 5,000m in 13:39.74 minutes in a race in which British favourite Mo Farah was beaten in second by Ethiopia's Muktar Edris in 13:32.79 minutes. Farah, who also retires from competitive racing, just failed to complete the 5,000/10,000m golden double, and won silver in 13:33.22 minutes.\n\nCampbell was more than satisfied with his historic display as he put Jamaica on the map in long distance running.\n\n\"I came here with the intention of making the final and I got 10th, so I can look at someone and say, 'hey, Jamaican distance runner got 10th,'\" Campbell said.\n\n\"They probably won't believe it, but it's there for them to see, so OK I'm very happy with my performance, even though I wanted more,\" he added.\n\n\"It feels good, but there is a lot of work to be done, and I will have to go back to the drawing board and come back stronger next time and hopefully be in medal contention,\" said Campbell.\n\nJamaica's medal count now stands at four, inclusive of one gold and three bronze, with the country currently lying in 14th place in the medals standing. The USA continue to lead with 27 medals, including nine gold. Kenya are second with eight medals, including three gold, with Poland rounding out the top three with seven medals, including two gold.", "time": "03:04:00"}

If you want to see the 4\u00d7100 meter relay injury that ended his career, you can find the grim video and photos here.\n\nBut why not rejoice in the wonder that he brought us instead? Bolt was the most exciting thing to happen to track-and-field since at least Michael Johnson and his gold shoes, and even that would only be from the perspective of American fans. There's never been a non-American track star capable of pulling this kind of weight here, even as Bolt is proudly Jamaica's own.\n\nAnd for casual track fans, it all started with the 2008 Beijing Olympics. And his unbelievable brilliance. And that turn and that smile and those arms thrown wide.\n\nThe amazing thing here is Bolt set a world record of 9.69 seconds in that 100m run - despite his showboating. Despite a huge lead, he saved the showboating in the 200m for after his record-setting performance of 19.30 seconds:\n\nBolt actually broke both of his world records the following year, at the world championships in Berlin. American Tyson Gay, who had been injured for the 2008 Olympics, pushed him harder in the 100m, which helped that.\n\nBut Bolt's 200m performance was even more dominant than in Beijing.\n\nWe may never again see an athlete like Usain Bolt. He was the best sprinter in the world at both standard sprinting distances for nine years, from 2007 to 2016. That he faltered at the end shouldn't matter.\n\nWe'll always have Beijing.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/08/usain-bolt-final-race-injury-career-2008-beijing-olympics-world-record-100m-200m-video", "time": "23:10:00"}

It was madness,\" Gatlin said.\n\nForte believes that the organisers should look seriously into the delay and have it addressed.\n\n\"They kept us in the Call Room extremely long in our running kits. We were getting cold, and it's not the warmest weather over here, and they kept us a while. I think they really need to look into that and do something about it,\" said Forte.\n\nThe race itself went off close to 10 minutes after its scheduled 9:50 p.m. start.\n\n\"It was ridiculous! We were there waiting. I think they had, like, three minutes, and we were really trying to stay warm, but it was really ridiculous. We waited a really long time,\" added an emotional McLeod, who said that he was desperate to help send off Bolt with another gold medal. \"I drank like two bottles of water.\"\n\nThe event was won by Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 37.47 seconds, with the USA taking the silver in 37.52. Japan were third in 38.04.\n\n\"It's tragic,\" Blake lamented. \"Everything didn't go according to plan. They were holding us too long in the Call Room. The race was 10 minutes late, inside was really cold, and Usain said to me 'Yohan, I don't like this'.\"\n\n\"We kept warning up, jumping up and down. I think the weather got the better of us. We were waiting too long, and there was a hell of a walk as well. It was just crazy and to see a true legend of the sport to go down like that, and we as Jamaicans and the world don't like to see that. We wanted him to go out in style, and we went out there to give it our all, and it came to that,\" Blake added.\n\nIt was Jamaica's first loss in a Men's 4x100m relay at the World Championships since 2007.", "time": "05:30:00"}

in the 4x100 metres relay at the world athletics championships in London.\n\nFor a man who has won 19 global titles, who has transformed athletics, it was a sorry way to go. But dramatic too. And Bolt does drama in big time.\n\nNine years after exploding onto the world stage with two jaw-dropping world records at the Beijing Olympics, five after he declared himself a \"living legend\" by retaining his titles in London, and one after lighting up yet another Games in Rio, Bolt waved goodbye to the crowd as he hobbled down the home straight at the London Stadium.\n\nThe greatest career athletics has even seen - over.\n\nBut the 30-year-old was so much more than a medal machine.\n\nThe saviour of athletics: it is a tag Bolt has lived with through the dark days of doping scandals during which it sometimes seemed that only he could keep the sport from going under.\n\nThe task of how to fill the void his departure will leave is a gargantuan one.\n\nBolt appeared destined for greatness since becoming, aged 15 in 2002, the youngest world junior champion by taking 200m gold on home soil in Kingston.\n\nIf that set the teenager from Trelawny on the road to stardom, his performances at the Beijing Olympics six years later sealed it.\n\nFuelled by a diet of chicken nuggets, he set a 100m world record of 9.69, despite celebrating well before crossing the line, spreading his arms and slapping his chest.\n\nInternational Olympic Committee president Jacques Rogge branded his showboating disrespectful. He could not have been more out of touch.\n\nHere was a man to take athletics into a new stratosphere.\n\nThe following year he set world records - 9.58secs over 100m, 19.19s over 200m - which look set to stand for years.\n\nThey were mind-boggling marks from a sprinter who looked different too.\n\nAt 6ft 5in he towered over his rivals and, once he had recovered from his always troublesome start, his speed was awesome.\n\nBut it has always been about so much more than the race with Bolt. It is the whole show. He has made athletics fun like no one else.\n\nBe it his dancing, his joking, his celebrating, his 'Lightning Bolt' pose - no one does it better.\n\nEnergy, excitement, humour, charisma - it is all there, even in the briefest of moments.\n\nSprinters of the past used to prowl around the start line, sporting their best menacing looks, before a race. Bolt has made them all look just a little bit foolish.\n\nBolt has, somehow, managed to tread the line between arrogance and humility exactly right.\n\nHe knows he is special and he is not afraid to say it.\n\nBut he is also aware of his responsibility to the sport, particularly in an age of repeated doping scandals, and when his biggest rival, Justin Gatlin, is a two-time drug cheat.\n\nBolt has been directly affected by doping. He is no longer a nine-time Olympic champion, having lost his 4x100m gold from the 2008 Olympics when teammate Nesta Carter failed a retrospective drugs test.\n\nThat fact will not affect his legacy, though.\n\nNor will the fact he had to settle for 100m bronze, behind champion Gatlin and young American Christian Coleman, in the 100m in London, the final individual race of his career.\n\nHis hero status is secure.\n\nBolt has hailed South Africa's 400m world record holder Wayde van Niekerk as the man to inherit his mantle.\n\nYet the pair are contrasting characters and expecting Van Niekerk to fill the void left by the larger-than-life, one-of-a-kind Jamaican is hugely unfair.\n\nIf athletics chiefs want a new Bolt, they could be in for a long wait.", "time": "23:31:00"}

injury and agony.\n\nThe British quartet of CJ Ujah, Adam Gemili, Danny Talbot and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake pipped the United States to gold in a world-leading 37.47 seconds, but only after Bolt had pulled up on his anchor leg and collapsed to the track.\n\nBolt, who had to settle for bronze in the individual 100 metres, had been hoping to sign off from the sport by leading Jamaica to a fifth successive relay gold but they were already struggling in third when he collected the baton.\n\nAs he tried to gain ground, Bolt pulled up and fell to the floor with what looked like a hamstring injury.\n\nThe United States, with individual gold and silver medallists Justin Gatlin and Christian Coleman running the second and fourth legs, had been expected to push the Jamaicans all the way.\n\nInstead, a brilliantly executed race by Chijindu Ujah, Adam Gemili, Danny Talbot and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake gave Britain gold in 37.47 seconds, the best time in the world this year.\n\nThe USA took silver in 37.52secs and Japan the bronze.\n\nRead More Top news stories today", "time": "21:47:00"}

"Kevin Mayer stayed on course to be crowned decathlon champion and Usain Bolt said there are \"no words\" to describe his feelings after Jamaica qualified for the 4x100 metres relay final at the IAAF World Championships.\n\nMayer holds a 116-point advantage over Rico Freimuth with only the javelin and the 1500m to come on Saturday evening at London Stadium.\n\nThe Frenchman maintained his march towards a first world title with strong showings in the 110m hurdles, discus and pole vault.\n\nBolt will have the chance to end his career with another gold medal after he led Jamaica home to reach a relay showdown a week after he could only take bronze in the a 100m final won by the controversial Justin Gatlin.\n\nFollowing legs by Tyquendo Tracey, Julian Forte and Michael Campbell, Bolt finished off the job as Jamaica won their heat in a season's best 37.95 seconds.\n\nBolt will later bring down the curtain on a sensational career, going for a record 15th medal at the Championships and what he hopes will be a 12th gold.\n\nMayer led the way after day one of the multi-discipline event and continued his march to a first major global title by taking his points tally to 7237.\n\nHe ran a personal best of 13.75 seconds in the 110m hurdles in the morning session of the penultimate day, with only Damian Warner (13.63) and Freimuth (13.75) faster.\n\nGerman Freimuth reduced the deficit by winning the discus with a throw of 51.17m to Mayer's 47.14m, but Mayer cleared 5.10m in the pole vault at the third attempt to ensure he still leads the way.\n\nFreimuth cleared 4.80m, but failed at 4.90m and remains second ahead of compatriot Kai Kazmirek.\n\nBolt had to listen to boos when Gatlin failed to read the script in the 100m final last weekend, but the noise generated by the crowd in the relay heats was music to his ears.\n\nHe said: \"There are no words to describe how I am feeling. I get so much support from the crowd. I appreciate that a lot. The young runners in our team - it is just about executing and coming through the race for them.\n\n\"All the energy I am getting from the crowd. It is brilliant. We have been training that relay, there were some camps. Still there were some mistakes. Yohan Blake coming in for the final is definitely good.\"\n\nGatlin and the United States will be aiming to deny Bolt again on the penultimate night after they won the first heat in a world-leading 37.70secs.\n\nThe United States have already amassed a mammoth 23 medals - 15 more than second-placed Kenya - and they should be able to count on another two in the 4x400m relay finals on Sunday.\n\nBoth the women and the men were quickest in their heats, with world-leading times of 3:21.66 and 2:59.23 respectively.\n\nIsaac Makwala's hopes of claiming a medal for an emotional World Championships ended when Botswana failed to make the final in his absence.", "time": "14:36:00"}

medal, but the race didn't go to script. The Jamaican pulled up injured on the home straight, with Britain steaming through to claim gold.\n\nSprint legend Usain Bolt pulled up injured on the anchor leg in the 4x100m relay, denying him of the gold medal he craved at the end of his glittering career.\n\nBolt, who had to settle for bronze in the individual 100m, had been hoping to end his career by leading Jamaica to a fifth successive relay gold - and hopes were high with Jamaica also boasting newly-crowned 110m hurdles champion Omar McLeod, Julian Forte and Yohan Blake in their line-up.\n\nBut they were already struggling in third when he collected the baton after a couple of sloppy handovers. Halfway down the home straight the towering sprinter pulled up clutching his left thigh, eventually doing a forward roll to the ground, to gasps from the sell-out London Stadium.\n\nThe British quartet of Chijindu Ujah, Adam Gemili, Daniel Talbot and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake claimed gold in 37.47 seconds, with the Justin Gatlin-led US four taking silver 0.05 seconds behind. Japan claimed a surprise bronze in 38.04, just ahead of China.\n\nBowie the relay hero\n\nIndividual champion Tori Bowie anchored the United States to victory in the women's 4x100 metres relay at the World Championships on Saturday.\n\nThe Americans, Olympic gold medallists in Rio last year, were led off by Aaliyah Brown who flew out of the blocks to start the run that brought them the world title they last won in 2011.\n\nAllyson Felix ran the second leg before passing on to Morolake Akinosun who handed the baton to Bowie, the 100m world champion.\n\nThe 26-year-old was shadowed down the final straight by Briton Daryll Neita who led her team to silver ahead of 2015 champions Jamaica. Great Britain finished second ahead of Jamaica.\n\nGermany's Johannes Vetter won the javelin at the World Athletics Championships on Saturday as his great rival and Olympic champion Thomas Rohler missed out on the podium.\n\nVetter's opening throw of 89.89 metres was enough to win the gold and the 24-year-old was overcome with emotion after clinching the title, mopping his tears on a German flag.\n\nCzech Republic pair Jakub Vadlejch and Petr Frydrych threw personal bests of 89.73 and 88.32 respectively to take silver and bronze.\n\nMo Farah narrowly failed to complete a fifth successive world double on Saturday when he finished second behind Ethiopian Muktar Edris in a thrilling 5,000m world final.\n\nThe legendary British athlete, whose winning run in the 5,000m at Olympics and world finals stretched back to 2011, fought desperately to claw back the deficit in the finishing straight but Edris held on to win in 13min 32.79sec.\n\nA two-time double world champion and two-time double Olympic champion, Farah finished in 13:33.22 in what was his last race on the track, before retiring only to compete in marathons.\n\nFarah, who had won the 10,000m last Friday to open the championships with a bang, finished just clear of Kenyan-born Paul Chelimo, who took the bronze in 13:33.30.\n\nGermany picked up two medals in the decathlon behind France's Kevin Mayer.\n\nMayer became the first athlete other than the now-retired Ashton Eaton to win a world decathlon event since 2011 when he claimed gold in the world championships.\n\nOlympic silver medallist Mayer amassed a total of 8,768 points from the 10 disciplines in the gruelling two-day event.\n\nGermany's Rico Freimuth took silver with 8,564 while teammate Kai Kazmirek claimed bronze (8,488).", "time": "21:41:00"}

We are confident we can win. We will go and prepare well for tonight,\" said Michael Rogers, who ran the first leg for the United States.\n\nBritain were second in the first heat in 37.76, also faster than Jamaica's time, while Japan were third.

leg injury\n\nA weekend after finishing third in the 100-meter dash final at the IAAF World Championships, Usain Bolt tumbled to the track in the final race of his world-renowned career, succumbing to an apparent leg injury in the 4x100-meter relay final Saturday and failing to finish the event before being helped to the finish line by Team Jamaica teammates.\n\nResponsible for the anchor leg of the relay, the eight-time Olympic gold medalist pulled up shortly after taking the baton, then laid on the track before getting up to finish.\n\nGreat Britain came from behind amid Bolt's collapse to top the United States for a gold medal, and Jamaica landed a did-not-finish designation, as noted by ESPN. Helped along by his teammates, Bolt did cross the finish line barefoot. But it was hardly the sendoff anyone anticipated for the world-record sprinter.\n\nAn 11-time world champion and the first athlete to hold 100- and 200-meter world records since fully automatic time became mandatory, the 30-year-old Bolt said he planned to retire from racing after this year's events. Named a World Athlete of the Year and Track & Field Athlete of the Year in seasons past, he holds a trio of Olympic titles in the 200-meter event.", "time": "23:34:00"}

draw, our athletes deserve the full support of Jamaicans for their participation in the IAAF World Championships in London. They were competitive, if not always in front, and represented Jamaica well. Hopefully we will go out in glory with the running of the relays; but whether or not, Jamaica was big in London this year.\n\nIt's not the expected medal haul, but when they start returning to the island I am sure Sport Minister Olivia \"Babsy\" Grange will be according them full welcome and official honours. We must not fall short of the accolades given in times of victory. The same quality welcome and salutations should be offered as done when they bring back gold to our shores.\n\nWe did not do as well as predicted, but Jamaica still has the respect of the world's athletes and will be a formidable team at the 2020 Olympics to be held in Tokyo, Japan. You might say we were just using these championships as a trial run for the big one in Japan. Certainly we can look back at our failings and slip-ups and emerge stronger for the next round as we will have regrouped and identified where the weaknesses are.\n\nI am one of the few that believe that the little beating will do us a world of good as we come down off our pomp and pride.\n\nHaving ruled the roost for the past 15 years, let's understand that victory can be a cyclical thing and we just have to pick ourselves up and get back into the ring.\n\nAnd, congratulations and thanks once again to Usain Bolt. Even in losing he was a champion when he congratulated rival Justin Gatlin and gave him words of encouragement. Bolt has been a winner all his life, but when it came to losing he took it well and rose to the supreme level of sportsmanship.\n\nI came across this quotation recently which I think defines him: \"So he lost his final race, but when were men's finest hours defined solely by the ultimate outcome? What of their spirit, individual acts of supreme courage and bravery? What of their honesty, the way in which they represented their countries and enhanced the great values of their sport? Such qualities are the bedrock of the game.\"\n\nThe other quotation that comes to mind is one that is often met with derision by those who prefer to assess greatness by the number of wins: \"For when the great scorer comes to write against your name, He marks not that you won or lost but how you played the game.\"\n\nApart from his records on the track, Bolt has left us with something else, something that can be priceless. His phenomenal performances on the track have been transposed to the ranks of legend.\n\nLegends don't come easily. I went to Wikipedia to look up legend -- Usain Bolt sends me there often as I try to define and put his awesome contributions into some perspective.\n\n\"A legend is a narrative of human actions that are perceived both by teller and listeners to take place within human history and demonstrating human values, and which possesses certain qualities that give the tale verisimilitude.\n\n\"Legend, for its active and passive participants, includes no happenings that are outside the realm of 'possibility', but may include miracles.\n\n\"Legends may be transformed over time in order to keep them fresh... vital and realistic. Many legends operate within the realm of uncertainty, never being entirely believed by the participants, but also never being resolutely doubted\".\n\nWhile in Opposition Grange suggested naming the Trelawny Multi-purpose Stadium in honour of both Bolt and Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce. This was in August 2015 during the IAAF World Championships in Beijing. I wrote at the time that the Usain Bolt Stadium would be most appropriate. Bolt ought to drive past that complex on his way home, a short distance away. But the point had to be made that the stadium would need to be upgraded and converted into something with more international appeal than an empty shell of a cricket bowl going to waste.\n\nI further suggested that we could encourage the Chinese -- who built it in the first place -- to help us create a modern, world-class international sports training centre worthy of the name Usain Bolt, where people from all over the world would come to train in track and field, swimming, soccer, cricket, boxing, gymnastics, basketball, netball, you name it.\n\nThe Chinese came to mind not only as a source for funding, but because of Bolt's association with Beijing, where he is already considered a legend because of his performances in the Bird's Nest stadium.\n\nI even cautiously suggested adding Beijing to the name -- Bolt/ Beijing Stadium -- as a teaser for the Chinese to show interest and conjure up possibilities. I admit, though, that the double name may not go down well with Bolt supporters.\n\nAn international sports training complex in Jamaica with accommodations, a calendar of major and mega events, indoor and outdoor facilities, lecture halls, convention meeting space would make Jamaica a mecca for sports development.\n\nSports marketing moves to the next level when you have a world-class institution that can promote tourism and economic development through sports. The Bolt International Multi-Sports Complex would not only attract in-house trainees, but also serve up weekly events to suit Jamaican as well as overseas fans who would fly to the island for the event and hopefully fill our hotel rooms.\n\nSports marketing is a big part of the vaunted National Tourism Plan, but frankly we haven't been seeing those major happenings that can engage visitors through sports on a regular basis with Brand Jamaica.\n\nIn the meantime, just remember this: Bolt may have retired, but he will never go away. He has given us some snapshots of greatness that will be this generation's privilege to carry for the rest of our lives. How can we ever forget the build-up to the various events when Bolt sometimes ran us crazy with reports of partying through the night, fab trips to European spas, and questions about his training, or lack thereof, hanging in the air and confounding our calculations?\n\nHe arrives at an airport and is treated like a prince, the porters fight with each other to carry his luggage, he gives tonnes and tonnes of interviews. Then the moment he approaches the track he romps almost boyishly to the starting blocks, smiles and waves at the crowds, and we know he is enjoying himself. Our confidence level grows as he looks around at his rivals, as if they are all pretenders to a throne that will always be his.\n\nHis showmanship is supreme. Nobody does it like Bolt. His familiar 'shhh' gesture is a kind of code to his fans -- wait for it. Then, as he gets down to his mark he makes the sign of the cross and points a finger upwards as if to remind us, \"Is not me, is Him.\" And, after going through the finish line first, he does his famous 'Lightning Bolt' pose to the world. All of this has made him an institution beyond athletics.\n\nOur prayers are answered. The legend has won. Half-Way-Tree rejoices. We will never see his likes again. But we can never forget.", "time": "08:30:00"}

Usain Bolt, the legendary sprinter, ran his last race on Aug. 12, competing in the 4x100m relay at the World Athletics Championships. Unfortunately, he suffered a painful injury on the track and came in last.\n\nIn front of a packed Olympic stadium in London, England, the man dubbed \"the fastest human on the planet\" took his last run around the track. Usain Bolt, 30, joined by his fellow countryman, raced in the 4x100m relay. With the sun setting on Usain's historic career, many wondered if \"Lighting Bolt\" could pull out one more victory to end things on a high note. Unfortunately, things did NOT go as planned. The gold medalist wasn't able to finish the race in a speedy fashion, having suffered a painful leg injury that left him lying on the track almost in tears. But like a true competitor, Usain did eventually limp his way to the finish line.\n\nIt has been known for years that this would be the last time fans would see Usain run. The initial plan was for him to retire in 2016, Usain said in 2015, per CNN. \"[B]ut my sponsor has asked me to go on for another year, to 2017 and London.\" Usain's 2016 was a year lined with gold, as he left the Rio Olympics with another three-pack of medals. He won the 100m, the 200m, and the 4x100m relay, completing the \"triple-triple,\" as he had taken gold in those three events in the past three Olympic games (though he would be stripped of one medal when a teammate tested positive for a banned substance.)\n\nWhile Usain seemed like he hadn't lost a step in 2016, they soon saw why he decided to retire. He barely won his last race before the world championships, edging out American Isiah Young by only 0.03 seconds at a 100m race in Monaco on July 21, according to NBC Sports. Usain was still proud, as he completed the race in 9.95 seconds. \"I'm going into right direction, still lot of work to do,\" he said, a \"Sub-10 always good.\" Sadly, it wasn't good enough in the 100m world championship race in London.\n\nNormally, running 100-meters in under 10-seconds should be considered a physical marvel, but for that night, Usain wasn't fast enough. Yes, he did clock in at 9.95, but he fell behind Christian Coleman, 21, who finished second at 9.94. It was Usain's Olympic rival, Justin Gatlin, 35, who beat Usain at his last solo race, winning it with a time of 9.92 seconds. While it's sad that Usain would end his solo sprinting career with a loss, it wouldn't tarnish his legacy as one of, if not THE the greatest runners to ever hit the track.\n\nAre you sad that Usain is retiring, HollywoodLifers? Do you think he'll try to make a comeback in the 2020 Olympics, or is he running off into the sunset?", "time": "22:04:00"}

(TWitter image)\n\nNews Americas, LONDON, England, Sun. Aug. 13, 2017: Hours after Caribbean athletic legend Usain Bolt stunned fans globally by pulling up and then domersaulting to the track at the 4\u00d7100 meters men's finals of the IAAF World Championships in London, the triple Olympian insisted he will be back to bid adieu to his fans officially in the stadium today, August, 13, 2017.\n\nSpeaking on video from I am Jamaican.com, Bolt from a massage table where he was being treated, said Saturday's turn of events was definitely not the way he wanted to go out.\n\nIt's \"not the way I wanted to end my championship but what can I say ... I left everything out there on the track ...I' gave it my all as always,\" said the Jamaican sprinter. \"I'm in here now getting treatment and I want to thank everybody that came out to support.\"\n\nBolt was ramping into warp speed when suddenly, stunningly, the sprint turned into a somersault and he collapsed on the track after taking the baton from Yohan Blake to run the final leg of the relays for his country Saturday.\n\nKevin Jones, a doctor with the Jamaican team, said after the race that his preliminary diagnosis was that the world's top athlete had suffered an acute muscle cramp in his left hamstring. He, however, could not rule out the possibility of a muscle tear.\n\nThe doctor said that a slight delay at the start of the race -- because of the length of two medal ceremonies that preceded it -- might have contributed to Bolt's situation.\n\n\"It was cold back there, and the guys were complaining,\" Jones said.\n\nBlake told reporters afterward: \"They were holding us too long in the call room. Usain was really cold. In fact, Usain said to me, 'Yohan, I think this is crazy, 40 minutes and two medal presentations before our run.'\"\n\nOmar McLeod, who ran the first leg for the Jamaican team, also criticized the delay.\n\n\"We were really trying our hardest to stay warm and keep upbeat, but it was ridiculous,\" he said.\n\nBolt did not dwell on the what ifs' of his injury and did not discuss the details of it in the video post but instead thanked all who came to see him run.\n\n\"Sorry I didn't get a chance to say bye or anything but I will be back In the stadium tomorrow... I will come and say good bye . I just want to thank you for everything.., really appreciate it,\" he said before ending with a peace sign.\n\nOn Twitter and Instagram he kept his post even shorter stating: \"Thank You my peeps. Infinite love for my fans. #LoveAlone.\"\n\nHis team mates on the relay team also took to social media to send their support. \"Thank you for everything you have done for the sport, us athletes and especially our country! We salute you Legend! @usainbolt,\" McLeod tweeted.\n\nJulian Forte, who won the second leg, took to Instagram to state: \"Not the way we wanted to send you off bro but unfortunately these mishaps are a part of our sport. Really had big plans to send you off in style and pop some champagne after but you're still a legend, still the GOAT and still the person who has taught me so much about the sport. We will try our best to fill these humongous shoes you will leave behind. Help me salute a true living legend @usainbolt! Happy retirement! #Legend #GOAT #usainbolt #london2017.\"\n\nBolt will end his career on the track with 11 World Championships gold medals and 6 Olympic Golds. He will turn 31 on August 21.", "time": "04:45:00"}

Whatever the challenges were, we were cognisant of them. Whatever the limitations were, we were cognisant of them,\" Walker told The Gleaner following Bolt's 100m run.\n\n\"We are not going to try and take away the shine from anyone else. Usain showed up at a championship and believed he could have won. We as a team believed he could have won that race, but we don't want to create any excuses. We will give thanks for his blessing and move on,\" added Walker, Bolt's best friend and executive manager.\n\n\"It was a tough season. I know he is disappointed that he did not go on to get the gold in the 100m. In my book, and considering everything that I know and everything that transpired this season, I think he should take comfort in the fact that he faced the starter and gave it his best,\" Walker said.\n\n\"This proves a lot about who Usain Bolt is, the competitor that he is. Many athletes would not have faced the starter knowing the kind of problems that he had, but he had promised the fans that this is his farewell. He wanted to put on a show for them, and he went out there and gave his best. If on the day his best was a bronze medal, we give thanks,\" said Walker, who also admitted that there were points in the season when he wondered if Bolt would in fact compete in London.\n\n\"There were always stages where you wonder, will it come together? But again, with the genius of Glen Mills, the appetite for success of Usain Bolt, he went about it, trained very hard and kept believing. The team has always believed in the ability of Usain Bolt.

Whatever the challenges were, we were cognisant of them. Whatever the limitations were, we were cognisant of them,\" Walker told The Gleaner following Bolt's 100m run.\n\n\"We are not going to try and take away the shine from anyone else. Usain showed up at a championship and believed he could have won. We as a team believed he could have won that race, but we don't want to create any excuses. We will give thanks for his blessing and move on,\" added Walker, Bolt's best friend and executive manager.\n\n\"It was a tough season. I know he is disappointed that he did not go on to get the gold in the 100m. In my book, and considering everything that I know and everything that transpired this season, I think he should take comfort in the fact that he faced the starter and gave it his best,\" Walker said.\n\n\"This proves a lot about who Usain Bolt is, the competitor that he is. Many athletes would not have faced the starter knowing the kind of problems that he had, but he had promised the fans that this is his farewell. He wanted to put on a show for them, and he went out there and gave his best. If on the day his best was a bronze medal, we give thanks,\" said Walker, who also admitted that there were points in the season when he wondered if Bolt would in fact compete in London.\n\n\"There were always stages where you wonder, will it come together? But again, with the genius of Glen Mills, the appetite for success of Usain Bolt, he went about it, trained very hard and kept believing. The team has always believed in the ability of Usain Bolt. In my book, Usain is the most talented athlete, and we thought that once he could get healthy, it was all possible,\" he noted.\n\nBolt was receiving treatment up to late last night for his injury, which came at the end of a career that brought eight Olympic gold medals, 11 World Championships titles, and world records in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m.", "time": "06:42:00"}

leaving the track after winning his 100m heat. Suddenly the boos for the pantomime villain - a twice convicted drugs cheat - dissolved, replaced by cheers of 'Bolt, Bolt, Bolt'.\n\nThe Jamaican wanted to sign off with one final 100m title to add to his 11 world and eight Olympic golds but admitted he needed to repair his relationship with the blocks.\n\nLeft to right: Usain Bolt springs out of the blocks in the 100m heats; Bolt crosses the finish line to win heat six ahead of Japan's Shuhei Tada.\n\nUrged on by a delirious 56,000 crowd, Mo Farah found his familiar full-throttled sprint finish to claim another 10,000m world championship gold medal in 26min 49.51sec - his fastest time for six years - with Ugandan Joshua Cheptegei second and Kenyan Tanui third.\n\nKatarina Johnson-Thompson finished fifth in the heptathlon, having to all intents bid farewell to her medal hopes with her collapse in the high jump. Afterwards she was close to tears but insisted it was a 'freak' failure in the high jump rather than psychological frailty that proved her undoing.\n\nThe Belgian Olympic champion, Nafi Thiam, was a model of consistency, winning with 6,784 points ahead of Germany's Carolin Sch\u00e4fer and Anouk Vetter of the Netherlands.\n\nFrom top: Belgium's Nafi Thiam clears the bar in the high jump before going on to win gold in the women's heptathlon; but dejection for Katarina Johnson-Thompson as she fails to clear a crucial height.\n\nAs a full moon rose over the London Stadium last Sunday, athletics' greatest pantomime villain, Justin Gatlin, sank his teeth into the carefully laid plans for Usain Bolt's retirement party. And then, in the last desperate steps of a compelling world championships 100m final, brutally ripped them apart. The 35-year-old American, who was banned twice early in his career for doping offences, is not necessarily the champion the sport wants. But given its problems, it is one that many will feel it deserves.\n\nClockwise from top: Usain Bolt jokes around ahead of his men's 100m semi-final; Bolt looks at the big screen to see that he has finished third in the final; Justin Gatlin stands on the podium with his gold medal; Gatlin has tears in his eyes as he celebrates with friends after winning the men's 100m final.\n\nKenya's Geoffrey Kipkorir Kirui prevailed in a compelling east African duel with Ethiopian Tamirat Tola on the streets of London to win the men's marathon.\n\nAbove: The front runners in the men's marathon cross the courtyard in front of the Guildhall watched by just a few spectators. Right: Turkey's Ercan Muslu walks to the finish at Tower Bridge after retiring from the men's marathon.\n\nIn a stadium at 56,000 capacity Great Britain's Sophie Hitchon looked to be in the loneliest place in the world after failing to win a medal in the hammer. The 26-year-old crouched beside the advertising hoardings at the far edge of the track, teary-eyed and staring into the distance, contemplating what might have been. Laura Muir was also close to tears after missing out on a world championship 1500m medal by seven hundredths of a second to South Africa's Caster Semenya. Muir had led for much of the race but ran out of gas down the home straight and was beaten to bronze by Semenya, the Olympic 800m champion. South Africa's Semenya later attempted to shut down debate over hyperandrogenism, the medical condition she has which is characterised by excessive levels of male sex hormones such as testosterone.\n\nClockwise from top left: Switzerland's Mujinga Kambundji puts her feet in the blocks for the start of a women's 100m heat; Great Britain's Sophie Hitchon cries as she leaves the arena after finishing out of the medals in the women's hammer; New Zealand's Eliza McCartney fails to clear a height in the final of the women's pole vault; Great Britain's Laura Muir falls to the track after competing in the women's 5000m heats; Jamaica's Elaine Thompson, the double Olympic champion, waits for the start of a women's 100m heat.\n\nAbove: Jamaica's Omar McLeod crosses the line to take gold in the men's 110m hurdles. Right: McLeod celebrates victory with his mother who is wearing a T-shirt bearing his picture.\n\nSouth Africa's Wayde van Niekerk said he felt upset and disrespected by his rival Isaac Makwala who suggested he was part of a conspiracy that saw the Botswana athlete excluded from the 400m final. The usually calm Van Niekerk was visibly tearful and angry, speaking after taking 200m silver behind the shock victor, Ramil Guliyev of Turkey. He dismissed Makwala's assertion that athletics' world governing body, the IAAF, had unfairly quarantined him with a sickness bug to pave the way for Van Niekerk to take 400m gold.\n\nClockwise from top left: Germany's Rico Freimuth competes in the long jump of the men's decathlon; runners wait in the heavy rain for the start of a heat of the women's 3,000m steeplechase; Isaac Makwala of Botswana starts a solo heat of the men's 200m after being given special medical compensation to compete; exhausted runners lie on the track after Wayde van Niekerk had won the men's 400m final. From top: Athletes compete in a heat of the mens 5,000m; Trinidad and Tobago's Deborah John falls during the women's 100m hurdles.\n\nBlock by block the crowd inside the London Stadium rose like an advancing Mexican wave as Mo Farah sprinted past in pursuit of the Ethiopian duo ahead in the 5,000m final. So often they have seen him win from this position but after 10 straight global titles and four double golds, finally, he could not find a way.\n\nBody heaving with adrenaline and emotion, he curled into the foetal position at the finish, beaten in a major final for the first time in six years. Silver on this occasion stung like defeat and salt was rubbed into open wounds by his conqueror, Muktar Edris of Ethiopia, performing the iconic Mobot at the finish.\n\nThe cheers have surely not been louder all world championships. But, dramatically and unexpectedly, this time they were not for Usain Bolt, who ended the final race of his career face down on the track and with his hamstring blown. Instead they rang loud and true for the young British athlete Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake, who held off the American Christian Coleman to take the home nation's second gold medal of the championships in a dramatic men's 4x100m relay final.\n\nThis has been a world championships where many of the sport's biggest stars have been knocked off their perch. Bolt. Mo Farah. Kendra Harrison. Wayde van Niekerk. All have felt the jolting sting of a rare defeat. Yet no one expected this. The Jamaican men's 4x100m relay team knew they were one of sport's great bankers, having not lost a global relay on the track since Osaka in 2007. Not this time.\n\nUsain Bolt pulls up injured as Great Britain's Daniel Talbot, back left, celebrates.", "time": "09:31:00"}

The winner of the 9 gold Olympic medals suffered an injury during 4 x 100 m relay race, collapsing to the ground.\n\nMo Farah also lost his race at 5,000 meters, and one of the best in the history of athleticism disappointed his fans enormously.\n\nIt seems that sometimes luck is not following the brave ones. Usain Bolt finished his career with his eyes full of tears, while laying on the ground, face towards down. He couldn't bear this outcome.\n\nHis body could not endure any more efforts, and the legendary Jamaican just snapped, making hundreds of millions his fans very sad.\n\nAccording to the Jamaican doctor, nothing serious happened, and Bolt will recover soon.\n\n\"It's a cramp in his left hamstring, but a lot of the pain is from disappointment from losing the race,\" Jamaican team doctor Kevin Jones said. \"The last three weeks have been hard for him, you know. We hope for the best for him.\"\n\nIt is something which Bolt hadn't deserved. Instead of celebrating his retirement in the best possible way along with his supporters we witnessed one unfortunate night which needs to be forgotten as soon as possible.\n\nThe fastest man of all times and the record holder at 100m and 200m won the championships in Berlin, Moscow, and Beijing and also won the Olympic gold medals in Beijing, London, and Rio. Sadly, he could not repeat the celebration at the same spot where he dominated 5 years ago.\n\nThe relay team of the Great Brittain used this in the best possible way and won the gold medal along with setting the new European record in this discipline 37,47 seconds. The silver medal went to the hands of the United States, 37,52, while the bronze medal was surprisingly won by the Japanese 38,04.\n\nAlso, one other fantastic athlete lost here in London. Mo Farah finished second at the 5,000m and the 34-year-old who have already won the 10,000m gold medal 8 days ago couldn't do the double.\n\n\"It's been a long journey, but it's been incredible,\" Farah told the journalists\n\n\"It didn't quite hit home until after I crossed the line and had a couple of moments to myself when I realized - this is it.\n\n\"I gave it all - I didn't have a single bit left at the end.\"\n\nIn the end, he will finish his career with 10 gold medals and 2 silver ones. Among those 10 medals, four of them were from the Olympics.\n\nMo Farah has only one race left at 5000m which will be his last in the career, at Diamond League final in Zurich.

Saturday: arguably the greatest ever sprinter not only in living memory, but of all time, bid goodbye to the tracks he's called home.\n\nUsain St Leo Bolt, at 30-years-old, ran his final race at the World Athletics Championships in London as part of the 4x100m relay.\n\nBut it wasn't the glittering send of that he wanted. He suffered an injury halfway on the final stretch and couldn't complete the race, with Team GB winning gold.\n\nWe've known about his retirement for some time. In February 2015 he announced that he would be ending his track days - extending his career by one year after Rio when his sponsors convinced him to carry on.\n\nThe legend turned pro in 2004, and with a surname such as 'Bolt', we should have known he'd be pretty quick.\n\nCredit: BBC\n\nJoe Townsend of Sky Sports Radio at the World Athletics Champions told LADbible: \"Bolt has been very vocal on the war against doping. In his later years, his biggest rival in Justin Gatlin has amplified that.\"\n\nHe added: \"Bolt's been so popular because throughout his career he's seemingly competed under zero pressure, laughing and joking right up until the moment he's stepped onto the blocks.\"\n\nBolt has broke the world record for the 100m three times - twice breaking his own.\n\nCredit: PA\n\nIn 2008, he shaved 0.02 seconds off Asafa Powell's record and ran in 9.72, and just over two months later he was at it again; this time he ran 9.69.\n\nExactly one year on, in Berlin, he saved an incredible 0.11 seconds off that time to run 9.58. It's that 2009 record that still remains the benchmark today.\n\nAnd, if that wasn't enough, his 19.19 second time for the 200m is also a world record - set also in 2009.\n\nHis first Olympic games were medal-less, but from there he never looked back. He took a double-triple (100m, 200m and 4x100m relay) by winning gold at London and Rio.\n\nSadly, he was denied the triple-triple thanks to a teammate in the 2008 4x100m relay at the Beijing Olympics.\n\nAmid the doping scandal that rocked the athletics, Nesta Carter was deemed to have breached the rules, and denied Usain Bolt of nine Olympic golds across three games - he described losing that medal as 'heartbreaking'.\n\nCredit: PA\n\nBut Bolt is so much more than a racer. He's a character and has endeared as many off the track as on it.\n\nHis chicken nugget diet reveal at the Beijing Games had the admiration of us all.\n\n\"At first, I ate a box of 20 for lunch, then another for dinner,\" he wrote in his autobiography, Faster Than Lightning.\n\n\"The next day I had two boxes for breakfast, one for lunch and then another couple in the evening. I even grabbed some fries and an apple pie to go with it.\"\n\nTo be fair, he admitted his whole career started when, at the age of 12, his coach offered the fastest runner in the group a free lunch.\n\nThe LADbible followers also have a fond memory from Beijing too, albeit seven years later. It involves a certain man on a hoverboard.\n\nHis personality, his signature pose, his ability to win races by casually not paying attention to others and his loveable nature in interviews or to the crowd also make him a winner in more ways than one.\n\n\"His personality means he has transcended the sport,\" said Townsend. \"By being such a huge personality, it attracts a huge fanbase, which is what the sport's been able to piggy-back on.\n\n\"Nobody talks about the incredible personalities of Tiger Woods, Cristiano Ronaldo or Michael Schumacher - Bolt is a one off.\"\n\nThe sprinter is also a huge fan of Manchester United - and dreams of playing for them. There were even rumours of him having a trial at one point.\n\nIt may not have come off, but that's not stopped him calling in a United phone-in on the club's TV channel, MUTV. He was also presented with a shirt on the pitch at Old Trafford too.\n\nWhatever he chooses to do next, he'll always be remembered as the greatest the sport has ever seen.\n\nJoe Townsend told LADbible: \"He'll be terribly missed.

expected but the greatness of Usain Bolt and Mo Farah doesn't erode a bit despite their performances at the IAAF World Athletics Championships in London.\n\nWhile participating in their respective final races of their careers on Saturday, Bolt couldn't finish the 4x100 metres relay due to muscle cramp and Farah ended up at second position in the 5000 metres event. The crowd at the London's Olympic stadium and millions around the globe saw how two of the world's greatest athletes couldn't get a perfect farewell, but they might have realised that sports is not a fairytale after all.\n\nEven in the finals of 100 metres just few days back, Bolt fell behind and had to settle for the bronze medal after Justin Gatlin and Christian Coleman took home the gold and silver respectively. While Farah won gold in the 10,000 metres event, the 34-year-old Briton lost his world 5,000 metres title to Ethiopia's Muktar Edris.\n\nHere's how Twitter reacted to Bolt's painful final run and Farah's silver medal finish on Saturday:\n\nUsain Bolt pulls up with pulled hamstring in final World Championship.

Denuded of one final medal that seemed his due, he was still determined to cross the finish line one last time.\n\nHe was asked at these London championships if we would ever see his like again. \"No, I don't think so,\" he replied. \"I'm unique.\" From a lesser mortal, it might have been perceived as staggering hubris. From him, it was simply a statement of fact.\n\nThe moment of adieu was marked with a poignant gesture, as Bolt took to the track in odd-coloured shoes: one purple, one gold.\n\nPurple denoted the colour of his alma mater, William Knibb High School in Falmouth, Jamaica, where a teenage Usain described by his teachers as a \"prankster\" found his metier in life. Gold defined his pre-eminence ever since: eight Olympic gold medals, world records galore, all securing him the helpless adulation of millions. \"Forever fastest,\" read the message on his footwear. We had better believe it.\n\nHis retirement marks a profound and solemn watershed in the history of track and field. What now? Bolt has not even hung up his spikes, and already the sport can be in no doubt as to the chasm he will leave behind. The past week's winning times for 100 and 200 metres - 9.92 seconds for Justin Gatlin, and 20.09 for Turkey's Ramil Guliyev - were the slowest on the global stage for 14 years.\n\nAnd yet it is his stage presence, which has beguiled everybody from Barack Obama to female Swedish handball players, that athletics will miss most. From gyrating with samba dancers in Rio to performing his 'To Di World' pose alongside Mo Farah, from high-fiving stadium mascots to hugging the hapless Chinese official who upended him on a Segway scooter, Bolt was never less than box-office.\n\nNot even the finest biologists can fully explain why Bolt, whose 9.58 for 100m is more than two tenths quicker than the next man who has never committed a doping violation - Maurice Greene, with 9.79 - came to be so fast. Some attribute it to his childhood penchant for yams, a highly popular food in his native Trelawny parish and one known to enhance the fast-twitch muscle fibres essential for sprinting. Others contend that the Maroons, the escaped slaves who populated this rugged region in the 18th century, bequeathed to their successors a level of physical resilience from which Bolt has benefited.\n\nTaking 41 strides to cover 100m when most of his rivals needed 44, Bolt saved athletics at a time when few realised it needed saving. He became supra-national, belonging as much to Jamaica as to the world. \"I can't think of anybody else besides Muhammad Ali who has captured the public imagination or a global audience like Bolt,\" Sebastian Coe said. \"He has gone way, way beyond athletics.\"\n\nNow that the sport is suffering, still wounded by the Russian doping scandal and toiling to engage the next generation with compelling rivalries, he is walking away. The void that remains is incalculable. Wayde van Niekerk is broadly identified as the pre-eminent talent following in Bolt's wake, but even he is struggling with the vast expectation that this casting creates. After being vanquished by Guliyev over 200, the South African broke down in tears, having to be consoled for at least a minute before resuming his trackside interviews. It was a reminder of Van Niekerk's status less as Bolt's logical heir than his polar opposite.\n\nTime can be a cruel and capricious mistress, though. From his late Noughties pomp, Bolt has been slowing by almost imperceptible degrees for the best part of eight years. Finally, here in London, his opponents have caught up with him. A once effortlessly languid motion has begun to look laboured. Painful as it might be, the time is surely right for him to bid farewell. For he should exist in our minds as a supreme force, not an ageing champion chasing one last shot.\n\nHe bowed out on Saturday night in an ill-starred relay, a discipline with which he has always had a chequered relationship. While he purports to love relays, regarding the task of anchoring Jamaica to glory as a signal honour, it is a former relay team-mate who has tainted the lustre of his otherwise immaculate Olympic canon. But for Nesta Carter, who ran the opening leg at Beijing 2008, recording a positive 'B' sample for the banned stimulant methylhexanamin, Bolt would be facing retirement with an unparalleled 'treble-treble' of sprint titles at the Games. Now this London relay will be remembered as the one race at such a level where he has had to pull out hurt.\n\nIt is not a memory, one hopes, that will last a lifetime. Much like the defeat by Gatlin that ended his individual career last Saturday, Bolt's loss of a nine-year-old gold medal as a consequence of a compatriot's misdemeanour is essentially a footnote to his feats. His is a greatness beyond compare.\n\nNobody, not even him, knows quite what comes next. A few nightclub visits, perhaps. All that is certain is that he is shutting down the kind of sporting electricity that might never be reproduced in our lifetimes. Enriching, affirming, one-of-a-kind, Bolt can slip off into his sun-kissed contentment content. For him and for all who watched him, it has been quite the ride.", "time": "21:51:00"}

the relay final on Saturday morning.\n\nThe eight-time Olympic champion anchored the squad to victory in the second heat.\n\nJamaica finished in 37.95 seconds - slower than Great Britain and the USA from the first heat - but will be expected to challenge for the podium in Saturday evening's final - Bolt's last race of his career.\n\nWhen is the race?\n\nThe race is due to start at 21:50 BST.\n\nWhere can you watch the race?\n\nThe BBC and Eurosport both have rights to the World Championships in the UK. Although if you can't get in front of a screen, Mirror Sport will bring you all the action LIVE.\n\nIs there a stream?\n\nIf you are watching in the UK, and can't get to a television, the the BBC website will stream the whole evening of action live. Beware though, you need to have a TV license to watch.\n\nQuote corner\n\nUsain Bolt said after the heats: \"For me it's hard to be sad because of the energy I am getting from the crowd, I just feel happy and blessed,\" Bolt said in a trackside interview.\n\n\"It's been brilliant, the energy in the stadium is outstanding.

ended in extraordinary drama on Saturday (August 12) as he pulled up with injury on the anchor leg of his very last race, the 4\u00d7100-metre relay final at the World Championships.\n\nThe 30-year-old had taken the baton for Jamaica a few metres adrift of the two leaders when, straining hard to catch them, he stopped abruptly with cramp in his left hamstring, began hobbling and tumbled to a halt after a forward roll.\n\nAs Britain went on to win gold, Bolt lay on his back in his lane, his head in hands, being tended to by medics as one waited with a wheelchair to help push him off the track.\n\nHis team mate, Yohan Blake and American Justin Gatlin both believe Bolt's cramping was due to the athletes being made to wait for too long in the stadium and their muscles started to get cold.\n\nGatlin added that it shouldn't take anything away from Bolt's career.\n\nElsewhere, Tori Bowie celebrated her second gold medal of the championships as the United States won the women's 4\u00d7100-metre relay gold. Britain claimed silver while Jamaica got bronze.\n\nElsewhere, Mo Farah's aura of invincibility after six years of unrelenting success was finally cracked in his very last major track race as he lost his world 5,000 meters title to Ethiopia's Muktar Edris.\n\nSeeking a fitting end to his matchless long-distance racing career before moving to marathon running, the 34-year-old Briton's bid for a fifth straight global 10,000/5,000m double was scuppered as he had to settle for the silver.\n\nFarah said he was sad but acknowledged a better man won on the day. Farah had won the 10,000-metre gold on August 4 and he admitted he wasn't sure what shape he was in coming into Saturday's race after picking up an injury in the 10k.\n\nThe other big story of the night was Australia's Sally Pearson who completed one of the great sporting comebacks when she overcame two years of injury agony to win the world 100-metre hurdles title at the age of 30.\n\nPearson, world champion in 2011 and Olympic gold medalist in London in 2012 and with Olympic and world silvers to her name, held off Dawn Harper-Nelson, one of four Americans in the field, for an emotional triumph.", "time": "13:58:00"}

ends in agony as he collapses to ground with muscle injury in last ever appearance\n\nGREAT BRITAIN stormed to a brilliant 4\u00d7100 metres gold medal as Usain Bolt ended his final race on the deck after suffering an injury.\n\nThe British quartet shocked their rivals with a stunning performance to romp to victory but Bolt's hopes of a final gold were ended as he looked to have suffered a hamstring injury on the last leg.\n\nCJ Ujah, Adam Gemili, Danny Talbot and Nathaneel Mitchell-Blake wrote their names in the rich history of British athletics as they saw off their much more lauded rivals to be crowned world champions.\n\nBolt was hoping to bring the curtain down on his brilliant career in fitting style with a 20th major title of his career.\n\nBut instead he was laid flat out in agony as Mitchell-Blake held off the challenge of American sprint star Christian Coleman to take a brilliant gold.\n\nA stunned 60,000 crowd inside the London Stadium suddenly switched from gasps at watching Bolt fall to roars of triumph as Britain romped home.\n\nTheir time of 34.47 was blisteringly quick, and 0.05secs ahead of the Americans who had boasted the first two in the 100m final in Coleman and Gatlin in their ranks.\n\nAnd with Jamaica's hopes hitting the deck with their stricken hero it was Japan who raced home to snatch the bronze.\n\nBritain were given a brilliant start by Ujah who ran a storming first leg to hand over to Gemeli in the lead.\n\nThe Londoner who was left out controversially by selectors for the individual sprints took up the challenge as he blazed down the back straight chased by world champ Gatlin.\n\nThe changeover to Talbot was excellent and the bend specialist didn't disappoint as America and Jamaica realised they were already playing catch-up.\n\nMitchell Blake took the baton three metres up from America with Jamaica further adrift and the pressure was on to hold off the challenges of rising star Coleman and the fearsome Bolt.\n\nThe Jamaican strained every sinew to claw his way back, and his body gave up on him halfway down the home straight, collapsing to the floor with an apparent hamstring injury.\n\nBut Mitchell-Blake refused to buckle in the final stages, holding his form to hit the line as the home crowd went wild with celebration.", "time": "21:36:00"}

sprint relay for first time\n\nBolt, who had to settle for bronze in the individual 100 metres, had been hoping to sign off from the sport by leading Jamaica to a fifth successive relay gold but they were struggling in third place when he collected the baton.\n\nAs he tried to gain ground, Bolt pulled up and fell to the floor with what looked like a hamstring injury.\n\nThe 60,000 in the stadium who had come to mark the farewell sport's greatest showman had only a split second to absorb what was happening as up ahead a new chapter was being written.\n\nThe U.S., with individual gold and silver medallists Justin Gatlin and Christian Coleman running the second and fourth legs, had been expected to push the Jamaicans all the way but they were always trailing the slick Britons.\n\nThe brilliantly executed race by Chijindu Ujah, Adam Gemili, Danny Talbot and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake gave Britain gold in 37.47 seconds, breaking an 18-year-old national record, and the world title for the first time.\n\n\"I wasn't sure if I had won or not, I gave it my all but I could see Christian Coleman out of the corner of my eye,\" said Mitchell-Blake.\n\n\"The feeling of euphoria was from infinity. I can't register it. We smashed the British record to pieces.\"\n\nBritain's only other men's global sprint relay golds came in the 1912 and 2004 Olympics.\n\nIt completed a great night for the host nation's sprinters after their women had earlier taken silver behind the Americans in the sprint relay, their best performance since the first championships in 1983.\n\nThe U.S. men took silver in 37.52 but for a nation that used to be totally dominant in the event, it was only their second medal in the last eight global finals after a series of world championship and Olympic disqualifications. Japan took advantage of Jamaica's travails to take third in 38.04. (Editing by Ed Osmond)", "time": "22:11:00"}

The walk was too long. Usain was really cold. In fact Usain said to me, \"Yohan, I think this is crazy. 40 minutes and two medal presentations before our run\".\n\n'We kept warming up and waiting, then warming up and waiting. I think it got the better of us. We were over warm. To see a true legend, a true champion go out there and struggling like that. The race was 10 minutes late and we were kept 40 minutes. Crazy.'\n\nBolt did not stop for interviews but his other team-mates piled into the row. Julian Forte added: 'They kept us in the call room for an extremely long time in our running kits, and it's not the warmest over here and they had us around there for quite a while, so I think they really need to look into that and do something about it.\n\n'We were excited, we were ready, we had been doing some hand offs and everybody was feeling good, but they kept us hanging around for a long time you know. So it's just really crazy.'\n\nOmar McLeod said: 'It's heart wrenching. It was ridiculous man, we were there around 45 minutes waiting outside, I think they had three medal ceremonies before we went out so we were really trying our hardest to stay warm and keep upbeat. But it was ridiculous. We waited a really long time. I drank like two bottles of water.'", "time": "22:13:00"}

"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/aug/12/great-britain-relay-usain-bolt-gold-injured", "body": "The cheers have surely not been louder all world championships. But, dramatically and unexpectedly, this time they were not for Usain Bolt, who ended the final race of his career face down on the track and with his hamstring blown. Instead they rang loud and true for the young British athlete Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake, who held off the American Christian Coleman to take the home nation's second gold medal of the championships in a dramatic men's 4x100m relay final.\n\nIt was a sensational performance that was reflected on the clock. The British team's time was 37.47 - a national record and the fastest time in the world this year. The United States were second in 37.52, with Japan third in 38.04. Britain has not had the greatest of world championships but suddenly the crowd were off their feet, jumping and hugging and applauding.\n\nBut, inevitably, there was sorrow for Bolt too. The Jamaican team were in third place when the greatest sprinter and showman the sport has ever known took the baton. He is older, slower, and greyer now - but he is still a man who can turn the ignition key to his own legs quicker than any other sprinter on the planet.\n\nUnderstandably he was desperate to win yet another world title in his last race - especially following the tragic death of his close friend Germaine Mason, the Olympic silver medal winning high jumper, in a road accident in April. But as he opened his stride and began to accelerate he suddenly began to hop before collapsing on the track in agony.\n\nThis has been a world championships where many of the sport's biggest stars have been knocked off their perch. Bolt. Mo Farah. Kendra Harrison. Wayde van Niekerk. All have felt the jolting sting of a rare defeat. Yet no one expected this. The Jamaican men's 4x100m relay team knew they were one of sport's great bankers, having not lost a global relay on the track since Osaka in 2007. Not this time.\n\nAfterwards CJ Ujah, who made a sensational start and put Britain ahead out of the blocks said: \"I just wanted to run a good race and a night like this is fantastic.\"\n\nAdam Gemili, who proved his fitness beyond doubt after being controversially left out of the 200m, called it \"the best feeling in the world\".\n\nMeanwhile Danny Talbot admitted a hidden truth: \"This is what we wanted to do. Everyone knew we wanted to win a medal - but deep down we wanted gold.\"\n\nBolt, meanwhile, hobbled to the line, helped by his team-mates. This is not how he would have wanted it to end. It is over 15 years since athletics insiders started speaking in hushed awe about a young lank Jamaican who had won the 2002 world junior championships in 20.61sec. That time alone, set as a 15-year-old, would have beaten two of athletes in Thursday's 200m final.\n\nThe British team of Asha Philip, Desiree Henry, Dina Asher-Smith and Daryll Neita also lit up the track by claiming a deserved silver in the 4x100m relay behind the United States. Their time of 42.12 wasn't the quickest - in fact it was nearly two tenths slower than in their morning heat. But no one was complaining.\n\nIt helped they were against a Jamaican team stripped of its biggest names. Not only were they without Elaine Thompson, the fastest 100m women in the world this year, but those veteran stalwarts Veronica Campbell-Brown and Shelly-Anne Fraser-Pryce. Still their team of Jura Levy, Natasha Morrison, Simone Facey and Sashalee Forbes were able to claim bronze in 42.19sec, with Germany fourth in 42.36.\n\nIn truth it wasn't smoothest set of baton changes ever seen by a British team. Henry was at full stretch when she handed over to Henry, while Asher-Smith had to check her stride to get the baton on the third leg. But with the Americans' handovers also ragged, particularly their final exchange to Tori Bowie, the world 100m champion, it meant that Neita was in the hunt for gold with 80 metres to go.\n\nThere was a shock in the women's 100m hurdles as the Australian Sally Pearson, who came close to quitting after serious injuries, blasted clear of world record holder Kendra Harrison to win gold.\n\nPearson has fond memories of this track, having won Olympic gold at London 2012. But two years ago in Rome she suffered a wrist injury so serious she feared she would need her lower arm amputated. To make matters worse, she also missed the Olympics with a hamstring injury.\n\nYet she was back close to her best here, leading from the gun to win in 12.59sec. It was her second world title - six years after her first in Daegu in 2011. No wonder she shouted: \"Oh my God!\" repeatedly after she crossed the line. She was barely any more coherent afterwards, \"That was bloody hard,'\" said Pearson. \"It's been a long journey back from injury, but to get this moment and go and celebrate in front of my family is unreal.\n\n\"My husband is in the crowd there somewhere, I'll try and find him and give him a hug soon. This is just so incredible to be a world champion again.\"\n\nThe American Dawn Harper-Nielsen took silver in 12.63, while the Germany Pamela Dutkiewicz grabbed a surprise bronze 0.09sec further back. Incredibly, Harrison - who set the world record of 12.22sec on this track last year - could only run 12.74, a time she could normally do in her sleep.", "time": "21:47:00"}

4x100m gold medal at the IAAF World Athletics Championship in London on Saturday.\n\nThe race also marked an inglorious exit to fastest man, Usain Bolt as he got injured in the last leg, collapsing on the lane, while GB powered on to victory in a time of 37.47 seconds.\n\nGB's winning time of 37.47 seconds is the third fastest time in men's 4x100m relay history, behind Jamaica and USA.\n\nEvery single part of the British team's race was exceptional but two parts in particular stand out: Chijindu Ujah's outrageously good start and Adam Gemili's rapid second leg down the back straight which seemed to extend their lead from USA and the new world champion, Justin Gatlin.\n\nDanny Talbot completed a tidy top bend and Mitchell-Blake did just enough on the anchor.\n\nIn the drama, a sad sight, Usain Bolt pulled up sprinting the final leg and is hurt. He hauls himself up and limps across the line before applauding the crowd and crouching back down in some pain.", "time": "20:24:00"}

conference have already passed when a journalist asks a question from the floor that changes the mood. This is about the last seven minutes and 16 seconds of that conference. Justin Gatlin lowers a bottle of water from his lips and listens to what the journalist is saying.\n\nNext to him on the dais, Usain Bolt, who has just been beaten into third place in his last individual race before retirement, closes his eyes and drags his fingers across his forehead in a gesture that is part weariness and part dawning irritation. Christian Coleman, on the other side of Gatlin, is new to all this. He listens, too.\n\nWhat follows tells you all you need to know about the grotesque dystopia that is modern athletics. All the stages of a sport's crushing defeat, all the stops on its descent, are mapped out in its exchanges.\n\nUsain Bolt takes exception with a journalist after she asks why 100m races are slower\n\nThere is vituperation, there is intimidation, there is ignorance, there is disingenuousness, there is sycophancy and, most of all, there is denial. There is lots and lots and lots of denial.\n\nFor 436 seconds, Gatlin and Bolt play a scene straight out of Icarus, the recently released documentary about Grigory Rodchenkov, the former director of Russia's anti-doping laboratory who blew the whistle on the country's state-sponsored doping programme.\n\nIcarus makes heavy references to the three stages of reintegration in George Orwell's novel, 1984: learning, understanding and acceptance. They are all writ large here in the crowded conference room at the London Stadium.\n\nWe are almost a quarter of an hour into the audience with the medallists in the men's 100m at the 2017 World Athletics Championships last Saturday night when the question comes in a foreign voice speaking clear English. It is addressed to all of them.\n\n'The winning time today,' says the journalist, 'was the slowest for a gold medallist since 2003 and the marks in general were much slower than the last edition of the World Championships. I would like to know from you guys whether you think there is any kind of relationship with a stronger anti-doping control?'\n\nBolt is not accustomed to being asked questions like this; informed, reasonable questions that are based in fact and which make a valid point that demands a considered answer.\n\nBolt is used to journalists swooning in front of him. He is used to them asking for selfies, fawning over him, serving up easy inquiries that he can swat away with his charisma and his humour. He is used to being indulged. That is his staple. So this is a bit different. Bolt doesn't like it.\n\n'Whoa, whoa, whoa, what?' says Bolt, looking around the room in astonishment, playing to the gallery. 'What's she saying here?' Some journalists start laughing. You always get that. People who want to try to impress the big star. People who laugh at all his jokes. Journalists who become acolytes. Gatlin, the new champion, laughs, too.\n\nThe woman is not deterred. She doesn't want to play Bolt's stupid game. So she starts to ask it again. Bolt cuts her off rudely. 'I heard you but I'm saying \"What?\" ' he says.\n\nPatiently, the woman repeats her question. She will not be intimidated. 'This season,' she says, 'and also in the last World Championships, we have slower times, much slower. We have 21 sub-10 times in the Beijing World Championships and, in this edition, less than 10. I would like to understand why and if you think there is any relationship with stronger anti-doping control.'\n\nBolt signals that he wants to answer. 'First of all, I'm sure everybody up here takes that very disrespectful,' he says. 'We have worked hard. Justin has done his time throughout the years and he has proven himself over and over again and I have proven myself over and over again.\n\n'There is something called injury. For you to directly say something or state something to all three of us, I take that as disrespectful. We have done so many great things over the years. So, yeah, wow.'\n\nBolt looks around, expecting more laughter. He gets it, another round of tittering and smirking from the floor. Perhaps it's nerves. Bolt sits back, satisfied that he has put the ingrate in her place.\n\nExcept, he has done nothing of the sort. He is supposed to be part of the solution but this just makes him seem like part of the problem. He is a clean athlete. He is salvation. He is the last barrier.\n\nAnd this is how he reacts to a brave but routine question about anti-doping? This is how he reacts to an inquiry that does not seek to cast suspicion on him, or Gatlin, or Coleman but just seeks a rational, informed opinion of why the times appear to be slower.\n\nSure, Bolt's being gracious in unexpected defeat and there is credit in that. But there is a bigger picture and suddenly Bolt can't see it.\n\n'Justin has proven himself over and over again.' Really? Is that all he's got to say about a drug cheat who has been banned twice for doping offences and whose way back into the sport was paved with gold by Nike?\n\nNobody criticises Bolt for it because Bolt is untouchable. It's a fair question about anti-doping. It's actually a question that invites a positive answer but athletics has become so obsessed with circling the wagons that it sees only enemies in people who want to clean it up.\n\nNow Gatlin takes over. He is actually more coherent than Bolt. He answers the question well. He talks about the vagaries of injury and form and how Coleman, in particular, has had a long season.\n\nBut let's not be too generous: this is the two-time drugs cheat, Justin Gatlin, the man whose times were getting faster as he got older. It's worth stressing that because in the aftermath of his victory, everyone suddenly got reluctant to remember the truth.\n\nEspecially Gatlin. When another journalist suggests he enjoys being the bad boy of athletics, Gatlin seems astonished that anyone might think ill of him. 'Here's my question to you,' he says, bridling. 'What do I do that makes me the bad boy? Do I talk bad about anybody? Do I give bad gestures? I don't. I shake every athlete's hand. I congratulate them. I tell them good luck. That don't sound like the trait of a bad boy to me.\n\n'It just seems like the media wants to sensationalise and make me the bad boy because Usain is the hero and that's fine. I know you have to have a black hat and a white hat but come on man. You guys know I keep it classy and never talk bad. I just try to stay in my lane, literally. I don't see where the bad boy comes from.'\n\nAnd you know what the really astonishing thing is? None of us say anything. Not one. Maybe that's because the moderator can see where this is going and is trying to wrap it up. But still.\n\nJustin, if you really don't know the answer to 'What do I do that makes me the bad boy?', here goes. You failed two drugs tests, you served two drugs bans, have scarcely acknowledged you did anything wrong and took refuge in excuses about a disgruntled masseur rubbing dodgy cream into your legs. You are helping to kill your sport.\n\nAre you getting it now? You'll have to forgive me if shaking hands and wishing somebody good luck doesn't seem like quite enough to earn your redemption.\n\nYet everywhere, Gatlin is being empowered. Michael Johnson is upbraiding Steve Cram for singling him out. People are saying it's wrong to boo him in the stadium. People are saying there are lots of other drugs cheats, too. People on social media are saying Gatlin didn't really cheat at all and that he was the victim of a conspiracy. Make that two conspiracies.\n\nAnd so we have reached our Icarus moment. We have reached our third stage of reintegration. We have reached our equivalent of the IOC admitting Russian athletes to the Rio Olympics. We will not boo Gatlin, we will not single him out. He has our acceptance.\n\n'We still train every day when you guys are sitting, typing on your computers,' Gatlin says now, emboldened. Bolt sits next to him, laughing like a drain, not aware enough to realise his sport just got sucker-punched.\n\nThe clock's ticking down now. The moderator asks Coleman, the kid, whether he's got anything to add. 'No, I think they pretty much said it all,' he said. The masterclass in how to shut down an anti-doping debate is nearly over.\n\nThere is one more question to complete it. 'Justin,' a journalist says, 'do you think that some of the British media have been disrespectful to you and I want you to be honest with your answer?'\n\nGatlin laughs and blusters a bit.

conference have already passed when a journalist asks a question from the floor that changes the mood. This is about the last seven minutes and 16 seconds of that conference. Justin Gatlin lowers a bottle of water from his lips and listens to what the journalist is saying.\n\nNext to him on the dais, Usain Bolt, who has just been beaten into third place in his last individual race before retirement, closes his eyes and drags his fingers across his forehead in a gesture that is part weariness and part dawning irritation. Christian Coleman, on the other side of Gatlin, is new to all this. He listens, too.\n\nWhat follows tells you all you need to know about the grotesque dystopia that is modern athletics. All the stages of a sport's crushing defeat, all the stops on its descent, are mapped out in its exchanges.\n\nThere is vituperation, there is intimidation, there is ignorance, there is disingenuousness, there is sycophancy and, most of all, there is denial. There is lots and lots and lots of denial.\n\nFor 436 seconds, Gatlin and Bolt play a scene straight out of Icarus, the recently released documentary about Grigory Rodchenkov, the former director of Russia's anti-doping laboratory who blew the whistle on the country's state-sponsored doping programme.\n\nIcarus makes heavy references to the three stages of reintegration in George Orwell's novel, 1984: learning, understanding and acceptance. They are all writ large here in the crowded conference room at the London Stadium.\n\nWe are almost a quarter of an hour into the audience with the medallists in the men's 100m at the 2017 World Athletics Championships last Saturday night when the question comes in a foreign voice speaking clear English. It is addressed to all of them.\n\n'The winning time today,' says the journalist, 'was the slowest for a gold medallist since 2003 and the marks in general were much slower than the last edition of the World Championships. I would like to know from you guys whether you think there is any kind of relationship with a stronger anti-doping control?'\n\nBolt is not accustomed to being asked questions like this; informed, reasonable questions that are based in fact and which make a valid point that demands a considered answer.\n\nBolt is used to journalists swooning in front of him. He is used to them asking for selfies, fawning over him, serving up easy inquiries that he can swat away with his charisma and his humour. He is used to being indulged. That is his staple. So this is a bit different. Bolt doesn't like it.\n\n'Whoa, whoa, whoa, what?' says Bolt, looking around the room in astonishment, playing to the gallery. 'What's she saying here?' Some journalists start laughing. You always get that. People who want to try to impress the big star. People who laugh at all his jokes. Journalists who become acolytes. Gatlin, the new champion, laughs, too.\n\nThe woman is not deterred. She doesn't want to play Bolt's stupid game. So she starts to ask it again. Bolt cuts her off rudely. 'I heard you but I'm saying \"What?\" ' he says.\n\nPatiently, the woman repeats her question. She will not be intimidated. 'This season,' she says, 'and also in the last World Championships, we have slower times, much slower. We have 21 sub-10 times in the Beijing World Championships and, in this edition, less than 10. I would like to understand why and if you think there is any relationship with stronger anti-doping control.'\n\nBolt signals that he wants to answer. 'First of all, I'm sure everybody up here takes that very disrespectful,' he says. 'We have worked hard. Justin has done his time throughout the years and he has proven himself over and over again and I have proven myself over and over again.\n\n'There is something called injury. For you to directly say something or state something to all three of us, I take that as disrespectful. We have done so many great things over the years. So, yeah, wow.'\n\nBolt looks around, expecting more laughter. He gets it, another round of tittering and smirking from the floor. Perhaps it's nerves. Bolt sits back, satisfied that he has put the ingrate in her place.\n\nExcept, he has done nothing of the sort. He is supposed to be part of the solution but this just makes him seem like part of the problem. He is a clean athlete. He is salvation. He is the last barrier.\n\nAnd this is how he reacts to a brave but routine question about anti-doping? This is how he reacts to an inquiry that does not seek to cast suspicion on him, or Gatlin, or Coleman but just seeks a rational, informed opinion of why the times appear to be slower.\n\nSure, Bolt's being gracious in unexpected defeat and there is credit in that. But there is a bigger picture and suddenly Bolt can't see it.\n\n'Justin has proven himself over and over again.' Really? Is that all he's got to say about a drug cheat who has been banned twice for doping offences and whose way back into the sport was paved with gold by Nike?\n\nNobody criticises Bolt for it because Bolt is untouchable. It's a fair question about anti-doping. It's actually a question that invites a positive answer but athletics has become so obsessed with circling the wagons that it sees only enemies in people who want to clean it up.\n\nNow Gatlin takes over. He is actually more coherent than Bolt. He answers the question well. He talks about the vagaries of injury and form and how Coleman, in particular, has had a long season.\n\nBut let's not be too generous: this is the two-time drugs cheat, Justin Gatlin, the man whose times were getting faster as he got older. It's worth stressing that because in the aftermath of his victory, everyone suddenly got reluctant to remember the truth.\n\nEspecially Gatlin. When another journalist suggests he enjoys being the bad boy of athletics, Gatlin seems astonished that anyone might think ill of him. 'Here's my question to you,' he says, bridling. 'What do I do that makes me the bad boy? Do I talk bad about anybody? Do I give bad gestures? I don't. I shake every athlete's hand. I congratulate them. I tell them good luck. That don't sound like the trait of a bad boy to me.\n\n'It just seems like the media wants to sensationalise and make me the bad boy because Usain is the hero and that's fine. I know you have to have a black hat and a white hat but come on man. You guys know I keep it classy and never talk bad. I just try to stay in my lane, literally. I don't see where the bad boy comes from.'\n\nAnd you know what the really astonishing thing is? None of us say anything. Not one. Maybe that's because the moderator can see where this is going and is trying to wrap it up. But still.\n\nJustin, if you really don't know the answer to 'What do I do that makes me the bad boy?', here goes. You failed two drugs tests, you served two drugs bans, have scarcely acknowledged you did anything wrong and took refuge in excuses about a disgruntled masseur rubbing dodgy cream into your legs. You are helping to kill your sport.\n\nAre you getting it now? You'll have to forgive me if shaking hands and wishing somebody good luck doesn't seem like quite enough to earn your redemption.\n\nYet everywhere, Gatlin is being empowered. Michael Johnson is upbraiding Steve Cram for singling him out. People are saying it's wrong to boo him in the stadium. People are saying there are lots of other drugs cheats, too. People on social media are saying Gatlin didn't really cheat at all and that he was the victim of a conspiracy. Make that two conspiracies.\n\nAnd so we have reached our Icarus moment. We have reached our third stage of reintegration. We have reached our equivalent of the IOC admitting Russian athletes to the Rio Olympics. We will not boo Gatlin, we will not single him out. He has our acceptance.\n\n'We still train every day when you guys are sitting, typing on your computers,' Gatlin says now, emboldened. Bolt sits next to him, laughing like a drain, not aware enough to realise his sport just got sucker-punched.\n\nThe clock's ticking down now. The moderator asks Coleman, the kid, whether he's got anything to add. 'No, I think they pretty much said it all,' he said. The masterclass in how to shut down an anti-doping debate is nearly over.\n\nThere is one more question to complete it. 'Justin,' a journalist says, 'do you think that some of the British media have been disrespectful to you and I want you to be honest with your answer?'\n\nGatlin laughs and blusters a bit.

Were you in grade school?\"\n\nChijindu Ujah, aged 23 and the second-youngest in the GB line-up, responded: \"I was in primary school.\"\n\nGatlin smiled as he replied with the quip: \"Yeah, I've been around a long time.\"\n\nDaniel Talbot, the oldest member of the gold-medal winning relay team at 26, believes the victory could provide a foundation for Great Britain to continue challenging the US and Jamaica for the top honours.\n\n\"Hopefully we're still developing. We've just got to keep pushing each other. As a nation we are getting stronger,\" said Talbot.\n\n\"We can try and be the best in our country and we will still come together as a team and hopefully we won't have to wait another 13 years for a global title.\n\n\"We've got to contend with the best athletes in the world. Hopefully we can compete for more global titles but we appreciate it is really difficult to do that.\"", "time": "22:34:00"}

Britain and the US from the first heat - but will be expected to challenge for the podium in Saturday evening's final - Bolt's last race of his career.\n\nMORE: There is an event out there for everyone One of the most infamous cases of drug cheating goes back to the 1988 Olympic final when Ben Johnson was banned for steroid abuse.\n\nThis time, the afterburners kicked in but not hard enough. They may win their race, they might come last, but every one of them walks off the track utterly beaming to collect their protein shake from the team physio. \"It doesn't change anything in my career\".\n\nThe 35-year-old Gatlin, with flecks of gray in his hair, won the Olympic 100-meter race in 2004 in Athens, but later was saddled with two suspensions related to performance-enhancing drugs. Later, he bowed down to the man he finally defeated. I'd dearly love to see him bow out with another gold, but he's going to find it tough. \"I'm just happy to be one of his biggest competitors\". A 21-year-old Christian Coleman too went past the Jamaican by a hundredth of a second.\n\nBolt, who finished third in a time of 9.95, accepted with class both the result, and the fact that, at 30, he probably is picking the ideal time to retire.\n\nEven as he posed for all the selfies afterwards, demonstrating a grace and sportsmanship that proved him just as big a victor in rare defeat, it still felt wrong, a desperately downbeat way to depart for a sportsman who has brought so much joy to all.\n\n\"I understand why, you have black hat, white hat; good, evil, but I think it was sensationalized by the media between two people who have the utmost respect for each other\". In the last decade or so nearly the only world class Jamaican sprinter who hasn't failed a drug test is Bolt, and the cheaters have helped haul in a glittering array of medals for Jamaica. Athletics is blessed to have the likes of #Justin Gatlin, Tyson Gay, Asafa Powell, and of course Bolt's training partner, Yohan Blake all running in the same era.\n\nThe eight-time Olympic gold medalist finished third in a photo finish to runner-up Christian Coleman, and Gatlin on August 5 at London Stadium, site of the 2012 Olympic Games.\n\nAfter easing past the finish line, Bolt ran down the track as he usually does and clapped towards the crowd.\n\nThen, he gave the fans what they've come to expect: The famous \"To The World\" pose, which used to be the cherry on top of a raucous, fun-filled night.\n\nBolt insisted this would be the final individual race of his storied career - his swan song.\n\nMo Farah may have provided the major highlight for British fans in the first weekend of the competition, but perhaps the lowlight was Usain Bolt's final solo race.\n\nMayer had a throw of 47.14 meters and leads with 6,296 points after seven events, but Freimuth set a mark of 51.17 to close within 24 points of the leader in the 10-event competition.\n\nShould we have seen this coming?\n\nThe women's squad of Dina Asher-Smith, Asha Philip, Desiree Henry and Daryll Neita qualified in a season's best of 41.93 seconds by finishing second, also behind the USA.\n\nHis first heat, on Friday night, was ugly.\n\nThe long-limbed, 6-foot-5 Bolt got off to a typically slow start bursting out of the blocks.\n\nIn the semifinals, he actually lost by.01 to Coleman _ a rare defeat in any sort of race, but one that could still be chalked up to it being a tune-up, with the real race more than two hours away.\n\n\"I was concentrating on my race, so I don't know how he was running but I feel good to have run with him\", Lakshmanan added.\n\nRelated News: 13 August 2017 Beijing slams USA 'freedom of navigation' exercises in South China Sea 13 August 2017 North Korea Calls UN Sanctions 'Fabricated' First Tesla Inc (TSLA) Semi Truck Details Emerge 13 August 2017 6 migrants dead, 13 remain missing off Yemen 12 August 2017 COAS condemns attack on army truck in Quetta 12 August 2017 A snapshot of Guam before US-North Korea conflict and now 13 August 2017 Parsing Tough Rhetoric On North Korea 15:00 Download 12 August 2017 Gary Cahill sent off 14 minutes into Chelsea's title defence 12 August 2017 AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc 13 August 2017 Hong Kong enhances checks on eggs from Europe 13 August 2017 Dolphins believe rookie LB Raekwon McMillan has torn ACL 12 August 2017 Cambodia accuses Laos of border violation, threatens force", "time": "19:24:00"}

Bolt's plan -- announced well in advance -- to retire at the end of the London World Championships, was a contributing factor to his failure to defend his 100-metre title, believes former 110m hurdles world record holder Colin Jackson.\n\nBolt had stunned many when he said he was retiring well over a year ago before capturing three gold medals at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games.\n\n\"I remember my coach said to me when I was going to retire, if you keep talking to yourself that you are going to retire you are actually already retired, which makes it really difficult for you to prepare,\" said Jackson.\n\nJackson, who turned 50 in February and represented Great Britain with distinction, won an Olympic silver medal in 1988 and won the World Championships twice -- in 1990 and 1993.\n\nJackson, born in Cardiff, Wales of Jamaican parents, said Bolt had a lot on his mind.\n\n\"He was focusing on this being his last competition. He wanted it to be a good competition. I think the team around him did a good job to get him here in the state that he is in,\" he noted.\n\n\"Remember he [was within] just a jiffy of taking the title and that's an amazing job that they have done to make him be where he is,\" Jackson added.\n\nBolt was third in the 100m final in 9.95 seconds, behind second-place finisher Christian Coleman in 9.94 and champion Justin Gatlin, who ran 9.92.\n\nJackson went unbeaten at the European Championships for 12 years and was a two-time Commonwealth Games champion. His world record for the 110m hurdles of 12.91 seconds in 1993 stood for over 10 years. He remains the 60m hurdles record holder with 7.30, established in 1994.\n\nJackson, who was also renowned for being a fast starter, was fascinated that Bolt was able to finish so close to those ahead of him despite throwing his technique through the window.\n\n\"It was an exceptional race really and I think because Usain felt that he was slightly out of practice of his starting technique in that sense... I think all that was on him and when you are under pressure at a major championships, the emotional stress being your actual last race and last competition and everywhere you go people wishing you good luck and that absorbs a lot from you,\" Jackson pointed out.\n\n\"I can remember when I retired how hard it was to deal with the fact that you will never ever, ever run again,\" said Jackson, who retired in 2003.\n\nHe continued: \"So you play all that with the slight complication of the technical issues and you end up the performance that Usain really gave us which was, he actually just drove out the blocks and ran and chased instead of him doing his beautiful normal fluid action and just take it in time and move himself through.\"\n\n\"So it's a couple of many things which ended up with that performance. He was literally only just five strides from the gold medal,\" he noted.\n\nJackson, who dabbled in sports management and coaching, and who is now a sports commentator, believes Bolt is more than just an athletics star, but a global sport star.\n\n\"It's been incredible and as a super star of sport, not just athletics he's been an amazing iconic figure. So many people really look up to and aspire to be like [him]. I would say if you see it you can be it and he showed that every and every single element you can be a great super star, a great human being, a nice personality and you can achieve. So when you kind of put all of those into one package it's called Usain Bolt,\" Jackson remarked.", "time": "22:00:00"}

a terrible way for Bolt to end his career, his hamstring appearing to go as he attempted to chase down the two men in front of him. Rico Freimuth took silver with 8,564 points, while German teammate Kai Kazmirek was third with 8,488. Gatlin revealed afterwards he thought the cold was likely to have played a part in Bolt's injury while Jamaica's Yohan Blake could not contain his anger that organisers had allowed the women's high jump medal ceremony to delay the start of the race. Prior to the men's final, the women's quartet of Asha Philip, Desiree Henry, Dina Asher-Smith and Daryll Neita took silver after finishing second behind the United States.\n\nAs expected, the United States also qualified. Named a World Athlete of the Year and Track & Field Athlete of the Year in seasons past, he holds a trio of Olympic titles in the 200-meter event.\n\nIt has been a disastrous farewell championships for the world's fastest man who was surprisingly beaten in the 100m, his final individual race of his career, where he took bronze.\n\nHowever, the 60,000 in the stadium who had come to mark the farewell of sport's greatest showman had only a split second to absorb what was happening as up ahead history was being made by the host nation.\n\nGatlin, who beat Coleman and Bolt to 100m gold last weekend, has previously expressed his opinion that his long-time rival will return to the sport in the future and reiterated those thoughts following an unbecoming farewell for the eight-time Olympic champion.\n\nAustralian hurdling great Sally Pearson could well add a second world title to her trophy cabinet and banish memories of two years of injury hell.\n\nMayer is the first Frenchman to win the title.\n\nHowever, baton changes are of prime importance and organisers will be praying the Jamaicans who run the heat don't foul it up for Bolt. He won a third 10,000-meter gold on the first day of the championships.", "time": "02:27:00"}

glorious career after the 4 x 100 m relay at the World Athletics Championships in London on Saturday.\n\nWhile there is no question that Bolt will go down as the greatest of all male sprinters, a legend who stamped his class by winning six individual Olympic gold medals, three each in 100 m and 200 m, one should not forget the achievements of the other legends.\n\nThis argument comes to mind as people are quick to dub Bolt as the greatest track and field athlete in history without remembering the likes of Carl Lewis, Paavo Nurmi and Ray Ewry.\n\nWhen the argument of the greatest track and field male athlete is drawn again, one will weigh in Bolt but will also remember the three greats mentioned above, simply because one is aware of history in all its glory.\n\nTo tell you about the other three icons, Nurmi won nine Olympic gold medals in long-distance running across three games.\n\nEwry won eight individual Olympic gold medals in the field in three games and Lewis won seven individual Olympic gold medals in track and field combined across four games.\n\nYes there has been no equivalent of Bolt in sprinting but when you look at the sport overall, there are multiple champions who cannot be ignored in the GOAT (greatest of all time) discussions.", "time": "11:12:00"}

night with \"DNF\" by its name: Did Not Finish. Dead last3Bolt, assisted by his teammates, limped gingerly across the finish line.\n\nUsain Bolt was ramping into warp speed when suddenly, stunningly, the sprint turned into a somersault.\n\nFifteen steps into the final homestretch of his final race, something gave in his left hamstring. The World's Fastest Man skittered to a stop - hopping, skipping, jumping, then finally dropping to the ground and tumbling forward before coming to a rest.\n\nWhile the winning team from Britain crossed the finish line, Bolt was writhing on the track, where he eventually wound up chest down with his face pressed into Lane 5. He was certainly every bit as stunned as any of the 60,000-plus who packed the stadium Saturday, or the millions watching one of the world's most entertaining showmen make his final curtain call in the 4x100-meter relay at world championships.\n\nThere was no celebration. No gold, no silver, not even a consolation bronze, the likes of which Bolt received a week earlier in his final 100-meter race.\n\nJamaica closed the night with \"DNF\" by its name: Did Not Finish. Dead last. Bolt was helped into a wheelchair, but eventually got to his feet and, assisted by his teammates, limped gingerly across the finish line. He gave a few waves to the crowd, then left for the trainer's room, and with that, presumably left track and field forever.\n\nEarlier, The world united on August 5 to witness Bolt run the very last individual race of his glittering career. People from all time zones waited with bated breath to see a gold medal hung around the neck of the greatest sprinter of all time.\n\nBut Justin Gatlin had other plans. Bolt could not ensure a fairytale ending as he could only manage a bronze at the World Championships in London.\n\nGatlin, who has been banned for doping twice, scooped the gold medal while his countryman Christian Coleman won the silver and Bolt, eight-time Olympic champion and 11-time World champion, failed to end his superlative career on a high.\n\nThe fact that Bolt could not bow out as the World Champion changes nothing in his career and the stadium applauded the champion just like millions sitting in front of TV did.\n\nBolt mentioned later that he raced for the final time for his fans who wanted him to stay for another season.\n\n\"No regrets,\" Bolt insisted, long after a result that stunned a pumped-up crowd into near silence. \"It was always going to end, no matter what happened -- win, lose or draw. It doesn't change anything in my career.\"\n\nBolt is unlucky to not have a fairytale ending to his immensely clean career but he isn't the only one.\n\nHere are some of the sporting greats who had to suffer heartbreaks during their farewell:\n\nDON BRADMANReuters Photo\n\nDon Bradman is widely acknowledged as the greatest batsman of all time. He made his Test debut as a 20-year old against England on November 30, 1928 and wrote the greatest chapter of cricketing history.\n\nIn the 52 Tests that he played, he scored 6996 runs, 29 centuries, 13 fifties and 12 double hundreds.\n\nBradman scored 19 centuries in Ashes Test, more than any other batsman but his last Ashes game, which was also his last game, ended tragically.\n\nIn his last Test, against England at The Oval on August 14, 1948, the Australian great was just four runs away from averaging a 100 in Tests but got out on a duck, bowled out by Eric Hollies.\n\nDespite having a career that is remembered and reverred even today, Bradman did not have an ideal farewell.\n\nMUHAMMAD ALIReuters Photo\n\nMuhammad Ali is regarded as one of the most celebrated sports figures from the 20th century. Not only as a boxer, Ali created an impact with his social stance as well.\n\nAt a mere age of 22 in 1964, Ali won the WBA, WBC and lineal heavyweight title from Sonny Liston. Till today, he remains the only boxer to be the three-time lineal heavyweight champion, having won the title in 1964, 1974 and 1978.\n\nDespite being a champion on and off the ring and nicknamed \"The Greatest\", Ali did not have the greatest of finishes to his powerful career.\n\nAli initially retired in 1979 but came out of retirement and announced his comeback fight against Larry Holmes. It was around this time that Ali started facing vocal stutters and trembling hands. Holmes dominated Ali in such a ghastly manner that boxing writer Richie Giachetti called the fight \"awful... the worst sports event I ever had to cover\" and Ali lost the match by a knockout, his only knockout loss.\n\nAli did not stop at that. Even after the Holmes fight that is said to have contributed to his Parkinson's syndrome, Ali fought one last time in 1981 against Trevor Berbick and lost a ten-round decision.\n\nThus, a massively successful career ended in an immensely tragic manner.\n\nDIEGO MARADONAReuters Photo\n\nDiego Maradona is widely regarded as the greatest footballer of all time along with Pele. He was the joint FIFA Player of the 20th Century with Pele.\n\nMaradona was a classic number 10 and shattered the then world record transfer fee twice when he went to Barcelona for 5 million euros and then to Napoli for 6.9 million euros.\n\nDespite the success and beauty of Lionel Messi's game, Maradona is still considered the greatest Argentinian footballer mainly because he led Argentina to victory in the 1986 World Cup final against West Germany.\n\nMaradona also has to his credit an iconic 'Hand of God' goal and 'The Goal of the Century', his 66 yard dribble past five England players, which was voted so in 2002 by FIFA.com.\n\nDespite being such a successful footballer, Maradona had an ugly end to his playing days.\n\nIn 1990, he was suspended after he tested positive for doping after a match between Napoli and Bari and then his career hit rock bottom when he was tested positive at the 1994 World Cup.\n\nSPECIAL MENTION -- ZINEDINE ZIDANEReuters Photo\n\nZinedine Zidane is considered to be one of the most decorated and gifted footballers in the history of the game. He is famous for his sharp tactics, his flair and passing skills.\n\nAn attacking midfielder by trade, Zidane has won France the 1998 World Cup and the European Championship two years later.\n\nZidane is also a three-time Ballon d'Or, having won it twice with Juventus in 1998 and 2000 and once with Real Madrid in 2003.\n\nZidane had a beautiful career -- one that is still looked at awe with -- yet his final international game was about everything but his game.\n\nIt was the final of the 2006 World Cup between France and Italy and the game was tense.

largest: whose star will be shining brightest come the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo?\n\nThat question has been redundant in recent years, ever since a 21-year-old from the small township of Sherwood Content in northern Jamaica electrified crowds at the Beijing Olympics in 2008.\n\nBut the tall guy is taking his final bow in London and so departs the athlete with more magnetism than any other since he took to the grandest stages.\n\nNo one has captivated audiences like Usain Bolt. When he walked out before an event, you knew about 78,000 pairs of eyes in an 80,000 seat stadium were focused on him.\n\nHe knew it, too, and played up to the crowd, with his gestures, grins and fist pumps with the young helpers before and after his races. Not to forget the now tedious Lightning Bolt move he pulls with great regularity.\n\nIn short, athletics, a sport not short on polarising politics and contentious figures, needed him as much as he needed the sport.\n\nSo what now? Bolt leaves with eight Olympic and 11 world championship golds (with a last one in the 4x100m relay possibly to come around 8.50am tomorrow, so do yourselves a favour and watch the finale for one of the all-time greats), and seven world records over 100m, 200m and sprint relay.\n\nWho will arrive in Tokyo as the new standard bearer for athletics?\n\nThere are some names who stand out. First a question: does it need to be a track athlete? If not, which field athletes are worth a thought? Hammer throwers? No. Discus, shot put, triple jumpers don't resonate, due respect to our own Tom Walsh.\n\nIf you work on the basis that running is the purest form of athletic pursuit - after all, you don't need a ball or an implement to hit it with, or a pool or gymnastic mat - it must be a track athlete.\n\nThe first individual post-Bolt final was won by a Turk, Ramil Guliyev, who sped to the line for a thrilling, upset victory in the 200m final yesterday. The new age has begun, even before Bolt had left the building.\n\nHow about a man who wasn't even in London, Kenya's brilliant David Rudisha, winner of the last two Olympic 800m finals, world champion and world record holder with 1m 40.91s at the 2012 Olympics? A contender, for sure, but he's already 28, remember.\n\nPossibly Christian Coleman, the pocket rocket 21-year-old from Atlanta, who was second in the 100m final and is sure to shine in Tokyo.\n\nNo, the athlete closest to taking over the throne is South Africa's Wayde van Niekerk, who also finished second in the 200m final yesterday.\n\nThe 25-year-old from Cape Town is a two-time world 400m champion and the Olympic champion - winning that title in Rio from lane eight, which had never been done before at an Olympics or world champs, and in a world record 43.03s.\n\nHe's a charismatic figure, and came within a blink of a stunning double in London. Winning the 100m-200m double? Very doable. Both are flat-out sprints. But the 200m-400m pair? That's seriously challenging, requiring two different types of running.\n\nVan Niekerk, a Liverpool fan but don't hold that against him, is inclined to tweet sentiments like 'God is Power'.\n\nBut here's a bottom line: can anyone really fill Bolt's shoes?\n\nNo one is irreplaceable, but Bolt, in sporting terms, might be the closest to it for the moment. Others may eclipse his achievements. It'll take some doing, but it could happen.\n\nBut how about the overall package he brought to the sport: the track brilliance, the colourful persona, the ability to engage with a stadium full of fans. That's a trick you can't teach.", "time": "17:39:00"}

round completion\n\nChris Stroud, the last man to qualify for the PGA Championship, completed a three-under-par 68 on Saturday morning to join 2015 winner Jason Day in a tie for third before setting off for the third round at Quail Hollow. Stroud had five holes to finish after play was suspended on Friday due to failing light following an afternoon interruption of one hour 43 minutes because of lightning in the area.\n\nU.S. looking strong in bid to reclaim 4x400m relay title\n\nThe United States ran a world leading time in the women's 4x400 meters relay heats at the World Athletics Championships, having done the same in the 4x100m earlier on Saturday. The U.S., who finished as runners-up in the 4x400m two years ago after four successive world titles, were anchored by Natasha Hastings and finished 20 meters ahead of the British team, in a world leading time of 3 minutes and 21.66 seconds.\n\nOlympic champions U.S. lead the way in women's 4x100m relay heats\n\nThe United States ate up the track to run a world leading time in the women's 4x100 meters relay heats at the World Athletics Championships on Saturday. The Olympic champions, featuring Aaliyah Brown, Allyson Felix, Morolake Akinosun and Ariana Washington, won the opening heat in a time of 41.84 seconds, challenged only by the British quartet who came second in 41.93.\n\nMarquez claims pole ahead of Ducati duo in Austria\n\nHonda's Marc Marquez recorded his third consecutive pole of the season after setting the fastest time in qualifying at the Austrian Grand Prix on Saturday. Spaniard Marquez topped the session with a flying lap of one minute 23.235 seconds at the Red Bull Ring in Spielberg ahead of the factory Ducatis of Andrea Dovizioso and Jorge Lorenzo, who completed the front row.\n\nAggressive Federer cruises to semi-finals in Montreal\n\nRoger Federer reached the Rogers Cup semi-finals on Friday after coming to the net early and often in a straight sets victory over Roberto Bautista Agut on a windy day in Montreal. World number three Federer, who faces Dutchman Robin Haase in the last four, was never seriously pushed by Spain's Bautista Agut, who is winless in seven matches against the Swiss maestro.\n\nFans pay big money for Mayweather-McGregor tickets\n\nFight fans attending the much-hyped boxing match between Floyd Mayweather and mixed martial artist Conor McGregor will have a chance to rub shoulders with the stars in Las Vegas -- but it won't come cheap. The least expensive ticket listed on reseller StubHub is going for an eye-watering $1675 with two weeks to go until the Aug. 26 fight which pits undefeated boxer Mayweather against the UFC's lightweight champion in a 12-round super welterweight matchup.\n\nAthletics: Botswana miss out after baton drop, U.S. run year's fastest time\n\nBotswana missed out on the men's 4x400 meters relay final at the World Athletics Championships on Saturday after dropping the baton in their semi-final heat while the United States ran the year's fastest time. Bahamas, Olympic champions on the same track five years ago, also failed to qualify for the final as did Jamaica.\n\nAthletics: Mayer's decathlon lead slashed by Freimuth after discus\n\nKevin Mayer's lead in the World Athletics Championships decathlon was slashed by Rico Freimuth after the discus on Saturday, leaving the Frenchman 24 points ahead after seven of the 10 events. Mayer, the overnight leader, recorded the third fastest time of 13.75 seconds in the 110 meters hurdles but could manage only seventh place with a throw of 47.14 in the discus.\n\nBolt leads Jamaica into final, U.S. run year's fastest time\n\nUsain Bolt, running the penultimate race of his career, led Jamaica safely through their semi-final in the 4x100 meters relay at the World Athletics Championships on Saturday while United States ran the fastest time of the year. Bolt, who announced on Monday that he would also run in the heats, will race for the last time in the final on Saturday when he hopes to bow out with his 20th global championship title.\n\nWozniacki upsets world number one Pliskova in Toronto\n\nCaroline Wozniacki defeated world number one Karolina Pliskova 7-5 6-7(3) 6-4 in a marathon Rogers Cup quarter-finals match in Toronto marred by four rain delays on Friday. The delays, which all came during the first set, appeared to boost the sixth-seeded Dane, who was trailing 3-0 when the match was interrupted.", "time": "17:07:00"}

"http://www.deccanherald.com/content/627759/anything-villain.html", "body": "Justin Gatlin of the US won the 100M dash last week, spoiling Usain Bolt's farewell at the London Stadium. AFP\n\nThe sprinter Justin Gatlin is a tailor-made stand-in for the doping ills of track and field.\n\nHe served a four-year suspension after testing positive for steroids. He came back and continues to run fiercely in his 35th year, laying down the fastest times ever for a runner his age. Last weekend, in London, he spoiled the retirement run of the great Olympic champion Usain Bolt, whom some writers revere as the symbol of a clean sport. Gatlin ran 9.92 seconds in the 100 meters on Saturday night at the World Championships, and took the gold medal. Bolt settled for the bronze.\n\nFans showered Gatlin with boos; British sportswriters waxed righteous about their pantomime villain ('Gatlin is a shameless fraud' was one of the milder takes); and Sebastian Coe, president of track and field's international governing body, IAAF, was beside himself for having to award a medal to Gatlin.\n\n\"I'm not eulogistic at the thought of somebody who has served two bans in our sport walking off with one of the biggest prizes,\" Coe said.\n\nThis narrative is fractured and self-righteous. Gatlin has sinned, but the outrage, particularly from those who know better, edges toward the absurd. Let's start with what is, by now, the standard indictment: Gatlin is a 'two-time drug cheat,' with 'unrepentant' added as the adjectival chaser.\n\nThis is inaccurate. His first offense was no offense at all.\n\nIn the summer of 2001, after his freshman year at the University of Tennessee, Gatlin tested positive for a very small trace of amphetamine after running as an amateur in an event sponsored by USA Track & Field. Amphetamine is an ingredient in Adderall, for which Gatlin has carried a prescription since he was seven years old and learned he had an attention deficit disorder. He took Adderall while preparing for summer midterms three days before the race.\n\nHis decision was consistent with NCAA rules and guidance given to professional athletes. Nonetheless, Coe's organisation handed down a two-year ban. Gatlin appealed and got the suspension cut to a year. The grand executioners in the press corps might want to page to the decision's conclusion: \"Mr Gatlin neither cheated nor intended to cheat,\" the appeals panel wrote. \"He is certainly not a doper.\"\n\nSo Gatlin is a one-time doper. In 2006, he tested positive for a steroid and was suspended for eight years, a sentence reduced to four years after he co-operated with federal investigators. He would lose four peak years and millions of dollars in earnings, a considerably tougher penalty than those meted out to athletes in pro baseball, basketball or football.\n\nThat seems a suitably stiff sentence for a first offense.\n\nLet me now back off a step or three and interrogate my own righteousness.\n\nA month ago, I talked with American high jumper Chaunt\u00e9 Lowe about the moment in November when she learned she had won a bronze medal in the 2008 Olympics. The international anti-doping agency, taking advantage of technological advances, re-tested the blood of three jumpers (two Russians and a Ukrainian) who finished ahead of her at those Games. It disqualified all three. Lowe learned of this by Facebook and felt caught between elation and sorrow, aware of opportunities lost, not least that joyous moment atop a podium.\n\nA year ago, I sat atop a mountain outside Oslo and heard two top American biathletes, Susan Dunklee and Lowell Bailey, talk about the frustration of competing to their lung-straining best and suspecting that some of the athletes a few paces ahead of them might have a chemical advantage.\n\nThese athletes work too hard to think we can just slap them on the back and murmur que ser\u00e1, ser\u00e1. They enjoy precious few years at their peak. Several of them told me they would like to see career suspensions for first doping offenses.\n\nThere is, too, the peculiar challenge presented when nations or Olympic committees cover their eyes, with all the advantages and subterfuge that implies. The US Olympic Committee, for many years in the 1980s, enabled a pervasive doping problem. Its leaders knew that American swimmers, runners and jumpers were doping with the complicity of top Olympic coaches.\n\nThe United States has cracked down hard. But Russia has taken on the mantle and gone far beyond, running a State-sponsored doping programme with a thuggish insistence that gives its athletes and coaches little choice. This represents an existential threat to clean sport.\n\nI called Max Cobb, the president of US Biathlon and an insistent reformer, and asked about the question of appropriate penalties for athletes like Gatlin. He is not by temperament the sort who favors blanket lifetime suspensions, and he sees considerable mitigating factors in Gatlin's case. He also sees a place for lifetime bans as a threat.\n\n\"If you are engaged in systematic blood manipulation, you are deliberately trying to cheat the system,\" Cobb noted. \"It cannot be an accident, and that's where the option of a lifetime ban would really help.\"\n\nTrack and field's reputation as irreparably tarnished by doping may be unfair and owe paradoxically to its growing ability to ferret out offenders. The doping era may have reached its body-distorting peak before the turn of this century, when athletes from many nations imbibed all sorts of steroids. Olympians break records with less regularity now; some women's records set in that period have stood for decades. Scientists speculate that cheating athletes now take smaller doses to avoid detection.\n\nAs for Bolt and Gatlin, too many reporters and fans remain invested in fairy-tale dichotomies. Bolt is a glorious runner and a joyous showman for the ages, and he has passed every drug test without a glitch. So writers fit him for a crown as the king of clean sport.\n\nWhat, however, explains the urgency in fitting Gatlin for the crown of thorns? Gatlin is an athlete of his time and place. He finished third in the 100 meters at the 2012 London Olympics. Five of the eight men who ran that day have served doping bans. There were runners in London last weekend who had served doping suspensions and returned to competition.\n\nThe Championship race in London was an old man's affair. Gatlin won with a 9.92. Had he run that time at the World Championships in Beijing in 2015, he would have finished far behind Bolt. He is tested randomly by the US Anti-Doping Agency; screeners checked his blood four times and his urine 10 times last year before the Olympics.\n\nHe passed all of those.\n\nAge is the runner that will track Gatlin to earth. When I saw him in Oregon in May, he acknowledged mental fatigue and hamstrings and thighs that growl like old hounds. He is a personable man; he is flawed. There's no need to turn him into a hero.\n\nBut the villain stuff plays like the cheap tricks adults use to distract from bigger problems.", "time": "20:25:00"}

Green Bay will host next year's draft.\n\nAfter the league had its last draft in New York a decade ago, it envisioned giving cities -- particularly those in colder climates that may not host a future Super Bowl -- a chance to have a signature event that would have a lot of benefits, including an economic impact.\n\nChicago was the first tour stop in 2015 and it generated $81 million for the community. Kansas City had it last year, sparking $164 million in economic impact.\n\n\"Another opportunity for our franchise and our city and just for the world to kind of migrate to downtown Detroit,\" said Lions general manager Brad Holmes, who has turned around a franchise that is coming off its best season since winning the 1957 NFL title. \"I expect it to be pretty packed. I'm excited for all the businesses.\"\n\nDetroit's draft is expected to bring in at least $160 million, giving small businesses a boost from fans flocking in and around Campus Martius Park.\n\nOne longtime business is looking forward to more than just an increase in foot traffic.\n\nLauren Stovall, the business lead at Hot Sam's, and two others representing the 103-year-old men's clothing store and tailor shop will be onstage during the draft's final day Saturday.\n\n\"There's a perception of Detroit that comes from people who actually have not been here,\" Stovall said. \"What's so great is when people actually come to Detroit, they are blown away, because Detroit is not what they might have thought.\"\n\nThere are new hotels, high-end and trendy restaurants and bars along with a skyscraper nearing completion. Challenges continue to exist in some neighborhoods as the city continues to demolish abandoned houses, including more than 25,000 over the past 10 years. Crime has been trending down and homicides are the lowest since 1966.\n\n\"We're not going to lose our balance patting ourselves on the back,\" Detroit Police Chief James White said.\n\nHundreds of uniformed and plainclothes officers from Detroit, county, state and federal agencies will patrol the greater downtown area. White said all the city's police officers will work shifts during the draft, some downtown, others in neighborhoods.\n\nBomb-sniffing dogs and other K-9 teams will be flown into Detroit by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which also has pledged to have its tactical team on standby.

They finally have both, and the Motor City, the Lions and the region's most important businesses are eager to shine in the national spotlight.\n\nWhen the NFL's traveling road show draft arrives April 25, Detroit native and billionaire Dan Gilbert expects it will be a victory for the city's renaissance story decades in the making.\n\n\"Detroit's come such a long way in the last 10 to 12 years,\" said Gilbert, founder of NFL sponsor Rocket Mortgage as well as the owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers and broad swaths of prime Detroit real estate that will be a prominent backdrop to the downtown Detroit draft footprint. \"It's a perfect time.\"\n\nThe draft itself will take place downtown around Campus Martius Park and Hart Plaza. Lions President Rod Wood said the city has grown up since the team first pursued the draft, and the NFL has started to notice the city more. Out of 5,000 downtown hotel rooms, 700 have come online since 2014. The draft itself will occur in the densest part of downtown Detroit, giving it a look and feel more like Nashville in 2019 than drafts in more open spaces in recent years such as Cleveland (2021), Las Vegas (2022) and Kansas City (2023).\n\n\"It'll be very memorable for being downtown, with some aspects of it that are very Detroit, including the skyline and the riverfront and proximity to Canada,\" Wood said.\n\nSo far, 300,000 people are registered to attend, and some projections suggest the city will lure between 400,000 and 500,000 fans depending on the weather. Detroit's relative proximity to other NFL markets -- Chicago, Cleveland, Indianapolis, Cincinnati and Pittsburgh are all less than 300 miles away -- was a key selling point for the bid.\n\n\"Detroit still has an overhang from decades and decades of challenges, and one of our biggest missions is to get Detroit's reputation back to where it should be,\" Gilbert added. \"So having people here and experiencing it is such a huge motivating factor for us.\"\n\nWhile the Lions spearheaded the official league process, Gilbert personally lobbied Commissioner Roger Goodell for the draft, knowing his commercial real estate company, Bedrock, and its tenants in downtown, could gain considerably from the exposure.\n\nIn a bid to bring city neighborhoods far from downtown into the draft activities, the Gilbert Family Foundation is sponsoring two draft parties, one each on the city's west side and east side. Attendees can board shuttles from there.\n\nAlong with Gilbert's Rock family of companies, General Motors, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan and Roger Penske have contributed to the draft cause, he said. An NFL Draft-week VIP event is using Bedrock space, and up to 20,000 Gilbert company employees will be attending draft parties. They've encouraged businesses to promote their own events, and are establishing pop-up vendor stalls to diversify the retail along Woodward Avenue.\n\nFor NFL marketers, the draft is appealing because it brings together fans of all 32 teams, and without a zero-sum competitive outcome. Optimism is especially high in Detroit, where the Lions last season won their first divisional title since 1993 and last week unveiled new uniforms that should further boost offseason energy.\n\n\"It's awesome,\" Wood said. \"Obviously it wasn't known or even necessarily predicted at the time we got the draft awarded, but the timing couldn't be better for the fan enthusiasm.\"", "source": {"uri": "nj.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NJ.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Downtown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Downtown Detroit"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_Mortgage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket Mortgage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Gilbert", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dan Gilbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_A._Hart_Plaza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philip A.

Green Bay will host next year's draft.\n\nAfter the league had its last draft in New York a decade ago, it envisioned giving cities -- particularly those in colder climates that may not host a future Super Bowl -- a chance to have a signature event that would have a lot of benefits, including an economic impact.\n\nChicago was the first tour stop in 2015 and it generated $81 million for the community. Kansas City had it last year, sparking $164 million in economic impact.\n\n\"Another opportunity for our franchise and our city and just for the world to kind of migrate to downtown Detroit,\" said Lions general manager Brad Holmes, who has turned around a franchise that is coming off its best season since winning the 1957 NFL title. \"I expect it to be pretty packed. I'm excited for all the businesses.\"\n\nDetroit's draft is expected to bring in at least $160 million, giving small businesses a boost from fans flocking in and around Campus Martius Park.\n\nOne longtime business is looking forward to more than just an increase in foot traffic.\n\nLauren Stovall, the business lead at Hot Sam's, and two others representing the 103-year-old men's clothing store and tailor shop will be onstage during the draft's final day Saturday.\n\n\"There's a perception of Detroit that comes from people who actually have not been here,\" Stovall said. \"What's so great is when people actually come to Detroit, they are blown away, because Detroit is not what they might have thought.\"\n\nThere are new hotels, high-end and trendy restaurants and bars along with a skyscraper nearing completion. Challenges continue to exist in some neighborhoods as the city continues to demolish abandoned houses, including more than 25,000 over the past 10 years. Crime has been trending down and homicides are the lowest since 1966.\n\n\"We're not going to lose our balance patting ourselves on the back,\" Detroit Police Chief James White said.\n\nHundreds of uniformed and plainclothes officers from Detroit, county, state and federal agencies will patrol the greater downtown area. White said all the city's police officers will work shifts during the draft, some downtown, others in neighborhoods.\n\nBomb-sniffing dogs and other K-9 teams will be flown into Detroit by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which also has pledged to have its tactical team on standby. Intelligence agents are monitoring social media for any threats.\n\nMayor Mike Duggan devoted some time during his annual State of the City address Wednesday to talk about the importance of the draft turning a lot of eyes on Detroit. Visitors for the draft are \"going to see a very different city,\" the mayor promised.\n\n\"We have a chance to reintroduce Detroit to America,\" Duggan said.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0

Lions President Rod Wood said the city has grown up since the team first pursued the draft, and the NFL has started to notice the city more. Out of 5,000 downtown hotel rooms, 700 have come online since 2014. The draft itself will occur in the densest part of downtown Detroit, giving it a look and feel more like Nashville in 2019 than drafts in more open spaces in recent years such as Cleveland (2021), Las Vegas (2022) and Kansas City (2023).\n\n\"It'll be very memorable for being downtown, with some aspects of it that are very Detroit, including the skyline and the riverfront and proximity to Canada,\" Wood said.\n\nSo far, 300,000 people are registered to attend, and some projections suggest the city will lure between 400,000 and 500,000 fans depending on the weather. Detroit's relative proximity to other NFL markets -- Chicago, Cleveland, Indianapolis, Cincinnati and Pittsburgh are all less than 300 miles away -- was a key selling point for the bid.\n\n\"Detroit still has an overhang from decades and decades of challenges, and one of our biggest missions is to get Detroit's reputation back to where it should be,\" Gilbert added. \"So having people here and experiencing it is such a huge motivating factor for us.\"\n\nWhile the Lions spearheaded the official league process, Gilbert personally lobbied Commissioner Roger Goodell for the draft, knowing his commercial real estate company, Bedrock, and its tenants in downtown, could gain considerably from the exposure.\n\nIn a bid to bring city neighborhoods far from downtown into the draft activities, the Gilbert Family Foundation is sponsoring two draft parties, one each on the city's west side and east side. Attendees can board shuttles from there.\n\nAlong with Gilbert's Rock family of companies, General Motors, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan and Roger Penske have contributed to the draft cause, he said. An NFL Draft-week VIP event is using Bedrock space, and up to 20,000 Gilbert company employees will be attending draft parties.

The NFL draft experience, a party-like atmosphere that accompanies the annual selections, will overtake the downtown streets to highlight the growth and culture of the city.\n\nBut putting on the best possible show those three days isn't the only goal for the folks who planned the draft. There is hope the draft will have an impact in the years to come in Detroit, from hosting other major events, uplifting local businesses and youth sports organizations, and marketing the city to NFL fans coming to Detroit, along with the tens of millions who will tune in on TV.\n\nThe effort to bring the NFL draft to Detroit was a yearslong process involving decision-makers across the city: from the Detroit Lions; all parts of city government, including the mayor's office; the Detroit Sports Commission; Visit Detroit, the official tourist site for metro Detroit, including Wayne, Oakland and Macomb counties; and Rocket in the private sector.\n\n\"Thankfully, we kept at it and ultimately won,\" Lions president Rod Wood told the Free Press about the draft bid process. \"And I'm pretty confident that we're going to put on, if not the best draft, one of the best drafts that's ever been held.\"\n\nDetroit's initial bid\n\nThe NFL draft has been an annual event for the league dating to 1936. For most of the draft's history, the event was held in hotels in major cities on the East Coast. The event grew in magnitude in the second half of the 20th century, eventually getting moved to multiple locations in New York from 1995-2014 -- most notably the Radio City Music Hall -- before opening it to other NFL cities, starting in Chicago, in 2015.\n\nFrom there, cities could submit bids to the NFL to reel in and host a draft. The invested groups in Detroit immediately got to work forming a bid.\n\n\"As soon as they opened it up for cities to bid, we expressed our interest in bidding on the draft,\" Wood said. \"At the time, it was starting to grow in popularity and was becoming what it has since become, which is this big, three-day event in the city that's lucky to host it -- both for the visitors that come in person, as well as those that watch on TV.\"\n\nThe team then connected with the city, the Detroit Sports Commission and its advisory board, the Detroit Sports Organizing Corp (DSOC), Visit Detroit and private companies such as Rocket.\n\n\"The opportunity to host the draft, we felt that we were just as competitive as any other city and we can demonstrate that Detroiters will come out,\" Hakim Berry, the former chief operating officer for the city of Detroit who now works for Michigan Medicine while serving as an adviser for DSOC, told the Free Press.\n\nThe groups collaborated to lay out plans and send a Letter of Interest to the NFL in late 2017 to host a draft between 2019 and 2023. Two months after the initial letter, they presented an official bid laying out the plans for a prospective draft in the city.\n\nPart of the process was sending representatives to other NFL draft cities to see what worked and what didn't, then to generate ideas on making it a unique experience in Detroit.\n\n\"The NFL has told us this all along: Make it your own. Make it Detroit. Make it your city,\" Detroit Sports Commission executive director Dave Beachnau told the Free Press. \"Don't try to be Philadelphia (hosted in 2017) or Nashville (2019).\"\n\nMultiple location options were presented, including Campus Martius Park, Belle Isle, the renovated Michigan Central Station in Corktown and Ford Field. The plan also included information about financial partners, how to engage the citizens of Detroit and what it would mean to the city to host the draft.\n\n\"All of those things play into it,\" Wood said. \"I think part of the reason we were a little slow to win it was hotel issues downtown, where it would be held versus where we've ultimately decided to host it. And I think other cities, candidly, probably got ahead of us and had a little better bid.\"\n\nHow Detroit got the draft\n\nThe group submitted a second Letter of Interest in July 2018, and later hosted NFL officials for a Lions game and to scout potential locations. In December of that year, the NFL awarded Las Vegas the 2020 NFL draft. In May 2019, Cleveland was awarded the 2021 draft and Kansas City was awarded the 2023 draft.\n\n\"We ... initially, going as far back as 2018, did not make it into the finals for the first couple of rounds,\" Wood said. \"(We) did make it into the finals going into 2021 against a couple of other cities and were ultimately selected in 2022 to host the draft here in 2024.\"\n\nThe NFL visited Detroit in November 2019 to tour the locations, where the decision to host in Campus Martius was recommended. The idea of hosting in downtown Detroit remained a constant because it would differ from previous drafts and maximize engagement with citizens and local businesses.\n\n\"The one thing I kept pushing the mayor on is we can't move it out of the urban downtown core,\" Mark Hollis, chief operating officer of Rock Entertainment Group, said. \"That's the difference maker for us. That's the center of the vibrancy of what Detroit is all about.\"\n\nThe group was invited to submit a bid again in December 2019 for the 2022 draft, but the process was halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2020 draft was held virtually, and the NFL slid Las Vegas from 2020 to 2022. The bid process reopened at the end of 2020, and Detroit was invited to bid on the 2024 and 2025 drafts.\n\nThe approved bid for the 2024 draft was submitted on April 9, 2021, to the NFL. The league informed Detroit in December 2021 that it would host. In March 2022, the news became public, the same day it was announced the Lions would appear in that season's \"Hard Knocks\" on HBO.\n\n\"It's very competitive,\" Wood said. \"I mean, there were other really dynamic cities that were bidding against us, including Green Bay, who has next year. And their draft is going to be at the foot of Lambeau Field, which is obviously an iconic location for the entire NFL and the history of the league. So, to win it ahead of Green Bay was a coup for the city.\"\n\nDetroit's selling points\n\nThe submission to the NFL became more detailed until it was approved. One of those details was determining the actual draft footprint in downtown Detroit, which was designed to start at a center point and then stretch into all directions, which was referred to as \"spokes of a wheel\" by the Sports Commission -- which is the same way the city is laid out. Ford Field underwent renovations to potentially prepare and Belle Isle was considered, but the appeal of downtown was overwhelming.\n\n\"We are making this Detroit and dropping it in the middle of the Central Business District of our community, which brings with it benefits and challenges,\" Sports Commission Deputy Director Marty Dobek told the Free Press. \"But at the same time, it's the gathering place. That's kind of the phrase that comes along with Campus Martius Park, it's Detroit's gathering place.\"\n\nThe bid stressed how the draft could connect with Detroit residents by being centrally located and having \"activation\" events through the \"On the Clock\" tour located at different city parks and neighborhoods in the lead-up to the draft.\n\nHollis said a conversation between Dan Gilbert, the founder of Rocket Companies and the Bedrock real estate firm, along with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell was another important moment in securing the bid.\n\n\"(Gilbert) met with him in '21, and from my opinion and what the commissioner told me -- Commissioner Goodell -- is that that one phone call that happened in May of '21 was a critical call because it really demonstrated the synergy and the commitment that both the private and the public sector had for bringing the draft to Detroit,\" Hollis said.\n\nOther selling points that interested the NFL were Detroit's location relating to other NFL cities in the Midwest, the colleges within driving distance that regularly stockpile the league with players and the city's proximity to Canada.\n\n\"I think the location in the heart of downtown was very appealing to them,\" Wood said. \"The proximity to Canada is an interesting twist, which we've never really had a draft that close to another country, and, obviously, international expansion is on the NFL's mind.\" The league already plays regular season games in Europe and Mexico, and is adding a game in South America in the upcoming 2024 season.\n\nPart of the bid was a map showing all of the NFL and college football teams within a five-hour drive and two-hour flight of Detroit, which included dozens of teams, exceeding Kansas City in 2023.\n\n\"When you look last year to Kansas City, there really isn't a market geographically, I guess Chicago could drive there, but you don't have that driveable market with NFL cities like we do,\" Beachnau said. \"So, when we talk about attendance, we think it is going to be strong.\"\n\nDetroit's long-term commitment after the draft was another selling point to the NFL. Visit Detroit and the Detroit Sports Commission raised $10 million for the event from various partners, while Visit Detroit is spending $2 million, with the NFL contributing as much as seven times that amount to produce the draft.\n\nLocal donors from the community, including companies such as General Motors, Rocket Mortgage, the Pistons, Illitch Companies and the W.K. Kellogg Foundation in a group of over 20 contributors, committed $1 million toward an initiative focused on youth literacy and youth sports -- particularly girls in sports -- while the city is using Detroit-based businesses throughout the draft experience to elevate them and make it possible for them to bid on other sporting events in the future.\n\n\"That was the No. 1 priority,\" Berry said. \"This could not be a venue that Detroiters were not included in. And that's why it was very important for us to have the On the Clock tours to activate some of our rec centers and have things and make sure that the community feels they are involved and that it's open to them.\"\n\nPlanning and expected impact for Detroit\n\nThe parties worked in committees to bring the plan to life, with each group represented. Wood said the Lions helped facilitate the relationship with the NFL and gave input on the seven planning committees formed to produce the big event.\n\nThe city ensured the plans could be met on the logistical side, which includes most city departments, from police to the parks department, chipping in. The Sports Commission worked with the city on those efforts as well as helping shape the bid itself. And Bedrock made sure its downtown real estate could be used for different components of the draft.\n\n\"Working with our partners, we ensure that we can live up to the commitment to demonstrate to the entities that we're trying to attract, that Detroit is willing and able to host a large-scale event,\" Berry said.\n\nThe goal of hosting the NFL draft is the same for all: showcase Detroit's economic growth in the last decade, highlight the city's culture for a national audience and include Detroit residents as much as possible.\n\nThe hope is the draft will not only produce a local economic bump in the tens of millions during the three days, but stick with people all over the country to come and visit again in the future.\n\n\"As we continue to shape the image and perception of Detroit; to have 50 or 60 million eyeballs on our city for three days, I mean, we can't afford that kind of advertising that the broadcast brings,\" Beachnau said.\n\nOfficials are optimistic about the draft going well and hope it serves as yet another opportunity, like previously hosting the NCAA tournament did, for Detroit to show it can host big events without a hitch and elevate them. Wood mentioned it possibly helping bring events like the NFL Combine to Detroit in the future if it moves, while saying a Super Bowl is unlikely because the NFL wants it in warm weather cities, along with other major sporting events.\n\n\"I think where it will pay off is it bringing other big events,\" Wood said. \"We've got the Final Four coming in 2027. Hopefully, we can secure maybe the Big Ten football championship in Detroit now that the Big Ten's expanded -- we've expressed interest in doing that. I know Little Caesars would desperately love to have an NBA or an NHL All-Star game. But I think once we successfully put on a really big event -- and there's not much that's bigger than the NFL draft -- it should lead to other big events coming back to the city.\"", "source": {"uri":

Green Bay will host next year's draft.\n\nAfter the league had its last draft in New York a decade ago, it envisioned giving cities -- particularly those in colder climates that may not host a future Super Bowl -- a chance to have a signature event that would have a lot of benefits, including an economic impact.\n\nChicago was the first tour stop in 2015 and it generated $81 million for the community. Kansas City had it last year, sparking $164 million in economic impact.\n\n\"Another opportunity for our franchise and our city and just for the world to kind of migrate to downtown Detroit,\" said Lions general manager Brad Holmes, who has turned around a franchise that is coming off its best season since winning the 1957 NFL title. \"I expect it to be pretty packed. I'm excited for all the businesses.\"\n\nDetroit's draft is expected to bring in at least $160 million, giving small businesses a boost from fans flocking in and around Campus Martius Park.\n\nOne longtime business is looking forward to more than just an increase in foot traffic.\n\nLauren Stovall, the business lead at Hot Sam's, and two others representing the 103-year-old men's clothing store and tailor shop will be onstage during the draft's final day Saturday.\n\n\"There's a perception of Detroit that comes from people who actually have not been here,\" Stovall said. \"What's so great is when people actually come to Detroit, they are blown away, because Detroit is not what they might have thought.\"\n\nThere are new hotels, high-end and trendy restaurants and bars along with a skyscraper nearing completion. Challenges continue to exist in some neighborhoods as the city continues to demolish abandoned houses, including more than 25,000 over the past 10 years. Crime has been trending down and homicides are the lowest since 1966.\n\n\"We're not going to lose our balance patting ourselves on the back,\" Detroit Police Chief James White said.\n\nHundreds of uniformed and plainclothes officers from Detroit, county, state and federal agencies will patrol the greater downtown area. White said all the city's police officers will work shifts during the draft, some downtown, others in neighborhoods.\n\nBomb-sniffing dogs and other K-9 teams will be flown into Detroit by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which also has pledged to have its tactical team on standby. Intelligence agents are monitoring social media for any threats.\n\nMayor Mike Duggan devoted some time during his annual State of the City address Wednesday to talk about the importance of the draft turning a lot of eyes on Detroit. Visitors for the draft are \"going to see a very different city,\" the mayor promised.\n\n\"We have a chance to reintroduce Detroit to America,\" Duggan said.\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the

Now Detroit is ready to shine as NFL Draft host", "body": "DETROIT -- The clock touched down in Campus Martius a little over two years ago, counting down the days, the hours, the minutes leading up to Detroit's big moment. It's the culmination of a vision, years in the making. For a few days in April, Detroit would become the epicenter of the NFL, welcoming its best and brightest into the league. The pitch involved hundreds of thousands of folks flocking to Detroit's downtown area, traveling from neighboring NFL cities and all over the country, providing an economic boost and buzz that could have a lasting impact, while perhaps changing the perception of this city.\n\nThursday, that vision comes to life. And as Detroit gets ready for its close-up, hosting the NFL Draft for the first time, it's hard to imagine a better time for this city and its NFL franchise to showcase itself to a national audience.\n\n\"I'm so excited about the draft being in Detroit,\" Lions general manager Brad Holmes said last week. \"I really am. It's just another opportunity for our franchise, our city, just for the world to kind of migrate to downtown Detroit. We have multiple major NFL markets that are within driving distance. I expect it to be pretty packed. I'm excited for the local businesses. I just think it's going to be really exciting.\"\n\nWhen the NFL announced it would be moving the draft from its longtime host city of New York and accepting bids from other NFL cities, the Lions, along with the Detroit Sports Commission, quickly went to work on a pitch that would land them the draft.\n\nIt was a competitive market. Patience was required. Chicago was first, hosting in 2015 and 2016. Then came Philadelphia, Dallas and Nashville. Following a virtual draft in 2020, it returned to an in-person format with Cleveland and Las Vegas up next, and Kansas City hosting a year ago.\n\nAnd now, after years of planning, Detroit is on the clock.\n\n\"This is going to be a party that everyone will want to be at,\" said Claude Molinari, CEO of Visit Detroit.\n\nDetroit's downtown area is as healthy as it has been in some time. A number of financial investments have been made over the years to revitalize the city. City officials have been eager to showcase all Detroit has to offer, working with the Lions and the Detroit Sports Commission to secure the draft. Since the official announcement of Detroit as the home of the 2024 NFL Draft two years ago, those in charge began putting their plans into action.\n\nAs the host city, Detroit has a number of activities planned. The draft is free to the public, with city officials encouraging fans to register online or through the NFL OnePass app for entry -- though entry inside the draft theater will require tickets. Starting at noon Thursday, the festivities will begin. Hart Plaza will host the NFL Draft experience, which will feature attractions like an autograph stage, photo opportunities with the Lombardi Trophy, all 57 Super Bowl rings, oversized helmets of all 32 teams, a Taste of Detroit set-up, 40-yard dash and vertical testing and an NFL merchandise shop.\n\nThe 2024 NFL Draft Theater is located near Campus Martius. Per the Detroit Free Press, the theater took four weeks to build, has 2 million square feet of operational space, will be lit up by 50 million LED lights and will hold 1,500 fans per day. The theater will also hold daily free concerts throughout the draft, headlined by Detroit native and rapper Big Sean Thursday evening. Local bars and restaurants are expected to host watch parties for the draft, and benefit from all the extra foot traffic.\n\nIn total, officials expect the draft to bring in an estimated $175 million to $200 million in revenue for the city of Detroit, showcasing its revival to a national audience.\n\n\"Very excited to see all those people downtown and get the whole world to see Detroit maybe in a different way than what they perceive right now,\" said Lions president Rod Wood. \"I think it's going to be a great three-day commercial for the city.\"\n\nThe same could be said of its NFL franchise, too.\n\nIn many ways, the Detroit Lions' rise has mirrored their city's. A franchise known broadly for its history of losing, the Lions are slowly but surely transforming their image. This process began three years ago, when the franchise's leadership devised a search committee to find its next head coach and general manager. Interviews for both positions were conducted simultaneously -- an unconventional approach, but one that ultimately led them to head coach Dan Campbell and Holmes.\n\nThose two were tasked with building a winner out of the Lions -- no small task. Even before the franchise's fortune turned, there had been a quiet confidence among team officials that the Lions got it right in Holmes and Campbell. They were building through the draft. They were building their culture. They believed things were different, so much so that the Lions took advantage of the spotlight whenever it was offered, rather than hiding from it.\n\nTwo years ago, the Lions were featured on \"Hard Knocks,\" the HBO documentary series highlighting the ins and outs of a team prior to each season. Many teams are forced to participate in the show, trying to avoid the dozens of cameras capturing their decisions and conversations in training camp. The Lions, however, volunteered -- viewing it as an avenue to showcase what they'd been building under Holmes and Campbell. Fresh off a 3-13-1 season first season, mind you.\n\n\"That makes a show the best, because that's usually when the access is the best,\" NFL Films' Shannon Furman told The Athletic in 2022, when asked about the difference it makes when teams volunteer to be on the show, rather than being forced to. \"The Lions basically said before it got to that point that they liked the state of their team, their coaching staff. So they kind of talked about it and decided that they were going to volunteer for it.\"\n\nThe Lions have come a long way since. When the 2022 schedule was initially released, the Lions were the only NFL team without a prime-time game. They had a franchise-record five last season, going 4-1 in those games. Following that 3-13-1 2021 season and a 1-6 start the following year, the Lions have since gone 22-8 -- playoffs included. Detroit won its first division title in 30 years, its first playoff game in 32 years and reached the NFC Championship Game, falling just shy of the franchise's first Super Bowl appearance. A disappointing finish for the team, but a run that won't soon be forgotten in this city.\n\nThis offseason, the Lions have the look of a Super Bowl contender. They added key pieces in free agency like defensive tackle DJ Reader, right guard Kevin Zeitler, cornerback Carlton Davis III and more to a division winner. The organization on Wednesday re-signed two of its cornerstones in right tackle Penei Sewell and wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown for the long haul, giving four-year extensions to both of its young stars. And just last week, the team unveiled brand-new uniforms -- largely a hit among the fan base -- incorporating elements of the past with the present.\n\nAnd now, the Lions and the city of Detroit will host the very event that kicked off their turnaround. The team holds the 29th pick in this year's draft, and believes it has a roster that can contend for the Super Bowl, largely because of the players it acquired during this event in recent years. It's a full-circle moment, both for the franchise and Detroit. A chance to reflect and appreciate how far both have come, before the festivities begin. It's hard to find a team and city more intertwined than this one right now.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Everything you need to know", "body": "Just as excitement around the Detroit Lions is at an all-time high, following a thrilling run to the NFC championship game, the NFL world descends upon the Motor City today through Saturday for one of sports' biggest spectacles.\n\nThe 2024 NFL draft is in downtown Detroit, a moment at least two years in the making. Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to be there, with fans of all 32 teams looking to celebrate their teams' draft picks near the stage at Campus Martius and checking out the NFL Fan Experience at Hart Plaza.\n\nIf you're traveling to Detroit for the draft, here's a guide to make your draft experience easy and unforgettable. Information on registration, parking, travel, street closings, and draft day activities are all below.\n\nThe 2024 NFL draft is in Detroit, spanning from Campus Martius to Hart Plaza in downtown with additional events in Beacon Park, Capitol Park, Grand Circus Park, Harmonie Park, and along Woodward Avenue. It's a big moment for Detroit as it hits the national stage.\n\n2024 NFL draft registration, tickets, sign-up\n\nThe 2024 NFL draft is free to attend and open to the public. If you're planning to attend, though, you will need to register using the NFL OnePass app or online through the website.\n\nRegistering for the event only guarantees you the NFL draft footprint in downtown Detroit. You must buy tickets separately for the actual draft theater.\n\nTicket packages are available for purchase for the second and third rounds starting at $950 per person -- the fourth through seventh rounds start at $550 per person as well. Please be wary of potential ticket scams.\n\nYou might want to bring a jacket, at least for Thursday. Expect partly sunny skies, with potentially high pollen levels, and a high of 55 degrees on Day 1 of the NFL draft. On Friday, it warms up to a high of 66 degrees and with some sun, then clouds in the afternoon. Then Saturday, it warms even further to 75 degrees, with mostly cloudy skies and a potential shower or thunderstorm.\n\nOf course, this is Michigan weather, so keep your eyes on the latest forecast to stay up to date.\n\nIf you decide to drive downtown, make a plan and prearrange parking. Many off-street lots and garages are booked, and street parking will be limited or restricted in the area. Parking regulations will be enforced; vehicles may be towed. Those planning to park downtown are encouraged to arrive by 10 a.m. You may find off-street parking options on the Park Detroit app or on Park Whiz.\n\nYou can pay for metered parking through Park Detroit's website or app. There are also options for private parking throughout the city.\n\n2024 NFL draft parking: You better have a plan if you're coming to downtown Detroit\n\nDetroit road closures for 2024 NFL draft\n\nThe City of Detroit conducted six phases of road closures leading up to and during the 2024 NFL draft. It started March 29 and will go through May 7. Be mindful of these closures as you're perusing downtown this weekend.\n\nDetroit police have partnered with the NFL and local businesses on the security plan, as well as state and federal law enforcement, according to 3rd Precinct Cmdr. Matthew Fulgenzi.\n\nThe NFL will have weapon detectors installed that attendees must walk through at the gates of the event, which will take place at Cadillac Square, Campus Martius, Hart Plaza and a portion of Woodward Avenue. The NFL has a clear bag policy to enter the draft area, Fulgenzi said.\n\nThe 2024 NFL Draft Experience is at Hart Plaza on Thursday through Saturday. The hours:\n\nActivities include a Pro Football Hall of Fame exhibit and an autograph signing opportunity with current and former NFL players, as well as a 40-yard dash, vertical jump, deep throw accuracy challenges, and more. There will also be a collection of Detroit-based food trucks for participants who attend.\n\nUse the NFL OnePass app to find more on what's planned and when throughout the NFL draft blueprint.\n\nDetroit is a city rich with museums, restaurants and activities throughout. If you're interested in exploring the area outside of the draft, you can go to the Motown Museum, the Michigan Science Center, check out golf-rich southeast Michigan, and even catch a Detroit Tigers game on April 26, 27 or 28 when they host the Kansas City Royals. And get a souvenir while you're in the city.\n\nLooking for ideas?

An estimated half a million people are expected to descend upon the city for the 2024 NFL Draft, taking place in downtown Detroit from Thursday, April 24 through Saturday, April 27.\n\nWe are getting our first look at the completed NFL Draft stage and theater, which took about a month to construct. It's located next to Campus Martius Park and the sheer size of it makes it an awe-inspiring sight to see.\n\nBringing the NFL Draft to Detroit has been a half decade in the making. It's something David Cowan with the Downtown Detroit Development says he can't believe is real after all of the time and effort it took for the city to make this happen.\n\n\"I can't even believe it. It's flown by,\" Cowan told MLive. \"There's been so much detail, so much teamwork and passion here, preparing for this, from the Detroit Sports Commission, Visit Detroit, the Detroit Lions, Downtown Detroit Partnership, City of Detroit, Bedrock... the collaboration and teamwork to bring this draft to Detroit has been unmatched. And what a payoff.\"\n\nCowan says with so many people coming to the city from all over the country, the hope is that any negative preconceived notions they may have about the city will be squashed once they see the area for themselves.\n\n\"Hundreds of thousands of people are going to see this as a 3-day commercial for Detroit and the dividends, image and perception... just the fan experience is going to be just incredible. We're so excited.\"\n\n\"It's an incredible validation of our destination that the NFL, one of the most iconic brands in the world, chose Detroit to hold their signature event,\" added Claude Molinari of Visit Detroit. \"60-million people watching on TV and hundreds of thousands of people being here, it's going to change Detroit's image, I think, around the world.\"\n\nEntry into the NFL Draft is free, but you have to download the free NFL One Pass App and register ahead of time. That will get you into the fenced-in areas, which include in and around the stage and along Woodward Avenue all the way to the NFL Fan Experience at Hart Plaza.\n\nIf you don't register, you can still enjoy the NFL Draft downtown outside of the fenced-in area.

Instead, we're wondering whether the crowds -- and the economic impact -- generated by the 2024 NFL draft in Detroit will outrun the numbers that Kansas City put on the board last year.\n\nWhen asked about the economic impact of the NFL draft in Detroit, Visit Detroit has consistently referenced the 2023 NFL draft in Kansas City, where the draft reportedly led to $164.3 million in overall economic impact. Kansas City's draft drew 312,000 people.\n\nVisit Detroit and the Detroit Sports Commission did not release any specific economic projections ahead of the event. Data on the economic impact from on-going research won't be available until possibly late May, said Chris Moyer, senior director of communications and public affairs at Visit Detroit, which works to promote metro Detroit as a convention, business meeting and tourism destination.\n\n\"We want to be meticulous in how we go about this process,\" Moyer said.\n\nMoyer said he expects to have results of how many people attended the 2024 NFL draft in Detroit on Monday. On Wednesday, he expects to have more data on hotel occupancy during the three days of football festivities.\n\nMoyer said Visit Detroit is working with Patrick Rishe, \"one of the leading sports economists in the country, to conduct a full, post-event economic impact analysis.\"\n\nRishe is director of the sports and business program and a professor of practice in sports business at the Olin Business School at Washington University in St. Louis. Rishe, who has been a contributing sports business writer at Forbes.com, has done research in economic impact studies, as well as secondary ticket pricing in sports.\n\nHe's been quoted on the impact of legalized sports gambling on viewership. \"When you got stake in the game, i.e., when you bet on something, you are much more likely to watch, whether on TV or go in-person. This is changing all aspects of the sports industry including even how you're designing your venues,\" Rishe said in February in a Yahoo! Finance report.\n\nRishe estimated that about $20 billion to $25 billion would be wagered on the Super Bowl this year in an interview with CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"\n\nMore: 2024 NFL draft: How Detroit's historic Corktown will fit into the festivities\n\nMore: 2024 NFL draft in Detroit is prime time for scammers hawking fake tickets: What to know\n\nAfter nearly 50 years of anchoring the draft in New York, the NFL began moving the draft among its team cities in 2015. The NFL draft heads to Green Bay in 2025.\n\nNFL cities that host the annual draft want to harness the economic energy that can be triggered by hundreds of thousands visiting football fans. Entry to many events is free but food, beer and booze, and travel costs are not.\n\nThe record for attendance is more than 600,000 for the NFL draft held in 2019 in Nashville, Tennessee. But many times, we hear expects looking back toward last year.\n\nThe Kansas City number of $164.3 million is clearly top of mind in economic forecasting.\n\nBack in January, I talked with Visit Detroit's Moyer about flood of cash that would be generated in Detroit during the Detroit Lions playoff games. Each Detroit Lions home playoff game was expected to fuel $20 million in economic activity in Detroit.\n\nAnd yes, we talked a bit about the upcoming draft too.\n\nThen, Moyer told me that the economic impact for Detroit hosting the NFL draft was expected to exceed $100 million and could approach $200 million. A pretty wide range there.\n\nThe East Lansing-based Anderson Economic Group put out its forecast on April 11, saying that the net economic impact of the 2024 NFL draft in downtown Detroit will exceed $160 million.\n\nMore: Lions-Buccaneers showdown set to ignite $20M economic surge for Detroit\n\nAEG pegged the potential number of unique visitors at 255,000 and anticipated that some will attend more than one event during the draft that runs Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.\n\nThe direct economic impact would include what visitors spend \"on things like hotel stays, spending at restaurants and bars, and merchandise purchases,\" according to AEG.\n\nHosting the NFL draft also can foster \"long-term tourism and investment prospects in the city and state,\" AEG noted.\n\nVisit Detroit CEO Claude Molinari was quoted in the Detroit Free Press in late March, predicting that the event would be the largest and \"most inclusive sporting event in the state of Michigan\" and generate \"hundreds of millions of dollars in economic impact.\"\n\nA \"Fast Company\" article this week predicted a range for economic impact between $150 million to $200 million over the three days.\n\nCan football fans heading to Detroit move that much money around? $200 million in three days?

Future locations after the 2024 draft in Detroit", "body": "Three months after the Lions came within one game of making the first Super Bowl in franchise history, the collective eyes of the professional football world will once again be on Detroit.\n\nBeginning Thursday and running up through Saturday, Detroit will play host to the 2024 NFL Draft, with 257 picks being made in a production area stretching from Campus Martius Park to Hart Plaza in downtown.\n\nThough the draft has always been a source of interest in the NFL during the league's offseason, it has mushroomed in popularity over the past two decades and turned into perhaps the sport's marquee event outside of the Super Bowl.\n\nREQUIRED READING: Detroit People Mover unveils new lighting for NFL draft\n\nWith that intensified demand for all things related to the draft, the event has evolved over time. As recently as the late 1960s, team representatives gathered in a small room while the NFL commissioner wrote draft selections on a chalkboard. As it generated more attention, it moved to ballrooms and later theaters, where crowds could gather to watch the action unfold.\n\nNow, it's a full-fledged spectacle, one that overtakes cities and, for nearly a decade now, takes its show on the road, with Detroit serving as its most recent stop.\n\nBeyond this year, though, where will the draft take place? Here's everything you need to know about future NFL draft sites, how host cities are determined and more:\n\nREQUIRED READING: Bringing your kids to the NFL draft in Detroit? Here are a few places to take them.\n\nAfter things wrap up this week in Detroit, the NFL draft will take place in 2025 in another NFC North city: Green Bay, Wisconsin.\n\nThe 2025 NFL Draft will take place inside and around Lambeau Field, the famed home stadium of the NFL's Green Bay Packers, from April 24-26. Green Bay was awarded the draft in November 2023. Prior to the announcement, Green Bay had pursued the possibility of hosting the draft for seven years.\n\nGreen Bay, however, is the only future draft host site that has been determined, meaning that every draft from 2026 on has yet to be assigned to a particular location. That uncertainty isn't unusual. The draft host is only named so far ahead of time, as Green Bay was selected only 17 months before the 2025 draft and Detroit was picked 25 months ahead of the 2024 draft.\n\nThe idea of the NFL Draft becoming a touring event would have been unimaginable as recently as 15 years ago. From 1965-2014, it was held every year in New York City, but in 2015, Chicago hosted it. Since then, it has been held in six different cities, with Detroit set to become the seventh this week.\n\nThe process behind selecting a draft location is similar to what goes into picking a Super Bowl host, with various cities submitting bids, which are reviewed and ultimately voted on by the NFL's 32 owners.\n\nREQUIRED READING: Mayor Duggan touts NFL draft, public safety boost, junk removal plan at State of the City\n\nSince moving away from New York after the 2014 iteration of the event, here is where the draft has been held and where it will be held in the years to come:\n\nThis article originally appeared on Detroit Free Press: Where is the NFL Draft?

This year's event is \"expected to attract up to 400,000 people.\" The NFL has been \"working with local partners to showcase Detroit-inspired art and design, a lineup of Michigan musical performances, and local food and other vendors for fans over three days.\" The event's three central venues are the Draft Theatre next to Campus Martius, the Fox Theatre and Hart Plaza. NFL Dir of Event Operations Steve Farago said that while the focus of the Draft \"is football, it has become a major entertainment event.\" The main stage of the draft is located in the Draft Theatre, which \"will hold over 1,500 people.\" Farago expects fans from \"nearby NFL franchise cities like Chicago and Pittsburgh, as well as those all over the country,\" to converge in Detroit over the next few days. He said that gates will open to fans at noon CT Thursday and Friday, and 9am Saturday. Roughly \"15 lucky inner circle guests, or die-hard fans,\" of all 32 NFL clubs have been invited to watch the draft from the theater, with \"Lions fans seated front and center.\" Only invited guests \"will be seated inside the Draft Theatre, but tens of thousands are expected to line up just outside and throughout Campus Martius to watch the draft and concert series.\" Hart Plaza will host the immersive NFL draft experience for fans (DETROIT NEWS, 4/24). In Detroit, Bob Wojnowski wrote you will \"see Detroit as rarely viewed, by a captive national audience for three days,\" starting tonight with the first round. Ambassadors for the city \"are everywhere,\" and \"not just at the highest levels of celebrity-dom.\" Rapper Eminem \"is visible and valuable and authentically Detroit\" (DETROIT NEWS, 4/24).\n\nDRAFT BUILDUP: SBJ's Ben Fischer reported the draft itself will occur in the densest part of downtown Detroit, giving it a look and feel more like Nashville in 2019 than drafts in more open spaces in recent years such as Cleveland (2021), Las Vegas (2022) and K.C. (2023). Lions President Rod Wood said, \"It'll be very memorable for being downtown, with some aspects of it that are very Detroit, including the skyline and the riverfront and proximity to Canada.\" Detroit's relative proximity to other NFL markets -- Chicago, Cleveland, Indianapolis, Cincinnati and Pittsburgh are all less than 300 miles away -- was a key selling point for the bid. While the Lions spearheaded the official league process, Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert personally lobbied NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell for the draft, knowing his commercial real estate company, Bedrock, and its tenants in downtown, could gain considerably from the exposure. Along with his Rock family of companies, Gilbert said that General Motors, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan and Roger Penske have contributed to the draft cause (SPORTS BUSINESS JOURNAL, 4/22 issue).\n\nDETROIT SPOTLIGHT: In Detroit, Jeff Seidel wrote he \"absolutely love that the NFL draft is coming to Detroit this week.\" Seidel: \"Detroit is going to be the center of the sports world for several days. There will be countless shots of the skyline and talk about grit and how the Detroit Lions and the city are perfect for each other.\" He added the draft being in Detroit \"is completely absurd and doesn't make any sense.\" Seidel: \"If you are a casual sports fan -- or not a sports fan at all -- you may be wondering, what is the fuss?\" He wrote the draft has \"become three days of entertainment and sports debate fodder\" and is \"completely ridiculous when you step back and look at the big picture.\" Seidel: \"The NFL knows how to squeeze every ounce of drama out of every situation, turning the sport into a year-round story that never stops producing content.\" He added the NFL has taken the draft on the road since 2015, and it \"has morphed into an elaborate reality TV show\" (DETROIT FREE PRESS, 4/23). In N.Y., Ken Belson writes Detroit city officials hope the three days of exposure on television \"showcases the city to fans who might not otherwise visit.\" Detroit, they say, is \"not the Detroit of a decade ago, when the city was bankrupt, tens of thousands of homes had been abandoned and the automobile industry was pulling out of a long slump.\" Mayor Mike Duggan said, \"We have a chance to reintroduce ourselves to America. The last time this country paid any attention to us was 10 years ago when we were in bankruptcy. We haven't had anything of this magnitude in a long time. We're just looking to greet America and give our visitors a good experience\" (N.Y.

It has been under construction at the Monroe Street Midway lot since March 29 and will hold over 1,500 people, Farago said during a media preview Tuesday afternoon.Ahead of the first round, prospects will walk the red carpet at the Fox Theatre. Workers were dressing up the theater's lobby Tuesday to create an \"Oscar-worthy\" experience, said NFL Events Manager Justen Medina.\"This place is absolutely beautiful and I think it really highlights the music culture and history inside of Detroit,\" Medina said of the Fox. \"We have 13 invited prospects that are coming, so all 13 will be walking the carpet and they'll head over to the theater and wait for that lucky moment.\"The red carpet event begins at 5:20 p.m. and prospects will head to the Draft Theatre after to wait backstage with friends and family. Round one of the draft begins at 8 p.m. There are 32 picks, which will be broadcast live from the draft theater's stage. Thirteen prospects are expected to attend the draft in person, including USC quarterback Caleb Williams, who is favored to be the first draft pick.Farago expects fans from nearby NFL franchise cities like Chicago and Pittsburgh, as well as those all over the country, to converge in Detroit over the next few days. While 257 draftees will be affected, the event also is about creating an experience for fans, Farago said.\"Of course, Detroit offers a great backdrop and is a great host for this event,\" Farago said. \"Detroit just has a strong passion, a strong culture in football, music, food and art, and that's really going to come to life over the three days, both in entertainment in the site as it gets built and then just through the fan experiences.\"Gates will open to fans at noon Thursday and Friday, and 9 a.m. Saturday, Farago said. Detroit artist Angela Davis will perform \"Lift Every Voice and Sing,\" ahead of round one Thursday, and Lions performer Caleb Carroll will sing the national anthem before a military flyover.NFL Draft theater almost ready for prime timeThe NFL Draft theater will host tens of thousands of fansRoughly 15 lucky inner circle guests, or die-hard fans, of all 32 NFL clubs have been invited to watch the draft from the theater, with Lions fans seated front and center.\"These folks really bring the energy to the draft, particularly Thursday, before their team gets on the clock,\" Farago said. \"We obviously have the Detroit Lions front and center, right in front of where the commissioner is going to announce the Detroit pick where they sit at 29 right now.\"Only invited guests will be seated inside the Draft Theatre, but tens of thousands are expected to line up just outside and throughout Campus Martius to watch the draft and concert series. The series features Detroit native Big Sean on Thursday at 6:15 p.m., the Detroit Youth Choir at 6 p.m. on Friday, and Canton Township native Bazzi following round seven on Saturday night. There will be a fireworks show after the second and third rounds on Friday.\"(We're) really trying to lean into that Detroit music look and feel and bringing that to life here across the three days,\" Farago said.Hart Plaza will host the immersive NFL draft experience for fans, who can access food vendors and view the Vince Lombardi Trophy and Super Bowl rings, Farago said. Youth clinics focusing on flag football also will take place at Corner Ballpark in Corktown on Thursday, Friday and Saturday.Special designs, ranging from wall-scapes to billboards to banners hanging from street posts and a custom jersey on the Spirit of Detroit, have been created by the NFL and installed at Detroit Metro Airport in Romulus and throughout the city of Detroit. Visitors and Metro Detroiters may spot a new draft-themed wrap on the People Mover and the Water Board building downtown. The designs are inspired by Detroit's art and architecture, said NFL director of Events Daphne Wood.\"As our 32 teams and all of our fans descend here, we're looking very forward to immersing everyone,\" Wood said. \"It's such a privilege to be in Detroit and to bring the people here for the draft and to spotlight this part of the community, so for us, the art was really a center point.\"The NFL partnered with Visit Detroit and the city to create the designs but did not work with any local artists, Wood said. The league's creative department takes about a year and a half to make sure designs reflect its host city, Wood said.\"There's a process that goes into it that takes about a year and a half going through the city, getting inspiration to make sure that it's reflective of Detroit, the energy of the people here,\" Wood said. \"We went around to many different groups around the city and made sure that everybody had a perspective in the decor.\"hmackay@detroitnews.com\n\nSource link", "source": {"uri": "sportal.co.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportal - World Sports News - Live Scores"},

Unlike the NFL's marquee event, the Super Bowl, the draft does not require extensive public subsidies, hotels and security. It is also held in late April, when weather is less of a concern, even in cities with harsh winters. This allowed the NFL in recent years to award the draft to Cleveland, Kansas City, Missouri, and other cities that have never, and may never, host a Super Bowl.\n\nDetroit hosted the Super Bowl in 2006, as a reward to the Lions for moving into a new stadium. But city officials expect that being the site of this year's draft, which begins Thursday, will provide an economic jolt, although how much of one is unclear.\n\nThey also hope the three days of exposure on television showcases the city to fans who might not otherwise visit. Detroit, they say, is not the Detroit of a decade ago, when the city was bankrupt, tens of thousands of homes had been abandoned and the automobile industry was pulling out of a long slump. Since then, new hotels, businesses and residents have flooded downtown; unemployment has fallen; and the city's debt has returned to investment grade.\n\n\"We have a chance to reintroduce ourselves to America,\" Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan said in an interview. \"The last time this country paid any attention to us was 10 years ago when we were in bankruptcy. We haven't had anything of this magnitude in a long time. We're just looking to greet America and give our visitors a good experience.\"\n\nThe draft as movable feast started partly out of necessity. Radio City Music Hall in New York, which hosted nine consecutive drafts dating to 2006, had a scheduling conflict in 2015, so the NFL moved the event to Chicago. The draft that fans watched on television, with top college players walking onstage when their names were called, was held in a theater on Michigan Avenue. The real surprise was across the street in Grant Park, where 200,000 fans from around the region attended what amounted to a pop-up NFL theme park.\n\nThe mix of team colors and the family-friendly vibe was proof of concept for the NFL, which created a process for other cities to apply to host the event. Teams and civic leaders in their markets raised their hands, seeing the event as a kind of football Woodstock that attracts lots of visitors. In 2016, Rod Wood, the president of the Lions, began lobbying the league to bring the draft to Detroit. The next year, the Lions and the Detroit Sports Commission applied but were passed over as the draft traveled to cities like Nashville, Tennessee, and Las Vegas. Detroit was finally tapped in 2022 to host this year's event.\n\nLike other cities, Detroit worked with the NFL to find a location that met the league's requirements for issues like security and transportation. The NFL chose Campus Martius Park downtown and a four-block stretch on Woodward Avenue leading to the Detroit River for the stage and fan zone. To fuel businesses outside that narrow footprint, the Downtown Detroit Partnership created fan viewing sites in nearby parks. Block associations in the Corktown, Greektown and Eastern Market neighborhoods will host their own viewing parties.\n\nBob Roberts, the president of the Corktown Business Association, runs McShane's, a sports bar in the area. He said he expected to triple his normal sales during the draft. Visitors, he said, can visit a market for local artisans and the Detroit Police Athletic League down the street, where the NFL is hosting activities for youngsters. The association will run shuttles to nearby parking facilities and the draft site downtown.\n\n\"It's going to be a huge shot in the arm,\" Roberts said. \"We expect that we're going to be busy from the time we open until the time we close.\"\n\nThe Michigan Black Business Alliance used the draft to persuade small, minority-owned businesses to register to work at big events. Britney Hoskins, who runs the Top Pic Collective, which rents chairs, tables and other furnishings, said that after she was certified, the NFL selected her company to outfit VIP rooms, a beer tent and other areas. Having the league on her resume, she said, is validation that she hopes will help her win other business after the draft has left town.\n\n\"We've never been in the room before,\" Hoskins said. \"We are on all of these major-scale event radars now, so to me the impact is long-lasting.\"\n\nCities and tourism bureaus often promote the economic benefits of hosting large events like the draft. The Kansas City Sports Commission, for instance, said the event generated $164 million last year. Most sports economists, though, dismiss these estimates as manufactured to suit agencies trying to justify the use of taxpayer funds to host events for for-profit organizations like the NFL. The estimates often fail to account for expenses like police overtime and road closures, or the money raised by host committees from sponsors and local corporations.\n\nJordan Kobritz, who teaches sports management at the State University of New York at Cortland and has owned and operated minor league baseball teams, is skeptical of the projections but said publicity from the event could be a positive, even if it was ultimately intangible.\n\n\"There is benefit at the end of the day because one thing that is very hard to analyze is the publicity that the community gets out of it,\" he said. \"Look at where Detroit is. True or not, there is a public perception that downtown is a disaster area. They're hoping that all this positive publicity will help attract people who want to live there or do business there.\"\n\nDetroit has not created any estimates on the potential boon in part because no one is sure how many people will show up and from where. Detroit is within a five-hour drive of six NFL markets and just across the Detroit River from Canada. Officials hope the recent success of the hometown Lions and the University of Michigan's football team, which won the national championship this year, will boost local attendance. But the weather and other factors can affect whether fans arrive from out of town.\n\n\"That's the thing: When it's not necessarily a ticketed event, how many people are going to show up?\" said Dave Beachnau, executive director of the Detroit Sports Commission.\n\nAfter the draft ends, a ceremonial football will travel to Muskegon, Michigan; board the Lake Express ferry; cross Lake Michigan to Milwaukee; and then head north to the site of next year's draft, Green Bay, Wisconsin, the smallest NFL market, but a singular one.\n\n\"I have a feeling people will make the pilgrimage\" next spring, said Gabrielle Dow, vice president of marketing for the Green Bay Packers. \"You'll get to see your favorite team's picks and check the box of seeing Lambeau Field. You'll kill two birds with one stone here.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.", "source": {"uri": "kansas.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Wichita Eagle"}, "authors":

There was a lot of neglect until a shiny, new Ford Field finally got to host the Super Bowl in 2006, kicking off a new era for the city. It forced a transformation.\n\n\"I'm very excited to see all those people downtown and get the whole world to see Detroit maybe in a different way than they perceive right now,\" Lions CEO Rod Wood said.\n\nNow, the city is alive, thriving, buzzing as the entire nation's eyes are on it for the NFL Draft. Locals are helping get the city's message out there.\n\n\"I just wanted to put Detroit in your face, especially for those that know Detroit from the outskirts,\" Detroit artist Fel'le said. \"I just wanted to represent Detroit well.\"\n\nFootball fans in Detroit can take pictures with 20 giant cleats scattered throughout downtown. All are painted by local artists and will be auctioned off for a charity of the artist's choice.\n\nThat's only part of what makes Draft day in Detroit unique.\n\n\"The first day people could register for it, we had almost 100,000 people sign up, which is 2.5x what signed up for the first day in Kansas City,\" Wood said. \"So, I think it's going to be a ruckus downtown environment. I think it's going to be dynamite for the city.\"\n\nNFL Network Analyst Charles Davis was in Detroit for the official announcement and it was unlike any other Draft announcement he's seen.\n\n\"The governor of the state, Gretchen Whitmer, the commissioner of the NFL, Roger Goodell, the lieutenant governor, the mayor, are you kidding me? Oh, and by the way, Mrs. Sheila Hamp, who's running the Detroit Lions and owns them, was there,\" Davis said. \"That's not supposed to happen. I knew that day that Detroit was taking dead aim at what the best Draft was, in terms of attendance ... I can't wait to watch this unfold. I've been looking forward to it ever since I came.\"\n\nThe NFL Draft attendance record is 600,000 people through the three-day span.

Detroit's experience is also expected to bring hundreds of thousands of fans as the city is centrally located between several of the league's 32 major teams.\n\n\"The NFL Draft will be a moment Detroiters remember for years to come,\" Mayor Mike Duggan told The Detroit News. \"I had a chance to tour the Draft Theater and event footprint, and it's spectacular. Everyone in Detroit owes an enormous thanks to the hundreds of people who have spent the last two years planning every detail of this event.\"\n\nThe three-day free event required years of planning, tens of millions spent by the NFL, along with an unknown amount from private partnerships. Detroit officials contend they spent $230,000 in city funds on murals; they spent another $1.53 million on improvements to streets, traffic signal improvements, tree planting and sprucing up medians in the city, but officials say a state grant covered those costs.\n\nThe NFL predicts around 300,000 will attend the event, which is in line with numbers for last year's draft. Depending on weather conditions, attendance could possibly approach the record of 600,000 in Nashville, Tenn., in 2019.\n\nThe economic impact is expected to top $160 million, according to a new analysis from the East Lansing-based economic consulting firm Anderson Economic Group LLC.\n\nWith so much at stake, city officials and planners said they are sparing no effort on infrastructure upgrades, beautification and neighborhood outreach to lure all residents to a sparkling downtown for the NFL Draft.\n\n\"Success in hosting major events is a lot like success on the football field; it takes a complete team effort,\" said Christopher Moyer, spokesman for Visit Detroit. \"The draft will be the largest and most inclusive sporting event Michigan has ever hosted, and we can't wait for the festivities to begin.\"\n\nWhile the city has gone through a dramatic transformation since it hosted Super Bowl XL in 2006, there are some similarities in preparation. At the time, a $14 million blue six-lane Gateway Bridge shaped with footballs was permanently constructed above Telegraph and Interstate 94 for travelers coming from the airport.\n\nThis year, the city commemorated the NFL Draft with a Gateway \"D-E-T-R-O-I-T\" sign on I-94 between Central and Cecil avenues that stirred controversy after an AI rendering took social media by storm and set expectations too high, Duggan said. The sign, which illuminates at night, cost nearly $300,000 but still didn't impress some, like topical rapper Gmac Cash who released two songs about it this month.\n\nResidents may have noticed more detours and construction building up this week, but few may realize it took years to plan the event. Detroit learned two years ago it would host the 2024 NFL Draft, three years after it submitted its bid to the league, said David Cowan, the chief spaces officer for the Downtown Detroit Partnership.\n\nThe city has partnered with the state, entities like Visit Detroit and Downtown Detroit Partnership and several private sector companies to raise $10 million to make the NFL Draft free to attend for all visitors downtown.\n\nTo gear up, the city's public works department and the Downtown Detroit Partnership repaired sidewalks, paved streets, upgraded traffic lights and painted 600 flag polls and electrical boxes. Campus Martius' free Wi-Fi bandwidth has been boosted, and several downtown businesses are expanding in preparation for the influx of visitors.\n\nThe draft runs Thursday through Saturday around Campus Martius Park, where the made-for-television stage has been built out and stationed near the Monroe Street Midway. The footprint stretches from Ford Field to Hart Plaza, where family-friendly festivities and photo opportunities with the Lombardi Trophy are expected to be held.\n\nDuggan has focused most of his time touting the draft as an opportunity to \"reintroduce Detroit to America.\" Building off the Lions' success during last season's playoffs, he said the city is ready to show how dramatically it has changed since 2006 -- and a decade after its historic bankruptcy.\n\n\"Of course, this is not just about three days in April,\" Moyer said. \"The success of this event will help accelerate Detroit and Michigan's growth for the next 30 years. Success this week will help us attract more visitors, events, and billions of dollars in investment.\"\n\nHomicides and unemployment are down, once-vacant hotels have come back to life, and downtown is filled with stores and trendy restaurants. Detroit's national image two decades ago as a city of \"ruin porn\" has been replaced by footage of a gleaming skyline, Duggan said earlier this month. He moved his 11th State of the City speech to highlight a robust effort in preparation for the draft.\n\n\"Instead of blight, they can visit beauty,\" he said during his speech.\n\nBeautification, murals\n\nAlong the freeways, the city planted hundreds of trees and shrubs, and its demolition department has ramped up efforts to remove blight and increased its trash removal services. Belle Isle held a volunteer day cleanup event on Saturday.\n\nThe city has also upgraded 30 privately owned parking lots and provided grants to parking lot owners \"so those ugly yellow chains won't be across their lots but rather aesthetically beautiful fencing,\" Duggan said.\n\nIn addition to new signage on the freeway, smaller pathway signs have been placed throughout downtown instructing residents how to get around to popular spots. There's also new wrapping on the QLine and People Mover welcoming the NFL Draft.\n\nThrough the City Walls program, Detroit has contracted artists to paint murals at five People Mover stations that will showcase Detroit's sports history, including championship moments from the Tigers, Red Wings and Pistons. It also commissioned local artists and charities on \"DCLEATED,\" 20 fabricated colossal football cleats that have been painted by local artists and scattered around downtown and will be auctioned off for charity.\n\nThe city also contracted six murals to be painted on downtown buildings, but the City Council refused to pay for them, citing the work had been done without their approval.\n\nIn the heart of downtown, meanwhile, a large sign of Lions edge rusher Aidan Hutchinson will welcome visitors looking up toward the side of Cadillac Tower reading, \"Dreams get made here,\" in the same spot where a storied mural of Lions running back Barry Sanders once stood.\n\nHow much has been spent so far\n\nCity officials say it's hard to quantify how much they've spent preparing for the draft.\n\nOf the city's estimated $1.76 million draft bill, $230,000 was spent on the City Wall projects including murals and art installations, like the giant cleat project and painting electrical boxes to represent historic city athletes. Another $3,000 was spent on hosting business certification fairs for minority and women-based businesses, where more than 300 small businesses became certified to work as vendors during the event.\n\nAnother $1.53 million was spent on traffic signal improvements, tree planting and sprucing up medians in the city, but those funds came from the city's street fund, which comes from state grant money from the state's gas tax revenue.\n\nThe city made other improvements over the last year but said it doesn't consider them to be \"draft improvements,\" including renovations to Hart Plaza, $5 million for the Dodge Fountain restoration, $425,000 for six Welcome to Detroit signs, and freeway cleanup.\n\nThe city also said it relied on the private partnerships, which assisted in applying for the draft to be held in Detroit, to cover some improvement costs as part of preparations.\n\nEric Larson, CEO of the Downtown Detroit Partnership, said they have raised $2 million spent on hosting Draft Day in the D, including watch parties at the four nearby parks and on Woodward activations, without more specifics. \"Other investments made were part of DDP's general operating budget that Downtown will benefit long after Draft weekend, such as infrastructure and public space improvements,\" Larson said.\n\nSecurity\n\nDetroit Police Chief James White has said that not a single officer of the department's 2,500 will have a day off during the three-day event. According to White, \"a lot\" of police overtime is expected, which was allocated for in Detroit's fiscal budget through last year's surpluses.\n\nExpect to see -- and not see -- a heavy police presence downtown during the draft, a gun-free, smoke-free and weapon-free event. There is also a clear bag policy. Only strollers, small cameras, binoculars and empty, reusable water bottles will be permitted. There's free water filling inside the event.\n\nMore than 770 banners create the perimeter for the draft footprint stretching from Ford Field to Hart Plaza.\n\nPolice will monitor live video feeds from cameras throughout downtown, including footage from properties owned by Ilitch Holdings and Rocket Mortgage and its family of companies that have offices encircling Campus Martius, White said.\n\nThis year's draft strategy will employ \"Casper Units\" -- undercover cops in crowds -- and more \"eyes in the sky,\" with helicopter patrols and officers on rooftops. DPD will also be assisted by dozens of deputies from the Wayne County Sheriff and other nearby agencies. K-9 teams are also being flown in from across the country.\n\nThe department owns about a dozen Evolv weapon detection monitors and has borrowed 50 additional detectors to use throughout downtown.\n\nIn addition to watching for problems that might erupt downtown during the draft, authorities are monitoring for crimes including human trafficking, even through social media posts.\n\nTo ensure there are enough officers to patrol the city's neighborhoods, White said last week, \"every single officer will be working those three days; we call it a restricted day. We still have neighborhood policing to do.\"\n\nMore than 140 volunteers will be assisting police in responding to immediate medical situations. The Detroit Medical Center is this year's medical provider for the NFL Draft.\n\nActivating the neighborhoods\n\nThere have been changes to local transportation services, road closures, and the city has had to spend efforts educating residents about changes underway.\n\nDuggan has declared Thursday \"Honolulu Blue Day\" to kick off the draft to ensure people watching from afar know the city's pride in the Detroit Lions, he said.\n\nThe city also held its \"On the Clock\" tour, a pre-draft activation, with 11 events in Detroit neighborhoods. They're working with the Lions and Detroit Public Schools Community District for the draft fests, which will feature Visit Detroit's mobile visitor center, the D-Rover, which has been temporarily rebranded as the Draft Rover.\n\nDetroit needs to execute the draft perfectly, Duggan said, to ensure the city has future national event opportunities.\n\n\"The only thing we can't control is the weather,\" he said. \"And then, the only thing we need is a hotel attached to a convention center. That's in the process right now with the Water Square Hotel. If we can put those together, Detroit could see an economic boom for years.\"", "source": {"uri": "detroitnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Detroit News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Downtown Detroit"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Downtown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mural", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mural"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_light", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Traffic light"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_A._Hart_Plaza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philip A.

Those prior events, however, largely happened when long-downtrodden Detroit was still in the midst of economic decline, and certainly long before the rebirth of the Lions both on and off the field. This year's NFL draft arrives as the Lions in 2023 enjoyed their best season in more than three decades, reaching the NFC championship game, selling out their entire home schedule, and reigniting a long-dormant fan base into what is now one of the league's most fervent bases of support.\n\nAs a result, the draft presents a unique opportunity to show off the city to a large national audience and put a further exclamation point on the Lions' success of 2023.\n\n\"[We're] very excited to see all those people downtown and [to] get the whole world to see Detroit maybe in a different way than what they perceive right now,\" Lions president and chief executive Rod Wood said at the NFL's annual meeting last month in Florida. \"It's going be a great three-day commercial for the city.\"\n\nSince Ford Field hosted Super Bowl XL in 2006, downtown Detroit is a very different place. The Great Recession of '08-09 levied a further blow to an already-challenged city and the automotive industry that drives much of the local economy. But since then, Little Caesars Arena has opened as the new home of the NHL's Red Wings and NBA's Pistons. The downtown area -- once almost exclusively a locale for increasingly vacant office properties -- has seen a 30% bump in the number of residential activity since '19.\n\nAnd through a series of upgrades to dozens of commercial properties, an aggressive pursuit of new business activity, and an additional focus on developing additional cultural and entertainment activities in this downtown core, key economic metrics such as local unemployment, per capita income, and median credit score have all reached some of their best levels in years.\n\nChallenges, however, still remain, and the overall city revitalization effort is still very much a work in progress, as seen in part by a Detroit city population of 620,376 that is down by 28% since that last Super Bowl at Ford Field.\n\nThe NFL's draft plan, developed with the aid of the Lions and local officials, is specifically designed to incorporate a series of local landmarks, including Campus Martius Park (site of the draft itself), Hart Plaza (site of the fan experience), and along and near key downtown thoroughfare Woodward Avenue, where additional events will be staged.\n\n\"These kinds of events can definitely change the perception of people who have never been here,\" Mark Hollis, chief operating officer for Rock Entertainment Group, tells Front Office Sports. Hollis, the former athletic director at Michigan State and now a senior leader at the company led by Cleveland Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert, was part of the group that helped develop the initial bid for Detroit to host the draft. \"We made a specific push to have this event right downtown for that very reason.\"\n\nLast year's draft drew an average audience of six million over the event's three days, including an average of 11.4 million for the first round, and a total unduplicated audience of 54.4 million viewers. Given the NFL's across-the-board TV audience growth in the regular season and playoffs, there is little reason to believe there will be any meaningful decline in this year's draft totals, or even any decline at all.\n\nAttendance for the draft, meanwhile, is also likely to be boosted by not only the passion of local fans but also Detroit's proximity to other NFL markets such as Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Indianapolis, and Pittsburgh.", "source": {"uri": "frontofficesports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Front Office Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "owen_poindexter@frontofficesports.com", "name": "Owen Poindexter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "eric_fisher@frontofficesports.com", "name": "Eric Fisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "dennis_young@frontofficesports.com", "name": "Dennis Young", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ford Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFC_Championship_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFC Championship Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Caesars_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Little Caesars Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XL", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl XL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Pistons", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Pistons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Downtown Detroit"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Great Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Gilbert", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dan Gilbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_A._Hart_Plaza", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philip A.

As a result, different locales have earned the honor in each of the past nine years.\n\nThe city of Detroit is the latest to receive such a responsibility.

He has spent nearly a year immersed in building relationships here, making discoveries of things to showcase and putting together pieces of the overall coverage plan.\n\nAlong with the NFL Network, ABC, ESPN and the Spanish-language pay channel ESPN Deportes will offer live coverage of the draft's rounds on Thursday and Friday night and Saturday afternoon. There also will be streaming coverage on web platforms like ESPN+, YouTube TV, Hulu+ Live TV and more.\n\nThere will be multiple sets filled with numerous well-known TV sports commentators and behind-the-scenes crews at work in the downtown Detroit area stretching from from Campus Martius to Hart Plaza. You might even get a sighting of former New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick, who'll co-host the \"The Pat McAfee Show Draft Spectacular\" Thursday night, streaming on ESPN+.\n\nAll those cameras - not to mention the possibility of several hundreds of thousands of visitors - are going to give Detroit a showcase like no other.\n\n\"The NFL draft is going to do more for our city in terms of economic activity and its national image than any single event in Detroit's history,\" said Mayor Mike Duggan in a news statement about the draft's potential impact.\n\nMore: Sam Richardson showcases Detroit hot spots and swagger in ad campaign timed to NFL draft\n\nExposure like this is, to borrow a famous commercial catchphrase, priceless. As Detroit Sports Commission Executive Director Dave Beachnau told the Free Press, \"As we continue to shape the image and perception of Detroit; to have 50 or 60 million eyeballs on our city for three days, I mean, we can't afford that kind of advertising that the broadcast brings.\"\n\nSo how will Detroit be portrayed amidst the festivities? Most likely as a great place to visit, which locals have long realized -- and as a newly emerged football powerhouse, an image Lions fans are still savoring.\n\nMaloney said the city \"has been a sleeping giant of a football town for a long time.\" Now, thanks to last season's exhilarating playoff run by the Lions, Detroit is a contender, period.\n\nConversations with Detroiters have been key to informing the NFL Network's coverage, said Maloney. He cited one comment, in particular, that has been critical to his understanding of the city.\n\n\"They dropped this great line on me that I can't get out of my head, that I'm really trying to take and incorporate it. The line was cars wouldn't be cars, music wouldn't be music, culture wouldn't be culture without Detroit. I absolutely love that,\" he said.\n\nAlthough Maloney wants to keep some Detroit-centric references up his sleeve - \"You gotta wait,\" he insists, teasing some opening night surprises -- the NFL Network has revealed that Motown legend Smokey Robinson will be the voice for the opening of its coverage. Accompanying Robinson will be a remastered version of the classic 1966 Temptations hit \"Get Ready.\"\n\nThe NFL Network's main set is designed \"to take in the big theater and all the lights and screens, as well as the sea of Honolulu blue, all the Lions fans that are going to pack it, \" said Maloney.\n\nMore: A closer look at the NFL draft theater built in downtown Detroit\n\nAnd don't worry. With Thursday declared \"Honolulu Blue Day\" in Detroit by Mayor Duggan, there should be plenty of visual messaging about local pride for the team.\n\nAccording to Maloney, the NFL draft's appeal comes from several factors, including the way that it unites collegiate and pro football fans and involves all 32 NFL teams. But there's a more intangible reason, a little thing called hope.\n\n\"Every fan base goes into the draft thinking this is where we get our hall of fame player, this is where we get the player that our team really, really, really needs,\" he said.\n\nAnd, just maybe, this year will bring the star turn that Detroit deserves, too.", "source": {"uri": "freep.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Those prior events, however, largely happened when the long-downtrodden Detroit was still in the midst of economic decline, and certainly long before the rebirth of the Lions both on and off the field. This year's NFL draft arrives as the Lions in 2023 enjoyed their best season in more than three decades, reaching the NFC championship game, selling out their entire home schedule, and reigniting a long-dormant fan base into what is now one of the league's most fervent bases of support.\n\nAs a result, the draft presents a unique opportunity to show off the city to a large national audience and put a further exclamation point on the Lions' success of 2023.\n\n\"[We're] very excited to see all those people downtown and [to] get the whole world to see Detroit maybe in a different way than what they perceive right now,\" Lions president and chief executive Rod Wood said at the NFL's annual meeting last month in Florida. \"It's going be a great three-day commercial for the city.\"\n\nSince Ford Field hosted Super Bowl XL in 2006, downtown Detroit is a very different place. The Great Recession of '08-09 levied a further blow to an already-challenged city and the automotive industry that drives much of the local economy. But since then, Little Caesars Arena has opened as the new home of the NHL's Red Wings and NBA's Pistons. The downtown area -- once almost exclusively a locale for increasingly vacant office properties -- has seen a 30% bump in the number of residential activity since '19.\n\nAnd through a series of upgrades to dozens of commercial properties, an aggressive pursuit of new business activity, and an additional focus on developing additional cultural and entertainment activities in this downtown core, key economic metrics such as local unemployment, per capita income, and median credit score have all reached some of their best levels in years.\n\nChallenges, however, still remain, and the overall city revitalization effort is still very much a work in progress, as seen in part by a Detroit city population of 620,376 that is down by 28% since that last Super Bowl at Ford Field.\n\nThe NFL's draft plan, developed with the aid of the Lions and local officials, is specifically designed to incorporate a series of local landmarks, including Campus Martius Park (site for the draft itself), Hart Plaza (site of the fan experience), and along and near key downtown thoroughfare Woodward Avenue, where additional events will be staged.\n\n\"These kinds of events can definitely change the perception of people who have never been here,\" Mark Hollis, chief operating officer for Rock Entertainment Group, tells Front Office Sports. Hollis, the former athletic director at Michigan State and now a senior leader at the company led by Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert, was part of the group that helped develop the initial bid for Detroit to host the draft. \"We made a specific push to have this event right downtown for that very reason.\"\n\nLast year's draft drew an average audience of six million over the event's three days, including an average of 11.4 million for the first round, and a total unduplicated audience of 54.4 million viewers. Given the NFL's across-the-board TV audience growth in the regular season and playoffs, there is little reason to believe there will be any meaningful decline in this year's draft totals, or even any decline at all.\n\nAttendance for the draft, meanwhile, is also likely to be boosted by not only the passion of local fans but also Detroit's proximity to other NFL markets such as Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Indianapolis, and Pittsburgh.", "source": {"uri": "frontofficesports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Front Office Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eric_fisher@frontofficesports.com", "name": "Eric Fisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFC_Championship_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFC Championship Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Caesars_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Little Caesars Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ford Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XL", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl XL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Pistons", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Pistons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Downtown Detroit"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Great Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Gilbert", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dan Gilbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_A._Hart_Plaza", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philip A.

While the focus is football, it has become a major entertainment event, said NFL director of Event Operations Steve Farago.\n\nThe main stage is located in the Draft Theatre, where 257 players will be drafted across seven rounds. It has been under construction at the Monroe Street Midway lot since March 29 and will hold over 1,500 people, Farago said during a media preview Tuesday afternoon.\n\nAhead of the first round, prospects will walk the red carpet at the Fox Theatre. Workers were dressing up the theater's lobby Tuesday to create an \"Oscar-worthy\" experience, said NFL Events Manager Justen Medina.\n\n\"This place is absolutely beautiful and I think it really highlights the music culture and history inside of Detroit,\" Medina said of the Fox. \"We have 13 invited prospects that are coming, so all 13 will be walking the carpet and they'll head over to the theater and wait for that lucky moment.\"\n\nThe red carpet event begins at 5:20 p.m. and prospects will head to the Draft Theatre after to wait backstage with friends and family. Round one of the draft begins at 8 p.m. There are 32 picks, which will be broadcast live from the draft theater's stage. Thirteen prospects are expected to attend the draft in person, including USC quarterback Caleb Williams, who is favored to be the first draft pick.\n\nFargo expects fans from nearby NFL franchise cities like Chicago and Pittsburg, as well as those all over the country, to converge in Detroit over the next few days. While 257 draftees will be affected, the event also is about creating an experience for fans, Farago said.\n\n\"Of course, Detroit offers a great backdrop and is a great host for this event,\" Farago said. \"Detroit just has a strong passion, a strong culture in football, music, food and art, and that's really going to come to life over the three days, both in entertainment in the site as it gets built and then just through the fan experiences.\"\n\nGates will open to fans at noon Thursday and Friday, and 9 a.m. Saturday, Farago said. Detroit artist Angela Davis will perform \"Lift Every Voice and Sing,\" ahead of round one Thursday, and Lions performer Caleb Carroll will sing the national anthem before a military flyover.\n\nRoughly 15 lucky inner circle guests, or die-hard fans, of all 32 NFL clubs have been invited to watch the draft from the theater, with Lions fans seated front and center.\n\n\"These folks really bring the energy to the draft, particularly Thursday, before their team gets on the clock,\" Farago said. \"We obviously have the Detroit Lions front and center, right in front of where the commissioner is going to announce the Detroit pick where they sit at 29 right now.\"\n\nOnly invited guests will be seated inside the Draft Theatre, but tens of thousands are expected to line up just outside and throughout Campus Martius to watch the draft and concert series. The series features Detroit native Big Sean on Thursday at 6:15 p.m., the Detroit Youth Choir at 6 p.m. on Friday, and Canton Township native Bazzi following round seven on Saturday night. There will be a fireworks show after the second and third rounds on Friday.\n\n\"(We're) really trying to lean into that Detroit music look and feel and bringing that to life here across the three days,\" Farago said.\n\nHart Plaza will host the immersive NFL draft experience for fans, who can access food vendors and view the Vince Lombardi Trophy and Super Bowl rings, Farago said. Youth clinics focusing on flag football also will take place at Corner Ballpark in Corktown on Thursday, Friday and Saturday.\n\nSpecial designs, ranging from wall-scapes to billboards to banners hanging from street posts and a custom jersey on the Spirit of Detroit, have been created by the NFL and installed at Detroit Metro Airport in Romulus and throughout the city of Detroit. Visitors and Metro Detroiters may spot a new draft-themed wrap on the People Mover and the Water Board building downtown. The designs are inspired by Detroit's art and architecture, said NFL director of Events Daphne Wood.\n\n\"As our 32 teams and all of our fans descend here, we're looking very forward to immersing everyone,\" Wood said. \"It's such a privilege to be in Detroit and to bring the people here for the draft and to spotlight this part of the community, so for us, the art was really a center point.\"\n\nThe NFL partnered with Visit Detroit and the city to create the designs but did not work with any local artists, Wood said. The league's creative department takes about a year and a half to make sure designs reflect its host city, Wood said.\n\n\"There's a process that goes into it that takes about a year and a half going through the city, getting inspiration to make sure that it's reflective of Detroit, the energy of the people here,\" Wood said. \"We went around to many different groups around the city and made sure that everybody had a perspective in the decor.\"", "source": {"uri": "detroitnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Detroit News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Theatre_(Detroit)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fox Theatre (Detroit)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Downtown Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Downtown Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_A._Hart_Plaza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philip A.

Hundreds of thousands of football fans are expected to descend upon downtown Detroit for the sports spectacle that will see more than 200 new players enter the league and hope at an all-time high for all 32 teams, including the Detroit Lions.\n\nWhile the actual NFL draft begins at 8 tonight with Round 1, the NFL Fan Experience opens to the public at noon, and fans are expected to beging trickling downtown far sooner. We're covering all the action as we bring the excitement to you with live updates and visuals from Detroit.\n\nKeep up with our live updates on what's happening on Day 1 at the NFL draft's theater near Campus Martius and at the NFL Fan Experience in Hart Plaza.\n\n11:30 a.m.: Qline commuters face long walks\n\nThe opening day Thursday for the NFL draft brought some unexpected inconvenience -- and long walks -- for Detroiters who had intended to ride the Qline into downtown.\n\nThe 3.3-mile streetcar line will stop short of downtown through Saturday, ending its route outside Little Caesars Arena.\n\nThat partial closure, although announced before the draft, nevertheless was a surprise to many of the riders on a Qline streetcar at about 9:30 a.m. Riders throughout the car groaned and complained once the conductor shared the news that the next stop -- Sproat Street -- would be their last.\n\nFor Chelsey Rayford, 56, whose stop is ordinarily the last Qline stop at Congress, it meant that she would need to walk a mile or so to get to work -- and she was now running late.\n\n\"It's a very big inconvenience. I think that they should have thought about the working people that actually work downtown,\" she said. \"If they didn't do anything but give us a shuttle, that would have been great.\"\n\nRayford added that she is glad the draft is in Detroit, but wishes more consideration had been given to year-round Detroiters.\n\nCelebrate the Lions' epic season withthe Detroit Free Press' new commemorative book: \"From Grit to Glory: The Epic Story of the Detroit Lions' 2023 Renaissance.\" Order now atLions.PictorialBook.com!\n\nFollow the Detroit Free Press on Instagram (@detroitfreepress), TikTok (@detroitfreepress), YouTube (@DetroitFreePress), Twitter/X (@freep), and LinkedIn, and like us on Facebook (@detroitfreepress).", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Downtown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Downtown Detroit"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tram", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Caesars_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Little Caesars Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_A._Hart_Plaza", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philip A.

Since 2014, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources has operated Belle Isle as a state park as part of a 30-year lease with the city of Detroit.\n\nVisitors can check out the Belle Isle Aquarium, Belle Isle Nature Center, Anna Scripps Whitcomb Conservatory and the Dossin Great Lakes Museum.\n\nIt's also a great place to walk around and take in the city, as it provides a great view of the Detroit skyline.\n\nIf you're staying in downtown Detroit for the draft, you can probably walk to the events, but taking a ride on the Detroit People Mover is still a fun experience.\n\nThe Detroit People Mover operates in a one-way, nearly 3-mile loop in downtown Detroit. From 7 a.m. on Thursday, April 25, through midnight on Sunday, April 28, the People Mover will operate 24 hours a day. It will be free to ride, and the stations closest to NFL Draft entry locations are the Financial District and Millender Center stops.\n\nWhile Detroit-style pizza can be found across the country, it only makes sense to try the square-shaped pizza in its birthplace.\n\nThe pizza, known for its crusty, cheesy corners, originated in 1946 at Buddy's Rendezvous Pizzeria on Six Mile in Detroit.\n\nThere is a buddy's location at 1565 Broadway St. in downtown Detroit. There are several places to get Detroit-style pizza in the city, though, including Michigan & Trumbull, Pie Sci and Grandma Bob's. Two other places outside of the city but still in Metro Detroit, known for having good Detroit-style pizza, are Green Lantern in Madison Heights and Loui's Pizza in Hazel Park.\n\nAnd just to add in one more place, because Detroit's thriving pizza scene provides many options for recommendations, check out Supino Pizzeria for New York-style pizza if that's more your vibe. You can visit Supino's Eastern Market location for take-out or dine-in at its New Center location.\n\nWhile we're on the topic of food, if you're visiting Detroit, you might want to stop at a coney island to grab a bite to eat. There are several staples in and around the city, including Kerby's, Leo's, National, Grandy's, and more, that serve a variety of foods, such as breakfast items, Greek salads, pita wraps, sandwiches and saganaki, and are open early and late, with some open 24/7.\n\nConey Islands also serve coney dogs, and if you're in Detroit for the draft, you can grab one at American or Lafayette (or both to participate in the longtime debate over which Coney Island serves a better coney dog).\n\nThe Detroit Institute of Arts, or DIA, is a museum located in the Midtown neighborhood of Detroit. Its collection is among the top six across the country, with more than 65,000 pieces of work.\n\nLast month, the DIA was named the best art museum in the United States in USA Today's 10Best Readers' Choice Awards.\n\nThe Motown Museum is where Berry Gordy started Motown Records in 1959. The museum is located in the original headquarters and recording studio for Motown Records and has a variety of artifacts, including photos, costumes and more.\n\nVisit the museum's website for all the specific information on admission prices and hours.\n\nIf you're looking to get some dancing in while you're in town for the draft, Detroit has plenty of options for you. Detroit is also known as the birthplace of techno music, and you can find tributes to its origin throughout the city.\n\nOn Friday, the Saunderson Brothers, the sons of Detroit techno and house pioneer Kevin Saunderson, will have a shot at Big Pink.\n\nMarble Bar is also hosting a 12-hour party on Saturday, April 27, with a lineup of artists, including Shigeto, a Detroit favorite. Other popular spots for dancing include Spot Lite, TV Lounge, Temple Bar and SpkrBox.\n\nWhile you're having fun checking out all that the city has to offer, be sure to check out our list of important information to know for the NFL Draft. It includes information about registration, security procedures, road closures, transportation and more!\n\nClick here for a guide to everything you need to know about the draft, including road closures, transportation options for getting around the city, concerts and more.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Connect to the audience and try to inspire them through stories they can relate to versus a marketing message.\"\n\nSometimes you need to bring in outsiders to tell your story.\n\nIn 2008, a group consisting of Detroit business and civic leaders and local journalists launched the Detroit Regional News Hub. The Hub brought in groups of journalists from well-known and respected news organizations such as The Wall Street Journal, Forbes and others, to explore the city and talk to local residents and entrepreneurs about the direction it was heading.\n\nLow and behold, journalists from outside the city told a much more positive story than local media, just by getting a different perspective.\n\n\"People come and experience [the city] and say 'this is not what I thought Detroit was,'\" Kozak says. She notes the importance of really opening up the doors as a strategy to enhance perception.\n\n\"Now, you still need to convince people, show them good and bad, and don't sweep areas under the rug that need work,\" she says. \"We have a lot of opportunity with infrastructure, public transit, education...it paints a whole picture.\"\n\nChris Moyer, Senior Director of Communications at Visit Detroit, says this is the best job he's ever had. After all, he gets to \"share an incredible secret with people.\"\n\n\"Travel is a connector for people in a world that can seem...pulled apart by politics or culture,\" Moyer says.\n\nHe believes in letting Detroiters tell the story of their city.\n\n\"Don't listen to me, I'm a comms guy!\" he laughs. \"Talk to the immigrant restauranteur, a Black Detroiter paining murals, an entrepreneur that created a business...we are sharing their stories as much as possible.\"\n\nAnd Moyer notes that while it's great to share stories about the new and shiny and inspiring happenings going on in a place, it's also important to not sugar coat problems -- which is one of the ways the organization has been most successful.\n\n\"There is nothing wrong with admitting your faults,\" he says. \"Start at a place of humility. A product/idea/place -- nothing is perfect. When we are wrapped up in a protection of reputation we fail to acknowledge that even if we are at our best, we shouldn't be satisfied -- we can always get better.\n\nOne major perception Detroit needed to crack is safety. Visit Detroit counters this by delivering facts and information to flip that perception.\n\n\"When someone says Detroit is not safe, we hit back,\" he says. \"The facts are on our side. It's safe because our police work with the community. There are great stories about the police athletic league running programs and serving and [getting to know] the community -- so kids feel comfortable running towards a cop rather than away. It's always about using real people and [providing] real stories.\"\n\nMoyer also says it's important to give the audience more credit.\n\n\"We can tell a complex story,\" he says. \"We don't need to dumb it down and distract someone with a shiny object. If you try to sell bs, they can see through it.\"\n\nUSA Today recently named, Campus Martius Park, a city center of Detroit, the number one public square in America. It's a downtown core, developed by the Downtown Detroit Partnership, that creates a vibrancy and connectivity for the community. It brings people to and keeps them downtown.\n\nDavid Cowan, Chief Pubic Spaces Officer at Downtown Detroit Partnership (DDP), oversees the Detroit 300 Conservancy -- a program managing, beautifying and servicing 18 public spaces around the city for the public to enjoy. DDP manages the big events in town including an upcoming Final Four and the NFL Draft, and Taylor Swift, Beyonce and other concerts spread out over four stadiums. It also serves as a catalyst for social investment to attract employers, and provide amenities to downtown residents.\n\n\"Because we have this great stretch of downtown space...[you can] especially see it on TV...the skyline, the river, the international vantage points,\" he says. \"Some cities put things [like stadiums] outside of downtown on the periphery -- with a parking lot, or in a grassy field...for some cities that's all the space they have. Detroit has lots of space to create these opportunities.\"\n\nThat space will allow the city to host the Chevrolet Detroit Grand Prix on the streets of Downtown Detroit, which will welcome visitors from around the world for the race weekend. Showcasing what you've got is another way to engage others from outside the area.\n\n\"It's so hugely important for role of earned media professionals in partnership with us,\" he says. \"We could be working hard, but if we aren't telling that story, we can't be competitive to attract opportunities like large events and funding needed to sustain and grow.\"\n\nAnd if that still doesn't convince you, all you have to do is search for a Detroit-style pizza parlor in your town.\n\nEveryone from The New York Times to Pizza Hut has their own spin on the comforting pizza style. And yes, it did originate in Detroit. The pans used in the beginning were borrowed from auto manufacturing factories in Detroit.\n\nFranco helped to boost this narrative when client Buddy's Pizza -- an original home of Detroit Style Pizza -- wanted the agency to make them \"cool.\"\n\n\"They said, we have a great product, so unique,\" Kozak says. \"We have a loyal following but feel like there's an opportunity to ride the Detroit love. Basically, they said, 'we need you to make us cool, but we don't know how.'\"\n\nFranco worked with the group, organizing celebrity partnerships (one in the early 2000s with Kid Rock -- another Detroit name -- used his craft beer in its dough) and community partnerships with the Detroit Institute of Art (portion of pizza sales goes back to that organization) and the Detroit Zoo (morning \"pizza feedings\" were on the agenda for the inhabitants). And the brand started to get national recognition in media outlets like GQ magazine and the Food Network.\n\n\"Detroit-style pizza places started popping up everywhere,\" says Kozak. \"And instead of getting bent out of shape, Buddy's embraced it. For its 75th anniversary, Buddy's partnered with pizzerias across the country to donate a portion of sales to combat hunger in their respective communities. It cemented imitation as the best form of flattery.\"", "source": {"uri": "prnewsonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PRNEWS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nicole_schuman@prnewsonline.com", "name":

For Thursday night four of the seven are sold out,\" said said Gordon Orr, the CEO of Tourism Windsor Essex Pelee Island, in a statement.\n\nFor those hotels that aren't yet sold out, occupancy rates are at 90 per cent of higher, he added.\n\nChris MacLeod, chair of the Downtown Windsor BIA, says it's a chance for Windsor to be part of the big events going on in Detroit.\n\n\"This is really a celebration of what's going on in Detroit,\" he said. \"So both the economic impact ... on our restaurants and or bars on our hotels and then, it's another opportunity for us to bring local residents downtown and have them have a great experience.\"\n\nWindsor restaurants and bars are poised to take advantage of the extra traffic: At the Bull and Barrel, they expect to be about as busy as they were for the Super Bowl.\n\n\"We are looking forward to this weekend, hoping for definitely an increase in traffic,\" said owner Andrew Corbett.\n\n\"I think tomorrow (Thursday) night will probably be the big one with the the first round of the draft in Detroit.

Orange cones and barrels are sprinkled across Campus Martius, the nexus of roads and businesses in the heart of downtown, as massive steel trusses are erected in that park and in Hart Plaza, a quarter mile down Woodward on the Detroit River.\n\nSpringtime construction in Detroit isn't a new thing, especially in recent years as the city's revitalization kicks into higher gear. This year, though, the clamor of activity has a singular focus. As Detroit prepares to host the NFL Draft on April 25-27, the city is receiving national attention on a level it doesn't normally see. But with an expected 300,000 visitors and some draft activities still in planning stages, many are wondering if Detroit is ready to handle this onslaught of attention.\n\nThe answer is unequivocally yes, says Visit Detroit CEO Claude Molinari. \"We've spent the better part of 700 days preparing for this,\" he says. With the influx of visitors in recent years -- 17 million in 2023 to the 10-county southeast Michigan area, according to the Michigan Economic Development Corporation -- \"the story of Detroit is improving by the second,\" he says.\n\nThat improvement story is especially evident downtown on Woodward, where the official draft selection party will take place.

(WFRV) - Many local officials are in Detroit this week to get a firsthand look at the ins and outs of hosting an NFL draft.\n\nGreen Bay will host the NFL draft next April. Local officials told Local 5 News that about 250,000 people will descend on Northeast Wisconsin for the event. They expect that the draft will pump $20 million into the Green Bay economy and over $90 million into Wisconsin's economy as a whole.\n\nIn addition to being a great boom for the local economy, local leaders expect that it's going to be one heck of a party.\n\n\"It's going to be something that everybody in town is going to want to come and check out,\" said Nicholas Coehoorn who is the assistant operations manager at Stadium View in Ashwaubenon.\n\nHe said preparations for the NFL draft have already begun at Stadium View.\n\n\"The owners are out in Detroit (this week at the NFL draft) getting ideas for the draft for next year,\" he told Local Five News.\n\nHe said the details aren't fully ironed out yet, but they expect to have food specials, DJ's, and lots of live music to make sure the draft is a party that nobody who visits forgets. He said he expects a Packers game-like atmosphere for the entirety of the NFL draft.\n\nThe owners of Stadium View aren't the only locals in Detroit checking out things this week.\n\nLocal 5 News has learned that officials with Discover Green Bay, Green Bay mayor Eric Genrich, and local law enforcement officials have all also made the trip.\n\n\"Them (Detroit officials) sharing things that have worked and haven't worked, it's extremely helpful to our planning,\" said Nick Meisner with Discover Green Bay when asked about the purpose of the Detroit trip.\n\nMeisner said their itinerary this week includes a bunch of conversations with leaders in Detroit as well as question and answer sessions with people who work for the NFL. Discover Green Bay officials were also in Kansas City last year for the same reason.\n\nMeisner said they're doing all they can to maximize the opportunity they have next spring, even if that preparation calls for a work trip to another state.\n\n\"Being able to say we can host the NFL draft shows we can host an event of any size,\" he said. \"It's really a good sales tool for us.\"\n\nHe said that even though Detroit and Green Bay are different cities, there's things they can learn in the Motor City that they can tweak and apply to Titletown.\n\n\"All in all, it's about three things, making them feel welcomed, making sure they have a good time, and making sure they want to come back,\" he said. \"Those principles weave through no matter the size of your destination.\"\n\nFrom local businesses like Stadium View to Discover Green Bay and local law enforcement officials, everybody else is also working on their piece of the plan that will lead to a successful NFL draft in Green Bay.\n\n\"A lot of it is transportation, Lambeau Field is on our southern border (of the city),\" said David Buck the city planner when asked what his department is doing ahead of the NFL draft. \"How do you get people to the draft and to the other amenities of the city?\"\n\nThe Packers have said they will use the Lambeau Field campus, Titletown, and the area around the Resch Center to different parts of the NFL draft experience.\n\nThe team and the NFL said they have blocked off the required number of hotel rooms for the event.

The entire draft footprint spans several blocks and two million square feet.\n\nIn Campus Martius, the draft theatre has been being built over the past month. That's the area where NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell will announce the picks.\n\nIt is free for people to come and watch as the picks are announced. However, the NFL usually caps how many people are let in. An official capacity number hasn't been announced for this year, but last year in Kansas City about 60,000 fans were let in to the theatre area.\n\nWe still don't know where the theatre will be located when the draft is held in Green Bay next year. In Detroit, the NFL and city officials didn't come up with a location until about six months ago.\n\n\"We've gone to drafts in the past where the location has been pretty far from the downtown, where it's really easy to setup because it's just like, in a park or in a fairly remote location,\" said City of Detroit Infrastructure Chief Sam Krassenstein.\n\nWe wanted to have something that was right in the heart of the downtown, that offered opportunity for the people coming down here to see the city, and make the whole event that could be really accessible for the residents. And then for the bars, restaurants and businesses -- something that they could benefit from.\n\nGetting the area ready has meant road closures that started over a month ago, which might make people in Green Bay nervous for when the big event rolls around next year.\n\nAbout 300,000 people are expected to visit Detroit for the draft, and of course, that same crowd is expected when Green Bay hosts it next year.\n\nEveryone will want their own keepsake to remember what will be the largest event Green Bay has ever hosted. In Detroit, a pop up NFL shop was constructed right across the street from the park area where the draft theatre has been built.\n\nIt took five people three days to get the shop up and running. It is heavy on the Lions gear, naturally, but you can find merchandise for every NFL team. From magnets to lanyards and the big ticket items, like jackets, there is a little bit of everything.\n\nThe manager of the pop up shop tells FOX 11 the wheels are already rolling for what will be setup in Titletown next year.\n\n\"We are going to try to do a pop up. We're in the plannings right now. We actually leave for a meeting right after this, straight to Green Bay, just to plan this out for you guys,\" said Edson Apaez, manager for NFL Events.\n\nThe pop up shop isn't massive by any means, just a small fraction of the size of the Packers Pro Shop at Lambeau Field. For the first time, it opened a few days before the draft begins, bringing people down here even earlier.", "source": {"uri": "fox11online.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WLUK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_krumholz@fox11online.com", "name": "Ben Krumholz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Green Bay, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campus_Martius", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Campus Martius"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KTTV", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KTTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Goodell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roger Goodell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Downtown Dallas"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambeau_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lambeau Field"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://fox11online.com/resources/media/1be42bbc-19b4-493b-971d-b67ac28b6446-large16x9_AP24113818344544.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9506658", "eventUri": "eng-9506658", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

We spent a lot of time thinking about that.\"\n\nJessica Parker is deputy COO with the mayor's office in Detroit. She says it's been a mission for the city to make sure the draft is an enjoyable experience for everyone -- and she's urging Green Bay leaders to do the same in 2025.\n\n\"Don't make it just about football fans,\" Parker advised. \"Make it about the family.

Now we know things have changed", "body": "On behalf of the city of Detroit, I would like to welcome our new best friends here for the NFL draft. All 400,000 of you. Spread out. There's plenty of room. Some of you might be watching Roger Goodell from the river, but hey, a seat's a seat.\n\nNow, first off, since a great many of you are football junkies, let's address the elephants in the room: Russ Thomas, Chuck Schmidt, Matt Millen, Martin Mayhew, Bob Quinn ...\n\nEnough. We're getting PTSD.\n\nIt's true. Detroit does not have a glorious history with the draft. We are to the draft what Will Smith is to the Oscars; we're surprised someone hasn't slapped us in the face! When your first-round picks include Reggie Rogers, Charles Rogers, David Lewis and Andre Ware, you should be running AWAY from the event, not hosting it.\n\nAh, but those days are gone. In the blink of an eye, Detroit has become a pro football mecca. The Detroit Lions were a breath away from making the Super Bowl in January, remember? Our current GM, Brad Holmes, is on such a winning streak, Warren Buffet calls him for stock tips. And for the first time in forever, Detroit is scheduled to make its first-round pick after most fans have gone to sleep.\n\nBIG DAY FOR LIONS BEFORE DRAFT: Lions sign Penei Sewell, Amon-Ra St. Brown to deals worth more than $230 million\n\nWhich gives us plenty of time to play host to our guests. All 400,000 of you. Just file in calmly. Plenty of room. Yes, Corktown is a great place to see the draft. On a TV set. But a great place.\n\nThis isn't the city you've heard about before\n\nNow, many of you are here for the first time. And that's fine. We know historically, Detroit has not been atop too many \"Places To See Before I Die\" lists.\n\nBut that's changing. This isn't your granddaddy's Detroit. We're no longer the gum on the bottom of America's shoe. Our city has undergone a huge renaissance. We have a thriving downtown, an active riverfront, a mayor in his third term who is overwhelmingly liked, and a new reputation for avoiding maladies that are sinking many other metropolises, like overwhelming homelessness or riotous behavior.\n\nThe truth is, while once defined as the \"Rust Belt,\" parts of Detroit now gleam. We're almost shiny. Sometimes, we have to stop and stare at ourselves in the mirror, like Maria in \"West Side Story,\" and sing out, \"Who can that attractive place be?\"\n\nOK. That may be pushing it. But the point is, we are proud of Detroit. We like living here. We even like its quirks. So in an effort to make this the most pleasant experience for our visitors this week -- all 400,000 of you -- let me answer a few questions before you ask them:\n\nYes, there's a tunnel to get there. Right under that water you're staring at.\n\nYes, that really is a sculpture of a fist. Joe Louis' fist. We think it's cool.\n\nYes, we have a lot of places called Coney Island. And no, they are not small amusement parks. They sell hot dogs. Try one.\n\nYes, that blue and white building really is where all the Motown records were made. And no, you won't be bumping into Diana Ross, Stevie Wonder or Smokey Robinson this weekend. Unless you're in L.A.\n\nYes, it really is called Campus Martius. We don't know why.\n\nYes, that huge structure is the Renaissance Center. And no, please don't go in there. By the time you find your way out, you'll have missed the whole draft.\n\nYes, Dan Campbell does chew nails. (Well, that's what I heard.)\n\nNo, we're not mad at Matthew Stafford.\n\nYes, the best dessert on Woodward Avenue is Detroit Water Ice, where they have countless flavors of Italian ices and soft serve ice cream. (OK. I'm biased. But all the profits go to charity.)\n\nSo, once again, welcome. We're happy you're here. And we truly hope you have a great time in our beloved city. But remember that a lot of longtime Lions fans will be mixing with you for the next few days. So in the interest of being polite guests, please refrain from using the words \"Eric Ebron.\"\n\nWe're better at this draft stuff, but we're still sensitive.", "source": {"uri": "freep.com",

And the mention that more than three times that number of people are expected to converge on downtown Detroit when the NFL draft festivities begin Thursday brings a smile to Bradley's face that can even be felt over the phone.\n\n\"Not in my wildest imagination when I played for the Lions (from 1978 to 1981) did I think anything like this would ever happen in Detroit,\" said Bradley, a native of Florence, South Carolina, who became a Detroit resident early in his Lions career. \"This was a place where players didn't want to come, but the city has completely changed.\n\n\"Detroit is now the place to be!\"\n\nMore: Fans can participate in multiple activities at the NFL Draft Experience in downtown Detroit\n\nEarlier this year, Bradley says he was taken by surprise when a friend from Muncie, Indiana -- the place where Bradley starred at Muncie Northside High -- called to say that he was coming to Detroit for the draft.\n\nSince that time, Bradley has wrapped his mind around the magnitude of the draft as an extravaganza that transcends football, but even when droves of people spread out across downtown and spaces beyond for the festivities, Bradley will often be focused on just one person. It's the same person who has made the two-time college football national champion an even bigger local celebrity when he attends church services at New Prospect Missionary Baptist Church in northwest Detroit.\n\nAnd that person is Bradley's beloved nephew, who also is known to the football world as Brad Holmes, executive vice president and general manager of the Detroit Lions.\n\n\"The people that come up to me in church -- these are not really big football fans, but they congratulate me for what Brad and the team have done,\" Bradley, a trustee at New Prospect, explained. \"You can see and feel their excitement.\"\n\nBradley says he also plans to be in an exciting spot on Thursday evening during Day One of the NFL draft when he attends a draft party with his wife, Sylvia (Sli) Shelby Bradley, at Ford Field. While that party is going on, roughly a half-mile away at the NFL draft theater near Campus Martius park, top draft prospects will be waiting to hear their names called by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. Bradley, who played four seasons in the Lions' defensive backfield, says the prospects will have an experience that is much different than his draft night in 1978.\n\n\"Times have changed; I was the 11th pick overall and I just received a phone call from the team,\" Bradley recounted of the 1978 draft, which was conducted May 2-3 at the Roosevelt Hotel in New York. \"It was the same for my Notre Dame teammates that were taken ahead of me in that draft, (defensive end) Ross Browner (eighth overall) and (tight end) Ken MacAfee (seventh overall), they just received a phone call. The top prospects now have an opportunity to be flown out to the draft and hear their names called and be celebrated during a ceremony that will be seen by the world.\"\n\nBut as much as things have changed about the NFL draft through the years, Bradley said there is one thing that will never change.\n\n\"For all the top prospects that will be sitting there in the theater, you still don't really know where you will go until your name is called and that makes you feel a little uneasy,\" said Bradley, who in the 1978 draft was drafted right after Gordon King, an offensive tackle out of Stanford, selected by the New York Giants; and just before Clay Matthews, a linebacker from the University of Southern California, taken by Cleveland. \"There will be players in this draft that won't go as high as they thought they would, but you have to be patient and understand that the draft is need-based and every team has different needs.\"\n\nBradley may have had some butterflies floating in his stomach during his own draft day, but he says that will not be the case when the Lions make their 2024 draft selections -- beginning with the 29th pick in the first round -- because he knows a little something about a man who will be heavily involved in the decision-making process.\n\n\"I used to be nervous when Brad first started in this position, but not anymore because he has proven himself time and time again through the selections he has made,\" said Bradley, who pointed to the extensive time that Holmes as a young man spent with his grandfather, Luther Bradley Sr. -- the first Black coach for Muncie Community Schools -- as key to Holmes' early training to be a professional football executive. \"Brad is just a guy who really works at his craft, and he tries to perfect it. I believe he's the best drafting general manager in the league -- I really believe that. And he's not done, he's always working to get better, and better, and better.\"\n\nLuther Bradley then provided a message for Lions fans and the city of Detroit as a whole with the draft party festivities about to begin.\n\n\"There is going to be more excitement and more big wins to come from our football team because together, Brad (Holmes) and Dan Campbell are a great team,\" he said. \"But let's embrace this moment and these three days of hosting the draft as much as we can, because this is a big win for our fans and the entire city.\"\n\nScott Talley is a native Detroiter, a proud product of Detroit Public Schools and a lifelong lover of Detroit culture in its diverse forms.

And he's ready for big crowds.\n\n\"I believe the excitement adrenaline will be pumping, and folks are gonna be coming in and out of the doors all day, all night,\" Mitchell said.\n\nWith 300,000 to 400,000 people expected in Detroit this week for the NFL Draft, downtown restaurants and bars are gearing up to serve some of the biggest crowds they've seen, extending their hours, adjusting shifts for employees, adding staff, even rolling in big screens so diners can eat and watch the draft at the same time.\n\nFrom Campus Martius to Greektown, many restaurateurs said they're a little nervous, but ready. Many said they're eager to introduce the city and its restaurants to new customers.\n\n\"We're ready,\" said Scott Sadoff, executive vice president of food and beverage for Method Co. at the Book Tower, 1265 Washington Blvd.\n\nThe refurbished Louis Kamper-designed hotel, owned by Bedrock, will erect a 28-foot by 19-foot LED entertainment wall in its lobby Thursday, and the Book Tower's restaurants and bars will have expanded hours this week.\n\nThe screen will not only accommodate the guests of the sold-out hotel, Roost, but also downtown visitors who may want to sit down for a French dinner at hot spot Le Supre\u0302me, grab a quick cappuccino at the lobby Bar Rotunda or a cocktail at rooftop bar Kamper's, which will have its own projection screen for draft viewing.\n\n\"Whenever an event like this comes around -- and I've been fortunate to be part of a few events like this in other cities -- you have this weird, uneasy feeling. But the general feeling that my team has here at the Book Tower is simply just pure excitement,\" Sadoff said. \"We all know what we're doing, and we feel ready and confident and comfortable to be bring an additional million people into the city and to be able to provide an extraordinary guest experience for them.\"\n\nThe draft will bring an infusion of dollars to Detroit's restaurants and bars, most of which didn't exist the last time the city hosted crowds this big: the 2006 Super Bowl. Some are worried about the city's ability to handle so many.\n\n\"We've never had anything like this since the Super Bowl back in the day,\" said Kujcim Kolami, the owner of Que Deli on West Fort Street downtown.\n\nBut others said the crowds and overflowing dining rooms are good problems have to have.\n\nMootz Pizzeria and Bar on Library Street downtown debuted an expanded dining room and a new bar, Side Hustle Lounge, this week. Announced in January, the 2,100-square foot space is an extension of Mootz's dining room, which is often packed. Side Hustle Lounge, a new bar from the brand that has its own shareable plates menu and a 24-seat sidewalk patio, is open to the public now aside from a private party on Thursday.\n\n\"The draft is huge for us,\" said Mootz director of operations Walter Gregorio. \"It's going to be, one, a lot of new people that have never been here, so it's a great chance for us to showcase. Two, it gave us the incentive to get (Side Hustle) done on time.\"\n\nMootz and Side Hustle will be staying open late, too, until 1 a.m. Thursday through Saturday.\n\n\"The biggest trouble we have is trying to fit all the people in. ... It's a good problem to have,\" Gregorio said. \"Bar sales keep going up and up. Detroit supports us.\"\n\nDraft's economic impact\n\nDuring his 11th State of the City address last week, Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan said not only will the city welcome an influx of an estimated 300,000 visitors during the draft, but the city also will be showcased to more than 50 million viewers on television.\n\n\"This is our moment to reintroduce Detroit to America,\" he said.\n\nThe net economic impact of the draft in downtown Detroit is expected to exceed $160 million, according to a new analysis from the East Lansing-based economic consulting firm Anderson Economic Group LLC. AEG estimated that the draft will have a direct economic impact of $97.5 million on Detroit, with an estimated $35.1 million in total spending by attendees, after accounting for expenditures that leave the area.\n\nThat total includes both spending both inside and outside of the event in Detroit, including hotel stays, spending at restaurants and bars, and merchandise purchases.\n\n\"When we approach economic impact analysis, we carefully consider each dollar that is going to be invested or spent due to the event. We also carefully consider the power of that dollar in the region and industry of study as it is respent,\" said Tyler Theile, vice president and director of economic analysis and public policy at AEG. \"Hosting the NFL draft is an exciting win for Detroit and presents invaluable opportunities for the city to showcase its culture on a national stage, fostering long-term tourism and investment prospects.\"\n\nWhat restaurants are doing\n\nJoe Vicari Restaurant Group's Statler French American Bistro in Grand Circus Park just across the street from Comerica Park will host a barbecue patio party during the day on Friday and Saturday, weather permitting. It comes as the Tigers will be playing a series against the Kansas City Royals Friday through Sunday at Comerica Park in addition to the draft.\n\nThere will be a special menu of burgers, hot dogs, pretzels and an adult lemonade stand. Customers can watch the Tigers game on the patio's televisions on Friday and the draft picks on Saturday.\n\nVicari's other two downtown Detroit restaurants also are preparing for football fans. Joe Muer Seafood and Andiamo Riverfront at the Renaissance Center are open for lunch and dinner on the days leading up to the draft, and will offer patrons a complimentary shuttle to the Campus Martius area from the RenCen.\n\nIn Campus Martius, the hub of the action for the draft, bars and restaurants in its direct footprint might see the most visitors, and several are extending hours.\n\nNearby, Zuzu, normally open only for Asian-inspired dinner cuisine and nightlife, will open at 11 a.m. Thursday for a draft party with DJ Chantel Jeffries. It also plans to have an all-day party on its open rooftop patio with outdoor and tent seating.\n\nJust feet away, Townhouse at 500 Woodward will be opening much earlier than usual, 10:30 a.m. on Thursday and Friday. Its sister restaurant Prime + Proper, 1145 Griswold, also has extended hours, opening at 11 a.m. with a limited menu before dinner service starts at 4 p.m. Wednesday through Friday.\n\nZaid Elia, a local developer who owns multiple restaurants, including the Campus Martius' Starbucks, Anchor Bar, Parc and Zuzu, said \"it's not business as usual by any means.\"\n\nThe NFL has taken over Zaid's Parc, which will not be open to the public but only serving guests for the NFL and draft sponsors Verizon and Bud Light, he said.\n\nZaid said one of the key hurdles his restaurants have faced is mapping out logistics for the multiple parties involved in the draft. But he's leaning on the restaurant's past experience handling large-scale events.\n\n\"The secret to our success lies in our dedicated and enthusiastic team,\" Zaid said.\n\nConcerns raised about draft crowd\n\nAt least one restaurant owner, Kolami, the owner of the Que Deli, is concerned the crowds from the draft may be too much. Still, he said he's ready with a streamlined menu and extra staff.\n\n\"I'm going to be here 24-7. ... I'm getting prepared,\" said Kolami, whose deli serves breakfast and lunch from the ground floor of the Fort Washington Plaza and via many third-party delivery apps. The restaurant is known for its labor-intensive corned beef, homestyle chicken noodle soup, and grilled sandwiches and wraps.\n\nWhile Kolami is ready to go, he's worried that closed streets will make it hard for third-party apps to deliver food and for restaurants to get the kind of deliveries they need so they don't run out of supplies.\n\n\"They're going to run out of food with that kind of crowd, it's expected,\" he said. \"...I don't think we have enough restaurants for this kind of crowd, and spatially around Campus Martius over there. Even today, when we have a convention at (Huntington Place), there's no delivery going through over there. They can't get to them because they block all the streets.\"\n\nKolami said he's getting friends and family to help him and his regular staff, and they're going to pare the menu down to one page so they can feed as many people as possible as fast as possible.\n\n\"I'll probably come here Thursday morning and not leave from downtown until Sunday ... just take naps from time to time,\" he said.\n\nMuseums, Belle Isle ready\n\nBeyond the city's restaurants, its cultural institutions also said they're ready for crowds and hoping for spillover from the draft frenzy.\n\nAt Detroit's Historical Museum, family activities are planned during museum hours 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sherrie Savage, NFL's arts and Detroit-based proprietor of The Coloring Museum, has created some NFL Draft-themed coloring pages, the museum is hosting coloring tables with finished artwork on display at the museum.\n\n\"In addition, we've refreshed our unique assortment of vintage Detroit Lions merchandise in the Museum Store, and for those who want a parking hack -- note that our parking lot is available for only $9 a day, and we're just half a block away from the nearest QLine stop,\" said Historical Museum spokeswoman Sarah Murphy.\n\nAt Belle Isle, the nation's second most visited state park behind Niagara Falls, officials are gearing up for crowds who are expected to travel to see Detroit's connecting river to Canada.\n\n\"We were lucky in that the draft dates correspond with us bringing back much of our seasonal staff. We plan to be ready for crowds, but expect mostly 'drive-throughs' which are quite common,\" said Thomas Bissett, park supervisor for the Michigan Department of Natural Resources.\n\nBissett said its park clean up event is Saturday and \"generally gets a terrific turnout\" of volunteers.\n\n\"Beyond that, staff have the restrooms open and ready as of last week, and our summer staff have begun prepping our summer trash can placements and readying the picnic spaces,\" he said.\n\nAs for Mitchell, the chef and restaurant owner in Greektown, he's looking forward to the influx of bodies to his restaurant. He said recent street closures and other factors have made it \"a rough late winter and early spring.\"\n\n\"We have been placed on life support,\" Mitchell said. \"We're truly hopeful this draft weekend will be very busy and very profitable for us. No reservations, needed, just walk in greeting us with 'what up doe' and welcome to the rebirth of Detroit.\"", "source": {"uri": "detroitnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Detroit News"},

Fans were expected to come from all over the country, but especially the Midwest.\n\nBetween 300,000 and 400,000 people are expected to visit Detroit for the draft, which officially starts Thursday evening. The Draft Theater requires a ticket but there are several free activities for fans, including the NFL Draft Experience at Hart Plaza and Campus Martius. Fans can pose with the Vince Lombari trophy, see Super Bowl rings and a collection of Lions jerseys from the past.\n\nHours ahead of the action, a steady stream of travelers in NFL jerseys poured into the Detroit Metro Airport on Thursday morning.\n\nAllie Goodman, of Naples, Florida, said she'd been looking forward to the draft ever since making travel arrangements in January after the Pro Bowl.\n\n\"We want to see all around Detroit,\" said Goodman, 33. \"We're just looking forward to seeing our super fan friends, and obviously we want to welcome our draft picks.\"\n\nBearing a construction hard hat modified with Miami Dolphins regalia in full aqua, blue, orange and white, Goodman said she was excited to explore Detroit for the first time and hopefully see Eminem perform.\n\nThe couple considered themselves hardcore Dolphins fans, having already traveled to see the 2022 NFL Draft in Las Vegas, NFL games in London and even a Super Bowl game, said Jared Goodman, 34.\n\nA love for both Detroit and Washington Commanders brought Marcus Ellis into the city on Thursday morning from D.C., the 47-year-old fan told The News.\n\nEllis had visited Detroit several times before, but was looking forward to seeing the downtown transformation that had been lighting up his social media, he said.\n\nSeeing the draft in person had always been a bucket list experience Ellis hoped to accomplish, he added.\n\nNow was the perfect time to see that vision through, he said.\n\n\"I'm hoping to see my team get the best pick possible,\" Ellis said. \"That is the primary reason why I'm here, to bring us some D.C. luck. I'm going to enjoy food, the sights, the music, the people -- everything that Detroit brings.\"\n\nSeeing the draft in person was also a longtime bucket list item for 9-year-old Jared Soriano, the Minnesota Vikings fan said.\n\nSoriano, of Farmington, Minnesota, has been watching NFL football games since he was a baby and can now recite near-encyclopedic knowledge of the sport, his 22-year-old sister, Emma Melendez, said.\n\nThe siblings were traveling alone together but planned to make a ton of memories out of their time together, said Melendez, of Rosemount, Minnesota.\n\nSoriano said he felt thrilled to visit Detroit for the first time and see his favorite team up close.\n\n\"I've kind of been bragging about it,\" he said, adding that he also plays wide receiver on his own football team.\n\nHe only hoped the team didn't make \"a dumb decision\" by picking University of Michigan quarterback J.J. McCarthy, Soriano said.\n\nOther young fans were also making their way through the arrivals section in the airport, including 10-year-old Liam Powell in stride with his cousins, aunt and mother.\n\nPowell, of Rosemount, Minnesota, had been looking forward to making the trip with his dad for a long time said, his mother, Jolina Pettice.\n\nPettice, her sister and nephews happy to step in when Powell's father sustained a last-minute injury that prevented him from traveling, said Pettice, 41.\n\nOriginally from Illinois, Pettice said she was excited to see the Chicago Bears get the first draft pick.\n\nPowell was especially excited for the opportunity to see pro players up close, he said.", "source": {"uri": "detroitnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Detroit News"},

And Bradley couldn't be happier, especially since his nephew is key to the Lions' draft.\n\nIt could be said that Luther Bradley, the Detroit Lions' first-round pick in the 1978 NFL draft, is an authority when it comes to big crowds and big occasions connected to football.\n\nBradley's experience dates to Dec. 31, 1973, when, as an 18-year-old freshman student attending Notre Dame, he played in the Sugar Bowl at a packed Tulane Stadium in New Orleans, where the Fighting Irish defeated Alabama, 24-23, to claim a national championship.\n\nOn that evening, Bradley and his Notre Dame mates performed valiantly in front of 85,161 fans. And the mention that more than three times that number of people are expected to converge on downtown Detroit when the NFL draft festivities begin Thursday brings a smile to Bradley's face that can even be felt over the phone.\n\n\"Not in my wildest imagination when I played for the Lions (from 1978 to 1981) did I think anything like this would ever happen in Detroit,\" said Bradley, a native of Florence, South Carolina, who became a Detroit resident early in his Lions career. \"This was a place where players didn't want to come, but the city has completely changed.\n\n\"Detroit is now the place to be!\"\n\nMore:Fans can participate in multiple activities at the NFL Draft Experience in downtown Detroit\n\nEarlier this year, Bradley says he was taken by surprise when a friend from Muncie, Indiana -- the place where Bradley starred at Muncie Northside High -- called to say that he was coming to Detroit for the draft.\n\nSince that time, Bradley has wrapped his mind around the magnitude of the draft as an extravaganza that transcends football, but even when droves of people spread out across downtown and spaces beyond for the festivities, Bradley will often be focused on just one person. It's the same person who has made the two-time college football national champion an even bigger local celebrity when he attends church services at New Prospect Missionary Baptist Church in northwest Detroit.\n\nAnd that person is Bradley's beloved nephew, who also is known to the football world as Brad Holmes, executive vice president and general manager of the Detroit Lions.\n\n\"The people that come up to me in church -- these are not really big football fans, but they congratulate me for what Brad and the team have done,\" Bradley, a trustee at New Prospect, explained. \"You can see and feel their excitement.\"\n\nBradley says he also plans to be in an exciting spot on Thursday evening during Day One of the NFL draft when he attends a draft party with his wife, Sylvia (Sli) Shelby Bradley, at Ford Field. While that party is going on, roughly a half-mile away at the NFL draft theater near Campus Martius park, top draft prospects will be waiting to hear their names called by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. Bradley, who played four seasons in the Lions' defensive backfield, says the prospects will have an experience that is much different than his draft night in 1978.\n\n\"Times have changed; I was the 11th pick overall and I just received a phone call from the team,\" Bradley recounted of the 1978 draft, which was conducted May 2-3 at the Roosevelt Hotel in New York. \"It was the same for my Notre Dame teammates that were taken ahead of me in that draft, (defensive end) Ross Browner (eighth overall) and (tight end) Ken MacAfee (seventh overall), they just received a phone call. The top prospects now have an opportunity to be flown out to the draft and hear their names called and be celebrated during a ceremony that will be seen by the world.\"\n\nBut as much as things have changed about the NFL draft through the years, Bradley said there is one thing that will never change.\n\n\"For all the top prospects that will be sitting there in the theater, you still don't really know where you will go until your name is called and that makes you feel a little uneasy,\" said Bradley, who in the 1978 draft was drafted right after Gordon King, an offensive tackle out of Stanford, selected by the New York Giants; and just before Clay Matthews, a linebacker from the University of Southern California, taken by Cleveland. \"There will be players in this draft that won't go as high as they thought they would, but you have to be patient and understand that the draft is need-based and every team has different needs.\"\n\nBradley may have had some butterflies floating in his stomach during his own draft day, but he says that will not be the case when the Lions make their 2024 draft selections -- beginning with the 29th pick in the first round -- because he knows a little something about a man who will be heavily involved in the decision-making process.\n\n\"I used to be nervous when Brad first started in this position, but not anymore because he has proven himself time and time again through the selections he has made,\" said Bradley, who pointed to the extensive time that Holmes as a young man spent with his grandfather, Luther Bradley Sr. -- the first Black coach for Muncie Community Schools -- as key to Holmes' early training to be a professional football executive. \"Brad is just a guy who really works at his craft, and he tries to perfect it. I believe he's the best drafting general manager in the league -- I really believe that. And he's not done, he's always working to get better, and better, and better.\"\n\nLuther Bradley then provided a message for Lions fans and the city of Detroit as a whole with the draft party festivities about to begin.\n\n\"There is going to be more excitement and more big wins to come from our football team because together, Brad (Holmes) and Dan Campbell are a great team,\" he said. \"But let's embrace this moment and these three days of hosting the draft as much as we can, because this is a big win for our fans and the entire city.\"", "source": {"uri": "freep.com", "dataType":

It's becoming a lot about the coaches. You're seeing all these reality shows and all the sudden the emphasis isn't on the kid but all on the ancillary things happening around the kid. So, we want to really focus on the kids again and show it's all about them because every single kid started from somewhere.\"\n\nOn the NCAA's new rules, Sanders seemed enthusiastic.\n\n\"I mean the things it's been able to do for so many kids it's amazing for all sports, men's and women's,\" Sanders said. \"I love sitting on Saturday afternoon watching college football.

It was a final, and meticulous, spruce-up before Thursday's NFL Draft brings an expected 100,000-plus fans and hours of national television exposure.\n\nIn some cities, hosting the NFL Draft is just hosting the NFL Draft -- a fun, unique three-day event that has toured the country since leaving New York in 2015.\n\nFor Detroit, it was seen by both public and private interests as something more: a rare opportunity to showcase the city.\n\nOr more specifically, how far the city, particularly downtown, has come in the decade since it became the largest U.S. municipality to declare bankruptcy, let alone since 2006, when it hosted the Super Bowl.\n\n\"A lot of people haven't been here in years,\" Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan told Yahoo Sports. \"I think they will see the riverfront, see the construction, see what is happening in the city and come away with a different impression.\"\n\nFor decades Detroit has been known as beaten up and beaten down. It was a reputation well-earned -- population loss, blight, urban ruins, high crime and so on. The challenges remain vast -- \"We've got a long way to go, no question,\" Duggan said.\n\nYet progress can't be denied. Visitors and viewers alike will be greeted with streets of bars and restaurants, cranes above completing new skyscrapers and high-end condo developments filling formerly empty parcels and once-broken buildings.\n\nNo, this isn't San Francisco or Miami or Los Angeles. But Duggan isn't afraid to note that there are advantages here too.\n\n\"Everyone who visited last year said, 'Where is the graffiti? Where are the homeless encampments?'\" Duggan said. \"We don't have graffiti and homeless encampments. I think it shocked them.\"\n\nWell, at least not downtown they don't, which is the focus this weekend.\n\nOther host cities have found more expansive parks or areas to host the draft and gather fans. Last year Kansas City, for example, used the area next to Union Station, about two miles south of downtown.\n\nDetroit purposefully tucked the draft into its central business district, using public streets, plazas and parking lots for not the stage, but viewing areas, food trucks, concerts, family entertainment and the NFL Draft Experience.\n\nWith huge crowds of both locals and out-of-town visitors expected -- Detroit's 6,000 hotel rooms sold out for the weekend, according to the tourism board -- the goal was to immerse the draft within the downtown. It should both boost local businesses and maximize the promotional impact of hours of live national broadcasts.\n\n\"I think some people who visit will end up moving here even if they never thought Detroit would be in their plans,\" Duggan said. \"Entrepreneurs will realize this is a cost-effective place to start a company. And corporate leaders who are looking to open an office will see this as a place to invest.\"\n\nDetroit still has plenty of problems, including poverty, education and dysfunction. However, for the first time in a generation or two, positive momentum isn't one of them.\n\nThe aforementioned riverfront has been cleaned up, becoming an award-winning jogging, biking and recreational attraction.\n\nIt will be bolstered by the opening next year of the 22-acre Ralph C. Wilson Centennial Park, which will transform a former industrial area. It is funded by the foundation of Wilson, the late Detroit native and billionaire team owner of the Buffalo Bills.\n\nAcross downtown, midtown and surrounding neighborhoods, housing, hotels, theaters, retail stores and restaurants are filling former shuttered fronts and forgotten buildings. Those range from historic skyscrapers to reclaimed wastelands.\n\nMeanwhile, the University of Michigan has broken ground on a graduate school in a once-forlorn spot that is now steps from the three modern stadiums where all four local professional teams play.\n\nAnd in trendy nearby Corktown, Ford is completing a $740 million renovation of a long abandoned 20-story train station that will turn an eyesore into a business incubator and hub for the development of autonomous vehicles. Hotels, condos and coffee shops have already sprung up in anticipation.\n\nOn television, the under-construction 685-foot Hudson Tower will be hard to miss. Developed by Dan Gilbert, the founder of Rocket Mortgage and team owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers, it will be home to the city's first ever five-star hotel as well as luxury condos with prices expected to top $3 million. That's nothing in New York, but almost unfathomable here a decade ago.\n\n\"You certainly can feel the optimism and hope in the city,\" the mayor said. \"Polling showed that 75 percent of residents believe the city is headed in the right direction. There are very few places in America that would show that.\"\n\nBack in 2006, when Detroit hosted Super Bowl XL, civic leaders, notably Roger Penske, spent millions trying to make downtown look alive, if only to avoid regional embarrassment.\n\nThat included clearing debris from empty lots near Ford Field, wrapping abandoned buildings to hide the destruction and even propping up fake storefronts so passersby might think a building was occupied.\n\nIf nothing else, that isn't necessary this time. They are down to scraping stickers off sign posts.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Gretchen Whitmer said she sees a chance to change the perception of Michigan's largest city.\n\n\"I'm really excited about this week here in Detroit. It is just one more chapter in the story that we continue to tell the world about what's happening in Michigan, what's going on here in the city of Detroit,\" Whitmer said during a panel called \"Motor City Momentum: Draft Day Economics\" held on the rooftop of a downtown building Wednesday.\n\n\"People ... operate with old notions and that's why we've got to be the best ambassadors we can be. That's also why we got to host events like this to invite people and to see it with their own eyes,\" Whitmer added.\n\nClaude Molinari who heads Visit Detroit -- the economic development organization that promotes metro Detroit as a destination for business, conventions and tourism -- sees a similar opportunity to shift the view of Detroit for those tuning into the draft on TV as they watch drone footage of the city's skyscrapers. \"I think it's going to change that perception for decades to come,\" he said.\n\nBut what does the draft mean for those living in Detroit?\n\nCity Council Member Fred Durhal III said they can take pride in their city. \"I want folks to walk saying, 'Wow we here in the city of Detroit hosted one of the largest sporting events in the country,\" he said. He also said the draft provides a boost for minority businesses. The NFL draft has left at least one neighborhood business association complaining that they were left out of the planning process to leverage the economic opportunity of the big event.\n\nOver the next few days, those coming from out of town will fill hotel rooms, dine at restaurants and drink at bars. The economic impact of their spending won't be clear until after the teams have made their picks and their fans return home. But Molinari projected it will land between $175 to $200 million in spending. Visit Detroit is planning to work with a sports economist to conduct an analysis following the event.\n\nWhitmer backed his call on state lawmakers to pass a revolving large special event fund to attract similar events moving forward. \"You just can't go to the corporate community and constantly say, 'You guys got to pitch in.' I think it's got to be a state effort,\" Molinari said.\n\nWhitmer has recently clashed with Democratic lawmakers on some economic development policies. Senate Democrats passed a bill to take funding currently slated to subsidize businesses and divert the money instead to a community investment fund. Whitmer reiterated her opposition to the legislation Wednesday. \"We've got different views about how we can get maybe some of the same goals,\" she told reporters.\n\nOne of the key aims the governor and lawmakers from both parties say they share is reversing the state's sluggish population growth.\n\nNLF Draft Detroit: Will Detroit beat Kansas City when it comes to crowds, economic impact of NFL draft?\n\nAnd Whitmer said she sees the upcoming draft as a chance to introduce more people to the state she leads.\n\nIt wouldn't be the first time the governor has used Michigan's sports offerings to lure prospective residents. After the University of Michigan's football team won the national championship earlier this year Whitmer touted it as a victory for the state.\n\n\"That win last night is going to maybe make some people say, 'Well I want to learn a little bit more about Michigan,'\" Whitmer said the day after the game during an interview with FOX 2 Detroit.\n\nWhitmer empaneled a population council last year to recommend ways to grow Michigan's population. Among its ideas, the group proposed investments in public transportation, an overhaul of the state's public education system and paying workers to move to Michigan.", "source": {"uri": "freep.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Detroit Free Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gretchen_Whitmer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gretchen Whitmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Downtown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Durhal_III", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fred Durhal III"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Council", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metro Detroit"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyscraper", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Skyscraper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Wolverines_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michigan Wolverines football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Economics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Economics", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Urban_and_Regional_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Urban and Regional Planning", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/CAD_and_CAM/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Computers/CAD and CAM/Associations", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/04/17/USAT/73363237007-usatsi-22364295.jpg?auto=webp&crop=6047,3403,x0,y310&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9506658", "eventUri": "eng-9506658", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

If I go to Chicago it's bad. If you go in the wrong spot, you're in the wrong spot,\" she said.\n\nAs Duggan mentioned in his State of the City address last Wednesday, Detroit made headlines in years past for murders, shootings, carjackings, abandoned buildings, fires, bankruptcies and more.\n\nHowever, he was proud to tout a significant drop in crime, continued blight enforcement, more neighborhood improvements, park upgrades and historic development.\n\n\"I really hope since we don't start until the evening on Thursday and Friday, they take the day and walk the Riverwalk - which as you know - USA Today has called three years in a row the finest Riverwalk in America. But we're going to encourage people who like music to go to the Motown Museum, people who like Mexican food to go into Southwest Detroit, Greek food into Greektown. We're going to encourage our visitors to get out and explore,\" Duggan said.\n\nIt's something that activist Helen Moore agrees with.\n\n\"What do you hope visitors will take away from their visit to Detroit?\" I asked Moore.\n\n\"Walk around, check Detroit out, and you will find even the people that have the least money, etc. are good people,\" she said.\n\nThe 86-year-old was surprised at the end of the State of the City address to to learn the Dexter-Elmhurst Community Center she helped save will be called the \"Helen Moore Community Center.\" She understands more work is needed.\n\n\"Do you think Detroit is safe?\" I asked her.\n\n\"Oh, God, that's a problem. But I have to compare it to the past and I say we're getting there, but we're not there yet,\" Moore said.\n\n\"What do you see the city doing differently this time around compared to the the Super Bowl planning that you think could really score big with visitors' perceptions of the city?\" I asked City Historican Jamon Jordan.\n\n\"The involvement of community organizations, the involvement of businesses, legacy businesses in the city of Detroit, the involvement of African-American business owners, that is going to make all the difference,\" he said.\n\nJordan said iconic spots like Hot Sam's Clothing and Cafe D'Mongo's Speakeasy will be among the local standouts to impress out-of-towners.\n\nJohn George, the executive director and co-founder of Detroit Blight Busters, showed me where a $21 million redevelopment is underway in Northwest Detroit. he thinks perceptions are changing.\n\n\"People say, 'Hey, where are you from?' And you say, 'Detroit.' What's the typical reaction you get?\" I asked George.\n\n\"Well, it's getting better. Before it was like shock and horror,\" he said. \"I believe Detroit is on the front porch of the greatest urban comeback story in this nation's history. But we have to work together.\"\n\nThe most recent Gallup poll taken in July of last year asked people how safe the consider 16 of the country's biggest cities showed Detroit ranked at the bottom of the 16. Only 26% of respondents considered the city \"safe to live in or visit,\" whether they'd visited here or not.

I hope the game continues as it is and it doesn't alter the game, but just as a college sports fan, it's great to see kids compensated in that way.\"\n\nNFL DRAFT: What fans will find at the downtown NFL Draft Experience\n\nHill spoke about how challenges in public schools across Detroit affect youth sports.\n\n\"We look at how Detroit's population has decreased, I see what impact that has had athletically,\" Hill said. \"Then when you look at the fact that it's pretty much open school enrollment, and because of that it feels like a lot of concentrated talent that you used to come to know in Detroit doesn't happen the same way anymore. So just as an outsider, seeing how public schools have been affected just by being underfunded by losing students, you know, by frankly more powerful kinds of sports factories, teams being able to cherry pick who they want. I just hope cities like Detroit aren't left to hold the bag.\"\n\nAs the city kicks off the NFL draft today, Hill said she hopes that people who visit Detroit will move past misconceptions that have long plagued the city.\n\n\"I think, just in general, there's always stereotypes about what Detroit isn't and so people can now see what it is and that relates to both the community commitment, community involvement as it relates to youth sports and then even just being a showcase for the NFL draft,\" she said. \"It's like an opportunity for the city to help people understand that those old narratives that they have about Detroit don't exist.\"\n\nEric Guzm\u00e1n covers youth sports culture at the Free Press as a corps member for Report for America, an initiative of The GroundTruth Project.

So, it's not only tents, it's inside the local hotels and banquet facilities, restaurants, they'll all be needing to rent equipment.\"\n\nFOX 11 has learned, the NFL has a hold on the majority of hotel rooms in and around the immediate Green Bay and Brown County areas for he draft.\n\nAccording to Aaron Wolf, with Comfort Suites Green Bay, \"We're contracted through the NFL, they'll let us know who we have an we'll embrace them and welcome them in.

Just blocks away sits Ford Field, where the Detroit Lions won two playoff games back in January.\n\nAnd yet, if you really want to know why Detroit -- long marketed as \"Hockeytown\" and historically an incubator for churning out elite basketball talent -- is currently America's football boomtown, you need to head out to the neighborhood fields and high school stadiums across this sprawling city.\n\nIt's there, far from the spotlight and celebrities, where the NFL comes from -- and they are coming in quantities that not just outpace the rest of the country and exceed historical norms but, per local coaches, are likely to increase going forward.\n\n\"It's completely different from even 20 years ago, Detroit is transitioning from a basketball town to a football town,\" said Terel Patrick, head coach at King High School, which has produced a slew of college and NFL stars, including New York Jets All-Pro cornerback Sauce Gardner.\n\n\"I see so much growth right now,\" said Marvin Rushing, the head football coach at Cass Tech, which had five alums play in the NFL last season, including New England OL Michael Onwenu and Lions WR Donovan Peoples-Jones. \"There is more talent and a real hunger for the game at the youth level.\"\n\nIt's already started bubbling up. On opening day of the 2023 NFL season, Detroit, the 27th-most populous city in America, had more players (19) from its high schools on league rosters than anywhere else. The closest comparable was Houston, with 16. It also has a population (2.3 million) that is nearly four times that of Detroit's 640,000.\n\nPart of this is obvious. Football is a tough sport. Detroit is a tough town.\n\n\"It comes down to the pillars of our city, working class, blue-collar, grit,\" Rushing said.\n\n\"You have to grind for what you want,\" Philadelphia Eagles star Brandon Graham, who played at Detroit Crockett and still holds an annual youth football camp here, said this week. \"Nothing was ever given. For me, [Detroit] brought me up and made me who I am today.\"\n\nYet Detroit has always been hardscrabble. And it isn't alone. Everywhere from Miami to Rock Hill, South Carolina is famous for producing incredible amounts of per capita talent. This is believed to be the first time Detroit has ever had the most NFL players.\n\nCoaches say the reason ranges from a rule change in the youth ranks to encourage more participation among bigger players to improved facilities and funding for kids activities that make the sport seem special. That includes turning the old Tiger Stadium into a Detroit Police Athletic League facility where football as well as baseball is played on modern turf.\n\n\"We now have the infrastructure that other cities, especially in the South, have had for years,\" Patrick said.\n\nOthers point to the popularity of football in general has driven down interest in great athletes playing basketball. The latest figures from the Police Athletic League showed 34,944 boys played football, but only 18,803 basketball.\n\nIt's believed just two players, Jamal Cain of the Miami Heat and Isaiah Jackson of the Indiana Pacers, who played at least one season at a Detroit high school, appeared in the NBA this season. It's a sea change for a city that once churned out major talent -- George Gervin, Spencer Haywood, Derrick Coleman, Jalen Rose and so on.\n\nPerhaps not coincidentally, the biggest homegrown star athlete in Detroit isn't a basketball player, but Gardner, the uber-talented and equally charismatic cornerback.\n\nPatrick, the King coach who remembers Gardner as a 140-pound sophomore, attended a youth football clinic Sauce held last year. He was blown away by the reaction from the campers.\n\n\"The way these kids responded to him, it was unreal,\" Patrick said. \"It was probably how I would have responded if, at that age, I met sau\n\n.\"\n\nThat fuels participation. So does, or should, recent success by the Lions and the nearby University of Michigan. Meanwhile, some city games -- notably the annual Cass-King game -- have become anticipated, massive affairs played in front of standing room-only crowds.\n\nOthers point to the tradition of NFL stars returning to hold kids' camps and even college programs working with youth coaches.\n\n\"There's better instruction at the youth level,\" Rushing said. \"Michigan, Michigan State and Eastern Michigan have all come in and done clinics for coaches and that's really helped put kids in a better position.\"\n\nThen there was the decision 10-15 years ago for the youth leagues to drop weight limits for players, which essentially kept bigger kids away from the sport. Now almost everyone is welcome and linemen don't show up as high school freshmen with no experience.\n\n\"The guys in the trenches have been in the trenches,\" Patrick said.\n\nPatrick additionally points to a generation of African American men in Detroit who are determined to improve conditions and spend countless hours mentoring and teaching, including through football.\n\n\"You hear about the absence of Black men in the family, in the community, but if you look at youth sports here it's about Black men giving back,\" Patrick said. \"It's fathers and sons, uncles and nephews. It's older men giving back to younger men.\"\n\nRushing, for example, grew up in Detroit public housing -- \"on the rougher side of town\" -- but fell in love with football. He starred at Cass Tech and earned a scholarship to Eastern Michigan.\n\nInjuries ended any chance of the NFL, but he's a district manager for Comerica Bank, overseeing 170 employees. He doesn't need to coach high school football, but wants to show kids what the sport can do for them.\n\n\"Football lets them express themselves,\" Rushing said. \"Be a leader when you need to be a leader. Be a follower when you need to be a follower. There are so many life skills in it and more and more kids are coming to it.\n\n\"From what I am seeing, it is only getting bigger here.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

Celebrities and football stars are making their way into town, along with hundreds of thousands of visitors, and Detroit business wonders are ready for them.\n\n\"The excitement it's bringing to the city, a great economic impact too,\" said Zeana Attisha, owner of Sahara Restaurant and Grill.\n\nTheir District Detroit location is near all of the draft activities downtown. And they have already hosted some of the parents of draft prospects. Attisha said they are ready for the crowds the rest of the week.\n\n\"The chef has prepared triple the amount of preparation that goes into our freshly made food. And all the prep work that goes into that. Obviously, staffing has been tripled. Everything, from ways to ways to even get to work. They are all going to carpool and get dropped off,\" she said.\n\nMichigan residents said it's about time Detroit got this spotlight, and they love that tourists are getting to see it.\n\n\"The amount of people that are down here is crazy. We went to the casino and all the people that were coming down all dressed up, it's beautiful,\" said Lansing resident Cammi White.\n\nFootball starpower is now in the Motor City. NFL legend and Detroit native Jerome Bettis said he is now proud to root for the Lions.\n\n\"For years and years, when I was a kid, they didn't win. So, I found myself rooting for other teams. But now I am rooting for the Honolulu blue,\" said Bettis.\n\nBettis hosted an event with other hall of famers like Barry Sanders and Calvin Johnson.\n\nHe said his goal now is to focus on young players with the Boys and Girls Club of Southeastern Michigan's 3Cs Sports Conference.\n\n\"From the mental health perspective, from NIL perspective, from the youth perspective. So, we want to just bring this all-encompassing conference to Detroit, where I think it can be very, very useful.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWJ-TV", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WWJ-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Downtown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Bettis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Bettis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpool", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carpool"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barry Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boys_&_Girls_Clubs_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boys & Girls Clubs of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Hispanic_whites", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Non-Hispanic whites"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Calvin Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southeastern Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casino", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Casino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honolulu", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Honolulu"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Honolulu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lansing,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lansing, Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lansing, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/25/2aa6c021-c8c2-48b1-8e82-10f54cbcf0f9/thumbnail/1200x630/6b7d557fdcd8432580116c9936133a86/ap24115662139990.jpg?v=1da0267dcfd5e1d387d4678a648e733c", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9506658", "eventUri": "eng-9506658", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

Typically the accounts belonging to an entire news organization are the least partisan, built on the principles of journalism that encourage neutrality so as not to impinge upon the quality and impartiality of the reporting being done.\n\nThe Free Press has been a little loose with those principals, even dating back to last year's playoff run.\n\nOf course, the tweet's also funny for other reasons, with the 2024 NFL Draft as the backdrop. One, it's not like Detroit has some ridiculously commanding lead over Dallas in NFC Championship Game appearances.\n\nDetroit just made its first appearance since 1991, while Dallas' last appearance came in 1995. But if you back out the search a little more, to an equally arbitrary timeline of, say, since 1992, the entire operation takes on a very different look. Then Dallas would have had four NFC Championship Game appearances to Detroit's one.\n\nFurther, if you want to push a little past simple NFC Championship Game appearances to Super Bowl titles, Dallas then takes a commanding lead. The 'Boys have won five Super Bowls in franchise history, while Detroit has yet to win one.\n\nAll of Detroit's four league championships came before the NFL/AFL merger in 1970.\n\nSo while the Detroit Free Press tweet is certainly funny -- and an unquestionable shot across the bow of Dallas -- it probably doesn't carry quite as much weight as the organization would like.\n\nStill, it's a fun bit of work before tonight's real business gets underway tonight with the 2024 NFL Draft.", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "thomas_goldkamp@on3.com", "name": "Thomas Goldkamp", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFC_Championship_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NFC Championship Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_service_announcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public service announcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Free_Press", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Free Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL\u2013NFL_merger", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AFL\u2013NFL merger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/02/16105533/dallas-cowboys-to-hire-former-commanders-assistant-jeff-zgonina-as-defensive-line-coach.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9506658", "eventUri": "eng-9506658", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

Up the street, at 1001 Woodward, fans can find exclusive merchandise at the NFL Shop presented by Visa.\n\nRight off of Jefferson Avenue, the Draft Experience is a re-creation of the Ford Field experience. The activation includes games such as Lions-themed skeeball and reaction relay to see who has the fastest hands, End Zone Ink for airbrushed tattoos and jerseys on display. The Detroit Lions will have multiple activation spaces within the venue for fans of all ages to participate in Lions-themed games and activities.\n\n\"We expect over 20,000 fans to make their way through throughout the weekend with this experience,\" said Emily Griffin, Lions senior vice president for marketing and brand. \"There's all sorts of different photo opportunities and interactive games, the opportunity to check out our brand new uniforms that we unveiled last week. I think one of the marquee components that we're most excited about is our hero's entrance. Fans that come in will get announced and introduced into the activation just like our players do on Sunday at Ford Field to our frenzied and passionate fan base.\"\n\nVisitors can expect to see a number of Arab-American owned businesses throughout the draft footprint and experience zone, along with a prayer hall on the west side of Hart Plaza, a first for the draft, Griffin said.\n\n\"For the first time ever, they will have these prayer halls and I think that their effort to understand our community and the makeup of this community, and make this draft unique to Detroit and the surrounding area is exceptional. We're very proud of that,\" Griffin said.\n\nDeeper into Hart Plaza, fans will see a gallery of football memorabilia, the Lombardi Trophy, all 57 Super Bowl rings on display, an autograph stage, along with local vendors like Shibam Coffee and Good Cakes and Bakes, who were present for a media tour Wednesday. Several local concession stands will be placed near the UAW-Ford National Programs Center adjacent to Hart Plaza and farther north near the draft theatre.\n\nMore: Bringing your kids to the NFL draft in Detroit? Here are a few places to take them.\n\nNicki Ewell, NFL senior director of events, said fans can participate in a variety of interactive events, including a digital 40-yard dash against Derrick Henry and Saquon Barkley, a vertical jump and Hail Mary experience by the riverfront.\n\n\"We also have our play football field at Corner Ballpark,\" Ewell said. \"We have our flag football field there so flags, skills and drills for kids ages 6 through 14 can be played there, but we also have a watch party there.\"\n\nThe Lions' success this past year, making it to the NFC championship game, amplified the experience for the draft, Griffin said.\n\n\"It's made everything better. We're so proud of the incredible season that we had, our first home playoff win in over 30 years, and we know that access to Ford Field and the Lions gameday experience is going to be increasingly more difficult to access. And that was part of our strategy here. For over three days, we expect hundreds of thousands of people in downtown Detroit and (want) to give them an opportunity to feel what it's like to be at the stadium on game day when they may not be able to necessarily was very important to us,\" Griffin said.\n\nDana Afana is the Detroit city hall reporter for the Free Press.

Up the street, at 1001 Woodward, fans can find exclusive merchandise at the NFL Shop presented by Visa.\n\nRight off of Jefferson Avenue, the Draft Experience is a re-creation of the Ford Field experience. The activation includes games such as Lions-themed skeeball and reaction relay to see who has the fastest hands, End Zone Ink for airbrushed tattoos and jerseys on display. The Detroit Lions will have multiple activation spaces within the venue for fans of all ages to participate in Lions-themed games and activities.\n\nGet a hero's introduction\n\n\"We expect over 20,000 fans to make their way through throughout the weekend with this experience,\" said Emily Griffin, Lions senior vice president for marketing and brand. \"There's all sorts of different photo opportunities and interactive games, the opportunity to check out our brand new uniforms that we unveiled last week. I think one of the marquee components that we're most excited about is our hero's entrance. Fans that come in will get announced and introduced into the activation just like our players do on Sunday at Ford Field to our frenzied and passionate fan base.\"\n\nVisitors can expect to see a number of Arab-American owned businesses throughout the draft footprint and experience zone, along with a prayer hall on the west side of Hart Plaza, a first for the draft, Griffin said.\n\n\"For the first time ever, they will have these prayer halls and I think that their effort to understand our community and the makeup of this community, and make this draft unique to Detroit and the surrounding area is exceptional.

It could draw upwards of 300,000 people to Detroit through Saturday.", "source": {"uri": "woodtv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WOODTV.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "teresa_weakley@woodtv.com", "name": "Teresa Weakley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Flag football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Special Olympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metro Detroit"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southfield,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southfield, Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southfield, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Harrison_Jr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marvin Harrison Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_Buckeyes_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ohio State Buckeyes football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://www.woodtv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/51/2024/04/nfl-prospects-in-detroit-2.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9506658", "eventUri": "eng-9506658", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.6000000000000001, "wgt": 116, "relevance": 1}

(These signs are 5 feet high by 7 feet long.):\n\nThe Downtown Development Authority allocated $5.7 million for five infrastructure projects leading up to the draft, including $500,000 for wayfinding signs to improve navigation for pedestrians and vehicles downtown. The project generally is bounded by the Fisher service drive to the north, Fifth Street to the west, St. Antoine to the east and the Detroit Riverwalk to the south.\n\nA wayfinding sign at Randolph and Monroe streets lists destinations, such as Ford Field, Woodward Avenue, Hart Plaza, Campus Martius Park, the Riverwalk and the entertainment district.\n\nIt provides directional arrows to each location and includes other information, including how many minutes it should take to walk to each destination from that spot.\n\nSeparately, about $130,000 was to be spent on murals at Detroit People Mover stations and for painting electrical transformer boxes around downtown.\n\nAt night, support columns for the Detroit People Mover are expected to be lit up with LED lights.\n\nThe displays are to be permanent on the guideway track, with the lighting projecting single or multiple hues to feature themed colors from hometown sports teams, universities, signature brand colors and more.\n\nThe 2.9-mile elevated transit system is running for free this year and is one way to navigate downtown during the draft.\n\nMultiple privately-owned downtown Detroit parking lots also were to get spruced up, with funding coming from a portion of taxes paid by downtown property owners within the Downtown Development Authority district. About $900,000 was allocated for this project.\n\nLot owners will be responsible for maintenance beyond the one-time fund assistance, which includes bollards, planters, trash receptacles, benches, decorative fencing, murals and landscaping.\n\nThe Downtown Development Authority approved $1.7 million to replace brick pavers on sidewalks along Woodward Avenue from Park Avenue to State Street.\n\nIn front of the new Dunkin' on Woodward, there's also smooth concrete on the sidewalk that extends north for a couple blocks.\n\nOther planned investments included $1.3 million toward light pole upgrades, with funding to address repairs for about 1,000 light poles, including repainting, foundation and base replacements, and place-based lighting -- such as spotlights or colored displays -- in designated downtown areas. Projects already were budgeted, but expedited for the draft.\n\nAnd about $1.3 million was planned for the Washington Boulevard median between Park and West Lafayette for a redesign with new paving, path lighting and landscaping.\n\nContact Christina Hall: chall@freepress.com.

From the annual fireworks to multiple Stanley Cup parades, this city has giant celebrations in its DNA.\n\nBut in decades past, many of those celebratory events came with a glance over the shoulder, a barely concealed worry that something would go wrong. Detroit seemed to fear that visitors would notice the blighted and broken urban landscape just behind the curtain.\n\nEven Super Bowl XL in 2006, deemed a triumph for the city, followed a frantic rush of demolitions and patching up of eyesores lest out-of-towners take home a bad image of the city.\n\nRemember the Donovan Building? The 10-story office tower on Woodward near Ford Field, once home to the business offices of Motown but empty for many years, was razed, along with the adjacent Sanders Building in January 2006 just weeks before the Super Bowl out of fear it might give the wrong impression.\n\nIt wasn't the only building to be demolished ahead of the anticipated Super Bowl crowds. And the dozen or so derelict tall buildings downtown, known collectively as the \"dinosaurs,\" like the then-empty Book Cadillac hotel? It wasn't feasible to demolish them, so the city sheathed those in vast mylar wraps with football images to conceal the blight.\n\nIt was reminiscent of an earlier practice of putting awnings on empty eyesores along the People Mover route so visitors couldn't see into the vacant spaces inside.\n\nWhen Super Bowl XL was in the books, the city let out a collective sigh of relief that nothing had gone wrong.\n\nLetters to the Editor: RenCen isn't an architectural jewel. Tear it down.\n\nAs Detroit puts the finishing touches on its NFL draft extravaganza this week, the tone is different. Gone is the apologetic air, the fear that visitors will discover the blight just around the corner.\n\nInstead, the blocks-long set-up for the draft bespeaks a hard-won confidence, a belief that visitors can see what they wish without fear we'll somehow slip up.\n\nRemember years ago when the media would turn out just for a new Starbucks or pancake house opening? Decades ago, we grasped at those fragile signals of hope. Now the city takes even the vast and expansive NFL Draft in stride.\n\nChallenges remain for Detroit, and some big ones. Rising home values in the city haven't banished housing insecurity for many. Poverty remains too high, unemployment remains well above state and federal levels, and our public transit needs years more work and commitment to become even adequate.\n\nMore from opinion: Rural water systems are vital to the health of the planet.\n\nAll that admitted, think of what's happened in Detroit even since the Super Bowl just 18 years ago.\n\nHow did it happen? There were no silver-bullet solutions to Detroit's problems.

Draft Is Like Super Bowl for City of Detroit", "body": "When the N.F.L. took its college draft on the road a decade ago, its first stops were Chicago, Philadelphia and Dallas, three of the league's biggest markets.\n\nThe concept was an instant hit, turning a show cloistered for a half century in hotels and theaters in Manhattan into a free, three-day football festival that drew hundreds of thousands of fans, many driving long distances to attend.\n\nSoon, more than a dozen cities were raising their hands to host the event. Unlike the N.F.L.'s marquee event, the Super Bowl, the draft does not require extensive public subsidies, hotels and security. It is also held in late April, when weather is less of a concern, even in cities with harsh winters. This allowed the N.F.L. in recent years to award the draft to Cleveland, Kansas City, Mo., and other cities that have never, and may never, host a Super Bowl.\n\nDetroit hosted the Super Bowl in 2006, as a reward to the Lions for moving into a new stadium. But city officials expect that being the site of this year's draft, which begins on Thursday, will provide an economic jolt, though how much of one is unclear. They also hope the three days of exposure on television showcases the city to fans who might not otherwise visit. Detroit, they say, is not the Detroit of a decade ago, when the city was bankrupt, tens of thousands of homes had been abandoned and the automobile industry was pulling out of a long slump. Since then, new hotels, businesses and residents have flooded downtown; unemployment has fallen; and the city's debt has returned to investment grade.\n\n\"We have a chance to reintroduce ourselves to America,\" Detroit's mayor, Mike Duggan, said in an interview. \"The last time this country paid any attention to us was 10 years ago when we were in bankruptcy.

That's why members of our staff, who spend the most time in the city, have gathered recommendations of what to do in Detroit for the NFL Draft.\n\nBut first, a bit of history for new visitors.\n\nDetroit is known as the Motor City, but its roots run much deeper. The city was once upon a time called the \"Little Paris of the Midwest,\" attributable to its French colonial era when it was established in 1701 by Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac, a French military leader and trader. The area had been known by many names to various Indigenous peoples, including the Waawiiyaataanong, meaning \"where the river bends.\"\n\nBy the 1910s, an influx of workers from around the world came to Detroit to work in high-paying factory jobs. They, along with native Detroiters, organized unions to fight against unfair labor practices, and the United Auto Workers union was born. As the 20th century progressed, the shape of the city changed. New neighborhoods sprang up around new factories in outlying communities.\n\nFew know Detroit was the last stop on the Underground Railroad to Canada, where civil rights activist the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. gave his first rendition of his legendary \"I Have a Dream\" speech, and was home to bootleggers during the Prohibition era. The 1967 uprising was the culmination of decades of institutional racism and entrenched segregation. The crisis is still remembered as the largest civil disturbance of the 20th century in America, which resulted in 43 deaths, hundreds of injuries, almost 1,700 fires, and more than 7,000 arrests.\n\nStill, the city is famous for making great cars and even better music, including Motown, techno and rock. Detroit reps as home of Aretha Franklin, the Supremes, the Temptations, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, MC5, the Stooges, the White Stripes, Madonna, Bob Seger, Kid Rock, Insane Clown Posse and its own rap style championed by Eminem, Big Sean, J Dilla and Royce Da 5'9, just to name a few.\n\nThe city resurrected, but fast-forward to July 2013, and Detroit filed the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. A decade later, the city has undergone a dramatic, unrecognizable transformation. It has also financially recovered with surpluses, and its credit rating returned to investment-grade status earlier this year. Detroit's Mayor Mike Duggan has spent the last year talking about how the draft will be a \"re-introduction of Detroit to America\" and that he hopes travelers who used to come for \"ruin-porn\" tours will be surprised to find fewer abandoned spots.\n\nThis history is reflected in the present-day bustling distillery and brewing scene, iconic churches, brick roads, monuments, stunning architecture and new factories alongside blighted ones. Take a tour on foot, by bike, by bus or by boat. Here's also Bedrock's field guide in the Draft downtown footprint.\n\nThe Spirit of Detroit will undoubtedly be the monument most visitors notice. Currently, it is fitted with a Honolulu Blue Lions jersey, but we encourage visitors to look above it to notice the seals encrusted on Detroit's City Hall where two Latin mottos read Speramus Meliora and Resurget Cineribus, meaning \"We hope for better things\" and \"It will rise from the ashes,\" which was written by Fr. Gabriel Richard after the Great Fire of 1805.\n\nTake the QLine from the NFL Draft footprint to Midtown's Cultural Center. Stepping off Woodward, these are the institutions we encourage visitors to check out:\n\nLouis Aguliar (Wayne County reporter on where to take selfies)\n\nRod Beard (Sports editor who loves neighborhood vibes)\n\nMelody Baetens (Restaurant critic, who has a separate list for food recs)\n\nAdam Graham (Film critic turned late-night foodie)\n\nSarah Rahal (city reporter wants you to see

{"id": 237095908, "title": "Liberty unhappy with WNBA forcing Commissioner\u2019s Cup championship from Barclays Center", "text": "The Liberty don\u2019t appear too happy with the WNBA after the league kept the date for the Commissioner\u2019s Cup championship game, despite a conflict with the team\u2019s home venue of Barclays Center, and forced the Libs to move the game east to UBS Arena. The Liberty had notified the WNBA in December that a potential championship game on June 25 would not work should they make it and the league \u201cignored\u201d the team, according to a report from amNewYork. The Liberty and WNBA announced on Monday that the game against the Lynx would take place at UBS Arena, which straddles the Queens/Nassau County border, rather than Barclays Center due to the 2024 NBA Draft taking place at Barclays on June 26. The defending Eastern Conference champions had gone back to the WNBA earlier this month about the scheduling conflict and, according to the amNewYork, were told \u2013 before UBS Arena became an option \u2013 that the game would have to be played in Minnesota, even though the Liberty had earned home court. A source told the outlet that the Liberty had suggested that their July 2 home game against the Lynx be re-designated as the championship game and that the Lynx were given the final say about when the game should take place. The Barclays Center has served as the home of the NBA draft every year since 2013 \u2013 except for 2020 due to COVID \u2013 and it has become one of the venue\u2019s major annual events. The setup for an event like the NBA draft can take several days, which likely contributed to the issue with the Liberty\u2019s game. \u201cWith the scheduling of the NBA Draft at Barclays Center on June 26, the NBA created an unavoidable conflict for use of the building,\u201d NBA spokesman Mike Bass told The Post in a statement. \u201cWe are working closely with the New York Liberty on this one-game relocation to UBS Arena and to provide the best possible experience for attendees and participants at the WNBA Commissioner\u2019s Cup Championship. We apologize for any inconvenience to the Liberty\u2019s season ticket holders and loyal fans.\u201d The Liberty did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Post. A statement from Liberty CEO Keia Clarke earlier in the day thanked UBS Arena, which is home to the Islanders and has hosted several college basketball games since it opened in 2021, for allowing the WNBA team to use the facility. \u201cWhile we wish we could have brought this game to our fans in our home arena, we are grateful to UBS Arena for accommodating us and providing a world-class venue in New York,\u201d Clarke said. This is the second consecutive season the Liberty made it to the championship game of the Commissioner\u2019s Cup, which is the WNBA\u2019s in-season tournament, and they are looking to repeat as champions. The Liberty defeated the Aces last year in Las Vegas to capture the Commissioner\u2019s Cup title.", "summary": "The Liberty don't appear too happy with the WNBA after the league kept the date for the Commissioner\u2019s Cup championship game, despite a conflict with the team\u2019s home venue of Barclays Center, and forced the Libs to move the game east to UBS Arena.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/17/sports/liberty-unhappy-with-wnba-forcing-commissioners-cup-championship-to-ubs/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/newspress-collage-a7hzcccai-1718673210115.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1718658856&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 01:15:16", "author": "Christian Arnold", "authors": ["Christian Arnold"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.26}

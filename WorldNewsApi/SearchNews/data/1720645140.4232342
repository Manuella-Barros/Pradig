In an exclusive conversation with PEOPLE on Friday, June 7, at the New York City luncheon for Through Her Lens: The Tribeca CHANEL Women\u2019s Filmmaker Program, Turlington revealed what advice she gave her 20-year-old daughter about modeling. \u201cI told her to stay far away from that,\u201d Turlington, 55, said. \"But she\u2019s actually a storyteller, and I have a little bit of that in my work, too, as an advocate,\" she continued, seemingly referring to Grace\u2019s recently released poetry book, Derived from Us. \u201cSo in that sense, very excited, love her academic pursuits,\u201d Turlington added. \u201cThe other part was a little harder to be excited about.\u201d Grace, who is one of Turlington and filmmaker Edward Burns\u2019 two children, made her runway debut at the British Vogue X LuisaViaRoma show in Florence, Italy, in June 2023. That year, the mother-daughter duo also appeared in a Carolina Herrera campaign. Unlike her mother, who started modeling at age 14, Grace entered the industry later in life. \u201cI was officially allowed to begin modeling at 18; that was the age my mom always had in mind, and I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way,\u201d Grace told HOMMES Magazine in 2022. \u201cI remember denying the interest to anyone and everyone because I hadn\u2019t yet told her,\u201d she added. \u201cHowever, I\u2019d longed to be 18 for some time. My first job was last January, after my birthday, after I had gotten into college.\u201d Grace, who balances modeling while attending the New York University Gallatin School of Individualized Study, has appeared in Perfect Magazine, MUSE Magazine and POP Magazine. Turlington, a headline speaker at the Tribeca Film Festival, was at Friday\u2019s event to continue spreading awareness for maternal health and her non-profit Every Mother Counts, which she founded in 2010 after the release of her documentary film, No Woman, No Cry.

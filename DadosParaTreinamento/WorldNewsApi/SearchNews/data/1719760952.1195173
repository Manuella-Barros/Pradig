The event, taking place in the Marriott Hotel in Grosvenor Square, London, saw in-depth discussions between Holocaust survivors and subsequent generations, with Lord Eric Pickles, the government\u2019s Special Envoy for post-Holocaust Issues, Lord John Mann, the government\u2019s independent adviser on antisemitism, and former MP Joan Ryan also in attendance. The evening began with the \u201945 Aid Society\u2019s traditional memorial candle lighting ceremony, where survivors Jackie Young, Harry Olmer, Joanna Millan, Mala Tribich, Rachel Levy, and Zdenka Husserl, plus third generation relatives, lit six memorial candles to represent the six million Jewish lives lost during the Holocaust. The reunion dinner was organised by a team from the Society\u2019s 2nd generation, headed by Chairman Angela Cohen MBE, and Vice Chairman Philip Burton. In her opening remarks, Cohen paid tribute to the many fallen IDF soldiers who have fought to serve and protect Israel in the months since October 7, as well as the civilians who have been murdered and hostages still in captivity. Private Secretary to the prime minister, Tim Kiddell, gave the loyal toast to King Charles, followed by Michael Helfgott, son of the late Sir Ben Helfgott, toasting the State of Israel. Jackie Young, one of the youngest members of the Boys who was brought to the UK aged 4, was interviewed by actress and second-generation Louisa Clein. Young spoke poignantly about his search to find out about his past, as documented on the BBC\u2019s \u2018DNA Secrets\u2019 programme. Only at aged 19 did Young find out that he was not only born in Austria but also that he had spent over two and a half years in a concentration camp. BBC journalist Hannah Gelbart also shared the stage with TV personality Rob Rinder, both of whom are third generation. Among the many things they discussed, the two spoke about their reactions to finding out as children about their respective grandfathers\u2019 experiences during and after the Holocaust. Attendees on the evening also heard from Domonic Townsend, lead teacher for the UCL Beacon School, Nottingham University Samworth Academy, who has been working to develop a programme to teach the Holocaust to deaf children. Entertainment was provided by singing group Jewish Encore and Shir. Chairman Cohen said: \u201cWe enjoyed a wonderful celebration. The Boys taught us that, although they went through unspeakable horrors, we must always look forward and celebrate life: they showed us the art of simcha. It was wonderful to see the \u201945 Aid family growing, with further involvement this year by the third and even fourth generation. \u201cWe are very much looking forward to celebrating our historic 80th anniversary reunion dinner next year.\u201d The Boys are a group of 732 tightly knit child survivors of the Holocaust, both male and female, who escaped mainland Europe to find safe harbour in the Lake District, England. Their story was told in the 1997 book \u2018The Boys: The true story of children who survived the concentration camps\u2019 by the late Sir Martin Gilbert.", "summary": "The Boys are a group of 732 child survivors of the Holocaust who after fleeing the Nazis were placed in the Lake District", "url": "https://www.thejc.com/community/hundreds-attend-the-boys-79th-anniversary-reunion-dinner-kwh5uw3u", "image": "https://api.thejc.atexcloud.io/image-service/view/acePublic/alias/contentid/1bkqcgs49rjstkabznr/0/45-aid-2024-dinner-13486-photo-john-rifkin.webp", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:31:19", "author": "Daniel Ben-david", "authors": ["Daniel Ben-david"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.476}

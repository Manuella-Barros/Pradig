Warren's mother, Norma Crow, played by Glynis Barber, also believed Freddie was the elusive character.\n\nHowever, after weeks of conjecture from both characters and viewers, the mystery surrounding Blue's identity will be resolved later this week (or next week for E4 viewers), as the character's true identity is finally revealed to audiences, reports the Mirror.\n\nJamie Lomas has hinted that his character Warrens departure from Hollyoaks will be nothing short of explosive. The actor, who made his debut on the show in 2006, has decided to take a step back from the Channel 4 drama to dedicate more time to his expanding family.\n\nDiscussing his exit, the 49 year old actor expressed: \"I feel ready, I work so hard there and you do need that break from time to time. I'll just be having a baby so it will be nice to spend some time at home with the new-born.\"\n\nLomas emphasised the value of family time, saying, \"Spending time with family is just so important. I think it changes as you get a little bit older, but in the past we've been so focused on our careers, I've ended up just working constantly and this is time I won't get back.\"\n\nReflecting on personal loss and its impact on perspective, he added, \"My dad passed away last year and this made me re-evaluate everything and realise that family is what's important in life. It's going to be a great exit and I'm sure Hollyoaks is going to go on to do great things.\"\n\nOn the soaps recent change in scheduling, Jamie remarked, \"Hollyoaks is going down to three days and I think this could be a really good thing, for them to really focus on their content.\"\n\nHe concluded with an observation about modern viewing habits: \"These days people's attention is a lot less due to things like mobiles and now they'll be able to binge all the episodes in an hour!\"", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "angie_quinn@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Angie Quinn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Lomas", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Lomas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Fox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warren Fox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollyoaks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hollyoaks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Hollyoaks_characters_(2022)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "List of Hollyoaks characters (2022)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_4", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Channel 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Roscoe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freddie Roscoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glynis_Barber", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glynis Barber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mystery fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E4_(TV_channel)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "E4 (TV channel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clapham", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clapham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Clapham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soap_opera", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soap opera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drama"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Supplies_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Supplies and Equipment", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Roleplaying", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Roleplaying", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Characters", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Characters", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/tv/article29705857.ece/alternates/s1200/1_hollyoaks-reveals-first-look-at-jamie-lomass-return-as-warren-fox.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801984", "eventUri": "eng-9801984", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

The mystery surrounding who exactly Blue is has been the talking point of Chester's residents and Hollyoaks fans alike.\n\nHowever, Detective Zoe Anderson (Garcia Brown) confirmed Blue to be a terrifying gangster who is feared by criminals of the underworld.

Warren won't go down without a fight - but will he live to regret ever taking Blue on?\n\nIn a bizarre twist, hard nut Warren thought Freddie Roscoe (Charlie Clapham) was actually despite him being too young to be the mysterious killer, whose reputation dates back decades. Warren's mum, Norma Crow (Glynis Barber), also believed Freddie was the illusive character.\n\nBut after weeks of speculation, from both characters and fans, the mystery will be solved later this week (next week for E4 viewers), as Blue's identity is finally revealed to audiences.\n\nJamie Lomas has teased that his Hollyoaks character will be going out with a big bang in his upcoming exit storyline.

Warren sees someone moving around the flat and he investigates, interrupting Blue. What will he find?\n\nBlue hides in plain sight, while Mercedes begs Warren to keep his promise and stay out of crime.

Theresa reminds the McQueens that they have all had lots of chances too.\n\nFrankie prepares to leave for dance school, and it's JJ's day to sign for his football club.

Who knows if it\u2019ll go that far, but Knicks star Jalen Brunson and the Pacers\u2019 Tyrese Haliburton were both in the building for an MSG episode of Friday Night Smackdown \u2014 and they eyed each other up in a tense moment. Brunson was introduced to the crowd to a loud ovation \u2014 as expected \u2014 from the MSG faithful as commentator Corey Graves remarked, \u201cIt\u2019s Jalen Brunson, No. 11, from your New York Knicks.\u201d Shortly after, influencer and WWE United States Champion Logan Paul \u2014 a heel \u2014 made his entrance for his Money In The Bank qualifying triple threat match with Santos Escobar and LA Knight. Paul, trolling the audience, brought out Haliburton, who introduced himself enthusiastically to a chorus of boos from fans in The Garden. Of course, it was Haliburton\u2019s Pacers who defeated Brunson\u2019s Knicks in the second round of the NBA playoffs, with Game 7 taking place at the Garden. Haliburton, a known wrestling fan, managed Paul for the affair. Paul instructed Haliburton to get brass knuckles to help Haliburton win the match \u2014 which he did \u2014 but was confronted ringside by Brunson, who was told by WWE officials to leave the area. Paul then lost the match after being rolled up by Knight, and he was joined by Haliburton in the ring. Brunson then returned with a steel chair to fend off Haliburton and Paul from the outnumbered Knight. Haliburton and Brunson argued in the ring before the former left with Paul. At one point after entering the ring, Brunson shook his left hand \u2014 the one he had surgery on after fracturing it in the series against the Pacers \u2014 and appeared to, but his facial expression could\u2019ve been part of his planned segment and it\u2019s not clear if he was actually hurt. It\u2019s unknown if there are any plans for Brunson and Haliburton to be involved with the WWE beyond this angle for the MSG crowd, reigniting their playoff \u201cfeud.\u201d Haliburton, when leaving up the ramp and to the back, was heard by the camera saying, \u201cI\u2019ll be back.\u201d He\u2019s been involved with WWE before, so it\u2019s not out of the realm of possibilities.", "summary": "It's never too early to start building towards WrestleMania.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/28/sports/jalen-brunson-tyrese-haliburton-have-wild-moment-at-wwe-smackdown/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/newspress-collage-rms46mr3p-1719626039292.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1719611682&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 02:05:44", "author": "Bryan Fonseca", "authors": ["Bryan Fonseca"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.037}

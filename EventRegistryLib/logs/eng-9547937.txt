That could mean the Fed has more work to do to cool inflation, Kashkari wrote in the essay.\n\n\"My colleagues and I are of course very happy that the labour market has proven resilient, but, with inflation in the most recent quarter moving sideways, it raises questions about how restrictive policy really is,\" Kashkari wrote.\n\nFed officials have kept interest rates unchanged since their July meeting, and stronger-than-expected inflation data have kept officials from lowering borrowing costs from the highest levels since 2001. Investors now expect just under two cuts this year, from as many as six seen at the start of 2024.\n\nKashkari, who pencilled in two rates cuts for this year when Fed officials met in March, said Tuesday that he will forecast anywhere from two to zero cuts for 2024 when officials next meet in June, based on incoming inflation data.\n\nInflation as measured by the Fed's preferred gauge rose 2.7 per cent in March. While that's down from a peak of 7.1 per cent reached in 2022, it's faster than the 2.5 per cent pace seen at the start of this year.\n\nOne of the biggest drivers of inflation right now is housing. A shortage in supply is keeping prices elevated even as mortgage rates hover near their highest levels in more than 20 years.\n\n\"Given that housing is a key channel through which monetary policy affects the economy, its resilience raises questions about whether policymakers and the market are misperceiving neutral, at least in the near term,\" he said.\n\nKashkari said he raised his longer-run neutral rate forecast to 2.5 per cent from 2 per cent. Some of his colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee have also raised those estimates, with the median forecast of the longer-run fed funds rate rising to 2.6 per cent from 2.5 per cent in the latest projections published in March.\n\nThe Minneapolis Fed chief, who does not vote on monetary policy this year, emphasised the central bank must set policy based on where the neutral rate is in the short run.\n\n\"The uncertainty about where neutral is today creates a challenge for policymakers,\" he added.\n\nKashkari last published an essay in early February, in which he said policymakers had time to gauge incoming data before lowering interest rates.\n\nHe said then that shifts in the post-pandemic economic recovery may mean that neutral interest rates have moved higher. Kashkari has written a series of essays since 2022 as the Fed was tightening policy in an effort to cool inflation.

In other comments on Tuesday Kashkari said he expects the Fed to need to hold rates steady for an \"extended period.\"\n\nPowell and other officials say they will be looking at the \"totality\" of economic data in making decisions - assessing inflation's stickiness, for example, in the context of what is happening in the job market and within the economy as a whole, whether public expectations around inflation remain stable or start to shift higher, and whether policymakers feel their own credibility is on the line.\n\nThe U.S. central bank at its meeting last week kept the benchmark policy rate steady in a range of 5.25% to 5.5%, where it has been since July, with officials generally resetting expectations for a later start and less overall policy easing this year, but also downplaying the likelihood of further rate increases.\n\nUpdating his policy view in a Monday conversation with reporters, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said that his response to a continued lack of progress on inflation might, for example, hinge on whether overall demand in the economy remained strong or seemed to be weakening.\n\n\"If demand is vibrant, robust, and the numbers aren't moving, that's very different than if demand is weakening or fragile,\" he said. \"Rates are supposed to influence demand which is supposed to influence inflation. If they are not influencing demand or inflation that's very different then if they are.\"\n\nKashkari's essay suggested the Fed's current benchmark rate simply may not be doing enough - at least at this point - and questioned whether policymakers have underestimated the \"neutral\" rate of interest and therefore expect current policy to have more impact than it will.\n\nResidential investment is rebounding, he noted, despite relatively high mortgage interest rates. Like other Fed officials he said he feels weak first-quarter growth in gross domestic product masked strong underlying demand. April job growth fell from the higher numbers seen during the recovery from the pandemic, but remained healthy with an unemployment rate still under 4% as it has been for more than two years.\n\nA wrong understanding of how tight policy really is \"could explain the constellation of data we are observing,\" Kashkari wrote. \"The question we now face is whether the disinflationary process is in fact still underway, merely taking longer than expected, or if inflation is instead settling to around a 3% level, suggesting that the (Federal Open Market Committee) has more work to do to achieve our dual mandate goals.\"\n\nWhat that \"work\" entails will reopen an issue policymakers had hoped they'd settled - over how much economic growth may need to be suppressed in order to achieve the 2% goal, whether higher interest rates will be needed to do it, and whether the tradeoffs are worth it to reduce headline inflation a few tenths of a percentage point.\n\nFed officials across the board have been adamant they will return inflation to 2%.\n\nBut they've no particular timetable.\n\nThe most recent Fed economic projections issued in March see the target reached by the end of 2026, though that could change when new projections are issued at the Fed's June 11-12 meeting.\n\nThose projections will include new guidance on the path of interest rates. While officials downplay the idea rates will need to rise again, a continued stall in inflation at its current level does pose a \"challenge\" Kashkari said.\n\n\"With inflation in the most recent quarter moving sideways, it raises questions about how restrictive policy really is,\" Kashkari wrote.\n\nSource: Reuters (Reporting by Howard Schneider; Editing by Andrea Ricci)", "source": {"uri": "hellenicshippingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hellenic Shipping News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neel_Kashkari", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Neel Kashkari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real estate economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Barkin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Barkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Richmond, Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Richmond, Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547937", "eventUri": "eng-9547937", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-11", "dateEnd": "2024-06-12", "textStart": 4465, "textEnd": 4475}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

Housing in particular is \"proving more resilient to...tight policy than it generally has in the past,\" depriving the Fed of what is typically a key channel for the impact of high interest rates to be felt.\n\nKashkari said that could be happening for a number of reasons, from blunt ones like a housing supply shortage coupled with rising demand, to a more difficult-to-diagnose shift in the \"neutral\" rate of interest which would imply that Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as expected.\n\nRegardless, it means the Fed has to determine whether inflation has truly stalled above target or whether price pressures will eventually continue to ease - a key issue that could force policymakers to decide whether it is worth risking a recession with even tighter monetary policy in order to squeeze a few tenths of a percentage point from the pace of price increases.\n\n\"The question we now face is whether the disinflationary process is in fact still underway, merely taking longer than expected, or if inflation is instead settling to around a 3% level, suggesting that the (Federal Open Market Committee) has more work to do to achieve our dual mandate goals,\" Kashkari wrote.\n\nKashkari did not settle on an answer or update his views on the proper path of monetary policy. Prior to the Fed's last meeting he said that disappointing inflation data and ongoing growth might mean the Fed does not cut interest rates at all this year, but that further increases in the benchmark policy rate were \"not a likely scenario.\"\n\nMOVING SIDEWAYS\n\nThe U.S. central bank at its meeting last week kept the benchmark policy rate steady in a range of 5.25% to 5.5%, where it has been since July, with officials generally resetting expectations for a later start and less overall policy easing this year.

All of this is in pursuit of 2% inflation, a goal that seemed in sight after a rapid decline at the end of last year. And yet inflation has stagnated, with the latest personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, at 2.7%.\n\nThe has made Minneapolis Fed leader Neel Kashkari question if perhaps the ideal natural rate -- or the neutral rate of interest theorized to keep job growth strong and inflation stable -- has grown a percent since the pandemic to around 3%. As a result, the Fed might need to hold off on interest rate cuts that once seemed likely for the time being, Kashkari said Tuesday during a session at the global conference of nonpartisan think tank the Milken Institute.\n\nHigh inflation typically signals the need for interest rate increases to tame it. A floundering economy, meanwhile, suggests interest rate cuts to stoke activity. The fact inflation has remained high but the economy is still chugging along, including a historically low unemployment rate and increase in residential investment compared to last year, presents a conundrum.\n\n\"Right now, it looks like the economy is in a very good place,\" Kashkari said during a Tuesday interview with New York Times reporter Jeanna Smialek. \"Economic momentum is maintaining. There's a lot of resilience. It seems like things are kind of at a steady state. So if I had to pick a scenario today, it seems like we are going to kind of go sideways for a while. And under that scenario, that would lead me as a policymaker to say we ought to just sit with interest rates for longer than expected.\"\n\nKashkari, who was a voting member of the FOMC last year, said in March he thought the Fed might need to cut rates twice this year, but now his stance has wavered.\n\n\"It's possible I would stay at two. It's possible I would go to one or even zero,\" he said of potential cuts. \"We need to look at the constellation of data.\"\n\nKashkari's musings are likely not the discussion investors and everyday consumers who are feeling budget constraints want to hear. Total household debt has been on the rise reaching $17.5 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2023, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The delinquency rate on auto loans and credit cards is higher than before the pandemic.\n\n\"We are facing a puzzling economic environment where the good news is we had rapid disinflation in the second half of last year, much faster than we had expected. ... We had much stronger economic growth than we had anticipated,\" Kashkari said at the conference. \"Those two things are a little bit puzzling. You would think if monetary policy is bringing inflation down, it would also be restraining economic growth, but we didn't see that.\"\n\nThus his desire to stay put at the current rates to see if the disinflation will eventually continue or if it has really stalled. Or if that \"new normal\" is finally revealing itself. Per an essay Kashkari published Tuesday: \"The question we now face is whether the disinflationary process is in fact still underway ... or if inflation is instead settling to around a 3% level.\"\n\nThe April jobs report released last week indicated there is some softening in the labor market with non-farm payrolls increasing by 175,000 jobs on the month, below estimates. The unemployment rate went up to 3.9% from 3.8%, but many still interpret the labor market as remaining fairly tight. Minnesota added about 11,000 jobs in March, thousands more than the same time the year before as well as better than in February.\n\nIn his essay, Kashkari explained residential investment has also grown 5% through the past year despite housing traditionally being especially sensitive to high interest rates. According to a Freddie Mac survey from last week, rates for the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage were 7.17%. Still, builders in the Twin Cities received 40% more single-family home building permits than last year at this time.\n\n\"Given that housing is a key channel through which monetary policy affects the economy, its resilience raises questions about whether policymakers and the market are misperceiving neutral, at least in the near term,\" Kashkari said, adding once the economy fully stabilizes from the pandemic effects, the pre-pandemic low-rate environment could return and bring the neutral interest rate down with it. \"But the FOMC must set policy based on where neutral is in the short run to achieve our dual mandate goals in a reasonable period of time.\n\n\"The uncertainty about where neutral is today creates a challenge for policymakers.\"", "source": {"uri": "startribune.com",

That could mean the Fed has more work to do to cool inflation, he wrote in the essay.\n\n\"My colleagues and I are of course very happy that the labour market has proven resilient, but, with inflation in the most recent quarter moving sideways, it raises questions about how restrictive policy really is,\" Mr Kashkari wrote.\n\nFed officials have kept interest rates unchanged since their July meeting, and stronger-than-expected US inflation data have kept officials from lowering borrowing costs from the highest levels since 2001. Investors now expect just under two cuts this year, from as many as six seen at the start of 2024.\n\nMr Kashkari, who penciled in two rates cuts for this year when Fed officials met in March, said on May 7 that he'll forecast anywhere from two to zero cuts for 2024 when officials next meet in June, based on incoming inflation data.\n\nInflation as measured by the Fed's preferred gauge rose 2.7 per cent in March. While that's down from a peak of 7.1 per cent reached in 2022, it's faster than the 2.5 per cent pace seen at the start of this year.\n\nOne of the biggest drivers of inflation right now is housing.

Some of his colleagues on the Fed's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee have also raised those estimates, with the median forecast of the longer-run fed funds rate rising to 2.6 per cent from 2.5 per cent in the latest projections published in March.\n\nThe Minneapolis Fed chief, who doesn't vote on monetary policy this year, emphasized the central bank must set policy based on where the neutral rate is in the short run.\n\n\"The uncertainty about where neutral is today creates a challenge for policymakers,\" he added.

Fed Presidents Weigh In", "body": "Last week, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided not to take action on the federal funds rate, leaving it where it has been since last July, in the 5.25%-to-5.5% range.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell did not offer much beyond the usual boilerplate responses, but he did say that it was not likely that the next move would be a rate hike.\n\nIn the days that followed, several Fed presidents and FOMC members spoke publicly at various events and provided their insights. Two of them, New York Fed President John Williams and Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, spoke at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Los Angeles this week.\n\nTheir answers to questions on the trajectory of interest rates and the state of monetary policy may shed some light on where things might be headed.\n\nWilliams, who is currently on the FOMC, spoke at the Milken Conference on Monday, saying that things are generally moving in the right direction.\n\n\"We are seeing a continuation of the process of supply and demand getting back into better balance,\" said Williams, and that is critical to getting inflation back to the 2% goal. \"Is the stance on monetary policy appropriate for where we are, and I think right now, it is, very much so.\"\n\nWilliams added, \"Eventually, we'll have rate cuts, but right now, I think policy is in a very good place.\"\n\nThus, he agreed with the moderator that it is \"steady as she goes.\" He did not offer an estimate as to when interest-rate cuts might occur, only to say that the committee will rely on the data to guide it and will \"hopefully continue to see progress.\"\n\nSpeaking at the conference on Tuesday, Kashkari began his comments by talking about the \"puzzling\" nature of what happened in 2023, when inflation rates fell rapidly, but the economy did not slow down, as would typically be the case.\n\n\"It has led me to question: is monetary policy having as much downward pressure on demand as I would have otherwise expected?\"\n\nHe also wondered if the Fed had slammed the brakes hard enough on monetary policy.\n\n\"Perhaps monetary policy is only putting one foot down on the brakes,\" he said, instead of two.\n\nAs for movement on interest rates, Kashkari said the most likely scenario is that \"we stay put for an extended period of time until we get clarity on if disinflation is in fact continuing.\"\n\nIf inflation starts to come back down or if there is some marked weakening in the labor market, that could lead to rate cuts. However, he also said he would need to see multiple reports showing inflation rates dropping before he would be comfortable lowering interest rates.\n\nKashkari did not rule out the possibility of raising rates, although he said that scenario is the least likely and would only be a consideration -- from his perspective -- if inflation goes higher and stays \"entrenched\" there for an extended period.\n\n\"We would do that if we needed to, I think. That's not my most likely scenario, but I also can't rule it out.\"\n\nLater in the conversation, Kashkari discussed inflation, saying that his most likely scenario is that it could go sideways for a while.\n\n\"Under that scenario, it would lead me, as a policymaker, to say we ought to just sit with interest rates for longer than expected ... I think it is much more likely we would just sit here for longer than we expect, or the public expects, right now until we see what effect our monetary policy is having.\"\n\nKashkari also responded to a question about the last \"dot plot,\" or summary of projections, in March, which called for three rate cuts in 2024. Kashkari only jotted down two rate cuts for the year in March, and what he will project in June will depend on the data released between now and then.\n\n\"It is possible I'd stay at two.

But one important takeaway from recent Fed commentary is that unlikely and inconceivable are not the same thing.\n\nAfter the central bank held rates steady at 5.3 percent last week, Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell delivered a news conference where what he didn't say mattered.\n\nAsked whether officials might raise interest rates again, he said that he thought they probably would not -- but he also avoided fully ruling out the possibility.

This makes sense. Housing is considered one of the most interest-rate-sensitive segments of the economy because homes are typically purchased with mortgages. As a result, the housing market is one of the primary channels through which monetary policy is transmitted to the real economy.\n\nHere's how that works. When the Fed raises its target for overnight interest rates for loans between banks, this tends to raise yields on longer term bonds because these are essentially just a series of short-term loans. Because mortgage-backed securities are a somewhat close substitute for Treasuries, mortgage rates tend to follow the yield on 10-year Treasuries.\n\nHigher interest rates make buying homes less affordable. They can either depress home prices or at least slow down the rise in prices by reducing demand. They also tend to slow down home building, which is an economically intensive activity that employs lots of labor, materials, and manufactured products. So, if you can slow down the housing market, you can probably slow down the economy and reduce inflation.\n\nExcept that does not seem to be happening. Kashkari points out that after residential investment fell in the early months of the Fed's tightening cycle, it has \"since reversed and has grown 5 percent over the past year.\"\n\nHe could have also pointed out that the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index is up 6.4 percent through February (the most recent month available), an acceleration from the 6.0 percent annual gain in January. The 20-City Composite index, which is what Wall Street tends to focus on, posted a year-over-year increase of 7.3 percent.\n\nAnd Americans think home prices are going to keep rising. The New York Fed's recent Survey of Consumer Expectations found that average one-year-ahead home price growth expectations increased to 5.1 percent in February 2024 from 2.6 percent in February 2023. While that is lower than the 2022 series high of seven percent, it is also the second highest reading in the history of the survey.\n\nHow about rents? The consumer price index for residential rents was up 5.7 percent over the 12 months through March. While the month-to-month increases fell sharply in the first half of last year, over the past seven months they have been in a range of 0.3 percent to 0.6 percent, very elevated compared with the 10 years before the pandemic. The New York Fed survey shows that households expect rents to increase by 9.7 percent over the coming year, reversing last year's decline to an expected 8.3 percent increase.\n\nHousing starts tell a similar story. They fell steeply in the first few months after the Fed started raising rates, but this downward trajectory ended in the summer of 2022. Since then, starts have bounced around within a range much higher than was typical pre-pandemic.\n\nEmployment in home building is also running hot again. After plateauing in the months immediately following the Fed's first interest rate hike, it began rising again last August. There are now 100,000 more people employed in home building than there were prepandemic, when things were running at the highest level since the bursting of the housing bubble. In fact, the last time so many people were employed building houses was the summer of 2007.\n\nThis cuts the legs out from under the interest rate doves who say that shelter inflation is somehow distorting the overall inflation numbers because of lags in the way it is calculated. The idea that shelter will stop being a major contributor to inflation falters on the fact that home prices and rents keep rising rapidly.\n\nKashkarai argues that the \"resilience\" of the housing market suggests that the neutral rate of interest -- the rate that neither holds back nor stimulates the economy -- has likely risen from the very low levels that we experienced in the decade or so before the pandemic. As a result, the level of interest rates necessary to push inflation down to the Fed's two percent target is likely higher than thought.\n\nIn other words, rates might not be as restrictive as many Fed officials and Wall Street economists think. And that, in turn, suggests that rates might need to be higher if they are going to do the job of taming inflation.\n\nThe data, however, suggests an alternate explanation. Instead of the problem being the absolute rate of interest, it may be the very fact that the Fed's stopped raising rates that is important. If the restrictiveness of rates comes not from their level but from the fact that they are rising, the Fed's decision to stop raising last summer is a form of easing. What matters when it comes to inflation may be the rate of increases instead of whether rates are high or low in some objective sense.\n\n\"Once the policy rate remains stable and the transition dynamics work their way through ('long and variable lags'), the higher policy no longer appears contractionary,\" economist David Andolfatto wrote in a blogpost back in February.\n\nThe further implication is that the Fed's signal that its next move will be an interest rate cut is itself expansionary. The market -- and corporations, especially homebuilders -- don't have to wait for the cuts to come. They'll start executing their expansion plans in anticipation of the cuts.\n\nThis suggests that the Fed probably will need to restart interest rate increases to get inflation to start falling again.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_carney@breitbart.com", "name": "John Carney", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neel_Kashkari", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Neel Kashkari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real estate economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Treasury_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Treasury security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage-backed_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage-backed security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_New_York", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Bank of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housing_bubble", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Housing bubble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/05/housing-inflation-market-home-sales-getty.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547937", "eventUri": "eng-9547937", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-20", "textStart": 1944, "textEnd": 1959}], "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

The survey, taken in February, suggests refinancing to lower rates is a thing of the past.\n\nThe pessimistic outlook is understandable. Pushing interest rates up slowed home sales but had the mostly unexpected consequence of pushing home prices even higher. That's because people with low-interest loans were hesitant to put their homes up for sale, which forced buyers to pay more in the low-supply market.\n\nRising home prices have contributed to prolonging the battle against inflation, Jerome Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, said May 1. \"There are a number of places in the economy where there are just lag structures built into the inflation process,\" Powell said, \"and housing is one of them.\"\n\nRising rates aren't a certainty yet. Three Fed officials, the presidents of the Minneapolis, New York and Richmond branches, have all said as much in recent days. A likely scenario, Neel Kashkari of the Minneapolis Fed said on May 7, is that the Fed's rate would go unchanged, not up or down, for a while. \"We would just sit here for longer than we expect or the public expects right now,\" Kashkari said at a Milken Institute conference in Los Angeles, \"until we see what effect our monetary policy is having.\"\n\nMortgage interest rates are not set by the Fed but generally move in the same direction as the Fed's rate.\n\nHigher-rising interest rates will further strain buyers' ability to get the home they want. A rule of thumb is that for every 1 percentage point increase in mortgage rates, buyers pay 10% more per month for the same loan amount.\n\nAffordability will shrink sharply if interest rates go up the roughly 2.5 percentage points the survey predicts they will in the next three years.\n\nIf the rate on a 30-year mortgage hits 9.7% in 2027, it will be the first time borrowing cost that much since January 1991. Rates were last at 8.7% four years later, in early 1995.\n\nFor most of the 21st century, mortgage rates approaching 10% weren't in anyone's sights.\n\nThe highest interest rates have been in the 21st century is about 8.5%, as the century was dawning in June 2000. They dropped below 5% in spring 2010 and didn't rise back above that level until April 2022, at the start of the Fed's inflation-fighting increases.\n\nWhile the expectations of 8.7% mortgages a year from now and 9.7% in three years are the highest in the 10 years the Fed has been surveying on this question, a historical note is in order. Between December 1978 and November 1986, lending rates were consistently above 10%, and spent a year above 15%.\n\nInterest rates peaked at a now-unthinkable 18.63% in early October 1981.

Asian stocks largely declined after U.S. stocks ended mixed amid a lack of fresh economic data; the dollar strengthened; Treasury yields were steady; while oil futures fell and gold was little changed.\n\nEquities:\n\nStock futures were mixed early Wednesday as corporate earnings continue to roll in.\n\nHopes for rate cuts in 2024 had dimmed in recent weeks after a string of data showing inflation has proven stickier than expected.

Earlier, Finance Minister Suzuki said excessive currency moves aren't desirable, and that authorities will take appropriate action in the FX market when necessary.\n\nBonds:\n\nTreasurys were little changed after rallying overnight, spurred by buying that initially emerged during the Asia session and sent long-term yields to their lowest levels in weeks.\n\nIt was a quiet day for traders, who were focused on a trio of government auctions this week.\n\nThe Treasury's $58 billion auction of 3-year notes on Tuesday was met with good demand from non-dealers. Non-dealer bidding came in at 85.1% versus an 81.7% average, according to BMO Capital Markets strategist Vail Hartman. Tuesday's sale is set to be followed by a $42 billion auction of 10-year notes on Wednesday and a $25 billion auction of 30-year bonds on Thursday.\n\nEnergy:\n\nOil fell early Wednesday following news reports that Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak indicated OPEC+ could move to increase crude production.\n\nAlthough crude oil prices aren't technically in oversold territory yet, with the daily relative strength index hovering around 35 on Brent oil contract, prices are showing some signs of stabilization around key technical levels, said Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at City Index and FOREX.com. Brent oil has been testing a key support zone around $82.40/bbl-$83.00/bbl during the last couple of days, he noted.\n\nMetals:\n\nGold was little changed in Asia as traderes eye Fed cues. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said Tuesday that he can't rule that the next move from the central bank will be a rate hike.\n\n\"The bar to raising is quite high, but it is not infinite,\" Kashkari said in a talk. Kashkari said he would support a hike if inflation starts to look entrenched, but added quickly that a rate hike wasn't his base case.\n\n-\n\nCopper fell in Asian trading as the base metal looks for its next tailwind. Prices are likely to be volatile in the short term, as investors continue to look for clues on rate cuts from the Fed, Nanhua Futures said.\n\nCopper and other industrial metals tend to benefit from looser monetary policy, which eases borrowing costs, thereby spurring more construction and manufacturing activity. High rates also boost the dollar, which can weigh on appetite for USD-denominated assets like copper.\n\n-\n\nIron ore prices declined in Asia. Investors see no near-term solution to China's property market woes despite recent positive signals from Beijing, ANZ said.\n\nSteel demand from China's residential real estate sector is likely to fall further this year, ANZ added.

The ICE US Dollar Index DXY, which measures the greenback against six major currencies, was up modestly Tuesday for a gain this year of around 4%, according to FactSet data, at last check.\n\nU.S. Treasury Bonds Have Gotten Harder to Sell. This Week Could Be Different.\n\nIt's a new and more angst-ridden era in the bond market.\n\nNot long ago, bonds were considered unexciting-a calm and tidy way for investors to build wealth without taking the risk found in stocks.

The SBU said they were two of five agents working on the plot under the direction of Russia's Federal Security Service, the FSB. The agency said the group was also planning to kill SBU Chairman Lt. Gen. Vasyl Malyuk, and the country's top military-intelligence officer, Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov.\n\nReddit shares soar on revenue beat, narrower-than-expected loss in first post-IPO results\n\nReddit Inc. reported its first results as a public company Tuesday, with the social-media platform reporting better-than-expected revenue and a narrower-than-expected loss for the first quarter.\n\nThe company RDDT reported a first-quarter loss of $575.1 million, or $8.19 a share, after a loss of $60.9 million, or $1.05 a share, in the year-earlier quarter. Analysts surveyed by FactSet expected a loss of $8.75 a share.\n\nTikTok Sues to Block U.S. Ban\n\nTikTok filed a federal lawsuit Tuesday challenging the constitutionality of a new law that requires a sale or ban of the popular social-media app, setting up a court showdown over national security and free speech in the age of global information wars.\n\nThe suit, filed directly with a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., seeks a court order preventing the U.S. from enforcing the bipartisan law signed by President Biden last month. The measure bans Chinese-backed TikTok in the U.S. unless its parent company, ByteDance, divests itself of the platform by mid-January.\n\nInternational Paper stock rises on report of $15 billion

The S&P 500 opens on a negative note, exhibiting a decline in investors' risk appetite. 10-year US Treasury yields recovered to 4.48% after Minneapolis Federal Reserve (Fed) Bank President Neel Kashkari raised concerns over stalled progress in the disinflation process as it favours interest rates remaining at their current levels for the entire year.\n\nThe US Dollar Index (DXY) advances to 105.50 as Neel Kashkari said he wants to see multiple positive inflation readings to build confidence that inflation is progressively declining to the 2% target. He added that weakness in the job market could justify the need for a rate cut.\n\nDue to the absence of top-tier United States economic data, investors will focus on speeches from policymakers: Fed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston Susan Collins and Fed Governor Lisa Cook to project the next move in the US Dollar.\n\nMeanwhile, the Australian Dollar remains under pressure after the RBA's less-hawkish commentary on the interest rate outlook. In the press conference, RBA Governor Michele Bullock ruled out expectations of more rate hikes despite recent price pressures exceeding expectations.

Minneapolis Fed Kashkari (non-voter this year) gave us some flavor on how a slightly more hawkish shift at last week's policy meeting could have looked like. His guidance sounded familiar: \"the most likely scenario is we sit here for an extended period of time\". In its official statement, the onus remained on a policy rate cut though the bar to implement one was raised given little progress on inflation. We assume FOMC Minutes to highlight a split between two camps. Kashkari said that the bar for raising rates is quite high, but he doesn't rule it out. He made the case of a higher neutral interest rate especially given persistent housing inflation, questioning how restrictive monetary policy really was/is. It would also help explaining why the labour market has proven resilient and why inflation moved sideways in recent quarters. Kashkari said that he penciled in two rate cuts for this year when Fed officials met in March and that he'll forecast anywhere from two to zero cuts for 2024 when officials meet next on June 12. The Kashkari comments didn't bring life into mostly sideways dealings. German Bundesbank Nagel sounded somewhat more hawkish than most of his colleagues by stressing that a range of potential factors could lead to higher inflationary pressure in the future (eg demographic trends pushing up wages). The ECB shouldn't allow an accommodation to higher levels trigger a de-anchoring of inflation expectations. Longer term, he doesn't eye a return to the sort of weak inflation rates (and easy monetary policy) we've had in the run-up to the pandemic. Apart from these central comments, the US Treasury kicked off its mid-month refinancing operation with a solid $58bn 3-yr Note auction. Tonight's $42bn 10-yr Note sale and Thursday's $25bn 30-yr Bond auction will likely prove more tricky.\n\nUK gilts outperformed returning from May Day holiday and in the run-up to tomorrow's BoE meeting. Risks are asymmetric with markets likely positioned too hawkish. Sterling already feels the pressure with EUR/GBP returning to 0.86. We eye a sustained return higher for the pair.\n\nThe US Commerce Department has revoked export licenses that allowed major chip companies Intel and Qualcomm to do business with China's Huawei. The move, confirmed to and reported by the Financial Times, comes amid evidence that China is able to develop advanced chips using US technology despite sweeping export controls that are already in place since 2022. \"We continuously assess how our controls can best protect our national security and foreign policy interests\", the agency said. US national security officials note that these cutting edge chips have helped China engage in cyber espionage. Washington has also pushed allies/kings of the semiconductor industry in Europe and Asia, including the Netherlands & South Korea, to implement tough(er) export controls.\n\nThe Turkish government has been holding talks recently about easing restrictions on offshore currency swaps, Bloomberg reported citing people familiar with the matter. Any loosening would be gradually and could focus in a first step on longer-maturity contracts but is expected to be welcomed by foreign investors. Local banks are currently limited in the amount of liras they can lend (in the form of FX swaps, options, futures etc.) to counterparties abroad. This, however, makes it difficult for investors to hedge the currency risk they take when investing in lira assets, despite the demand being there. International optimism on Turkey has increased sharply in recent months thanks to more orthodox policies, including in monetary policy. This high demand abroad also caused a widening gap between offshore and onshore rates with the former earlier this month at some point being about half of the domestic ones (26% vs >50%), denting the currency's carry appeal. The Turkish lira reacted stoic (USD/TRY 32 area) on the news for the time being but other Turkish assets including equities and CDS did rally.\n\nGE 10y yield\n\nECB President Lagarde clearly hinted at a summer (June) rate cut which has broad backing. EMU disinflation continued in April and brought headline CPI closer to the 2% target. Together with weak growth momentum, this gives backing to deliver a first 25 bps rate cut. A more bumpy inflation path in H2 2024 and the Fed's higher for longer strategy make follow-up moves difficult. Markets have come to terms with that.\n\nThe Fed in May acknowledged the lack of progress towards the 2% inflation objective, but Fed's Powell left the door open for rate cuts later this year. Soft US ISM's and weaker than expected payrolls supported markets' hope on a first cut post summer, triggering a correction off YTD peak levels. Sticky inflation suggests any rate cut will be a tough balancing act. 4.37% (38% retracement Dec/April) already might prove strong support for the US 10-y yield.\n\nEconomic divergence, a likely desynchronized rate cut cycle with the ECB exceptionally taking the lead and higher than expected US CPI data pushed EUR/USD to the 1.06 area. From there, better EMU data gave the euro some breathing space. The dollar lost further momentum on softer than expected early May US data. Some further consolidation in the 1.07/1.09 are might be on the cards short-term.\n\nDebate at the Bank of England is focused at the timing of rate cuts. Most BoE members align with the ECB rather than with Fed view, suggesting that the disinflation process provides a window of opportunity to make policy less restrictive (in the near term). Sterling's downside turned more vulnerable with the topside of the sideways EUR/GBP 0.8493 - 0.8768 trading range serving as the first real technical reference.", "source": {"uri": "actionforex.com",

This caused the average rate of the one-week deposits to inch down by 0.03 basis point (bp) to 6.5306% from 6.5309% a week earlier.\n\nMeanwhile, bids for the 14-day term deposits amounted to P125.336 billion, lower than the P140-billion offering and the P140.158 billion in tenders for the P160 billion worth of 13-day papers placed on the auction block on May 2.\n\nAccepted rates for the tenor were from 6.54% to 6.6%, a tad wider than the 6.5495% to 6.6% margin seen a week ago. With this, the average rate for the two-week deposits rose by 0.29 bp to 6.5736% from 6.5707% logged in the prior auction.\n\nThe BSP has not auctioned off 28-day term deposits for more than three years to give way to its weekly offerings of securities with the same tenor.\n\nThe term deposits and the 28-day bills are used by the BSP to mop up excess liquidity in the financial system and to better guide market rates.\n\nTDF yields were mixed following the release of April inflation data on Tuesday, Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. Chief Economist Michael L. Ricafort said in a Viber message.\n\nHeadline inflation accelerated for a third straight month to 3.8% in April from 3.7% in March, the Philippine Statistics Authority reported on Tuesday.\n\nThe April print was slower than the 6.6% print in the same month a year ago and was within the BSP's 3.5-4.3% forecast.\n\nIt also marked the fifth straight month that inflation settled within the central bank's 2-4% target band.\n\nStill, the latest inflation print was below the 4.1% median estimate in a BusinessWorld poll of 16 analysts conducted last week.\n\nFor the first four months, headline inflation averaged 3.4%. The BSP expects full-year inflation to settle at 3.8%.\n\nMr. Ricafort said recent signals of policy easing from US Federal Reserve policy makers also affected term deposit yields this week.\n\nOn Tuesday, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari suggested the US central bank may need to forgo interest rate cuts this year due to stubborn inflation, Reuters reported.\n\nMr. Kashkari said at a Milken Institute conference that stalled inflation, kept higher in part by housing market strength means the central bank will need to hold borrowing costs steady for an \"extended period,\" and possibly all year.\n\nMr. Kashkari did, however, also say it is still possible the Fed could cut if inflation begins to cool again.\n\nThe comments came on the heels of remarks from Fed officials on Monday that seemed to lean toward indicating the central bank's next move would be to lower interest rates.\n\nLast week, Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell said the wait to loosen policy is taking longer than anticipated, but signaled his inclination is still to cut.\n\nAnd while prices have been sticky, the labor market showed some signs of weakening in the monthly payrolls data from Friday. Consumer price data in a week from now will be closely watched.\n\nThe US central bank kept its Fed funds rate steady at 5.25%-5.5% at its April 30-May 1 meeting.\n\nFollowing last week's Fed policy meeting and softer-than-expected US jobs report, market expectations for two rate cuts this year have increased, with expectations for a cut of at least 25 bps in September currently at 64.5%, according to CME's FedWatch Tool.", "source": {"uri": "bworldonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BusinessWorld"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangko_Sentral_ng_Pilipinas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_deposit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Time deposit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auction", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Auction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rizal_(province)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rizal (province)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_Statistics_Authority", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philippine Statistics Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neel_Kashkari", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neel Kashkari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commercial bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Security (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milken_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milken Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BusinessWorld", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BusinessWorld"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Mercantile_Exchange", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Mercantile Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal funds rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.bworldonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Peso-coins-currency.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547937", "eventUri": "eng-9547937", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-30", "dateEnd": "2024-05-01", "textStart": 3674, "textEnd": 3688}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-02", "textStart": 1089, "textEnd": 1094}], "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

The market's robust movement positions it for a potential breakout above the near-term high at $27.73. Notably, this rally persists despite the backdrop of increasing Treasury yields and a stronger dollar, factors typically associated with reduced demand for dollar-denominated assets.\n\nAt 10:38 GMT, the 10-year Treasury yield rose over 2 basis points to 4.506%, while the 2-year Treasury yield climbed by less than 1 basis point to 4.847%. Investors scrutinized comments from Federal Reserve officials, seeking clues on the trajectory of interest rates. Fed policymakers, including Boston Fed President Susan Collins, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, and Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin, emphasized the likelihood of steady rates until inflation clearly trends towards the Fed's 2% target range.\n\nAs the market awaits further guidance, attention is drawn to upcoming economic data. The U.S. weekly jobless claims report is scheduled for Thursday, with the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment reading expected on Friday. Additionally, next week's release of the consumer price index data will be closely monitored for further insights into inflation trends.\n\nDespite market anticipation of a rate cut in September, silver traders remain cautious, particularly in anticipation of the upcoming U.S. inflation report. A hotter-than-expected inflation reading could potentially lead to further price declines. Presently, traders are pricing in a 66% chance of a Fed rate cut in September, a factor influenced by the reduced opportunity cost of holding bullion in a low-interest-rate environment.\n\nLooking ahead to the remainder of 2024, the outlook for silver remains relatively positive, with potential for another multi-year high.

Your money saved in these accounts is insured for up to $250,000 by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), if deposited with a credit union.\n\nDig deeper: I'm a personal finance expert: Here's why you need to invest in a CD today\n\nCD rates in the news\n\nCD rates strongly correlate with the key interest rate set by the Federal Reserve, the U.S.'s central bank. This Fed rate is the benchmark that affects rates on deposit accounts, loans, mortgages and other financial products. Typically, as the Fed rate rises, so do APYs on savings products like CDs, high-yield savings accounts and money market accounts -- surging up to 4.5% and higher today to accelerate your savings.\n\nThe Federal Reserve increased the target interest rate 11 times from March 2022 to July 2023 in an effort to combat the highest inflation in four decades coming out of the pandemic.\n\nMay 1, 2024: Fed holds benchmark rate unchanged for sixth time since July 2023\n\nAt the conclusion of its third rate-setting policy meeting of 2024 on May 1, 2024, the Federal Reserve left the federal funds target interest rate at a 23-year high of 5.25% to 5.50%, marking the sixth consecutive time the Fed's held the benchmark rate unchanged since July 2023.\n\nIn its post-meeting statement, the Federal Reserve maintained \"there has been a lack of further progress toward the 2 percent inflation objective.\" The Federal Reserve is focused on a 2% percent inflation goal that's ideal for keeping employment high and prices low. Despite speculation in March of three rate cuts by the end of the year, the Fed cautioned in its May statement that its rate-setting committee \"does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.\"\n\nApril inflation data comes in higher than expected, complicating Fed's next move\n\nComplicating future cuts to the Fed rate is March's Consumer Price Index data released on April 10 that showed a rise in consumer prices -- a widely used indicator for inflation -- to 3.5% in March, up from 3.2% in February.\n\nThe same week brought with it the latest Producer Price Index, an economic indicator measuring changes over time in the prices producers receive for goods and services -- or wholesale inflation. The April 11 data showed a lower rate of growth in March than economists expected, providing modest relief from continued inflation worries.\n\nWhat to expect at the Fed's June policy meeting\n\nIt's too early to predict what the Federal Reserve will decide at its next policy meeting on June 11 and June 12, 2024, though it's given no signals as to when it might lower the key interest rate.\n\nThe pace of inflation has fallen from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022 to rates that have ranged from 3% and 4% since May 2023. April's Producer Price Index data is due for release on May 14, 2024, followed by new Consumer Price Index data on May 15, 2024. Each report could indicate an improvement in the inflation rate, influencing the Fed's decision on a future rate cut.\n\nYet April's inflation data has prompted a growing group of economists and strategists to doubt whether the Fed can cut interest rates at all this year.\n\nResponding to continued inflation concerns, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned on April 16, \"If higher inflation does persist, we can maintain the current level of [interest rates] for as long as needed.\"\n\nThe Powell-led rate-setting panel will announce a rate decision at the conclusion of its meeting on June 12, at 2 p.m. ET.\n\nFDIC averages on CD products: Rates steady or up on most terms in April\n\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation tracks monthly average interest rates paid on certificates of deposit and other savings accounts. Created by Congress, the FDIC is an independent government agency charged with maintaining stability and public confidence in the U.S. financial system and providing insurance on consumer deposit accounts.\n\nHere's how national deposit rates on a $10,000 minimum deposit compare between April and March 2024, as reported by the FDIC, showing an increase in the rate on terms of six months as well as terms of 24 months and longer.\n\nDig deeper: When's the next Federal Reserve meeting? The FOMC -- and how it affects your finances\n\nHow a certificate of deposit works\n\nA CD is a type of savings or deposit account that's offered by banks, credit unions and other financial institutions. Unlike a traditional savings account, a certificate of deposit holds your money for a fixed period of time -- terms of one month to five years or longer -- paying out the interest your deposit amount earns only after the term expires or \"matures.\"\n\nTypical CD rates are fixed, which means you're guaranteed a rate of return that doesn't change. While you can't add to or access your cash until the CD matures, the trade-off is a safe, stable way to earn a much higher yield than you'd find with a traditional savings account.\n\nDig deeper: When is it worth it to break a CD? A finance expert's thoughts on early withdrawals and breaking even\n\nHow to compare CDs\n\nWhen choosing the best certificate of deposit for your budget, compare these key factors against your specific savings or financial goals.\n\nTerm length. A CD is ideal for saving toward a specific goal with money you're not likely to need until the account matures. Look to shorter terms for saving toward, say, a family holiday or new appliances. Terms of one to five years or longer can help you lock in today's highest APYs before interest rates are expected to drop.\n\nRate of return. Look for the highest APY for the term you're interested in. The APY is the amount of interest the CD earns in a year -- including compounding. Unlike a savings account, CD rates are fixed, meaning they won't change over your term.\n\nMinimum deposit. While you can find CDs without minimum starting deposits, most CDs require $100 to $1,000 to open an account. Generally, if you have the money for a higher initial deposit, you can earn a higher APY -- just be sure that amount isn't a hardship on your budget.\n\nType of bank or financial institution. Today's best interest rates are offered by digital banks, with few exceptions among traditional brick-and-mortar banks or credit unions. If you aren't comfortable with an online-only bank, look to a high-yield savings account or money market account offering a high rate without withdrawal penalties.\n\nPenalties and fees. Life happens, and you might find yourself needing to tap into your money before the CD matures. Early withdrawal penalties are typically expressed in months of interest you're giving up -- for example, 90 days of interest for CD terms of up to 24 months. Often the longer the term, the higher the penalty fee.\n\nBenefits of a certificate of deposit\n\nGuaranteed returns. With a CD, you make one deposit and earn a guaranteed interest rate over your term that's yours after the CD matures.\n\nHigher rates than traditional accounts. Many banks and financial institutions offer CDs at rates that are higher than you'll earn with the average savings or money market account -- with digital and online banks offering the highest rates on average.\n\nRange of CD terms. You can find CD terms of three months to five years or more to fit your financial goals. Rates for six-month CDs can outpace the average bank account, and longer terms offer rates comparable to the best high-yield savings accounts.\n\nDrawbacks of a certificate of a deposit\n\nPenalty for early withdrawals. If you need to access your money before your CD term expires, you face fees equal to several months of interest -- as much as three to six months' worth, depending on the account.\n\nNot the highest investment returns. CDs are a safe way to steadily earn interest, but you stand to earn more over the long term through stocks, bonds or securities. And by locking your money in a CD, you could miss out if average rates increase.\n\nYou can't add more money. After your CD locks, you aren't able to add to your balance until after the CD matures -- at which point, you can move your money to another account or roll it over to a new CD.\n\nAlternatives to a certificate of deposit\n\nA certificate of deposit isn't the only low-risk way to earn interest on your savings. Look to these alternatives that offer safe, steady returns -- with the flexibility to add to or withdraw your money without penalty.\n\nHigh-yield savings account. An HYSA offers a way to quickly grow your savings investment at variable rates of 4.5% APY or higher with no penalty for withdrawals.\n\nMoney market account. Also called a money market savings account, the rate on an MMA can beat those of traditional savings accounts, with the same flexible access to your money.\n\nHigher-risk investments. Stocks, index funds and mutual funds average higher returns than CDs, though with higher potential losses.\n\nFrequently asked questions about CDs\n\nLearn more about how certificates of deposit work when comparing the best for your budget and financial goals.\n\nHow does a CD compare to a high-yield savings account?\n\nCDs can attract higher rates of return than a high-yield savings account in exchange for locking up your money, while HYSAs can earn you more than a traditional savings account with greater access to your money than a CD. Compare how CDs and HYSAs differ in access, flexibility and type of interest earned before deciding on the best for your investment.\n\nHow do banks make money with a CD?\n\nBanks charge higher interest rates on money they lend out than the interest they pay on customer deposit accounts. The difference is called a spread, and it's what banks rely on to make money. Unlike a traditional savings account that allows for flexible movement of your money without penalty, a CD requires you to lock in your deposit over a specified period of time, returning your principal plus interest after the account matures. That lock-in period -- and penalties that discourage your early withdrawal -- allows a bank to better plan how long it has to make money off your deposit, and it's typically willing to pay a little more for that reliability.\n\nIs my money safe with an online-only bank like Lending Club or SoFi?\n\nYes. These fintech (short for financial technology) companies are either FDIC-insured chartered banks or partner with more recognizable banks to offer deposit accounts that are protected by the government for up to $250,000. The FDIC insures the safety of your money, even if the fintech were to fail or go out of business. Look for terms like \"member FDIC,\" \"FDIC insured\" or \"NCUA insured\" when comparing your options.\n\nWhat is compound interest?\n\nCompound interest is often described as earning interest on your interest. It's a powerful way to boost your savings over time by earning interest on both your initial deposit and any interest you earn along the way. An account's APY is the total amount of interest you'll earn on your deposit over one year, including compound interest, expressed as a percentage.\n\nWhat is a no-penalty CD?\n\nA no-penalty CD -- also called a liquid CD -- is like a traditional CD through which you lock in a deposit for a guaranteed rate of return over a stated period of time, but with the flexibility of withdrawing your money without penalty before the CD matures. This flexibility comes with trade-offs, however, including lower rates of return than a traditional CD. With rates at historic highs, a high-yield savings account may offer comparable or even higher rates than a no-penalty CD with the same flexibility.\n\nWhat is a CD ladder?\n\nA CD ladder is a savings strategy designed to spread out your money across multiple CDs to leverage high rates without tying up your full investment into one long-term CD. The result of CD laddering is access to a portion of your investment at regular, timed intervals. With rates at all-time highs, a short-term CD ladder combines the high rates of return of a long-term CD with the flexible access to your money that a shorter-term CD offers.\n\nLearn how a short-term CD ladder can help you lock in today's highest rates while enjoying rolling returns -- before rates drop.\n\nEditor's note: Annual percentage yields shown are as of Thursday, May 9, 2024, at 8:10 a.m. ET.

Instead, long-term growth and stock values would be better supported by letting markets take rates higher.\n\nThe consensus among Fed policymakers is that the federal funds rate should eventually fall to about 2.6% from its current 5.33%.\n\nThat target is higher than what prevailed between the Global Financial Crisis and COVID but is still too low.\n\nNowadays, demands on available savings are greater.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates that the federal deficit will rise from 5.6% of GDP this year to 6.1% in 2034 -- much higher than 4.6% in 2019.\n\nThe youngest Baby Boomers are now 60. As they retire, they pull funds from tax-sheltered retirement accounts.\n\nArtificial Intelligence requires prodigious investments -- Nvidia's expensive processors, data centers and enormous additions to the electrical grid.\n\nSurging immigration is relieving labor supply constraints, but it requires more housing and other infrastructure and doesn't bring a lot of additional capital.\n\nAlong with investments to transition to electric vehicles and build a greener electrical grid, these forces tax available savings and put upward pressure on interest rates.\n\nTrend growth is potentially much higher than the 1.8% Fed policymakers assume.\n\nAI should boost productivity and investment akin to the advent of the steam engine, electricity, automobile and computer.\n\nGoldman Sachs optimistically estimates as much as a 1.5% annual boost to productivity growth.\n\nMore realistically, the attainable trend rate of growth should be closer to 2.8% than 1.8% if we are not overzealous about suppressing inflation.\n\nEven Chairman Paul Volcker only managed to get inflation down to an average 3.8% the decade following his battle with the Great Inflation of the early 1980s.\n\nChairman Jerome Powell has said he would tolerate periods above 2% to compensate for periods below 2% but little about the opposite.\n\nConsumer expectations for 5-year inflation, as surveyed by the University of Michigan and New York Federal Reserve, are between 2.5% and 3%.\n\nAssuming inflation will be above 2.5% rather than 2% seems reasonable.\n\nA better gauge for the adequacy of interest rates is the 10-year Treasury rate, because it provides the benchmark for business and consumer borrowing rates, As of this writing, it's about 4.5%.\n\nThe yield on high-quality corporate debt fluctuates between 0.7% and 1.5% above that rate. It's trading closer to 0.7%, anticipating that the Fed will eventually cut the federal funds rate and increase the availability of funds across all markets.\n\nA good estimate of where the 10-year Treasury rate should be is the sum of expected inflation and economic growth -- that's in the neighborhood of 5% to 5.5%.\n\nInflation and interest rates were historically low between the GFC and COVID. Globalization kept goods prices down, permitting the Fed to support households and businesses with easy money in their recovery from the GFC.\n\nThe 40 years prior to the GFC, average inflation was 4.0% and the 10-year was Treasury rate 7.4%. Equities thrived -- the S&P 500 averaged a 10.5% return.\n\nIn recent months, stocks have held up well in the face of inflation reports that put interest rate cuts further into the future.\n\nConsidering this record, the 3.5% March increase in the Consumer Price Index does not seem high.\n\nHigh mortgage rates -- currently the 30-year fixed rate is about 7.2% -- is not what handicaps homebuyers and landlords.\n\nRather it's barriers to building new housing -- restrictive zoning and NINBY around large cities and rising material costs and skilled-worker shortages when construction picks up.\n\nCheaper mortgages don't fix supply constraints but those do enable buyers to push up prices, leaving them and new investors in rental units no better off.\n\nCheap credit props up firms that should wind down. That ties up labor that would be better redeployed into new and expanding activities like AI infrastructure and software, electric vehicles, batteries and green energy.\n\nSuch damage to healthy capital reallocation is likely one reason the IMF study of more than 100 episodes across 56 countries found that central banks that lowered interest rates too soon after battling inflation endured both a resurgence of inflation and slower growth over the longer term.\n\nIf the Fed wants healthy growth, it should let the 10-year Treasury rate drift up and abandon its obsession with lowering the federal funds rate to stave off a short recession.\n\nLower rates might put off a recession, but those would harm the great transition to AI that will channel workers from mundane to more creative tasks and slow the creation of a carbon-neutral economy.\n\nEconomic growth and equities would do well, as they did before the GFC, with a market determined, realistic cost for capital -- the Fed should let interest rates rise.\n\n_______________\n\nPeter Morici is an economist and emeritus business professor at the University of Maryland, and a national columnist.", "source": {"uri":

The most active June 2024 contract for gold futures closed at $2,322.30 in New York, down $1.90. In the aftermath of the regular trading session, gold futures extended their decline, currently fixed at $2,316.10 as of 5:25 PM ET in Globex trading, marking an additional six-dollar drop.\n\nThe dollar's strength was a definitive component of today's decline, with the U.S. Dollar Index gaining 0.14% to reach 105.57. This dollar appreciation exerted downward pressure on the precious metal, which typically trades inversely to the greenback.\n\nInvestors remained cautious as they digested recent statements from Federal Reserve officials and awaited the release of the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment reading on Friday and the U.S. CPI (consumer price index) data on May 15. These key economic indicators could provide valuable insights into the state of the economy and influence the Fed's future monetary policy decisions.\n\nAccording to Daniel Ghali, a commodity strategist at TD Securities, \"The market is likely to wait for a catalyst for additional upside, whereas the downside does appear to be capped by the limited participation from money managers.\" This sentiment reflects the prevailing mood among investors, who are treading carefully in the absence of clear directional cues.\n\nAdding to the complexity, recent statements from Federal Reserve officials have painted a mixed picture. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari warned that the Fed's inflation crusade may still not have restricted policy enough to bring down high prices, suggesting that interest rates are likely to stay where they are for an extended period.\n\nReuters reported that \"Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Susan Collins expressed confidence that the current setting of monetary policy will slow the economy in the way she believes will be necessary to get inflation back to the Fed's 2% target.\"\n\nThese divergent views from Fed officials underscore the challenges faced by the central bank in navigating the delicate balance between combating inflation and supporting economic growth.\n\nInvestors have also yet to fully digest the implications of the Fed's recent revision to its asset balance sheet. Last week, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting statement revealed that the Fed would revise the monthly reduction of its balance sheet to $60 billion per month, down from the previous $95 billion. This revision represents the first accommodative action by the Federal Reserve since it paused raising its benchmark interest rate, potentially signaling a shift in monetary policy stance.\n\nAs market participants await further clarity from economic data releases and Fed communications, gold futures are likely to remain volatile, reflecting the ongoing tug-of-war between opposing forces

The portmanteau of stagnation and inflation was an economic catastrophe that completely dumbfounded the mainstream economic establishment at the time.\n\nThe idea that an economy could have simultaneous high inflation and high unemployment was a complete shock to a generation of economists who had grown up taking the idea of the Phillips curve as gospel truth.\n\nAs a result, the US economy floundered throughout the 1970s and beyond, as Federal Reserve policymakers found themselves ill-equipped to deal with the phenomenon of stagflation. And it wasn't until Paul Volcker took the helm of the Fed and undid the misdeeds of his predecessors that the economy returned to some semblance of normalcy.\n\nThe lessons from that era, however, have been forgotten by policymakers today who place too much trust in their own ability to parse economic data and react to changes in the economy quickly enough. And so the possibility that the US economy could fall into another stagflationary episode is growing.\n\nAfter decades of economic growth and moderate inflation, entire generations of Americans have grown up expecting low inflation and constant economic expansion. But there are three big reasons stagflation could be returning, disappointing those expectations.\n\n1. Stubborn Inflation\n\nThe first and most obvious reason stagflation could be returning is the fact that inflation has been remarkably stubborn. Although it's lower today than it was a couple of years ago, that doesn't mean that the Fed has whipped inflation yet.\n\nIf you look at inflation figures from the 1970s, you'll see that inflation rates were like a roller coaster, climbing up, then falling, then climbing even higher, etc. It wasn't until the early 1980s that that vicious cycle was finally brought to an end.\n\nThe Fed today seems not to understand that it may be facing a similar cycle.\n\nFirst we heard that inflation wasn't happening. Then we heard that it was transitory. Then we were told to trust that the Fed would bring inflation under control.\n\nAnd what happened?\n\nInflation came down, but never to its pre-pandemic levels. The amount of money that the Fed pushed into the financial system to fund the government's fiscal stimulus was so massive that we're still feeling the effects of it.\n\nInflation has started to climb again, and once again the Fed seems to be behind the curve. Rather than aggressively fighting to bring inflation down, the Fed has started to end its balance sheet drawdown, something that could allow inflation to continue rising.\n\nOne of the problems with inflation throughout the 1970s was that once it became entrenched, inflation expectations increased and consumer behavior changed accordingly. Once those expectations change and that behavior changes, it can be very difficult to counteract.\n\nThe risk today is that the Fed won't get ahead of inflation, consumer behavior will change, and those patterns of behavior will become entrenched, making the Fed's inflation fight doubly hard.\n\n2. Stagnating Productivity\n\nWhile most people point to GDP as a sign of economic growth, that's misleading. Government spending is a major factor of GDP, which skews those figures.\n\nWith a government that is continuing to run up the national debt and run multi-trillion dollar budget deficits each year, no one in their right mind would think that rising deficit-fueled spending should be treated as a sign of economic growth. Yet it is.\n\nIf you look at actual industrial production, it has been largely stagnant for the past two years. In fact, current industrial production indices are right now at about the same level they were right before the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nThe fact that US industrial production really hasn't seen any growth in over 15 years is scandalous. Yet it's an indicator that not all is well with the US economy.\n\nEven though the US is transitioning to a service economy, industrial production remains a vital component of the economy. And if productivity continues to stagnate, it could be a major warning sign for the economy.\n\n3. Clueless Leadership\n\nWhat really binds these two factors together is the third factor, which is leadership that is either unaware of the problem or unwilling to face the problem. The Federal Reserve throughout the 1970s was helmed by men who could be charitably described as incompetent.\n\nSucceeding longtime Chairman William McChesney Martin in 1970, Chairman Arthur Burns led the Fed from 1970 to 1978. His tenure was marked by political pressure and policy missteps that led to the high inflation that characterized the 1970s.\n\nBurns' unwillingness to stand up to President Nixon's wish for easier monetary policy, as well as his unwillingness to question Keynesian orthodoxy, resulted in runaway inflation that characterized the 1970s as a decade beset by rapid and unpredictable price increases.\n\nBurns' successor, William Miller, wasn't any better. Lasting only 17 months, Miller's tenure is regarded as the worst of all Fed chairmen.\n\nMiller's unwillingness to confront inflation, and his insistence that raising interest rates would make inflation worse, meant that inflation continued to rise unabated. And it required his successor, Volcker, to force shock therapy that caused a recession in order to keep inflation under control.\n\nCurrent Fed Chairman Jay Powell was in law school and starting his legal career during this period, so how much of it does he remember? Has he learned the lessons of Burns, Miller, and Volcker? Or will he repeat the Fed's mistakes that cause the 1970s to become a decade most would rather forget?\n\nSo far, the signs aren't good. Powell misread inflation a few years ago and seems to be downplaying its problems today. If he doesn't step up strong like Volcker did, the next several years could be difficult ones for the economy.\n\nProtect Yourself Against Stagflation\n\nMany people in this country feel that they are at the mercy of the powers that be, at economic factors that are beyond their control. They may feel that there's nothing they can do to protect themselves against worsening inflation or stagflation, and they may be tempted to throw up their hands in defeat.\n\nBut that's not necessarily the case. And taking steps today to protect yourself could pay dividends in the future.\n\nDuring the 1970s stagflation, economic performance was stagnant and stock markets rode a roller coaster of ups and downs, with the 1966-1982 time frame being one of nearly no overall growth. But there was something else that performed well during that period of stagnation.\n\nFrom January 1970 to December 1979, the gold price grew at an annualized rate of over 30% per year, growing nearly 15-fold over the decade. Even a single year of those types of gains is considered phenomenal, but a decade of it is almost unheard of.\n\nMany Americans have put their trust in gold again today, hoping that if the US economy enters another era of stagflation, the gold price will increase just as it did back then. With a track record like that, there's certainly a strong reason to hope.\n\nWhether it's through a gold IRA or just purchasing gold coins to store at home, there are numerous ways to buy gold in order to put it to good use in protecting your financial well-being.

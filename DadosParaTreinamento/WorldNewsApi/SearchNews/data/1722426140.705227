{"id": 243294454, "title": "Junior scores twice to lead Brazil to 4-1 win over Paraguay in Copa America group stage", "text": "LAS VEGAS (AP) \u2014 Vin\u00edcius Junior scored two first-half goals to lead Brazil to a 4-1 victory over Paraguay on Friday night and put itself in position to advance out of Group D in the Copa America. Savinho also scored a first-half goal for Brazil and Lucas Paqueta scored on a penalty kick in the second half. Omar Alderete scored Paraguay\u2019s goal. There were plenty of tense moments with five yellow cards and a red handed out. Andres Cubas was sent off for a red card in the 81st minute, forcing Paraguay to play the last part of the match down a man. Yellow cards were handed to Brazil\u2019s Wendell, Junior and Paqueta and Paraguay\u2019s Fabian Balbuena and Hernesto Caballero. The victory was quite a response for the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o Canarinho, who opened the tournament Tuesday with a scoreless draw against Costa Rica despite outshooting their opponent 18-2. With four points, Brazil is two behind group leader Colombia, which defeated Costa Rica 3-0 earlier Friday. A victory or tie by Brazil against Colombia on Tuesday ensures one of the group\u2019s two spots in the knockout stage. Brazil also has a six-goal differential advantage over Costa Rica, so a loss likely won\u2019t keep out the nine-time Copa America champions. Brazil has had its difficulties against Paraguay in Copa America play, having drawn in their previous five meetings. That tied for the second-longest unbeaten streak against Brazil in this tournament, which Paraguay also was part of from 1963-83. But Brazil won the most recent meeting, defeating Paraguay 4-0 two years ago in World Cup qualifying, and there was little doubt about the outcome of this match after two late goals broke it open in what was a contentious end to the first half. Moments after teammate Bruno Guimaraes hit the crossbar, Savinho put Brazil up 2-0 in the 43rd minute. Both teams got into a scrum in extra time, with Chilean referee Piero Maza Gomez handing yellow cards to Wendell and Balbuena at three-plus minutes. Then Junior delivered the crushing blow five minutes into extra time Paraguay had its chances and even outshot Brazil 8-5, including 4-3 on goal. Brazil goalkeeper Alisson Becker made a tremendous save diving to his right to prevent a goal from Dami\u00e1n Bobodilla 15 minutes into the match. Early in the second half, however, Alderete scored to close the deficit to 3-1. Then 17 minutes later, Paqueta made up for a missed penalty kick in the first half by converting to give back Brazil its three-goal lead. Brazil coach Dorival J\u00fanior made a bold and controversial move by deciding not to start Raphinha. The move, with national team legend Neymar watching from the stands, clearly paid off. Raphinha was a late-game substitute, entering the match at the 72nd minute in place of Savinho. ___ AP Copa America coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/copa-america", "summary": "<a href=\"https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2NvcGEtYW1lcmljYS1icmF6aWwtcGFyYWd1YXktc2NvcmUtOGNjZDNjMGMzOTQ4NjliNGM1NGQyNzE5Zjk3OGU5NWHSAQA?oc=5\" target=\"_blank\">Junior scores twice to lead Brazil to 4-1 win over Paraguay in Copa America group stage</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">The Associated Press</font>", "url": "https://apnews.com/article/copa-america-brazil-paraguay-score-8ccd3c0c394869b4c54d2719f978e95a", "image": "https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/1ba9edb/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5458x3070+0+284/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F45%2F66%2F28390a3759f27f78568a2e626ff4%2F0cb448b6221948f38206a1724f31240a", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 03:53:24", "author": "Mark Anderson", "authors": ["Mark Anderson"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.047}

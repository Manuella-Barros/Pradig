He was the son of 1974 American League MVP Jeff Burroughs.\n\nFormer MLB infielder Sean Burroughs died from fentanyl intoxication at the age of just 43\n\nThe ex-San Diego Padres third baseman collapsed while coaching his son's Little League team\n\nThe Atlanta-born third baseman spent the first three years of his pro career in San Diego after being taken out of high school in California by the Padres with the ninth overall pick at the 1998 MLB Draft.\n\nIn the 2003 season he finally became a key member of San Diego's roster, hitting .286 over 146 games, before hitting .298 over 130 games the following year.\n\nHowever, heading into the 2006 season Burroughs found himself back in the minor leagues with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, who released him that August. Then came a stint with the Seattle Mariners, where he would play just four games with the Triple-A Tacoma before walking away from the sport for three years.\n\n'I just didn't have the drive or the passion,' he told ESPN in an interview in June 2011 of his decision to walk away from the game. 'I was spent physically and spent mentally. It just wasn't there.\n\nBurroughs, pictured with Arizona Diamondbacks owner Ken Kendrick after winning the National League West Division in 2011, appeared in 528 major league games\n\n'I was emotionally drained. I still loved the game and respected the game, but I didn't have the drive to go to the park every day. I kind of lost the desire.'\n\nIn his time away from baseball, the former No. 9 Draft pick suffered personal difficulties, spiraling into drink and drug abuse prior to his eventual return at the age of 30 - having achieved sobriety following a dark period in his life.\n\nIn the ESPN interview, Burroughs said that in part of the span in which he was out of baseball, he was a substance abuser living in cheap motels in Las Vegas and eating out of trash cans. It lasted until he looked in the mirror, decided he didn't recognize himself and vowed to turn things around.\n\nHe moved back into his childhood home, under the house rules, and worked himself back into baseball shape.\n\nHe encountered personal difficulties in a three-year spell out of baseball from 2008-11\n\nAnd having conquered those demons, a 30-year-old Burroughs was back in the major leagues with the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2011, where he spent one season before a brief stint with the Minnesota Twins.\n\nHe played 79 games with the independent Long Island Ducks (2015-16), winning the Atlantic League batting title in 2015.\n\nIn his major league career, Burroughs appeared in 528 games, batted .278, hit 12 home runs and drove in 143.\n\nAs well as enjoying several years in MLB, Burroughs was also a member of the Gold-medal winning USA team at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors":

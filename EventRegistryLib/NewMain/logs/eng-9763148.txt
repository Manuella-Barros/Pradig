By then Spacey was a megastar, while Rapp's acting career only limped along. Dozens of other men, with apparently similar resentments, filed harassment and assault charges. They, too, got nowhere in their suits.\n\nLast summer, Spacey was acquitted in a London court of nine counts of sexual misconduct. Nonetheless, New York Magazine opened its reporting on the case by referring to the acquitted as \"Disgraced actor Kevin Spacey.\"\n\nAnd The New York Times ran a piece citing charges against Spacey, Louis C.K. and others accused of sexual misconduct with the headline: \"Now what do we do with their work?\" The possibility that Spacey or the others were innocent of the charges did not seem relevant.\n\nThis was 2017. It was the heart of the witch-hunting #MeToo era where many equated charges with guilt. Spacey's case became a gay version.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nWhat Spacey seemed guilty of was getting drunk and handsy with young men. This may have been creepy behavior, but court after court concluded it did not rise to sexual assault.\n\nA slop-job of a documentary on Netflix, \"Spacey Unmasked,\" features a parade of male actors with stalled careers. They moan about their betrayal. After having endured Spacey's roving hands, the actor owed them. What they described at bottom was a willingness to prostitute themselves to some degree in return for career advancement.\n\nOne, a former Marine, talks of being afraid of the actor's physical moves toward him. The guy looked like he could have taken out six Kevin Spaceys.\n\nAnother actor complains that Spacey aggressively pressed into him and how shocked he was. A moment later he talks of subsequently accepting Spacey's invitation to go to the movies.\n\nThe film star's advances may have included hints that he would help these male actors with their careers, and that wasn't nice. And it's easy to believe that Spacey was guilty of groping, especially when he got drunk, which seemed to happen a lot. No one here is saying this conduct was acceptable. But inappropriate behavior does not equal assault.\n\nThe documentary repeated this line with shocked innocence: \"He had dead eyes just looking at me. He was a monster.\"\n\nWelcome to Hollywood.\n\nAlso, welcome to the world. \"Being looked at like an object\" is not limited to gender or sexual identity.\n\nActors who have called for Spacey's return to Hollywood include Sharon Stone, Liam Neeson and F. Murray Abraham. I'm a non-celebrity who much enjoyed his performances in \"LA Confidential,\" American Beauty\" and \"House of Cards.\" I miss him.\n\nThe courts have freed Spacey of the charges.

Also an actor, Rapp was 14 at the time, and Spacey was 26. Spacey denied that happened.\n\nIn the wake of the charges, Spacey's talent agency and publicist dropped him. The Netflix hit series \"House of Cards\" fired him. And film projects stopped coming his way. (One indie director took a chance on him this summer.) Spacey complains that all those suits against him and the inability to get work have left him deep in debt.\n\nRapp waited until he was 50 before launching the civil suit to which he attached a demand for $40 million in damages. The case was dismissed in October 2022 after a jury in a New York federal court found the actor not liable for the battery charges. The jurors needed but an hour to reach their decision.\n\nPeople are also reading...

By then Spacey was a megastar, while Rapp's acting career only limped along. Dozens of other men, with apparently similar resentments, filed harassment and assault charges. They, too, got nowhere in their suits.\n\nLast summer, Spacey was acquitted in a London court of nine counts of sexual misconduct.

Also an actor, Rapp was 14 at the time, and Spacey was 26. Spacey denied that happened.\n\nIn the wake of the charges, Spacey's talent agency and publicist dropped him. The Netflix hit series \"House of Cards\" fired him. And film projects stopped coming his way. (One indie director took a chance on him this summer.) Spacey complains that all those suits against him and the inability to get work have left him deep in debt.\n\nRapp waited until he was 50 before launching the civil suit to which he attached a demand for $40 million in damages. The case was dismissed in October 2022 after a jury in a New York federal court found the actor not liable for the battery charges. The jurors needed but an hour to reach their decision.\n\nSpacey's lawyer suggested that jealousy was the motive for Rapp's charges. By then Spacey was a megastar, while Rapp's acting career only limped along. Dozens of other men, with apparently similar resentments, filed harassment and assault charges. They, too, got nowhere in their suits.\n\nLast summer, Spacey was acquitted in a London court of nine counts of sexual misconduct. Nonetheless, New York Magazine opened its reporting on the case by referring to the acquitted as \"Disgraced actor Kevin Spacey.\"\n\nAnd The New York Times ran a piece citing charges against Spacey, Louis C.K. and others accused of sexual misconduct with the headline: \"Now what do we do with their work?\" The possibility that Spacey or the others were innocent of the charges did not seem relevant.\n\nThis was 2017. It was the heart of the witch-hunting #MeToo era where many equated charges with guilt. Spacey's case became a gay version.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nWhat Spacey seemed guilty of was getting drunk and handsy with young men. This may have been creepy behavior, but court after court concluded it did not rise to sexual assault.\n\nA slop-job of a documentary on Netflix, \"Spacey Unmasked,\" features a parade of male actors with stalled careers. They moan about their betrayal. After having endured Spacey's roving hands, the actor owed them. What they described at bottom was a willingness to prostitute themselves to some degree in return for career advancement.\n\nOne, a former Marine, talks of being afraid of the actor's physical moves toward him. The guy looked like he could have taken out six Kevin Spaceys.\n\nAnother actor complains that Spacey aggressively pressed into him and how shocked he was. A moment later he talks of subsequently accepting Spacey's invitation to go to the movies.\n\nThe film star's advances may have included hints that he would help these male actors with their careers, and that wasn't nice. And it's easy to believe that Spacey was guilty of groping, especially when he got drunk, which seemed to happen a lot. No one here is saying this conduct was acceptable. But inappropriate behavior does not equal assault.\n\nThe documentary repeated this line with shocked innocence: \"He had dead eyes just looking at me. He was a monster.\"\n\nWelcome to Hollywood.\n\nAlso, welcome to the world. \"Being looked at like an object\" is not limited to gender or sexual identity.\n\nActors who have called for Spacey's return to Hollywood include Sharon Stone, Liam Neeson and F. Murray Abraham. I'm a non-celebrity who much enjoyed his performances in \"LA Confidential,\" American Beauty\" and \"House of Cards.\" I miss him.\n\nThe courts have freed Spacey of the charges. Now free Spacey to act.\n\nHarrop, who lives in New York City and Providence, Rhode Island, writes for Creators Syndicate: fharrop@gmail.com.\n\nCatch the latest in Opinion\n\nGet opinion pieces, letters and editorials sent directly to your inbox weekly!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "newsadvance.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsAdvance.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Rapp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Rapp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Spacey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Spacey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Cards_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "House of Cards (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talent_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Talent agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharon_Stone", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sharon Stone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Damages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(crime)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Battery (crime)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_misconduct", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual misconduct"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MeToo_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MeToo movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Podcasts", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Podcasts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_C.K.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Louis C.K."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch-hunt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Witch-hunt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._Murray_Abraham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "F.

It has been named Baltimore's most extraordinary home.\n\nThe auction house is offering a starting bid of $1.5 million for Thursday's sale, with a $100,000 deposit required.\n\nLast month, Spacey publicly revealed that he was millions of dollars in debt, couldn't pay his bills and was moving his belongings into storage. He broke down while discussing the auction and his debts during an interview with British presenter Piers Morgan.\n\nHe told Morgan he owed millions and had considered filing for bankruptcy. Spacey's monthly mortgage payment had been set at $20,230, according to court documents, but he fell behind after being fired from House of Cards and sued in Manhattan for alleged sexual advances toward a teenage girl. boy in the 1980s.

Also an actor, Rapp was 14 at the time, and Spacey was 26. Spacey denied that happened.\n\nIn the wake of the charges, Spacey's talent agency and publicist dropped him. The Netflix hit series \"House of Cards\" fired him. And film projects stopped coming his way. (One indie director took a chance on him this summer.) Spacey complains that all those suits against him and the inability to get work have left him deep in debt.\n\nRapp waited until he was 50 before launching the civil suit to which he attached a demand for $40 million in damages. The case was dismissed in October 2022 after a jury in a New York federal court found the actor not liable for the battery charges. The jurors needed but an hour to reach their decision.\n\nPeople are also reading...

By then Spacey was a megastar, while Rapp's acting career only limped along. Dozens of other men, with apparently similar resentments, filed harassment and assault charges. They, too, got nowhere in their suits.\n\nLast summer, Spacey was acquitted in a London court of nine counts of sexual misconduct. Nonetheless, New York Magazine opened its reporting on the case by referring to the acquitted as \"Disgraced actor Kevin Spacey.\"\n\nAnd The New York Times ran a piece citing charges against Spacey, Louis C.K. and others accused of sexual misconduct with the headline: \"Now what do we do with their work?\" The possibility that Spacey or the others were innocent of the charges did not seem relevant.\n\nThis was 2017. It was the heart of the witch-hunting #MeToo era where many equated charges with guilt. Spacey's case became a gay version.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nWhat Spacey seemed guilty of was getting drunk and handsy with young men. This may have been creepy behavior, but court after court concluded it did not rise to sexual assault.\n\nA slop-job of a documentary on Netflix, \"Spacey Unmasked,\" features a parade of male actors with stalled careers. They moan about their betrayal. After having endured Spacey's roving hands, the actor owed them. What they described at bottom was a willingness to prostitute themselves to some degree in return for career advancement.\n\nOne, a former Marine, talks of being afraid of the actor's physical moves toward him. The guy looked like he could have taken out six Kevin Spaceys.\n\nAnother actor complains that Spacey aggressively pressed into him and how shocked he was. A moment later he talks of subsequently accepting Spacey's invitation to go to the movies.\n\nThe film star's advances may have included hints that he would help these male actors with their careers, and that wasn't nice. And it's easy to believe that Spacey was guilty of groping, especially when he got drunk, which seemed to happen a lot. No one here is saying this conduct was acceptable. But inappropriate behavior does not equal assault.\n\nThe documentary repeated this line with shocked innocence: \"He had dead eyes just looking at me. He was a monster.\"\n\nWelcome to Hollywood.\n\nAlso, welcome to the world. \"Being looked at like an object\" is not limited to gender or sexual identity.\n\nActors who have called for Spacey's return to Hollywood include Sharon Stone, Liam Neeson and F. Murray Abraham. I'm a non-celebrity who much enjoyed his performances in \"LA Confidential,\" American Beauty\" and \"House of Cards.\" I miss him.\n\nThe courts have freed Spacey of the charges. Now free Spacey to act.\n\nHarrop, who lives in New York City and Providence, Rhode Island, writes for Creators Syndicate: fharrop@gmail.com.\n\nCatch the latest in Opinion\n\nGet opinion pieces, letters and editorials sent directly to your inbox weekly!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "napavalleyregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Napa Valley Register"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Rapp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Rapp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Spacey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Spacey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napa_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Napa County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Napa County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Route_29", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "California State Route 29"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Cards_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "House of Cards (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talent_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Talent agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharon_Stone", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sharon Stone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Damages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(crime)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Battery (crime)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_misconduct", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual misconduct"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vallejo,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vallejo, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vallejo, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KVYN", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "KVYN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KVON", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "KVON"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._Murray_Abraham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "F.

The public auction, scheduled for 9:15 a.m., will take place outside of the Clarence M. Mitchell, Jr. Court House at 100 N. Calvert St. There will be no online bidding, according to the listing posted by Alex Cooper Auctioneers, based in Towson.\n\nThe foreclosure sale of the Inner Harbor condo was approved by a Baltimore Circuit Court judge last year. The two-unit pad was last sold in 2017 for over $5.6 million to Clear Toaster LLC. Around that time, Spacey's friend and manager Evan Lowenstein told The Baltimore Sun that it was he -- not the \"House of Cards\" star -- who purchased the home. More recently, Spacey claimed the address as his own in court documents.\n\nLowenstein and Spacey could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nDuring a June episode of \"Piers Morgan Uncensored,\" the British TV personality's YouTube talk show, the Oscar-winning actor said his Baltimore home was going to auction and that he had to put his belongings in storage.\n\n\"I can't pay the bills that I owe,\" Spacey told Morgan, detailing how he is millions of dollars in debt from legal bills related to several lawsuits the actor has been fighting over allegations of sexual misconduct in the U.S. and in Britain.\n\nIn 2022, a New York jury cleared Spacey of misconduct against Anthony Rapp in a $40 million civil lawsuit. The following year, a London jury acquitted the actor of sexual assault in a lawsuit brought by four men. His legal battles have continued this year.\n\nSpacey's five-floor Baltimore condo was anticipated to go up for auction in mid-June before it was postponed.\n\nThe abode has six bedrooms, seven full baths and three half-baths, plus an elevator, sauna, home theater, rooftop terrace, verandas and a garage for four cars.

Also an actor, Rapp was 14 at the time, and Spacey was 26. Spacey denied that happened.\n\nIn the wake of the charges, Spacey's talent agency and publicist dropped him. The Netflix hit series \"House of Cards\" fired him. And film projects stopped coming his way. (One indie director took a chance on him this summer.) Spacey complains that all those suits against him and the inability to get work have left him deep in debt.\n\nRapp waited until he was 50 before launching the civil suit to which he attached a demand for $40 million in damages. The case was dismissed in October 2022 after a jury in a New York federal court found the actor not liable for the battery charges. The jurors needed but an hour to reach their decision.\n\nSpacey's lawyer suggested that jealousy was the motive for Rapp's charges. By then Spacey was a megastar, while Rapp's acting career only limped along. Dozens of other men, with apparently similar resentments, filed harassment and assault charges. They, too, got nowhere in their suits.\n\nLast summer, Spacey was acquitted in a London court of nine counts of sexual misconduct. Nonetheless, New York Magazine opened its reporting on the case by referring to the acquitted as \"Disgraced actor Kevin Spacey.\"\n\nAnd The New York Times ran a piece citing charges against Spacey, Louis C.K. and others accused of sexual misconduct with the headline: \"Now What Do We Do With Their Work?\" The possibility that Spacey or the others were innocent of the charges did not seem relevant.\n\nThis was 2017. It was the heart of the witch-hunting #MeToo era where many equated charges with guilt. Spacey's case became a gay version.\n\nWhat Spacey seemed guilty of was getting drunk and handsy with young men. This may have been creepy behavior, but court after court concluded it did not rise to sexual assault.\n\nA slop-job of a documentary on Netflix, \"Spacey Unmasked,\" features a parade of male actors with stalled careers. They moan about their betrayal. After having endured Spacey's roving hands, the actor owed them. What they described at bottom was a willingness to prostitute themselves to some degree in return for career advancement.\n\nOne, a former Marine, talks of being afraid of the actor's physical moves toward him. The guy looked like he could have taken out six Kevin Spaceys.\n\nAnother actor complains that Spacey aggressively pressed into him and how shocked he was. A moment later he talks of subsequently accepting Spacey's invitation to go to the movies.\n\nThe film star's advances may have included hints that he would help these male actors with their careers, and that wasn't nice. And it's easy to believe that Spacey was guilty of groping, especially when he got drunk, which seemed to happen a lot. No one here is saying that this conduct was acceptable. But inappropriate behavior does not equal assault.\n\nThe documentary repeated this line with shocked innocence: \"He had dead eyes just looking at me. He was a monster.\"\n\nWelcome to Hollywood.\n\nAlso, welcome to the world. \"Being looked at like an object\" is not limited to gender or sexual identity.\n\nActors who have called for Spacey's return to Hollywood include Sharon Stone, Liam Neeson and F.

The buyer is a real estate developer who is a \"local DMV businessman,\" said Sam Sheibani, a Compass real estate agent who is representing him.\n\n\"It is an iconic property in Baltimore,\" Sheibani said. \"We were very interested in getting it, obviously not under the circumstances that it's being sold, from whom it's being sold.\"\n\nHe added that it hasn't yet been decided whether the buyer will live there or put the home on the market. \"He would certainly be open, and he would I'm sure entertain, interest from anyone who's interested in buying it,\" he said. \"He is a businessman after all.\"\n\nThe two-unit waterfront condo in the Pier Homes at Harborview complex spans more than 9,000 square feet and last sold in 2017 for over $5.6 million to Clear Toaster LLC.\n\nSpacey's friend and manager Evan Lowenstein once told The Baltimore Sun that it was he -- not the \"House of Cards\" star -- who owned the home, but Spacey more recently laid claim to it.\n\nCourt records showed he owed a significant sum in back payments, and last summer, a Baltimore Circuit Court judge approved the foreclosure sale of the Oscar-winning actor's pad. Just last month, Spacey spoke with British talk show host Piers Morgan about his millions of dollars of debt from legal bills related to several lawsuits he's fought in the U.S. and in Britain over allegations of sexual misconduct.\n\nThursday's auction, hosted by Towson-based Alex Cooper Auctioneers, had been postponed from a date in mid-June and started around 9:15 a.m., with a suggested opening bid of $1.5 million. No online bidding was allowed, so at least five bidders turned out in person for the multiple properties on auction.\n\nPaul Cooper, the vice president of Alex Cooper Auctioneers, rattled off bidding increments under overcast skies, as those interested in the property gave ever so slight indications of their intent.

It will be a match between Faf du Plessis's Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) and Sam Curran's Punjab Kings (PBKS). Right now, Royal Challengers Bengaluru is in seventh place with just 8 points from 4 wins to their tally and a net run rate of -0.049 on the IPL 2024 points table, and Punjab Kings are in eighth position with 8 points from 4 wins and a net run rate of -0.187.\n\nThe next match between Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) and Punjab Kings (PBKS) in the Indian Premier League (IPL) is crucial for both teams. RCB has improved after a bad start, winning three matches in a row and moving up in the points table. But they still need to win all their remaining games to have a chance at making it to the playoffs. Punjab Kings are in a similar situation, also needing to win to stay in the competition.\n\nThe match is important for both teams as only one can potentially reach the 14-point mark needed for the playoffs. RCB feels confident after their recent wins and a previous victory against Punjab Kings. While Punjab Kings have a slightly better record against RCB in the past, RCB won their last encounter with strong performances from Virat Kohli and Dinesh Karthik.\n\nPrediction: The match between RCB and Punjab Kings will be closely contested, with both teams giving their best to secure a win. RCB's recent form and confidence might give them a slight edge, but Punjab Kings will also fight hard to stay in the competition. It could be an exciting match with RCB having a better chance of winning.\n\nBefore their upcoming match on Thursday, May 9th, PBKS and RCB have played against each other 32 times. Punjab Kings has won slightly more matches against RCB in the IPL, winning 17 out of 32 matches compared to RCB's 15 victories. However, in their most recent clash this season, RCB won thanks to strong performances by Virat Kohli, who scored 77 runs, and Dinesh Karthik, who made 28 runs off just 10 balls.\n\nBat 1st: Virat Kohli, Will Jacks, Rajat Patidar, Faf du Plessis (c), Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Cameron Green, Swapnil Singh, Mohammed Siraj, Vyshak Vijaykumar, Karn Sharma\n\nBowl 1st: Dinesh Karthik, Faf Du Plessis, Virat Kohli, Anuj Rawat, Will Jacks, Dinesh Karthik, Tom Curran, Glenn Maxwell, Cameron Green, Mohammed Siraj, Mayank Dagar, and Raja Patidar\n\nImpact Players Option: Faf Du Plessis, Anuj Rawat, Glenn Maxwell\n\nBat 1st: Jonny Bairstow, Prabhsimran Singh, Shashank Singh, Rilee Rossouw, Jitesh Sharma (wk), Sam Curran (c), Rahul Chahar, Ashutosh Sharma, Harpreet Brar, Kagiso Rabada, Harshal Patel.\n\nIn the upcoming match between Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) and Punjab Kings in the Indian Premier League (IPL), both teams are fighting to stay in the tournament. RCB has been doing better lately, winning three games in a row and moving up to seventh place. But they still need to win all their remaining matches to make it to the playoffs. Punjab Kings are in a similar situation, also needing to win their matches to stay in the competition.\n\nThe match between RCB and Punjab Kings is crucial because only one team can potentially reach the 14-point mark needed to advance. RCB has a bit of an edge because they won their previous match against the Punjab Kings this season.\n\nThe pitch at the HPCA Stadium, where the match will be played, has been favouring the team batting first. Spinners are expected to play an important role, so both teams may include at least two specialist spinners in their lineup. A strong batting lineup will also be important because the pitch tends to produce high scores.\n\nKey players to watch out for are Virat Kohli, who has been in great form and scored well against Punjab Kings before, Shashank Singh, who has been consistent and played important innings for Punjab Kings, and Harshal Patel, who has been taking wickets consistently and strengthening Punjab Kings' bowling attack.\n\nOut of the 12 IPL matches played at the HPCA Stadium, 58.33% of them were won by the team batting first, while the remaining 41.67% were won by the chasing team.\n\nThe HPCA Stadium in Dharamshala has hosted 12 IPL matches since March 2010. It's known for its pitches that offer good bounce, which helps fast bowlers, and also provides opportunities for batsmen to score runs. The average score in the first innings is quite high, around 179 runs. However, in the recent match between CSK and Punjab Kings, CSK scored 167 runs in their innings. Spinners played a significant role in that game, with Rahul Chahar and Ravindra Jadeja both taking three wickets each.\n\nAccording to Accuweather.com, there's a 51% chance of rainfall at 5 PM IST today. Whether the thunderstorm will continue until the match begins remains to be seen.\n\nShikhar Dhawan (c), Matthew Short, Prabhsimran Singh, Jitesh Sharma, Sikandar Raza, Rishi Dhawan, Liam Livingstone, Atharva Taide, Arshdeep Singh, Nathan Ellis, Sam Curran, Kagiso Rabada, Harpreet Brar, Rahul Chahar, Harpreet Bhatia, Vidwath Kaverappa, Shivam Singh, Harshal Patel, Chris Woakes, Ashutosh Sharma, Vishwanath Pratap Singh, Shashank Singh, Tanay Thyagarajann, Prince Choudhary, Rilee Rossouw.\n\nRoyal Challengers Bengaluru: Faf du Plessis (c), Glenn Maxwell, Virat Kohli, Rajat Patidar, Anuj Rawat, Dinesh Karthik, Suyash Prabhudessai, Will Jacks, Mahipal Lomror, Karn Sharma, Manoj Bhandage, Mayank Dagar, Vijaykumar Vyshak, Akash Deep, Mohammed Siraj, Reece Topley, Himanshu Sharma, Rajan Kumar, Cameron Green, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Tom Curran, Lockie Ferguson, Swapnil Singh, Saurav Chauhan.\n\nDisclaimer: The Dream 11 team predictions provided in this article are based on analysis of recent player performance, team form, past encounters, and expert opinions.

The night match is scheduled to begin at 7:30 PM IST.\n\nIn Thursday's showdown, the victor will cling onto their faint playoff aspirations, while the vanquished will suffer the same fate as the Mumbai Indians, facing elimination from this season's race.\n\nRCB's transformation between their initial six matches and their most recent five is akin to witnessing two different teams on the field. Since their narrow defeat to the Sunrisers Hyderabad, falling short by just 25 runs in a pursuit of 288, RCB's batting lineup has undergone a remarkable revival. Their lowest total in the last five encounters stands at 152, achieved while chasing down 148 against the Gujarat Titans in Bengaluru. A resurgence led by Faf du Plessis finding form and a solid top four, featuring the likes of Virat Kohli, du Plessis, Will Jacks, and Rajat Patidar.\n\nDu Plessis has notched up two half-centuries in the recent five matches, contributing to RCB's increased scoring rate in the powerplay, soaring to 12.3 runs per over compared to their earlier 8.27. This shift has allowed for Jacks and Patidar to anchor the innings during the middle overs, capitalizing on additional risks taken in the initial phase. With more adept spin-hitters at their disposal, RCB has upped their scoring rate to 11.03 in the middle overs since April 15, a stark improvement from their 8.41 in previous matches.\n\nThis batting resurgence has also liberated Kohli, who has maintained consistency throughout IPL 2024, evident in his surge in strike rate from 141.77 in the first six games to 158.15 in the recent five matches. These factors set the stage for a crucial clash against PBKS at an opportune moment for RCB.\n\nPBKS have proven to be formidable away contenders but have struggled to find their footing at home. Having rotated between three home venues - Mohali, Dharamsala, and the latest addition Mullanpur - in the past two seasons, PBKS' home discomfort is apparent. In IPL 2024, they have secured victories in three out of five away fixtures but have stumbled to only one win in six encounters at home. With the lowest home win percentage over the last two seasons, PBKS' final showdown at Dharamsala in IPL 2024 against RCB holds significant weight.\n\nPBKS vs RCB Live Streaming Details\n\nThe IPL 2024 match between Punjab Kings and Royal Challengers Bengaluru will be broadcast live on the Star Sports Network. Viewers can also watch the live stream of the PBKS vs RCB match on the JioCinema app and website.\n\nPBKS vs RCB Toss\n\nIn Dharamsala, captains winning the toss have opted to bowl in the three IPL matches since last year and only once have gone on to win the match. However, the trend to opt for bowling first may continue in this match as well because the teams have preferred to chase rather than defend in IPL 2024.\n\nPBKS vs RCB Pitch Report\n\nDharamsala has introduced a groundbreaking 'hybrid pitch', marking a first in India. Engineered to deliver uniform bounce and sustain its quality over the duration of the match, this innovative pitch sets a new standard in cricket surfaces.\n\nPBKS vs RCB Weather Conditions\n\nBy evening, Dharamsala anticipates a temperature hovering at approximately 20 degrees Celsius, with a perceived temperature of 18 degrees Celsius. Humidity is projected to settle around 44%. Although there's a 61% probability of rain throughout the day, the evening forecasts no precipitation.\n\nPBKS vs RCB Head to Head\n\nThroughout IPL history, Punjab Kings (PBKS) and Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) have battled it out on 32 occasions. Among these showdowns, PBKS emerged triumphant in 17 matches, while Bangalore clinched victories in 15 encounters. PBKS posted their highest total against the Royal Challengers, amassing a formidable 232 runs, whereas RCB's highest tally against PBKS stands at 226 runs.\n\nPBKS vs RCB Playing 11 Prediction\n\nShikhar Dhawan remains absent from the squad's journey to Dharamsala, suggesting that they will likely maintain the same line-up that propelled them to victory in two out of their last three matches.\n\nAfter a prolonged hiatus, Glenn Maxwell made his comeback in RCB's triumph over the Gujarat Titans in Ahmedabad, chipping in with a crucial wicket while remaining untested with the bat. However, in the subsequent encounter, he endured a duck, extending his barren spell. RCB faces the dilemma of persisting with Maxwell or contemplating the inclusion of Reece Topley, whose array of variations could prove effective on a surface favoring slower bowlers, as seen in the PBKS-CSK match. The probable Impact Sub swap appears to be between Patidar and Yash Dayal once again.\n\nRCB Probable 11: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (capt), Will Jacks, Rajat Patidar, Glenn Maxwell, Cameron Green, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Swapnil Singh, Karn Sharma, Mohammed Siraj, Vijaykumar Vyshak, Yash Dayal (12th Man)\n\nPBKS Probable 11: Prabhsimran Singh, Jonny Bairstow, Rilee Rossouw, Shashank Singh, Jitesh

Both sides are under pressure because the remaining games are all must-win scenarios. Punjab has an additional incentive this season to exact revenge for their previous defeat to Bengaluru. With an equal amount of victories and losses, both teams are tied for the most points. In the standings, Bengaluru surpasses the hosts thanks to their higher net run rate. Punjab's season has been uneventful, with brief periods of optimism interspersed by defeat when it counted most.\n\nBengaluru is the only team they have defeated in the first month of this edition, making their victory over Punjab earlier in the tournament noteworthy. Due to the fact that both clubs want to secure their spots in the standings, this game is especially important.

Its elevated position above sea level promises swing for the new ball, encouraging pace bowlers who can take advantage of such circumstances. It has historically hosted high-scoring matches. But because there's not much turn, spinners usually don't get much help here. As such, it is set up to be an excellent batting surface, providing the pacers with the occasional bounce and movement.\n\nIPL 2024, PBKS vs RCB Predicted Playing XI\n\nPunjab Kings (PBKS) Predicted XI Team\n\nJonny Bairstow, Rilee Rossouw, Shashank Singh, Sam Curran (c), Jitesh Sharma (wk), Ashutosh Sharma, Harpreet Brar, Harshal Patel, Rahul Chahar, Kagiso Rabada, Arshdeep Singh\n\nRoyal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) Predicted XI Team\n\nVirat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Will Jacks, Glenn Maxwell, Cameron Green, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Swapnil Singh, Karn Sharma, Mohammed Siraj, Vyshak Vijay Kumar\n\nIPL 2024, PBKS vs RCB Full Squad\n\nPunjab Kings (PBKS) Full Squad\n\nShikhar Dhawan (c), Matthew Short, Prabhsimran Singh, Jitesh Sharma, Sikandar Raza, Rishi Dhawan, Liam Livingstone, Atharva Taide, Arshdeep Singh, Nathan Ellis, Sam Curran, Kagiso Rabada, Harpreet Brar, Rahul Chahar, Harpreet Bhatia, Vidwath Kaverappa, Shivam Singh, Harshal Patel, Chris Woakes, Ashutosh Sharma, Vishwanath Pratap Singh, Shashank Singh, Tanay Thyagarajann, Prince Choudhary, Rilee Rossouw\n\nRoyal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) Full Squad\n\nFaf du Plessis (c), Glenn Maxwell, Virat Kohli, Rajat Patidar, Anuj Rawat, Dinesh Karthik, Suyash Prabhudessai, Will Jacks, Mahipal Lomror, Karn Sharma, Manoj Bhandage, Mayank Dagar, Vijaykumar Vyshak, Akash Deep, Mohammed Siraj, Reece Topley, Himanshu Sharma, Rajan Kumar, Cameron Green, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Tom Curran, Lockie Ferguson, Swapnil Singh, Saurav Chauhan", "source": {"uri": "republicworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Republic World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "republic_world_digital@republicworld.com", "name": "Republic World Digital", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himachal_Pradesh_Cricket_Association_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_run_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Net run rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket-keeper", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicket-keeper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arshdeep_Singh_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arshdeep Singh (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Jacks", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Will Jacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Curran", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Curran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "K.

RCB (-0.049) have a slightly better NRR than PBKS (-0.187), but its all about winning big for them as they sit 7th and 8th in the table respectively.\n\nThe good thing for RCB is that they have won three matches in a row and have suddenly found some positive momentum in these latter stages. For Punjab, a defeat against CSK in the last match halted their winning run, and now a swift return to victory is required for them.\n\nPBKS vs RCB Match 59 Team News, Injury Update\n\nPunjab Kings will be buoyant of the fact that captain Shikhar Dhawan may return for this match after his injury absence. Apart from that, the Kings may drop Rilee Rossouw and bring in Liam Livingstone for this match. The Indian duo of Shashank Singh and Ashutosh Sharma are certain to start, while Rahul Chahar will also be in the team after his fantastic outing in the last match.\n\nRoyal Challengers Bengaluru are suddenly looking dangerous and playing with intent and poise. In terms of team selection, they may continue with the same set of foreigners. Swapnil Singh played his first match in the last one and looks likely to keep his place.

They have 8 points.\n\nPBKS squad: Sam Curran (C), Jonny Bairstow, Rilee Rossouw, Shashank Singh, Jitesh Sharma, Ashutosh Sharma, Harpreet Brar, Harshal Patel, Rahul Chahar, Kagiso Rabada, Arshdeep Singh, Prabhsimran Singh, Harpreet Singh Bhatia, Tanay Thyagarajan, Vidhwath Kaverappa, Rishi Dhawan, Liam Livingstone, Shikhar Dhawan, Chris Woakes, Atharva Taide, Nathan Ellis, Shivam Singh, Prince Choudhary, Vishwanath Singh.\n\nFaf du Plessis leads RCB in IPL 2024. After too many losses at the start, RCB has bounced back in the last few games. They have won their last three clashes. Out of 11 games, RCB has won 4 matches and lost 7. RCB has 8 points.\n\nRCB Squad: Shubman Gill (C), Wriddhiman Saha, Sai Sudharsan, David Miller, Shahrukh Khan, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Manav Suthar, Noor Ahmad, Mohit Sharma, Joshua Little, Sandeep Warrier, Vijay Shankar, Jayant Yadav, Darshan Nalkande, Sharath BR, Azmatullah Omarzai, Ravisrinivasan Sai Kishore, Matthew Wade, Umesh Yadav, Kane Williamson, Abhinav Manohar, Kartik Tyagi, Spencer Johnson, Sushant Mishra.\n\nAlso Read: \"It doesn't matter if Virat Kohli is in those 1st 6 overs..\"- Matthew Hayden's fresh tirade\n\nVirat Kohli owns a stunning form and will open the innings for RCB.

Kagiso Rabada is his teammate from South Africa and will look to dismiss him.\n\nJonny Bairstow is a hard-hitting batter for Punjab Kings and will play a big role as an opener. Mohammed Siraj is a powerful pacer for RCB and will look to crush him with his tactics.\n\nPunjab Kings- Shashank Singh, Jonny Bairstow, and Prabhsimran Singh are key batters for the side. Harshal Patel, Arshdeep Singh, and Sam Curran are leading wicket-takers.\n\nRoyal Challengers Bengaluru- Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis, and Dinesh Karthik are the most successful batters for RCB in IPL 2024.

However, seamers and pacers also get benefits.\n\nIn the previous clash in IPL 2024, RCB stunned PBKS by 4 wickets. Now, they will look to make it two in two.

Kohli hit seven fours and six maximums at a strike rate of 195.74 in his vintage knock which also took him past the 600-run mark in the IPL 2024. He was ably supported by Rajat Patidar's 55, his fourth fifty of this season as RCB posted 241/7, their fourth-highest total in the tournament. RCB Funny Memes and Jokes Go Viral After Royal Challengers Bengaluru Secure Dominating Win Over Punjab Kings in IPL 2024.\n\nFor PBKS, pacer Harshal Patel took 3-38, taking his IPL 2024 wickets tally to 20, while debutant fast-bowler Vidwath Kaverappa took 2-36, including a terrific Power-play spell, though the hosts were sloppy in their fielding. PBKS had a glimmer of hope to overhaul the total via a 65-run partnership between Jonny Bairstow and Rilee Rossouw. Though Rossouw made 61, none of PBKS's batters stood up as they were bowled out for 181 in 17 overs.\n\nKohli could have been out on the third ball of the innings if Ashutosh Sharma had not dropped a difficult catch at point off Kaverappa. Faf du Plessis got going with back-to-back fours through extra-cover off Kaverappa, who had the last laugh by having the RCB skipper hole out to deep point in the third over. In the same over of Kaverappa, Kohli got another life on 10 when Rilee Rossouw dropped another difficult catch at extra cover. Kohli and Will Jacks hit three boundaries collectively to take 16 runs off Sam Curran in the fourth over before Kaverappa had the latter sweeping to short fine leg.\n\nBut Kaverappa had to see the third catch dropped by PBKS off his bowling, as Patidar's chance was shelled by Harshal Patel at deep fine leg while on zero. Patidar smacked Harshal for three boundaries in a 12-run sixth over, before he and Kohli took a six each in Kaverappa's final over. Patidar stepped up the attack against spinners by smacking Rahul Chahar for three sixes in his first over and was given another life when Jonny Bairstow was late to react to a catch behind. He would get his fifty in 21 balls when he pulled Sam Curran over short fine-leg for six, before nicking behind to keeper off the left-arm pacer.\n\nFollowing a 33-minute rain and hail interruption, Kohli got his fifty in 32 balls with a vintage flick through mid-wicket for four off Liam Livingstone. He continued to nail authoritative boundaries mixed with nonchalance and vintage stroke-play to the delight of fans chanting 'Kohli, Kohli'. But Kohli fell eight runs short of his second century this season when he sliced an Arshdeep Singh delivery to deep third man in the 18th over. Dinesh Karthik hit three quick boundaries before holing out to long-on off Harshal, who castled Mahipal Lomror and had Cameron Green miscuing in the deep on the last ball of the innings.\n\nRCB had a superb start to their defence as Swapnil Singh trapped Prabhsimran Singh lbw on the fourth ball. Bairstow hit four boundaries and a six in his 16-ball 27, before falling to Lockie Ferguson on the second last ball of the powerplay. Rossouw kept PBKS in the hunt by smashing boundaries at will to hit his first fifty of the competition, which he reached by thumping a six over Green's head. After getting some attention from the physio for an injury, Rossouw holed out to long off against Karn Sharma, who went on to castle Jitesh Sharma.\n\nThough Shashank Singh was smashing boundaries, it wasn't enough for PBKS as Liam Livingstone was caught at cover for a duck, off a leading edge against Swapnil. Shashank himself needed attention from the physio for a shoulder injury and was run out by a direct hit fired by Kohli from deep mid-wicket on the very next ball, falling for 19-ball 37. After that, PBKS never recovered as Ashutosh was trapped lbw by Siraj, followed by Ferguson knocking over Sam Curran. Siraj came back to take out the remaining two wickets and finish with 3-43 as RCB managed another clinical win.\n\nPBKS vs RCB IPL 2024 Stat Highlights\n\n# 10th successive season PBKS has failed to make it to the Play Offs\n\n#PBKS are the only ones with a sub 40 win% at their home venue across the last two seasons\n\n#Second 50+ score for Rossouw in IPL.

The PBKS vs RCB encounter will take place on May 09, 2024, at the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium in Dharamsala.\n\nThe hosts are coming into this game on the back of their 28-run defeat against the Chennai Super Kings in the same ground, where they failed to chase down a target of 168. Punjab, who began their 17th season of the IPL campaign on the back of a four-wicket win over the Delhi Capitals (DC), faced two back-to-back defeats since then.\n\nAfter their firing victory over the Gujarat Titans (GT), thanks to the youngster Shashank Singh's spectacular knock of 61* in 29 balls, they slipped in four consecutive games in a row, only to find themselves far away from the playoff race.\n\nHowever, their 263-run record chase against the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) and a seven-wicket win over Chennai gave them some relief. Before the PBKS vs RCB clash, they are now in the eighth position with four wins in 11 games at a net run rate of -0.187.\n\nOn the flip of the coin, Royal Challengers Bengaluru too are going through the same route. After their first win of the season against Punjab, they lost six consecutive fixtures, one of which was a heart-breaking one-wicket defeat against Kolkata.\n\nAlso Read: 'Rohit Sharma Is No Longer Captain'- Shaun Pollock On India's T20 World Cup Captain\n\nAt the moment, they are walking on a line of string, with three successive wins before the PBKS vs RCB face-off. The last victory over Gujarat by four wickets was a mixed-bag feeling, as from a strong position, RCB lost six wickets for 25 runs.\n\nA defeat for any of the teams in this PBKS vs RCB encounter will eliminate them from the IPL 2024, while the winner can feel their breath going.\n\nAlso Read: Rahmanullah Gurbaz To Rejoin KKR Squad Soon; Reveals Reason For His Break From IPL 2024\n\nPBKS Probable

The match is scheduled to be played at the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Stadium in Dharamsala on Thursday (May 9).\n\nThis article will provide everything you need about the IPL 2024 match between PBKS and RCB. You'll get the PBKS vs RCB Dream11 prediction, match preview, points table update, head-to-head comparison, match details, weather and pitch report, fantasy cricket stats and our PBKS vs RCB match prediction.\n\nThe equation for both PBKS and RCB is very simple - the winning team lives to fight another day while the losing team will be knocked out of the IPL 2024 playoffs race. It's a do-or-die game for both PBKS and RCB. Even a win in the upcoming game will not really put the winning team in the driver's seat but will keep the playoffs hopes alive.\n\nA defeat, on the other hand, will be enough for the losing team to be eliminated from IPL 2024. PBKS are coming into this game after a dismal defeat against Chennai Super Kings in the last game in Dharamsala. Set a target of 168 runs, PBKS finished their innings on 139/9 to lose the game by 28 runs.\n\nThe win was another reminder of PBKS' terrible form at home this season. While they have won three of their five away games in IPL 2024, they have managed to win only one of their six games so far. After struggling in Mullanpur, PBKS must have hoped for a change in fortunes when they took on CSK in Dharamsala but the venue change made little difference.\n\nPBKS will be desperate to win the upcoming game but it won't be easy against a team that is very high on confidence right now. After managing to win just one of their first eight games, RCB have won their last three games and will be looking to make the most of the momentum.\n\nRCB have played with more freedom in recent days and will be looking to come up with a similar performance. RCB's first win of the season came against PBKS and they will be fancying their chances of beating them again.\n\nBoth PBKS and RCB have four wins and seven losses so far and are separated by net run-rate at this stage. While RCB are the seventh spot, PBKS are just below them in the IPL 2024 points table.\n\nPrabhsimran Singh, Jonny Bairstow, Rilee Rossouw, Shashank Singh, Sam Curran(c), Jitesh Sharma(w), Ashutosh Sharma, Harpreet Brar, Harshal Patel, Rahul Chahar, Kagiso Rabada, Arshdeep Singh, Harpreet Singh Bhatia, Tanay Thyagarajan, Vidhwath Kaverappa, Rishi Dhawan, Liam Livingstone, Shikhar Dhawan, Chris Woakes, Atharva Taide, Nathan Ellis, Shivam Singh, Prince Choudhary, Vishwanath Singh\n\nVirat Kohli, Faf du Plessis(c), Will Jacks, Rajat Patidar, Glenn Maxwell, Cameron Green, Dinesh Karthik(w), Swapnil Singh, Karn Sharma, Mohammed Siraj, Yash Dayal, Vijaykumar Vyshak, Mahipal Lomror, Anuj Rawat, Suyash Prabhudessai, Akash Deep, Himanshu Sharma, Reece Topley, Tom Curran, Lockie Ferguson, Mayank Dagar, Alzarri Joseph, Manoj Bhandage, Saurav Chauhan, Rajan Kumar\n\nHere are the playing XI of PBKS vs RCB for the 58th match of IPL 2024:\n\nJonny Bairstow, Rilee Rossouw, Shashank Singh, Sam Curran(c), Jitesh Sharma(w), Ashutosh Sharma, Harpreet Brar, Harshal Patel, Rahul Chahar, Kagiso Rabada, Arshdeep Singh\n\nPBKS impact players:\n\nPrabhsimran Singh, Harpreet Singh Bhatia, Tanay Thyagarajan, Vidhwath Kaverappa, Rishi Dhawan\n\nVirat Kohli, Faf du Plessis(c), Will Jacks, Glenn Maxwell, Cameron Green, Dinesh Karthik(w), Karn Sharma, Swapnil Singh, Mohammed Siraj, Yash Dayal, Vijaykumar Vyshak\n\nRCB impact players:\n\nAnuj Rawat, Mahipal Lomror, Akash Deep, Rajat Patidar, Suyash Prabhudessai\n\nTop Picks for PBKS vs RCB Fantasy Cricket Tips:\n\nBudget Picks for PBKS vs RCB Fantasy Cricket Tips:\n\nRCB will start the game as favourites and are expected to beat PBKS.

The upcoming game between PBKS and RCB is a night fixture and the dew factor will come into play which poses a challenge for the bowlers.\n\nRecent form:\n\nPunjab Kings: Lost, Won, Won, Lost, Lost\n\nRoyal Challengers Bengaluru: Won, Won, Won, Lost, Lost\n\nPBKS vs RCB, IPL 2024, Match 58 Probable Winners:\n\nRoyal Challengers Bengaluru are expected to win this match.\n\nWhat is the Expected, Probable Playing XIs for PBKS vs RCB, IPL 2024, Match 58?\n\nPunjab Kings\n\nPrabhsimran Singh / Arshdeep Singh, Jonny Bairstow, Rilee Rossouw, Shashank Singh, Sam Curran (c), Jitesh Sharma (wk), Ashutosh Sharma, Harpreet Brar, Harshal Patel, Rahul Chahar, Kagiso Rabada\n\nRoyal Challengers Bengaluru\n\nVirat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Will Jacks, Rajat Patidar / Yash Dayal, Glenn Maxwell, Cameron Green, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Swapnil Singh, Karn Sharma, Mohammed Siraj, Vyshak Vijaykumar\n\nInjury Updates:\n\nShikhar Dhawan is still nursing an injury and he is likely to be available for Punjab Kings' final two matches.\n\nWhat are the Fantasy Cricket Top Picks, Players for PBKS vs RCB, IPL 2024, Match 58?\n\nTop Pick - Batter\n\nVirat Kohli scored 27 balls 42 against Gujarat Titans and gave a befitting reply for the critics who made a statement on his strike rate. He is the current Orange Cap holder in the IPL 2024, scoring 542 runs in 11 matches at an average of 67.75 with the best score of 113*.\n\nTop Pick - All-Rounder\n\nSam Curran hasn't played to his huge price tag but provides the balance that the Punjab Kings asked for. In 11 matches, he picked up 13 wickets with the best figures of 3 for 28 and struck 185 runs in 10 innings.\n\nTop Pick - Bowler\n\nRahul Chahar was the show stopper with the ball for Punjab Kings in the last two matches, picking up 5 wickets with the best figures of 3 for 23.\n\nTop Pick - Wicketkeeper\n\nPrabhsimran Singh looks in great nick at the top of the order for Punjab Kings. His last four innings scores are 30, 13, 54 and 35.\n\nX-Factor:\n\nShashank Singh has turned out to be the main man for Punjab Kings in the middle order. He scored valuable runs in the tournament, hammering 315 runs in 11 matches at an average of 63.\n\nWhat are the Fantasy Suggested teams for PBKS vs RCB, IPL 2024, Match 58?\n\n1. Jonny Bairstow, Prabhsimran Singh, Virat Kohli (c), Faf du Plessis, Shashank Singh, Rajat Patidar, Sam Curran (vc), Will Jacks, Harshal Patel, Mohammed Siraj, Rahul Chahar\n\n2. Jonny Bairstow, Prabhsimran Singh, Virat Kohli, Shashank Singh (vc), Rajat Patidar, Sam Curran, Will Jacks (c), Cameron Green, Harshal Patel, Arshdeep Singh, Yash Dayal\n\nPre-Match Analysis:\n\nPunjab Kings who found their form with the bat in the away wins over Kolkata Knight Riders and Chennai Super Kings didn't go well when they returned to their second home Dharamsala and went down against Chennai Super Kings by 28 runs, failing to chase the modest 167. The bowlers put up a clinical show earlier where Rahul Chahar and Harshal Patel stood out picking up 3 wickets apiece. It's disappointing to see the batters turn out as they could only make 139 at the end of the 20 overs. With playoffs fast approaching they must win their remaining 3 matches to stay in the hunt. Currently, they are placed 8th in the standings with 8 points. Shikhar Dhawan is still recovering from injury and might be fit to play the final two league games.\n\nRoyal Challengers Bengaluru might have returned to form at the wrong time but 3 back to back wins under their belt gave them the slightest of playoff hopes with 3 matches in hand. Thumping away victories over Sunrisers and Titans reignited their confidence and the follow-up home win over Titans even made the difference for their self-belief as they are dreaming of playoff qualification which is far away from now. The batting collapse in the middle order didn't make any impact against Gujarat Titans as they got home with 38 balls to spare with 4 wickets in hand. As of now, they are placed 7th in the table with 8 points.", "source": {"uri": "in.ign.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IGN India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The 58th game of the tournament, which will also be a virtual eliminator, is taking place at the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium in Dharamsala.\n\nThis is the second time that Punjab Kings (PBKS) and Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) are facing off each other in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024. In the first leg of the fixture, the Faf du Plessis-led side won the game by 4 wickets in what was a thriller. But overall, Punjab have the upper hand as they have won 17 matches over the opposition, who have 15 wins.\n\nThe game between PBKS and RCB will be a knockout game for both teams. The loser of the game will be eliminated from the IPL 2024 and will join Mumbai Indians, who got knocked out after Sunrisers Hyderabad beat Lucknow Super Giants in the 57th game of the tournament in Hyderabad.\n\nCurrently, RCB are 7th on the points table with 4 wins and 7 defeats from the 11 games in the IPL 2024. They have 8 points under their belt. On the other hand, PBKS are 8th on the points table with the same number of wins and defeats in 11 games.\n\nRCB will be high on confidence entering into the game. They have played a magnificent brand of cricket in the last few games they have played and have won three matches on the trot. Punjab Kings on the other hand had a good run until the last game, where they suffered a thrashing loss to Chennai Super Kings.\n\nThe game between PBKS and RCB will be extremely crucial in the context of the game. Whoever wins the game will stay alive for the playoffs spot. With both the teams being in decent touch in the last few games, it promises to be an enthralling game.\n\nPunjab Kings skipper Sam Curran won the toss and opted to field first in the game against RCB. The skipper stated that they wanted to put pressure on the opposition and talked about the combination of the team. Speaking at the toss, he explained:\n\n\"Going to bowl. Looks like they've watered the wicket a bit, might be something early on. Looking to put RCB under pressure early. With the side we've picked today, looking to take wickets with the new ball. Pretty simple for us now - need a few results to go for us and win our remaining games. Livingstone comes in for Rabada. Our strength is our batting.\"\n\nFaf du Plessis on the other hand also expressed his desire to field first in the game against PBKS. He also stated that they want to focus on playing good cricket. He added:\n\n\"Would've done the same. Been a great turnaround for us. Last few games we've been clinical. Focus remains the same, not too much on the table, just the way we want to play. Maxwell out for Lockie Ferguson.\"\n\nPBKS: Harpreet Brar, Tanay Thyagarajan, Rishi Dhawan, Jitesh Sharma, Nathan Ellis\n\nRCB: Anuj Rawat, Suyash Prabhudessai, Vijaykumar Vyshak, Yash Dayal, Mayank

PBKS is in ninth place, with four wins and eight losses, a total of eight points. Punjab is out of the tournament.\n\nIn the run-chase of 242 runs, Punjab Kings lost their opener Prabhsimran Singh early for just six runs in four balls to Swapnil Singh after he trapped him leg-before-wicket.\n\nRilee Rossoue was the next up on the crease and made pressure on bowlers right from ball one, smashing Swapnil for two fours on his first two balls.\n\nOpener Jonny Bairstow and Rossouw eventually caught momentum and started to hit RCB bowlers all over the park. Rossouw looted 18 runs from Mohammed Siraj's over number four, smashing a six and three fours.\n\nWith a cracking six at the start of the next over by Yash Dayal, PBKS reached their 50-run mark in 4.1 overs. Dayal's over gave away 16 runs, including four each by Rossouw and Bairstow and six by Bairstow.\n\nBairstow tried to end the powerplay on high, smashing Lockie Ferguson for two fours, but a diving catch by Faf Du Plessis ended his innings at 27 in 16 balls, with four boundaries and a six. PBKS was 71/2 in 5.5 overs.\n\nRossouw and Shashank Singh continued their innings unfazed, with Rossouw being the key aggressor. Rossouw reached his second fifty in just 21 balls, with eight fours and two sixes.\n\nPBKS reached their 100-run mark in 8.2 overs with a crackling boundary through the cover region by Rossouw. However, the bowler Karn Sharma had a last laugh, removing Rossouw for 61 in 27 balls, with nine fours and three sixes. Will Jacks complete a fine catch. PBKS was 107/3 in nine overs.\n\nAt the end of 10 overs, PBKS was 114/3, with Shashank Singh (18*) and Jitesh Sharma (1*) unbeaten.\n\nRCB bowlers solidified their hold on the game, getting Jitesh Sharma (5) dismissed by Karn and Liam Livingstone dismissed by Swapnil for a duck. Half of the PBKS team was back in the hut for 126 runs in 11.2 overs.\n\nShashank tried to keep the run-rate going and his team's hopes alive. PBKS reached the 150-run mark in 13.3 overs. However, Shashank was run out by Virat for 37 in 19 balls, with four boundaries and two sixes. PBKS was 151/6 in 13.4 overs.\n\nSiraj then soon helped RCB get the big wicket of Ashutosh Sharma, trapping him lbw for just eight runs. PBKS was 164/7 in 15 overs.\n\nFerguson got Sam Curran cleaned up for 22in 16 balls, with two fours and Harshal was dismissed by Siraj for zero. PBKS was 174/9 in 16.1 overs.\n\nSiraj got his third wicket, removing Arshdeep for four runs, with a fine catch from Karn. RCB bundled out PBKS for 181 runs in 17 overs, winning by 60 runs.\n\nSiraj (3/43) was the pick of the bowlers for RCB. Lockie (2/29), Swapnil (2/28) and Karn (2/36) also impressed with the ball.\n\nEarlier, Virat Kohli's fiery 92-run knock powered Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) to 241/7 against Punjab Kings (PBKS) in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024 at the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium on Thursday.\n\nThe RCB batters displayed a stupendous performance in Dharamsala and gave a solid target in a must-win match in IPL 2024.\n\nAfter winning the toss, Sam Curran's Punjab Kings sent RCB to bat first, however, their decision did not go in their favour.\n\nKohli (92) and Faf du Plessis (9) opened for the visitors. Even though the skipper failed to make a mark in the game but Kohli did not make his absence felt on the crease.\n\nThe RCB openers could only make a partnership of 19 runs after Faf was dismissed by Vidhwath Kaverappa in the third over of the first inning. The Proteas batter smashed just 2 fours at a strike rate of 128.57.\n\nSoon after the first dismissal, RCB lost Will Jacks (12) in the 5th over, when the visitors were at 43/2. Jacks slammed just one four and six.\n\nHowever, Kohli played a 76-run knock partnership with Rajat Patidar (55) who was stupendous on the crease as he slammed 3 fours and 6 sixes during his time on the field.\n\nIn the 10th over, Patidar lost his wicket to Sam Curran. But it did not stop RCB from adding runs on the scoreboard.\n\nSoon after replacing Patidar, Cameron Green (46) started hitting. The pair Kohli-Green played a 92-run partnership and helped RCB to cross the 200-run mark in the 18th over.\n\nThe star Indian batter was in his red-hot form but was unlucky to miss his century as he was dismissed in the 18th over by Arshdeep Singh. He hammered 7 fours and 6 sixes at a strike rate of 195.74.\n\nAfter the dismissal of Kohli, RCB started losing wickets quickly.\n\nHarshal Patel was on fire in the final over the first inning as he dismissed Dinesh Karthik (18), Mahipal Lomror (0), and Cameron Green (46) all in one over. However, it was very late, as the RCB batters had already done the destruction and put 241/7 on the scoreboard.\n\nHarshal Patel led the Punjab Kings bowling attack as he picked up three wickets in his four-over spell. Kaverappa bagged 2 wickets. While Arshdeep Singh and Sam Curran took one wicket each in their respective spells.\n\nPBKS need to make 242 runs to win the match against the Bengaluru-based franchise in Dharamsala.\n\nBrief score: Royal Challengers Bengaluru 241/7 (Virat Kohli 92, Rajat Patidar 55, Cameron Green 46; Harshal Patel 3/38) beat Punjab Kings: 181 in 17 overs (Rilee Rossouw 61, Shashank Singh 37, Mohammed Siraj 3/43).

Match 58", "body": "When it comes to the head-to-head records of the PBKS vs RCB clash, the Punjab Kings (PBKS) are slightly ahead of the Royal Challengers Bengaluru with a 17-15 winning margin. However, in their last encounter of this season in Bengaluru, the hosts gained a close victory by four wickets.\n\nThe Bengaluru side hasn't bowled well constantly in the powerplay. Their economy of 9.77 is the third worst among the ten teams in this IPL 2024. They also have picked up the joint second least wickets (15) in this period.\n\nQuite bad their performance have been with the new ball in hand, as going into the PBKS vs RCB encounter, the visitors have conceded 34 sixes in this duration in 11 innings, which is more than three sixes in six overs per innings so far.\n\nPunjab, on the other hand, have been excellent in the time when there are two fielders allowed outside the 30-yard circle. Their economy of 8.82 is the second-best of the IPL 2024 in the powerplay so far. Even though they have kept the opposition batters calm, the bowlers have only 12 in the powerplay bank so far, the worst of the season.\n\nIn the case of conceding sixes, Punjab have done a decent job, giving away just 17 over boundaries in this period in 11 innings, which is the second best of this year till now, going into the PBKS vs RCB clash.\n\nAlso Read: DC vs RR scorecard, IPL 2024, Match 56 highlights: DC keep playoffs hopes alive with hard-fought win\n\nWhich team comes on top in this face-off, will keep their heart rate going, while the team to slip up from that position, may see them getting eliminated from this year's tournament.\n\nPunjab Kings probable XI: Jonny Bairstow, Prabhsimran Singh, Rilee Rossouw/Chris Woakes, Shashank Singh, Sam Curran (c), Jitesh Sharma (wk), Ashutosh Sharma, Harpreet Brar, Harshal Patel, Rahul Chahar, Kagiso Rabada.\n\nImpact Sub: Arshdeep Singh.\n\nRoyal Challengers Bengaluru probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Will Jacks, Rajat Patidar, Glenn Maxwell, Cameron Green, Dinesh Karthik (wk.), Karn Sharma, Swapnil Singh, Mohammad Siraj, Yash Dayal\n\nImpact Sub: Vijaykumar Vyshak.\n\nAlso Read: SRH vs LSG Dream11 Prediction, Match Preview, Points Table, head to Head, Match info, Weather & Pitch report, Fantasy Stats and Match Prediction for Match 57 in IPL 2024\n\nBest Batter Prediction: Virat Kohli\n\nThe former RCB captain has been in tremendous touch coming into the PBKS vs RCB clash, being the highest run-getter of the season with 542 runs in 11 innings at a strike rate of 148.08. He also has smashed 938 IPL runs in 31 innings at a strike rate of close to 130 against the Punjab Kings and may look for another big knock in the competition.\n\nBest Bowler Prediction: Harshal Patel\n\nHarshal Patel used his slow deliveries quite well in the last game at this same ground, with figures of 3/24 in four overs. Going into the PBKS vs RCB clash, he could be a valuable asset given he has spent his time with RCB, and knows the players pretty well.\n\nPBKS vs RCB Match Winner Prediction\n\nBoth teams have made an excellent comeback in this IPL 2024, after a very poor start. But looking at the current form, RCB looks to be slightly ahead going into the PBKS vs RCB encounter.", "source": {"uri": "sportzwiki.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportzwiki"}, "authors": [],

This match is a must-win for both teams as they strive to secure a spot in the playoffs.\n\nCurrently, Punjab Kings are in eighth place with 8 points from 11 matches. Their recent world record for the highest successful run chase in the T20 format, where they chased down 262 runs against Kolkata Knight Riders, was followed by a convincing win over Chennai Super Kings. However, they faced a setback in their second encounter with a 28-run defeat to Ruturaj Gaikwad's side. Now, PBKS must win all their remaining matches to have a chance at reaching the knockout stage.\n\nOn the other hand, Royal Challengers Bengaluru have made a strong comeback in the IPL, securing three consecutive victories after a series of losses earlier in the season. These wins have not only reignited their playoff hopes but also moved Faf du Plessis' side from the bottom to the seventh position in the IPL 2024 standings.\n\nLive Streaming details\n\nThe highly anticipated PBKS vs RCB match is set to take place at HPCA stadium, Dharamsala. The night game is slated to kick off at 7:30 PM IST.\n\nFans can catch all the action of the IPL 2024 showdown between PBKS and RCB live on the Star Sports Network. Additionally, viewers have the option to stream the match live on the JioCinema app and website.\n\nPitch report\n\nDharamshala recently unveiled India's first-ever hybrid pitch, a cutting-edge playing surface engineered to deliver reliable bounce and durability throughout matches.\n\nDuring the most recent IPL 2024 game held at this venue, a low-scoring affair unfolded. Chennai Super Kings (CSK) posted a modest total of 167/9 after their turn at bat. In response, Punjab struggled and were dismissed for just 139 runs in their allotted 20 overs.\n\nWeather report\n\nThe evening weather in Dharamshala is expected to be pleasant, with a temperature of around 20 degrees Celsius and a real feel of 18 degrees Celsius. The humidity level is forecasted to be approximately 44%. Although there is a 61% chance of rain during the day, there is no expectation of rainfall in the evening.\n\nPredicted playing XI\n\nPBKS: Jonny Bairstow, P Simran Singh, Rilee Rossouw, Sam Curran

Even though the skipper failed to make a mark in the game but Kohli did not make his absence felt on the crease.\n\nThe RCB openers could only make a partnership of 19 runs after Faf was dismissed by Vidhwath Kaverappa in the third over of the first inning. The Proteas batter smashed just 2 fours at a strike rate of 128.57.\n\nSoon after the first dismissal, RCB lost Will Jacks (12) in the 5th over, when the visitors were at 43/2. Jacks slammed just one four and six.\n\nHowever, Kohli played a 76-run knock partnership with Rajat Patidar (55) who was stupendous on the crease as he slammed 3 fours and 6 sixes during his time on the field.\n\nIn the 10th over, Patidar lost his wicket to Sam Curran. But it did not stop RCB from adding runs on the scoreboard.\n\nSoon after replacing Patidar, Cameron Green (46) started hitting. The pair Kohli-Green played a 92-run partnership and helped RCB to cross the 200-run mark in the 18th over.\n\nThe star Indian batter was in his red-hot form but was unlucky to miss his century as he was dismissed in the 18th over by Arshdeep Singh. He hammered 7 fours and 6 sixes at a strike rate of 195.74.\n\nAfter the dismissal of Kohli, RCB started losing wickets quickly.\n\nHarshal Patel was on fire in the final over the first inning as he dismissed Dinesh Karthik (18), Mahipal Lomror (0), and Cameron Green (46) all in one over. However, it was very late as the RCB batters already did the destruction and put 241/7 on the scoreboard.\n\nHarshal Patel led the Punjab Kings bowling attack as he picked up three wickets in his four-over spell. Kaverappa bagged 2 wickets. While Arshdeep Singh and Sam Curran took one wicket each in their respective spells.\n\nPBKS need to make 242 runs to win the match against the Bengaluru-based franchise in Dharamsala.\n\nBrief score: Royal Challengers Bengaluru 241/7 (Virat Kohli 92, Rajat Patidar 55, Cameron Green 46; Harshal Patel 3/38) vs Punjab Kings.

Both teams are battling to sustain their dimming hopes of reaching the playoffs.\n\nWith Mumbai Indians (MI) becoming the first team to be knocked out of the final four race, the stakes are higher than ever for the competing teams. The loser of this clash will join MI in the unfortunate category, facing an early exit from the tournament. PBKS, coming off a defeat against CSK, are already grappling with a compromised position in the play-offs race. Meanwhile, RCB enter the field with a vital momentum, boasting a three-match winning streak.\n\nSam Curran, the skipper of PBKS, won the toss and opted to bowl first in this crucial encounter against RCB. Both teams have made a change in their playing XIs. Punjab opted to leave out their esteemed pacer Kagiso Rabada, while RCB sidelined Glenn Maxwell.\n\nAlthough both captains refrained from explicitly mentioning the reasons behind the absence of Rabada and Maxwell, it appears that current form played a significant role. Rabada, who has struggled to make a mark as expected, has only managed to secure 11 wickets in 11 matches with an economy of 8.86. Similarly, Maxwell, known for his explosive batting and handy off-spin, has been underwhelming for RCB, accumulating a mere 36 runs in 8 games and claiming only 5 wickets.\n\nPunjab Kings: Jonny

In this PBKS vs RCB encounter, the team with the victory will keep them alive, while the losing team will end their journey unless something too dramatic happens.\n\nThe Punjab Kings have done a terrific job with the ball in hand during the powerplay. But their batting performance in this period hasn't been satisfactory. The 2014-runners have smashed 543 powerplay runs so far in this competition in 11 innings with a strike rate of 137.12, both of which is the third worst among the ten teams, before the PBKS vs RCB face-off.\n\nThe number of sixes (17) they have nailed in this duration too isn't very positive, compared to what the other teams have. And because they have lost the third most wickets (18) in this period, this has led them to a few bad shows in the middle phase of the 20 overs.\n\nGoing into the PBKS vs RCB fixture, the visitors, the Bengaluru side haven't lost many wickets (16) in this time frame, as their 162.37 strike rate in the powerplay is the fourth-highest, while their 643 runs in the first six overs also sits at the same rank, among all the ten franchises.\n\nAmong those who have played at least 100 balls in the powerplay, Virat Kohli has the third most runs with 272 in 11 innings with a strike rate of 160, while his partner Faf du Plessis has a strike rate of 177.93 in this period. For Punjab, Prabhsimran Singh has been doing the job regularly at the start with a strike rate of nearly 158.\n\nAlso Read: IPL 2024: KKR Flight Diverted To Guwahati And Then Varanasi As Plane Fails

top three of both teams need to be careful about the early swing the bowlers get off the surface.\n\nWhen will the PBKS vs RCB IPL 2024 match begin?\n\nThe 58th clash of the IPL 2024 between the Punjab Kings (PNKS) and the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) will take place at the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium, Dharamsala, on May 08, 2024, at 7:30 pm IST\n\nWhere to watch the

Harpreet Brar and Rahul Chahar gave away a combination of 4/33 in their eight overs. Even though Brar had a poor first and only over in their next game, giving away 19 of the over, Chahar ended with 3/23 in his four overs. However, at this business end of their tournament, they will look to get the services of their captain Shikhar Dhawan back.\n\nFor the last few game, Bengaluru bowlers seemed to get their mojo back. In their last game at home, RCB blew away the Titans for just 147 runs in 19.3 overs, as Mohammad Siraj picked up 2/29 in his four overs. The chance of speed, with variations, and different field placement helped them in the bowling.\n\nAlso Read: 'They Used MS Dhoni's Own Medicine Against Him'- Navjot Singh Sidhu On Master Stroke\n\nThe Punjab side missed some responsibility in their middle order. Once the top order made a tough start, no one stood there for long. Even the bowling in the death over is under a bit of scanner.\n\nJonny Bairstow and Prabhsimran Singh have gifted Punjab a few really good starts in this season. The former has managed 257 runs in 11 innings at an average of 32.12 at a strike rate of 163.69 with a century, and no fifties. Prabhsimran, on the other hand, has managed 251 runs in 11 innings at a strike rate of 156.87. But of them are in the top 25 run-scorers of the league.\n\nOne of the biggest positives for them is Shashank Singh, who has smashed 315 runs in 11 innings at a strike rate of over 165 with a couple of half-centuries. Even though he is the highest run-getter for the hosts before the PBKS vs RCB clash, he is not among the top 20 in the list.\n\nWhile in the bowling department, they have Harshal Patel, who is the second-highest wicket-taker of this IPL 2024, with 17 scalps in 11 innings at an economy of 9.78. Arshdeep Singh has nailed 15 wickets in the same number of innings, but at an economy of 10.06, which is quite on the higher side.\n\nPBKS's line-up vs RCB: Prabhsimran Singh, Jonny Bairstow, Shashank Singh, Rilee Rossouw/ Liam Livingstone, Sam Curran (c), Jitesh Sharma (wk.), Ashutosh Sharma, Harpreet Brar, Rahul Chahar, Kagiso Rabada, Harshal Patel. (Impact Sub: Arshdeep Singh).\n\nBoth the openers Virat Kohli and Faf du Plessis have been in aggressive touch in this IPL 2024 for the Bengaluru franchise. The former captain is the leading run-getter of the season, before the PBKS vs RCB clash, with 542 runs in 11 innings at a strike rate of close to 150 with four fifties and one century.\n\nAlso Read: 'How Do You Fit Him In?'- Josh Hazlewood On Jake Fraser-McGurk T20 World Cup Omission\n\nFaf, after a difficult beginning in this season, has 352 runs in 11 innings at a strike rate of 172.54 with three fifties. Rajat Patidar and Will Jacks have shown their spin game, as the former has 213 runs in this IPL with a strike rate of close to 175.\n\nMohammad Siraj has been inconsistent in this IPL with just eight scalps at an economy of 9.26, while their best bowler going into the PBKS vs RCB encounter still is Yash Dayal with 10 scalps at an economy of 8.89. The spinners need to raise their hands going forward.\n\nRCB's line-up vs PBKS: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Will Jacks, Cameron Green, Rajat Patidar, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk.), Swapnil Singh, Karn Sharma, Mohammad Siraj. (Impact Sub: Yash Dayal)\n\nThe 58th IPL 2024 game of the PBKS vs RCB is set to occur at the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium in Dharamsala.", "source": {"uri": "sportzwiki.com",

With Kagiso Rabada unwell, youngster Vidwath Kaverappa underlined his potential on debut, claiming the wickets of RCB captain Faf du Plessis and Will Jacks, after he was denied a dream start when Ashutosh Sharma dropped Kohli on the third ball of the match.\n\nRELATED: PBKS vs RCB Highlights\n\nKohli got another life in Kaverappa's second over as Rossouw dropped a difficult take. Even before the bowler could come to terms with his misfortune, Harshal Patel put down Patidar (on zero). Those misses went on to hurt Kings.\n\nOnce the two batters settled down, they tore the bowlers apart. Kohli went after the pacers, while Patidar began with three boundaries off Harshal and followed it up with three sixes off leg-spinner Rahul Chahar in the eighth over.\n\nHis sparkling fifty -- his fourth in this edition -- set up a run-fest as a few Kings bowlers conceded at least 12 an over. Patidar then fell to Sam Curran.\n\nRELATED: PBKS vs RCB Match Scorecard\n\nDespite the rain interruption, Kohli remained focused and brought up his fifty with a four off Liam Livingstone. He struck a flurry of boundaries and added 92 for the fourth wicket with Cameron Green before falling eight short of what would have been his 100th ton in all formats.\n\nRilee Rossouw's 27-ball-61 kept the Kings in the hunt. He forged a 65-run second wicket stand with Jonny Bairstow to help the Kings to 75 for two in the Powerplay. But once Rossouw fell to Karn Sharma, RCB bounced back with Mohammed Siraj and Lockie Ferguson claiming quick wickets.\n\nLatest on SportstarPBKS vs RCB, IPL 2024: Royal Challengers Bengaluru live to

Sent into bat by PBKS, RCB posted 241-7 as Virat Kohli led the way with a superb 92 off 47 balls. In the chase, Punjab were bowled out for 181 in 17 overs as Mohammed Siraj claimed 3-43.\n\nKohli set-up Bengaluru's win with a brilliant knock. The RCB opener was dropped twice inside the powerplay and made the opposition pay for their poor fielding efforts.\n\nBengaluru lost skipper Faf du Plessis for 9 as he sliced one off Vidwath Kaverappa towards deep point. Will Jacks fell for 12, mistiming a slower ball from Kaverappa towards short fine leg. Kohli and Rajat Patidar (55 off 23) lifted RCB, adding 76 runs for the third wicket.\n\nBoth batters were in tremendous big-hitting rhythm. Patidar clobbered three fours and six sixes to get to his fifty off 21 balls. He reached the landmark by top-edging a pull off Sam Curran for a maximum. Patidar, however, fell in the same over, nicking a full and wide delivery to the keeper.\n\nA rain interruption did not hamper Kohli's momentum. On resumption, he added 92 runs for the fourth wicket with Cameron Green (46 off 27). Kohli reached a 32-ball fifty by flicking a full ball from Liam Livingstone through midwicket for a boundary. The excellent stand ended when Kohli sliced a full and wide delivery from Arshdeep Singh to deep extra cover, eight short of three figures.\n\nRossouw the lone warrior as PBKS stumble in big chase\n\nChasing 242, Punjab Kings got off to a poor start as Prabhsimran Singh (6) was trapped lbw to Swapnil Singh in the first over. Jonny Bairstow and Rilee Rossouw added 65 for the second wicket at a swift pace.\n\nBairstow (27 off 17), however, fell to a brilliant diving catch by Du Plessis off Lockie Ferguson's bowling as he tried to loft one over the infield. Rossouw (61 off 27) played a terrific knock, smashing nine fours and three sixes. He, however, fell to Karn Sharma with the score at 107, miscuing one to long-on.\n\nJitesh Sharma (5) and Livingstone (0) perished in quick succession after which Kohli ended Shashank Singh's (37 off 19) stay with a brilliant direct hit, running in from deep midwicket. Only the formalities remained after that as PBKS were officially knocked out of IPL 2024.\n\nPBKS vs RCB: Who won Player of the Match in yesterday's IPL 2024 match?\n\nKohli played a superb knock for RCB, narrowly missing out on a hundred. He excelled in the field as well. Patidar contributed another fine fifty. The bowlers put up a good all-round show, sharing the wickets.\n\nFor PBKS, Harshal Patel claimed 3-38, while Rossouw struck a valiant 61.\n\nKohli was named Player of the Match for his wonderful innings that laid the foundation for the team's victory.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "renin_wilben_albert@sportskeeda.com",

They were handed a 60 run-loss by Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB).\n\nThe Punjab-based franchise invited RCB to bat first on a belter of a surface. Initially, PBKS' decision to field first went in their favor as the visitors lost two wickets inside the powerplay overs.\n\nHowever, Virat Kohli and Rajat Patidar staged a fightback for RCB, as they steered the team at a high run-rate. Although, Patidar was dismissed on 55 off 23, Kohli continued his purple patch, striking the ball cleanly to all corners of the park.\n\nKohli missed a well-deserved century, as he was dismissed on 92 off 47, a knock that included seven fours and six sixes. Cameron Green provided a notable contribution of 46 off 27 to lead Bengaluru to a mammoth 241. Harshal Patel impressed by taking three wickets.\n\nIn reply, PBKS lost Prabhsimran Singh (6) in the first over, but the pair of Jonny Bairstow and Rilee Rossouw kept the team in the fight with their hitting prowess.\n\nAs the home team were marching on in the right path, Faf du Plessis plucked a stunning catch to dismiss Bairstow (27). Then, Rossouw dominated the bowlers, but his untimely dismissal resulted in PBKS' slide. The Proteas batter slammed 61 off 27 with nine fours and three sixes.\n\nAlthough, Shashank Singh (37) did well, the other batters couldn't chip in as the team got bundled out for 181. Mohammed Siraj finished with figures of 3/43 off four overs.\n\nWith only four wins in 12 league matches, PBKS are eliminated from the IPL 2024 playoffs race. They will clash with Rajasthan Royals and SunRisers Hyderabad in their final two games. Gujarat Titans have already been eliminated and lie at the bottom of the table.\n\nRCB keep their IPL 2024 playoffs hopes alive\n\nThursday's match between Punjab Kings and Royal Challengers Bengaluru was certainly an eliminator for the race to the IPL 2024 playoffs. With a big 60-run victory, RCB gained crucial two points and boosted their net run-rate.\n\nThey have five wins in 12 league matches and boast a net run-rate of +0.217.

The 58th match of the season holds significant implications for both teams' playoff hopes. The team that emerges victorious will keep their playoff dreams alive, while the losing team may find themselves on the brink of elimination as other teams surge ahead in the race for a playoff spot.\n\nBoth RCB and PBKS are determined to secure a win, knowing that anything less would severely impact their chances of advancing in the tournament. With both teams having won four matches and suffered seven losses in the 11 matches played so far, RCB holds a slight advantage over PBKS due to a superior net run rate, placing them in the 7th position while PBKS sits in 8th.\n\nEach team possesses its own strengths and weaknesses. PBKS has struggled to get significant contributions with the bat from key players such as Rilee Rossouw, Sam Curran, and Jitesh Sharma. On the other hand, RCB's Cameron Green and Glenn Maxwell have yet to perform up to their potential with the bat. The winner of this match will secure the 7th spot in the points table, keeping their playoff hopes alive, while a loss would be a bitter pill to swallow for the defeated team.\n\nMatch Details\n\nPunjab Kings vs Royal Challengers Bengaluru, 58th Match\n\nDate & Time: May 09, 07:30 PM\n\nVenue: Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium, Dharamsala\n\nJitesh Sharma, Dinesh Karthik, Anuj Rawat, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (vc), Glenn Maxwell, Sam Curran (c), Liam Livingstone, Arshdeep Singh, Kagiso Rabada", "source": {"uri": "dnaindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News and Analysis (DNA) India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream11", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dream11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_run_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Net run rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anuj_Rawat", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anuj Rawat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arshdeep_Singh_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arshdeep Singh (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Curran", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Curran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himachal_Pradesh_Cricket_Association_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kagiso_Rabada", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kagiso Rabada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rilee_Rossouw", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rilee Rossouw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinesh_Karthik", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dinesh Karthik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faf_du_Plessis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Faf du Plessis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikhar_Dhawan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shikhar Dhawan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Maxwell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glenn Maxwell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_Livingstone", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liam Livingstone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jitesh_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jitesh Sharma"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/2024/05/08/2634036-untitled-design-2024-05-08t201955.140.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548702", "eventUri": "eng-9548702", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2007-05-09", "textStart": 1532, "textEnd": 1542}], "sentiment": 0.4823529411764707, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

The win over Punjab Kings (PBKS) in the 58th game of the tournament has revived the hopes of the fans their team can still reach the top 4.\n\nPunjab Kings (PBKS) hosted Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) at the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium (HPCA) in Dharamsala. The match between the two teams, which was also a virtual eliminator, took place on Thursday (9th May).\n\nRoyal Challengers Bengaluru were asked to bat first and it was a sensational outing for them. Even though Faf du Plessis (9) and Will Jacks (12) lost their wickets early, it was Virat Kohli's show with the bat at the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium in Dharamsala as he oozed his class with the bat.\n\nRajat Patidar (55) slammed a brutal half-century as well that put Punjab Kings under pressure. He along with Kohli added 76 runs and bailed the team out of trouble when they had two early wickets. After that Cameron Green joined Kohli and the duo did further carnage.\n\nVirat Kohli scored 92 runs, while Green ended with innings of 46 runs, based on their terrific effort with the bat, Royal Challengers Bengaluru posted a gigantic total of 241 runs on the board at the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium in Dharamsala.\n\nPunjab Kings started the chase pretty well even though they lost Prabhsimran Singh early. Jonny Bairstow (27) and Rilee Rossouw (61) kept their team in the hunt. After that, Shashank Singh (37) played vital innings but none of them could play a big hand.\n\nRoyal Challengers Bengaluru bowlers were all over the Punjab Kings batters and bundled them out for 181 runs to win the game by 60. With the win, they kept themselves alive in the Indian Premier League and knocked out opposition from the tournament.\n\nThe win against the Punjab Kings was their 5th win in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024. Win the win they solidified their 7th position at the points table with 10 points under their belt. They also boosted their NRR to +0.217, which might be handy for them going ahead.\n\nTo make it into the playoffs, Royal Challengers Bengaluru will need to win their next two games of the IPL 2024. If they manage to do so they will go to 14 points, which might turn out to be a qualification mark.\n\nBut the road isn't easy for them as apart from winning their next two games, they also need some other results to go their way. For them to qualify, they would want Delhi Capitals Chennai Super Kings, and Lucknow Super Giants, who are also on the 12 points to lose their games.", "source": {"uri": "cricketaddictor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketAddictor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himachal_Pradesh_Cricket_Association_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faf_du_Plessis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Faf du Plessis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prabhsimran_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prabhsimran Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Jacks", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Will Jacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajat_Patidar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rajat Patidar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Capitals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delhi Capitals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rilee_Rossouw", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rilee Rossouw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shashank_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shashank Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chennai Super Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_run_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Net run rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonny_Bairstow", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jonny Bairstow"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Kings_Cribbage", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Kings Cribbage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://static.cricketaddictor.com/images/2024/RCBIPL2024playoffsqualificationscenario.webp?q=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548702", "eventUri": "eng-9548702", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 546, "textEnd": 553}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

The last time these two sides faced each other in Bengaluru, RCB registered a four-wicket victory.\n\nPunjab is currently in the middle of a poor run after losing seven out of their 11 matches. Sam Curran and Co. registered two back-to-back wins against Kolkata Knight Riders and Chennai Super Kings, before losing their previous game to Chennai in the same venue. PBKS and CSK locked horns for the second time this season, earlier this week. The visitors managed to play a controlled inning against the dangerous bowling line-up of PBKS. With decent batting performances from Ruturaj Gaikwad (32) and Daryl Mitchell (30) at the top and a 26 ball-43 from Ravindra Jadeja, the defending champions ended their innings at 167/9. Harshal Patel and Rahul Chahar shared six wickets between them.\n\nComing to the chase, Punjab batters couldn't construct a much-required partnership in the middle, to take their side over the line. Prabhsimran Singh (30) and Shashank Singh (27) were the only notable performers with the bat. All thanks to Jadeja's all-round effort, Chennai managed to register their sixth win of the season.\n\nMeanwhile, RCB won only one out of their first eight games but have managed to win three games on the bounce against Sunrisers Hyderabad and twice against Gujarat Titans. The Faf du Plessis and Co. currently sit at the seventh position in the points table with just eight points in their kitty from 11 games. With three of their league games left in this season, the Bengaluru-based franchise will have to win all their remaining matches and hope that other results also go their way as they look to sneak into the playoffs.\n\nStar batter Virat Kohli is having yet another prolific season, having scored 542 runs from 11 matches at an average of 67.75 and a strike rate of 148.08. He has already hit four half-centuries and a century. The side has also found their other batters contributing with runs. Skipper Faf, from the past few matches, has been seen back at his regular best. English batter Will Jacks, who smashed a century against Gujarat Titans has also shown promise. Glenn Maxwell's form has been a talking point in this season.\n\nMohammed Siraj was expected to be the spearhead of the RCB bowling department but he has been far from his best. In ten matches, he has taken just eight wickets. Yash Dayal, who was picked up in the IPL 2024 auction, has fared slightly better, having taken ten wickets in ten games. Both of them will have an important role to play on Thursday.\n\nPBKS are currently placed at No. 8 on the points table, with four wins in 11 games. Meanwhile, RCB is positioned at No. 7, having registered four wins and seven losses so far in IPL 2024.\n\nThe HPCA Stadium in Dharamshala is known for its pace and bounce, making it a preferred venue for fast bowlers. Ahead of the IPL 2024 season, the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium installed a new hybrid pitch, the first of its kind in India. The team that wins the toss at this venue will likely choose to bowl first, taking advantage of the conducive surface for their bowlers.\n\nPunjab Kings' regular captain Shikhar Dhawan's availability remains uncertain due to an injury, which means Sam Curran might have to lead the team once again. PBKS had won two consecutive matches before losing their previous game against Chennai Super Kings. The batting department has been a major area of concern for the side this season, as apart from Shashank Singh and Ashutosh Sharma, none of the other batters have been consistent throughout the tournament. At this crucial stage of the season, they are unlikely to make changes to their line-up unless faced with unexpected injury concerns.\n\nPredicted XI: Jonny Bairstow, Rilee Rossouw, Sam Curran (C), Jitesh Sharma (WK), Shashank Singh, Ashutosh Sharma, Harpreet Brar, Harshal Patel, Kagiso Rabada, Arshdeep Singh, Rahul Chahar\n\nRCB brought back the struggling Glenn Maxwell into their playing XI, but his performance has been disappointing. Despite being in the seventh position on the points table, the Bengaluru franchise is still mathematically in contention for a playoff spot. The team is currently on a three-match winning streak and will be aiming to extend it to four victories. Unless faced with a last-minute injury, the 2016 finalists are unlikely to make any changes to their playing XI.\n\nPredicted XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (C), Will Jacks, Rajat Patidar, Glenn Maxwell, Cameron Green, Dinesh Karthik (WK), Mahipal Lomror, Karn Sharma, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Siraj", "source": {"uri": "crictracker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricTracker"}, "authors": [],

Fighting for survival in the IPL 2024 at Dharamsala on Thursday, Faf du Plessis and Co. managed to set a challenging total of 241 against Shikhar Dhawan-less PBKS following the Kohli masterclass.\n\nLeading the batting charge of the Royal Challengers Bengaluru, opener Kohli extended his free-scoring run as the former India skipper notched up his sixth half-century of the season. Kohli smashed his half-century off 32 balls after Punjab Kings stand-in skipper Sam Curran invited RCB to bat at Dharamsala. The former RCB skipper was the cynosure of all eyes as chants of 'Kohli, Kohli, Kohli' reverberated around the packed venue in his impressive innings.\n\nALSO READ: PBKS vs RCB Live Score, Punjab Kings vs Royal Challengers Bengaluru\n\nAccelerating the RCB innings after his gritty half-century, Kohli scored 68 off 36 at a strike rate of 176.31 inside the 15 overs. The 35-year-old improved his strike rate to almost 200 when the RCB icon entered the nervous 90s. Though Kohli was eyeing his record-extending century in the rain-curtailed encounter between Punjab and Bengaluru, the batting maestro was stopped in his tracks by speedster Arshdeep Singh in the 17th over. Kohli was dismissed for 92 off 47 balls. The Orange Cap holder batted at a strike rate of 195.74 against Punjab.\n\nThe talismanic batter of the Royal Challengers smoked six sixes and seven fours in his entertaining knock. The leading run-getter in PBKS vs RCB clashes, Kohli completed 1,000 runs against the Punjab Kings in the world's richest T20 tournament. Kohli had scored 938 runs in 31 games before PBKS hosted RCB in Dharamsala. Kohli is the first batter to complete 600 runs in the IPL 2024. The ex-RCB skipper also joined Lucknow Super Giants skipper KL Rahul in an elite club. Only Kohli and Rahul have completed 600-plus runs on four occasions in the IPL. While RCB skipper Du Plessis achieved the feat twice, the same milestone was secured by Chris Gayle and David Warner on three occasions.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himachal_Pradesh_Cricket_Association_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Curran", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Curran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faf_du_Plessis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Faf du Plessis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab,_India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arshdeep_Singh_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arshdeep Singh (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "K.

Their innings was a masterclass in power-hitting, as they posted an imposing score of 241/7 in their allotted 20 overs. The highlight of their innings was a scintillating knock by former skipper Virat Kohli, who blazed his way to 92 runs off just 47 deliveries, including 7 fours and 6 sixes. Contributions from Rajat Patidar (55 off 23) and Cameron Green (46 off 27) further bolstered RCB's total.\n\nPunjab's bowling attack struggled to contain the RCB batters, with notable performances coming from Harshal Patel (3/38) and Vidhwath Kaverappa (2/36).\n\nMohammed Siraj, Lockie Ferguson shine with the ball\n\nChasing a mammoth target of 242 runs for victory, Punjab Kings' batting lineup showed glimpses of brilliance but ultimately fell short. Rilee Rossouw led the charge with a blistering 61 off 27 balls, supported by valuable contributions from Jonny Bairstow (27 off 16) and Shashank Singh (37 off 19). However, the required run rate proved too daunting, and Punjab Kings were bowled out for 181 runs in just 17 overs.\n\nRCB's bowlers displayed discipline and control, with Mohammed Siraj (3/43) and Lockie Ferguson (2/29) being the chief architects of Punjab Kings' downfall. Swapnil Singh and Karn Sharma also chipped in with crucial wickets, restricting Punjab Kings' batting onslaught. In the end, RCB emerged triumphant by a commanding margin of 60 runs, showcasing their dominance with both bat and ball in this crucial encounter.\n\nAlso READ: IPL 2024 - Fans reacts as Virat Kohli misses out on a century by a whisker during PBKS vs RCB clash", "source": {"uri": "crickettimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketTimes.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "akshat_gaur@crickettimes.com", "name": "Akshat Gaur", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himachal_Pradesh_Cricket_Association_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toss_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toss (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajat_Patidar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rajat Patidar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harshal_Patel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harshal Patel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka_cricket_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karnataka cricket team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockie_Ferguson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lockie Ferguson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Siraj", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Siraj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rilee_Rossouw", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rilee Rossouw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karn_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karn Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swapnil_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swapnil Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shashank_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shashank Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowled", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowled"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Run rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonny_Bairstow", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jonny Bairstow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin_Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin Bowling", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://crickettimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Virat-Kohli-shines-in-RCBs-win-over-PBKS-at-IPL-2024.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548702", "eventUri": "eng-9548702", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

PBSK, on the other hand, were knocked out of the playoffs race.\n\nIPL 2024: Punjab Kings vs Royal Challengers Bengaluru - HIGHLIGHTS\n\nSwapnil Singh trapped Prabhsimran Singh LBW after being hit for a maximum in the first over. Jonny Bairstow and Rilee Rossouw then sticthed together a fifty-run stand for the second wicket to get PBKS back in the game. The former was removed just before the end of the powerplay thanks to a stunning catch from Faf du Plessis off the bowling of Lockie Ferguson. Bairstow departed for 27 from 16 deliveries.\n\nRossouw scored a well-made 27-ball 61 but was dismissed by Karn Sharma as Will Jacks completed the catch.\n\nEarlier, Virat Kohli's 92 off 47 balls powered RCB to 241/7 in 20 overs against PBKS, their fourth-highest overall total in the tournament.\n\nKohli hit seven fours and six sixes at a strike-rate of 195.74 in his vintage knock which also took him past the 600-run mark in IPL 2024. He was ably supported by Rajat Patidar, who struck 55, his fourth fifty of the season.\n\nFor PBKS, pacer Harshal Patel took 3-38, taking his IPL 2024 wickets tally to 20, while debutant fast-bowler Vidwath Kaverappa took 2-36, including a terrific Power-play spell, though the hosts were sloppy in their fielding.\n\nKohli could have been out on the third ball of the innings if Ashutosh Sharma had not dropped a difficult catch at point off Kaverappa. Faf du Plessis got going with back-to-back fours through extra-cover off Kaverappa, who had the last laugh by having the RCB skipper hole out to deep point in the third over.\n\nIn the same over of Kaverappa, Kohli got another life on 10 when Rilee Rossouw dropped another difficult catch at extra cover. Kohli and Will Jacks hit three boundaries collectively to take 16 runs off Sam Curran in the fourth over before Kaverappa had the latter sweeping to short fine-leg.\n\nBut Kaverappa had to see a third catch dropped by PBKS off his bowling, as Patidar's chance was shelled by Harshal Patel at deep fine-leg while on zero. Patidar smacked Harshal for three boundaries in a 12-run sixth over, before he and Kohli took a six each in Kaverappa's final over.\n\nPatidar stepped up the attack against spinners by smacking Rahul Chahar for three sixes in his first over and was given another life when Jonny Bairstow was late to react to a catch behind. He would get his fifty in 21 balls when he pulled Sam Curran over a short fine leg for six, before nicking behind to keeper off the left-arm pacer.\n\nFollowing a 33-minute rain and hail interruption, Kohli got his fifty in 32 balls with a vintage flick through mid-wicket for four off Liam Livingstone. He continued to nail authoritative boundaries mixed with nonchalance and vintage stroke-play to the delight of fans chanting 'Kohli, Kohli'.\n\nBut Kohli fell eight runs short of his second century this season when he sliced an Arshdeep Singh delivery to deep third man in the 18th over. Dinesh Karthik hit three quick boundaries before holing out to long-on off Harshal, who castled Mahipal Lomror and had Cameron Green miscuing in the deep on the last ball of the innings.", "source":

This match, on May 9, has massive playoff implications, with the loser facing potential elimination from the race for the coveted IPL trophy.\n\nRCB will be riding a wave of confidence after their three consecutive wins. They even recorded a victory over PBKS earlier this season. Virat Kohli, the current Orange Cap holder, has been in top form and will be a key player to watch.\n\nFor PBKS, this is a do-or-die encounter as well. Their batting, reliant on players like Jonny Bairstow and Shashank Singh, needs to fire on all cylinders. Bowling remains a concern, but Harshal Patel has been their bright spark with his wicket-taking abilities.\n\nAs both teams gear up at the picturesque Dharamsala, here are three potential milestones that could be reached in the PBKS vs. RCB clash.\n\n#3 Faf Du Plessis could complete 4500 IPL runs\n\nFaf Du Plessis is one of the most underrated batters in IPL history. The RCB skipper is enjoying a stellar campaign, having scored 352 runs at a strike rate of 172.55.\n\nDu Plessis could complete his 4,500 runs in the cash-rich league. The former IPL winner is only 15 runs away from achieving the landmarks. In doing so, he would become only the fourth overseas player to complete 4,500 IPL runs.\n\nAcross the 141 matches he has played, the South African star has amassed 4,985 runs at a strike rate of 136.5.\n\n#2 Arshdeep Singh could become the second-highest wicket-taker in PBKS history\n\nArshdeep Singh has a golden opportunity in this high-stakes encounter to etch his name further into PBKS history. With 72 wickets to his name for PBKS, he stands just one wicket away from surpassing Sandeep Sharma (73 wickets) to become the franchise's second-highest wicket-taker.\n\nThe left-arm pacer has been a consistent performer for Punjab Kings, especially in the death overs. His ability to swing the new ball and nail his yorkers makes him a vital cog in their bowling attack.\n\n#1 Virat Kohli could become the first Indian to score 1000 runs vs PBKS\n\nIPL legend Virat Kohli will be eyeing another landmark achievement as he steps onto the field in Dharamshala. Currently sitting at 938 runs against Punjab Kings in just 31 matches, Kohli is on the cusp of becoming the first Indian batter to breach the 1000-run mark against this particular franchise.\n\nJust 62 runs separate him from this historic feat. Given his blazing form and the high-scoring nature of the Dharamshala pitch, this match presents Kohli with the perfect opportunity to etch his name deeper into the record books.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "naman_jain@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Naman Jain", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faf_du_Plessis", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Faf du Plessis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himachal_Pradesh_Cricket_Association_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arshdeep_Singh_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arshdeep Singh (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harshal_Patel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harshal Patel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shashank_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shashank Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonny_Bairstow", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jonny Bairstow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandeep_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sandeep Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yorker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swing bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail_Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail Running", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Running", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/8e6c4-17152447030979-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548702", "eventUri": "eng-9548702", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 158, "textEnd": 163}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

The game between Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Punjab Kings is a must-win for both sides. The loser of the game will join Mumbai Indians and become the second team to be eliminated from IPL 2024.\n\nRCB came into the game on the back of their win against Gujarat Titans. On the other hand, Punjab Kings had lost to Chennai Super Kings at the same venue in the last match. Vidwath Kaverappa the Karnataka pacer made his debut for Punjab Kings.\n\nPunjab Kings pacer Vidwath Kaverappa got the wickets of Faf Du Plessis and Will Jacks to deal early blows to the visitors. Virat Kohli was at this sublime best but had been dropped twice in the first six overs. Rajat Patidar hit two fours off two balls to take the team past 50.\n\nIt was yet another frenetic start to the innings as the Punjab Kings fielders dropped three catches. Virat Kohli was dropped twice while Rajat Patidar was put down off his very first ball\n\nRajat Patidar continued to pound the Punjab Kings bowlers as he kept hitting the big ones. RCB who have to win the match didn't let the two early wickets weigh them down as the runs kept flowing at rapid pace.\n\nHarshal Patel would be cursing himself as his dropped chance off the very first ball gave Rajat Patidar a second life. The 30-year-made full use of this chance and got to his 4 fifty of the season with a six off Sam Curran.\n\nThe runs keep coming for Virat Kohli as he got to yet another fifty for the season. RCB's former skipper hit Liam Livingstone for a slog-sweep to reach his half-century.\n\nCheck Here: IPL 2024 Orange Cap\n\nThere was a brief halt in play as there was a slight downpour. All-rounder Cameron Green, who came out came out refreshed after the stoppage of the game and hit a few crisp shots to get RCB past 150 runs in the 14 over.\n\nPunjab Kings bowlers had nowhere to hide as they were taken to the cleaners by the visiting side. With five more overs to go and Virat Kohli batting well RCB would be looking to post a score in excess of 200.\n\nThe partnership between Cameron Green and Virat Kohli kept the pressure on the PBKS bowlers. Kohli in particular looked to step on the gas and hit Harshal Patel and Sam Curran for boundaries.\n\nVirat Kohli fell for 92 runs when he was dismissed by Arshdeep Singh caught by Rilee Rossouw. Dinesh Karthik who has been in brilliant form this season played a brilliant cameo to take Royal Challengers Bengaluru to the huge score.

They have the winning momentum on their side, having won their last three games comprehensively.\n\nThe wins have not only boosted their sagging morale but also taken them to the seventh spot in the points table.\n\nWith eight points from 11 games, RCB can still make the playoffs if they win all their remaining three fixtures although the chances are slim.\n\nPunjab Kings too stare at a similar situation. They occupy the eighth spot, having collected eight points from 11 games.\n\nHowever, between the two -- only one team can reach the all-important 14 points mark.\n\nHaving beaten PBKS earlier in the season and heading to this clash with three wins on the trot, RCB will feel more confident than the hosts.\n\nVirat Kohli remains consistent at the top, while skipper Faf du Plessis broke his string of poor scores with a belligerent knock in the last game.\n\nWill Jacks also impressed with a match-winning century against GT, and Cameron Green showcased his all-round skills with crucial contributions in runs and wickets against Sunrisers Hyderabad.\n\nTheir bowling department has started clicking with Mohammed Siraj, who is in India's T20 World Cup squad, finally finding his rhythm.\n\nYash Dayal and Vijaykumar Vyshak also did well against GT and RCB will expect them to continue in the same vein.\n\nPBKS, on the other hand, will be low on confidence having suffered an inexplicable batting collapse against Chennai Super Kings.\n\nThe Kings showcased their very best and worst against CSK. Their bowlers were all over the CSK batters but the batting unit choked.\n\nIt was a example of how Punjab's season has been this year -- unpredictable.\n\nThey have showcased their potential with away wins over Kolkata Knight Riders, when they recorded the highest successful run chase in T20 cricket, and CSK.\n\nHowever, they have faced difficulties getting the job done at home. They won just one out of five games in Mullanpur, their main home ground.\n\nA change in venue to the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium also didn't go their way in the previous game here.\n\nThe team would hope to end its home run on a high but for that to happen, the PBKS unit has to fire in unison.\n\nSquads:\n\nPunjab Kings: Sam Curran \u00a9, Matthew Short, Jonny Bairstow

They have the winning momentum on their side, having won their last three games comprehensively.\n\nThe wins have not only boosted their sagging morale but also taken them to the seventh spot in the points table.\n\nWith eight points from 11 games, RCB can still make the playoffs if they win all their remaining three fixtures although the chances are slim.\n\nPunjab Kings too stare at a similar situation. They occupy the eighth spot, having collected eight points from 11 games.\n\nHowever, between the two -- only one team can reach the all-important 14 points mark.\n\nHaving beaten PBKS earlier in the season and heading to this clash with three wins on the trot, RCB will feel more confident than the hosts.\n\nVirat Kohli remains consistent at the top, while skipper Faf du Plessis broke his string of poor scores with a belligerent knock in the last game.\n\nWill Jacks also impressed with a match-winning century against GT, and Cameron Green showcased his all-round skills with crucial contributions in runs and wickets against Sunrisers Hyderabad.\n\nTheir bowling department has started clicking with Mohammed Siraj, who is in India's T20 World Cup squad, finally finding his rhythm.\n\nYash Dayal and Vijaykumar Vyshak also did well against GT and RCB will expect them to continue in the same vein.\n\nPBKS, on the other hand, will be low on confidence having suffered an inexplicable batting collapse against Chennai Super Kings.\n\nThe Kings showcased their very best and worst against CSK. Their bowlers were all over the CSK batters but the batting unit choked.\n\nIt was a example of how Punjab's season has been this year -- unpredictable.\n\nThey have showcased their potential with away wins over Kolkata Knight Riders, when they recorded the highest successful run chase in T20 cricket, and CSK.\n\nHowever, they have faced difficulties getting the job done at home. They won just one out of five games in Mullanpur, their main home ground.\n\nA change in venue to the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium also didn't go their way in the previous game here.\n\nThe team would hope to end its home run on a high but for that to happen, the PBKS unit has to fire in unison.\n\nSquads: Punjab Kings: Sam Curran (c), Matthew Short, Jonny Bairstow (wk),

The loss meant that Punjab became the second team after MI to get knocked out of the race for the playoffs this season. PBKS had won the toss and opted to bowl first in Dharamsala.\n\nKohli would have a lucky start as the PBKS fielders gifted him two lives and the RCB batter would capitalise on it. He found help from the other end in the form of Rajat Patidar, who scored another blazing fifty. Kohli ended up scoring 92 off just 47 balls as a late cameo from Cameron Green would ensure that RCB would post a total of 241 in their 20 overs.\n\nKohli's innings consisted of 7 fours and 6 sixes as PBKS had a big ask in front of them in Dharamsala. The chase got off to a rocky start as they lost Prabhsimran Singh early. Rilee Rossouw and Jonny Bairstow would steady the innings, with Rossouw scoring a well-made 61 off 27 balls.\n\nPBKS vs RCB: Updates | Scorecard\n\nHowever, the wickets of Bairstow and Rossouw would end the hopes of a win for PBKS as they started to lose wickets in a cluster. The spin twins Karn Sharma and Swapnil Singh would take 2 wickets each, while Siraj would also get into form with 3 scalps.\n\nThe PBKS innings came to an end at 181 as RCB marched ahead with their 4th win on the trot.\n\nKohli was facing a storm over his strike-rate with fans and pundits targeting him. The RCB star would hit back at the criticism, which would see Sunil Gavaskar clapping back at him. But in Dharamsala, what the fans saw was a player who was getting ready for the T20 World Cup.\n\nHe got lucky on two occasions when he was at 0 and 10, and made the most of the opportunity to make PBKS pay for their errors. He got to his fifty with two back-to-back fours and in 32 balls and then went into top gear.\n\nThe next 15 balls would see Kohli amass 40 runs, with some of the shots being incredible. The six off Sam Curran was probably the shot of the day as he would deposit the ball into the stands with ease.\n\nThere was nothing that was really mistimed from Kohli as he raced into 90s with a six and a four off Arshdeep. Even after being in touching distance of what would have been a well-deserved hundred, Kohli decided to keep the scoring rate high and fell in the process. He would joke about how it was important for him to keep his strike-rate up in a small dig at the critics.\n\nThe RCB batter has now gone past the 600-run mark for the 4th time in the IPL and these are great signs for Indian cricket fans. To top it all off, he produced a stunning performance on the field with a direct-hit to dismiss the dangerous Shashank Singh.\n\nThe game in Dharamsala was reflective of PBKS' IPL 2024 campaign. There have been moments of brilliance in the season as they pulled off that impressive chase in Kolkata, but then they would go on to have an awful performance on the field like they did on Thursday.\n\nThey dropped Kohli twice, one in the very first over when the RCB star was just trying to get the feel of the wicket. The second one was a tougher chance, but the catch of Rajat Patidar proved to be one of the turning points.\n\nPatidar was on 0 when he skied a relatively easy catch to Harshal Patel and it was dropped. He would end up scoring 55 off just 23 balls.\n\nWhile chasing the target, PBKS could have held back Jitesh Sharma, who had been struggling with form. A better option could have been to see Curran come up the order. The decision to leave out Kagiso Rabada, who has a good record against Kohli would also come to haunt them in the end.\n\nThe Kings are left now looking to salvage their pride in another IPL campaign that did have a few moments of joy and a lot of despair.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rilee_Rossouw", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rilee Rossouw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonny_Bairstow", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jonny Bairstow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajat_Patidar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajat Patidar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prabhsimran_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prabhsimran Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Curran", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Curran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karn_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karn Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swapnil_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swapnil Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunil_Gavaskar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunil Gavaskar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kagiso_Rabada", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kagiso Rabada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harshal_Patel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harshal Patel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shashank_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shashank Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jitesh_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jitesh Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kolkata"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202405/pbks-vs-rcb-091217538-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=SF26oyQcgnYidWyiDH7wcUzop9sT2DhA", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548702", "eventUri": "eng-9548702", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 273, "textEnd": 278}], "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

They have a net run rate of -0.423.\n\nWhile speaking after the match, Curran said there have been lots of positive signs in the ongoing season of the IPL 2024.\n\nHe further added they need to keep learning and become better in the future. The skipper also apologised to the home fans after conceding a defeat against RCB.\n\n\"A lot of positive signs throughout the season, but not enough to get over the line unfortunately. We knew that we had the best side for the rest of the tournament and feel gutted for the team. Gotta keep our heads up, keep learning and keep becoming better. Really enjoyed leading a great bunch of guys, would have loved a few more wins. We had some highs, and some record run-chases as well. Lots of disappointment and apologies to the fans, we will keep fighting. The ups and downs have been quite tough, but you gotta keep learning and keep working hard,\" Curran said.\n\nRecapping the match, PBKS opted to field first after winning the toss. After the dismissal of skipper Faf Du Plessis (9) and Will Jacks (12) early, Virat (92) and Rajat Patidar (55) steadied the RCB's ship with a 76-run stand, keeping the strike rate high. Then, a fine knock by Cameron Green (46) and his 92-run stand with Virat powered RCB to 241/7 in their 20 overs.\n\nHarshal Patel (3/38) was the pick of the bowlers for PBKS. Vidwath Kaverappa (2/36) also did fine on his debut.\n\nIn the run-chase of 242 runs for PBKS, Rilee Rossouw (61), Shashank Singh (37) and Jonny Bairstow (27) looked dangerous, but lost their wickets on crucial stages.\n\nThe rest of the batters could not really put up a fight and lost the game by 60 runs as PBKS bundled out for 181 runs.\n\nMohammed Siraj was the top bowler for RCB with 3/43. Karn Sharma, Lockie Ferguson and Swapnil Singh also took two wickets.

RCB secured their 4th win on the trot on the back of Kohli's 92 off 47 deliveries as PBKS struggled to chase down the target of 242. RCB had a poor start to the campaign, which saw them win just 1 out of 7 matches before going on the winning streak.\n\nSpeaking after the 60-run win over PBKS, Kohli said that the team wasn't good enough in the first half of the competition. The star batter went on to say that things had reached a point where RCB had to play for pride and not look at the points table and were just looking to keep the fans happy.\n\n\"Have to be honest, we were not good enough in the first half of the tournament. We got to a point where we said don't look at the table, play for self-respect. Make yourselves proud and the fans,\" said Kohli.\n\nPBKS vs RCB: Highlights | Scorecard\n\nKohli went on to say that RCB would need to keep raising their level as if they had done it earlier, they wouldn't have been in a scenario where they need to depend on other results.\n\nWe need to raise our level. If we had done so earlier, we wouldn't be in a position needing to rely on so many factors,\" said Kohli.\n\nThe match saw Kohli, along with Rajat Patidar and Cameron Green, help RCB post 241 runs in their 20 overs, giving PBKS a big mountain to climb. Things were looking good for Punjab when Rilee Rossouw was at the crease, but the wicket of the South Africa batter would trigger a collapse for them.\n\nIPL 2024 Full Coverage | IPL 2024 Points Table and Standings | 2024 IPL Full Schedule\n\nMohammed Siraj picked up 3 wickets while the spin duo of Swapnil Singh and Karn Sharma claimed 2 each as RCB secured an easy win in the end.

Virat Kohli and Rajat Patidar conjured up superlative fifties before the bowlers joined the party as Royal Challengers Bengaluru kept their slim playoff hopes alive with a huge 60-run win over Punjab Kings in the IPL here on Thursday.\n\nDharamsala, May 9 (PTI) Virat Kohli and Rajat Patidar conjured up superlative fifties before the bowlers joined the party as Royal Challengers Bengaluru kept their slim playoff hopes alive with a huge 60-run win over Punjab Kings in the IPL here on Thursday.\n\nKohli's 47-ball 92 was the cornerstone of RCB's innings as he starred in two partnerships -- 72 off 32 balls with Patidar (55 off 23 balls) and 92 off 46 balls with Cameron Green (46 off 27 balls) to propel RCB to 241/7.\n\nAlso Read | ICC T20 World Cup 2024 All Squads: Full Players List of All Teams for Ninth Edition of Men's Twenty20 Cricket WC.\n\nIn reply, Rilee Rossouw put up a show with a 27-ball 61-run knock but Karn Sharma's twin strike triggered a collapse as PBKS were all out for 181 in 17 overs.\n\nThis was a fourth successive win for RCB and it took them to 10 points, while PBKS (8) were knocked out of the playoff race as they can reach a maximum of 12 points from the remaining two games.\n\nAlso Read | KL Rahul To Resign As LSG Captain? Three Players Who Could Replace the Current Skipper for Remaining IPL 2024 Matches.\n\nSwapnil Singh (2/28), Karn (2/36) and Lockie Ferguson (2/29) took two each, while Mohammed Siraj (3/43) claimed three wickets for RCB.\n\nChasing a stiff target, PBKS lost Prabhsimran Singh (6) early but Rossouw looked unstoppable as left-arm spinner Swapnil Singh was carted for two fours before Siraj was belted for three fours and a six.\n\nYash Dayal and Ferguson were then hit for 16 and 14 runs by Jonny Bairstow (27) and Rossouw as PBKS scored 75 runs in six overs.\n\nOnce Bairstow was removed by Ferguson, Rossouw turned his attention on Green, blasting two fours and a six on way to his fifty off 21 balls.\n\nJitesh Sharma was then cleaned up by Karn, while Swapnil got rid of Liam Livingstone (0) as Punjab slipped to 126 for 5 in 12th over.\n\nThey couldn't recover from those blows and it was all over when Shashank Singh (37), Sam Curran (22) and Ashutosh Sharma (8) returned to the dugout.\n\nEarlier, Kohli, who was dropped on 0 and 10, timed the ball nicely, used his feet and wrists to bring up his sixth IPL fifty this season. He reached his mark in 32 balls, before slamming another 40 in his next 15 balls. He cracked seven fours and six maximums.\n\nPatidar, who was also given two lives, provided the early momentum as he slammed six maximums and three fours during his 23-ball 55.\n\nAfter Patidar's dismissal, Kohli and Green continued the onslaught to take RCB past the 200-mark. Green hit five fours and a six before being caught in the final ball as RCB scored 77 in last five overs.\n\nPacer Vidhwath Kaverappa (2/36) picked up two wickets in the powerplay on his IPL debut but his figures could have been much better had the fielders not dropped three catches off his bowling.\n\nKohli was dropped in the third ball but Kaverappa dismissed Faf du Plessis (9) and removed Will Jacks (12) but PBKS couldn't create pressure as Sam Curran (1/50) and Harshal Patel (3/38) leaked runs.\n\nPatel, who had dropped Patidar, conceded three boundaries in his first over as RCB scored 56 in the powerplay.\n\nIt started raining sixes thereafter as Kohli and Patidar slammed a maximum each to spoil Kaverappa's bowling figures.\n\nPatidar then creamed spinner Rahul Chahar for three mighty maximums before depositing Arshdeep and Sam Curran for two more sixes, the last one bringing up his fifty in 21 balls.\n\nWith Patidar on fire, RCB crossed 100 in the ninth over. Curran, however, got rid of Patidar in the 10th over, when rain halted play for a brief while.\n\nAfter resumption, Kohli completed his fifty and hit Livingstone for two fours.\n\nGreen brought up the 150 with a four off Patel. Kohli then went berserk as he slog swept Livingstone for a six, while Curran was deposited over mid-wicket for a 94-metre maximum.

With both teams vying for crucial points in the league standings, this encounter promises high stakes and intense competition. It will be a must-win game for both sides to keep their hopes alive to make it into the playoffs.\n\nPunjab's aggressive batting style has led to remarkable feats, such as their record-breaking run chase against KKR. Their younger players like Shashank Singh and Ashutosh Sharma have stepped up, alongside notable performances from Jonny Bairstow.\n\nHowever, inconsistency has plagued them, exemplified by a loss to the defending champions in the reverse fixture at Dharamsala. The challenge for PBKS lies in maintaining composure under pressure.\n\nOn the other hand, RCB enters the match on a three-match winning streak after a rocky start to the season. Faf du Plessis' leadership has sparked a resurgence, with notable improvements in both batting and bowling departments.\n\nDespite complex qualification scenarios, RCB now plays with freedom, evident in their recent dominant performances.\n\nPunjab Kings (Probable Playing XI): Jonny Bairstow, Rilee Rossouw, Shashank Singh, Sam Curran (c), Jitesh Sharma (wk), Ashutosh Sharma, Harpreet Brar, Harshal Patel, Kagiso Rabada, Rahul Chahar, Arshdeep Singh.\n\n(Impact sub: Prabhsimran Singh)\n\nRoyal Challengers Bangalore (Probable Playing XI): Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Glenn Maxwell, Will Jacks, Cameron Green, Dinesh Karthik, Karn Sharma, Swapnil Singh, Yash Dayal, Vijaykumar Vysakh, Mohammed Siraj.\n\n(Impact sub: Rajat Patidar)\n\nThe match will be played at Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium in Dharamsala which has traditionally been a batting paradise. The ball comes onto the bat with true bounce expected, spinner has had some success at this venue in the last couple of seasons\n\nThe Batters will look to take on the attack and utilize the powerplay upfront. The pitch is likely to get better to bat on as the match progresses. Teams would want to chase here which makes the toss very crucial once again.\n\nWhere to watch?

The Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium in Dharamshala is playing host to this encounter.\n\nPBKS captain Sam Curran won the toss and invited the opposition team to bat first on a flat surface. RCB top-order batters Faf du Plessis (9) and Will Jacks (12) departed early in the innings without much contributions. Virat Kohli and Rajat Patidar then put on a brisk partnership of 76 (32) to inject momentum into the innings and lay down a solid platform.\n\nPatidar was the aggressor as he scored 55 (23) before perishing at the end of the 10th over. Virat Kohli took over the mantle in the second half of the innings and played a magnificent knock of 92 (47) to take RCB above the 200-run mark.\n\nCameron Green (46) supported him well as the duo stitched together a 92-run partnership for the fourth wicket. Dinesh Karthik (18) chipped in with a cameo in the end as RCB reached a massive score of 241 in 20 overs.\n\nFans enjoyed the first innings of the 58th match of IPL 2024 between RCB and PBKS. They expressed their reactions to the action by sharing hilarious memes on X and Instagram.\n\nHere are some of the best memes:\n\n\"We thought anything over 230 would be great\" - Virat Kohli after helping RCB reach 241/7 in IPL 2024 match against PBKS\n\nAt the mid-innings break, Royal Challengers Bengaluru batter Virat Kohli reflected on the action that unfolded during the first innings. He told the host broadcaster:\n\n\"It was important to keep the strike rate up throughout the innings. There was a bit of tricky phase when Patidar got out and rain came. Green got a couple of boundaries and then I thought it's time for me to go after the bowling. When the seamers were bowling up front, it was two-paced. It was dry and the ball was stopping it.\"\n\nHe added:\n\n\"Due to the two-pace nature, it's an opportunity for our pacers to exploit the swing. We thought anything over 230 would be great. We have a great bowling attack and the bowlers are confident. We thought of getting 230 but ends up getting 11 runs more because that was a hell of an over from Harshal.\"", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Jacks", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Will Jacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Curran", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Curran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himachal_Pradesh_Cricket_Association_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faf_du_Plessis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Faf du Plessis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toss_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toss (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajat_Patidar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rajat Patidar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinesh_Karthik", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dinesh Karthik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seam_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seam bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swing bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Lawn_Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Lawn Bowling", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin_Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin Bowling", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/bbff1-17152725922697-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548702", "eventUri": "eng-9548702", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 156, "textEnd": 161}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

RCB were off to a disastrous start as Vidhwath Kaverappa dismissed their captain Faf du Plessis (9) and Will Jacks (12) cheaply inside the powerplay.\n\nHowever, the former India skipper stood firm at one end to take RCB to the big total. He and Rajat Patidar steadied the ship with a 76-run stand before the latter departed for 55. After Patidar's departure, Kohli took charge and took RCB to the 200-run mark before being dismissed in the 18th over by Arshdeep Singh.\n\nKohli's 92-run knock came off 47 balls and was studded with seven fours and six sixes. It is only the second time in the IPL that Kohli was out in the 90s. He was last dismissed in the 90s way back in 2013 when he missed his maiden IPL century by just 1 run against Delhi Capitals.\n\nVirat Kohli has added yet another feather to his already illustrious cap with his impressive 92-run knock against PBKS. The former RCB skipper now holds the record for scoring 1000 or more runs against the maximum number of teams in the IPL.\n\nHe has now scored 1000 runs against three different teams in the tournament. Previously, he had scored 1000 runs against Chennai Super Kings and Delhi Capitals before doing it against PBKS as well.\n\nVirat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, and David Warner jointly held the record for scoring 1000 or more runs against the maximum number of teams. Virat Kohli has now moved ahead of both Rohit and Warner. He also became the second player to score at least 1000 runs against PBKS after Warner.", "source": {"uri": "cricketaddictor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketAddictor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himachal_Pradesh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Himachal Pradesh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Himachal Pradesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arshdeep_Singh_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arshdeep Singh (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Jacks", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Will Jacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajat_Patidar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rajat Patidar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka_cricket_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karnataka cricket team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faf_du_Plessis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Faf du Plessis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Capitals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delhi Capitals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Warner_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Warner (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chennai Super Kings"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://static.cricketaddictor.com/images/2024/ViratKohliRCB.webp?q=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548702", "eventUri": "eng-9548702", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 108, "textEnd": 113}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

After the dismissal of skipper Faf Du Plessis (9) and Will Jacks (12) early, Virat (92 in 47 balls, with seven fours and six sixes) and Rajat Patidar (55 in 23 balls, with three fours and six sixes) steadied the RCB's ship with a 76-run stand, keeping the strike rate high. Then, a fine knock by Cameron Green (46 in 27 balls, with five fours and a six) and his 92-run stand with Virat powered RCB to 241/7 in their 20 overs.\n\nHarshal Patel (3/38) was the pick of the bowlers for PBKS. Vidwath Kaverappa (2/36) also did fine on his debut.\n\nIn the run-chase of 242 runs, Rilee Rossouw (61 in 27 balls, with nine fours and three sixes), Shashank Singh (37 in 19 balls, with four boundaries and two sixes) and Jonny Bairstow (27 in 16 balls, with four boundaries and a six) looked dangerous, but lost their wickets on crucial stages.\n\nThe rest of the batters could not really put up a fight and lost the game by 60 runs as PBKS bundled out for 181 runs.\n\nMohammed Siraj was the top bowler for RCB with 3/43. Karn Sharma, Lockie Ferguson and Swapnil Singh also took two wickets.\n\nRCB is in the seventh spot with five wins and seven losses, with 10 points. PBKS is in ninth place, with four wins and eight losses, a total of eight points. Punjab is out of the tournament.

Virat Kohli (92) and Rajat Patidar (55) guided RCB to 241/7. Rilee Rossouw's 61 kept Punjab in the chase, but Karn Sharma's twin strike led to a collapse. RCB bowlers took seven wickets, with Swapnil Singh, Karn, and Lockie Ferguson taking two each, while Mohammed Siraj claimed three. This was RCB's fourth consecutive win, while Punjab was eliminated from the playoff race.\n\nVirat Kohli and Rajat Patidar conjured up superlative fifties before the bowlers joined the party as Royal Challengers Bengaluru kept their slim playoff hopes alive with a huge 60-run win over Punjab Kings in the IPL here on Thursday.\n\nKohli's 47-ball 92 was the cornerstone of RCB's innings as he starred in two partnerships -- 72 off 32 balls with Patidar (55 off 23 balls) and 92 off 46 balls with Cameron Green (46 off 27 balls) to propel RCB to 241/7.\n\nIn reply, Rilee Rossouw put up a show with a 27-ball 61-run knock but Karn Sharma's twin strike triggered a collapse as PBKS were all out for 181 in 17 overs.\n\nThis was a fourth successive win for RCB and it took them to 10 points, while PBKS (8) were knocked out of the playoff race as they can reach a maximum of 12 points from the remaining two games.\n\nSwapnil Singh (2/28), Karn (2/36) and Lockie Ferguson (2/29) took two each, while Mohammed Siraj (3/43) claimed three wickets for RCB.\n\nChasing a stiff target, PBKS lost Prabhsimran Singh (6) early but Rossouw looked unstoppable as left-arm spinner Swapnil Singh was carted for two fours before Siraj was belted for three fours and a six.\n\nYash Dayal and Ferguson were then hit for 16 and 14 runs by Jonny Bairstow (27) and Rossouw as PBKS scored 75 runs in six overs.\n\nOnce Bairstow was removed by Ferguson, Rossouw turned his attention on Green, blasting two fours and a six on way to his fifty off 21 balls.\n\nJitesh Sharma was then cleaned up by Karn, while Swapnil got rid of Liam Livingstone (0) as Punjab slipped to 126 for 5 in 12th over.\n\nThey couldn't recover from those blows and it was all over when Shashank Singh (37), Sam Curran (22) and Ashutosh Sharma (8) returned to the dugout.\n\nEarlier, Kohli, who was dropped on 0 and 10, timed the ball nicely, used his feet and wrists to bring up his sixth IPL fifty this season. He reached his mark in 32 balls, before slamming another 40 in his next 15 balls. He cracked seven fours and six maximums.\n\nPatidar, who was also given two lives, provided the early momentum as he slammed six maximums and three fours during his 23-ball 55.\n\nAfter Patidar's dismissal, Kohli and Green continued the onslaught to take RCB past the 200-mark. Green hit five fours and a six before being caught in the final ball as RCB scored 77 in last five overs.\n\nPacer Vidhwath Kaverappa (2/36) picked up two wickets in the powerplay on his IPL debut but his figures could have been much better had the fielders not dropped three catches off his bowling.\n\nKohli was dropped in the third ball but Kaverappa dismissed Faf du Plessis (9) and removed Will Jacks (12) but PBKS couldn't create pressure as Sam Curran (1/50) and Harshal Patel (3/38) leaked runs.\n\nPatel, who had dropped Patidar, conceded three boundaries in his first over as RCB scored 56 in the powerplay.\n\nIt started raining sixes thereafter as Kohli and Patidar slammed a maximum each to spoil Kaverappa's bowling figures.\n\nPatidar then creamed spinner Rahul Chahar for three mighty maximums before depositing Arshdeep and Sam Curran for two more sixes, the last one bringing up his fifty in 21 balls.\n\nWith Patidar on fire, RCB crossed 100 in the ninth over. Curran, however, got rid of Patidar in the 10th over, when rain halted play for a brief while.\n\nAfter resumption, Kohli completed his fifty and hit Livingstone for two fours.\n\nGreen brought up the 150 with a four off Patel. Kohli then went berserk as he slog swept Livingstone for a six, while Curran was deposited over mid-wicket for a 94-metre maximum. He sent one over long-on for another maximum. Dinesh Karthik (18) played a cameo before Patel claimed three wickets in last over.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source":

Maxwell has been struggling to find form throughout the IPL 2024 season while Rabada has been the third-highest wicket-taker for Punjab in the ongoing campaign.\n\nMaxwell had taken a mental break during the early part of the season and had recently returned to the lineup for the match against GT on April 28. However, the Aussie all-rounder has failed to impress once again as he scored 4 off 3 balls in the recent game against GT in Bengaluru. Following this effort, Parthiv Patel called Maxwell the most overrated player in the history of IPL in an explosive tweet.\n\nMaxwell has scored just 36 runs in 8 matches so far in the IPL 2024 campaign. The match is a must-win for both sides as the loser will be knocked out from the playoffs race.\n\nPBKS vs RCB: Live Updates\n\nRabada has 11 wickets to his name at an average over 33. PBKS had won the toss on the day and opted to bowl first in Dharamsala. Punjab decided to bring back Liam Livingstone into the line-up. Vishwath Kaverappa will be making his debut for PBKS as well.\n\nThey have also decided to give the wicketkeeping gloves to Jonny Bairstow for the game as Jitesh Sharma was demoted to the impact subs bench. Jitesh has struggled with the bat this season.\n\nRCB have brought in Lockie Ferguson for the game in place of Maxwell and haven't hindered a lot with their winning combination.

The result means RCB keep their Playoff hopes alive with their fourth win on the trot, while PBKS become the second team after Mumbai Indians to be eliminated from the tournament.\n\nKohli hit seven fours and six maximums at a strike rate of 195.74 in his vintage knock which also took him past the 600-run mark in the IPL 2024. He was ably supported by Rajat Patidar's 55, his fourth fifty of this season as RCB posted 241/7, their fourth-highest total in the tournament.\n\nFor PBKS, pacer Harshal Patel took 3-38, taking his IPL 2024 wickets tally to 20, while debutant fast-bowler Vidwath Kaverappa took 2-36, including a terrific Power-play spell, though the hosts were sloppy in their fielding. PBKS had a glimmer of hope to overhaul the total via a 65-run partnership between Jonny Bairstow and Rilee Rossouw. Though Rossouw made 61, none of PBKS's batters stood up as they were bowled out for 181 in 17 overs.\n\nKohli could have been out on the third ball of the innings if Ashutosh Sharma had not dropped a difficult catch at point off Kaverappa. Faf du Plessis got going with back-to-back fours through extra-cover off Kaverappa, who had the last laugh by having the RCB skipper hole out to deep point in the third over. In the same over of Kaverappa, Kohli got another life on 10 when Rilee Rossouw dropped another difficult catch at extra cover. Kohli and Will Jacks hit three boundaries collectively to take 16 runs off Sam Curran in the fourth over before Kaverappa had the latter sweeping to short fine leg.\n\nBut Kaverappa had to see the third catch dropped by PBKS off his bowling, as Patidar's chance was shelled by Harshal Patel at deep fine leg while on zero. Patidar smacked Harshal for three boundaries in a 12-run sixth over, before he and Kohli took a six each in Kaverappa's final over. Patidar stepped up the attack against spinners by smacking Rahul Chahar for three sixes in his first over and was given another life when Jonny Bairstow was late to react to a catch behind. He would get his fifty in 21 balls when he pulled Sam Curran over short fine-leg for six, before nicking behind to keeper off the left-arm pacer.\n\nFollowing a 33-minute rain and hail interruption, Kohli got his fifty in 32 balls with a vintage flick through mid-wicket for four off Liam Livingstone. He continued to nail authoritative boundaries mixed with nonchalance and vintage stroke-play to the delight of fans chanting 'Kohli, Kohli'. But Kohli fell eight runs short of his second century this season when he sliced an Arshdeep Singh delivery to deep third man in the 18th over. Dinesh Karthik hit three quick boundaries before holing out to long-on off Harshal, who castled Mahipal Lomror and had Cameron Green miscuing in the deep on the last ball of the innings.\n\nRCB had a superb start to their defence as Swapnil Singh trapped Prabhsimran Singh lbw on the fourth ball. Bairstow hit four boundaries and a six in his 16-ball 27, before falling to Lockie Ferguson on the second last ball of the powerplay. Rossouw kept PBKS in the hunt by smashing boundaries at will to hit his first fifty of the competition, which he reached by thumping a six over Green's head. After getting some attention from the physio for an injury, Rossouw holed out to long off against Karn Sharma, who went on to castle Jitesh Sharma.\n\nThough Shashank Singh was smashing boundaries, it wasn't enough for PBKS as Liam Livingstone was caught at cover for a duck, off a leading edge against Swapnil. Shashank himself needed attention from the physio for a shoulder injury and was run out by a direct hit fired by Kohli from deep mid-wicket on the very next ball, falling for 19-ball 37. After that, PBKS never recovered as Ashutosh was trapped lbw by Siraj, followed by Ferguson knocking over Sam Curran. Siraj came back to take out the remaining two wickets and finish with 3-43 as RCB managed another clinical win.\n\nBrief scores:\n\nRoyal Challengers Bengaluru 241/7 in 20 overs (Virat Kohli 92, Rajat Patidar 55; Harshal Patel 3-38, Vidwath Kaverappa 2-36) beat Punjab Kings 181 in 17 overs (Rilee Rossouw 61, Shashank Singh 37; Mohammed Siraj 3-43, Swapnil Singh 2-280 by 60 runs", "source": {"uri":

The right-hander pointed out his strike rate after scoring 92 runs off 47 balls at 195.74 in an innings featuring six maximums and seven boundaries.\n\nWith the knock, Kohli also surpassed 600 runs this season. The 35-year-old is the leading runscorer in IPL 2024 and holds the Orange Cap holder. He has scored 634 runs in 12 matches at a strike rate of 153.51, including a century and five 50s.\n\nIn the mid-match show, Virat Kohli said:\n\n\"It was important to keep my strike rate up right through the innings (laughs). So, I was just focused on taking the momentum forward for the team.\n\n\"There was a bit of tricky phase when Rajat got, we're three down and then the bit of rain and hail came in, so we had a bit off stop-up momentum. We had to rebuild for about 8-10 balls and then once the base was set, Cameron [Green] got a few boundaries, I thought, yeah, I've to go again.\"\n\nKohli further pointed out the two-paced nature of the pitch but added that RCB have got themselves to a par score:\n\n\"If you saw Faf and me got done for lack of pace from the pitch when Faf got out and my catch [on zero by Ashutosh Sharma in first over] was dropped as well. So, there was a two-paced feel with the new ball.\n\n\"We thought anything over 230 would be a good total here. That was the only mindset. That was a hell of an over from Harshal in the last over otherwise we would've been 250-plus.\"\n\nThis is not the first time that Kohli has shot a dig at commentators with his strike rate jibe in this IPL season. The reaction comes days after former India captain Sunil Gavaskar gave him an indirect reply to his previous message.\n\nMeanwhile, Virat Kohli will now look to continue his purple patch with the bat as RCB aim for a place in the playoffs. The Delhi-batter is also critical to Team India's success at the upcoming 2024 T20 World Cup in June.\n\nVirat Kohli's knock helps RCB set a 242-run target for PBKS in IPL 2024 match\n\nA clinical batting display from Virat Kohli helped RCB post 241/7 against PBKS in the IPL on Thursday.\n\nApart from Kohli, Rajat Patidar scored a quickfire 53 off 23 deliveries with the help of six maximums and three boundaries. Cameron Green provided the late flourish, scoring 46 off 27, hitting one six and five boundaries. Dinesh Karthik also chipped in with 18 off seven.\n\nHarshal Patel starred with the ball for PBKS against his former side, returning with figures of 3/38.

PBKS meanwhile, stand eliminated on the basis of this result.\n\nHaving posted a record 241 for 6 after they were put in to bat, an all-round effort from the RCB bowlers ensured that PBKS were bundled out in only 17 overs, for 181.\n\nDifference: Middle overs\n\nEven as Punjab Kings kept on track with the required rate through the middle overs, they lost far too many wickets, which left them with far too much to catch up with in the death overs. In the same period, led by half-centuries from Rajat Patidar and Kohli, RCB laid the platform for a death-overs flourish.\n\n- RCB PBKS Score 108/1 89/5 Run-Rate 12.00 9.89 4s/6s 6/6 7/5\n\nRoyal Challengers Bengaluru\n\nPowerplay: The VK Show\n\nPhase score - 56/2 [RR:9.33, 8x4s, 2x6s]\n\nVidwath Kaverappa, on his debut, should have accounted for the dismissal of the RCB's top-4. However, four dropped catches in the powerplay meant that he had only two wickets to his credit - Faf du Plessis and Will Jacks. Generating steep bounce and outswing, he managed to trouble the RCB batters, but a slew of dropped catches gave the visitors repreives as they scored at a fair clip in the first phase.\n\nMiddle: The other VK takes over\n\nPhase score - 108/1 [RR: 12.00., 6x4s, 6x6s]\n\nAfter being troubled early on, Kohli and Patidar took the attack to Kaverappa, slamming the seamer for a couple of sixes soon after the Powerplay. Patidar, who was dropped once again in the eighth over - this time by Jonny Bairstow - smoked three sixes off Rahul Chahar en route to a breezy half-century that set the tone of RCB's innings. After a brief delay due to a hailstorm, Kohli took the assault to the next level in the company of Cameron Green.\n\nDeath: Harshal controls after RCB onslaught\n\nPhase score - 77/4 [RR: 15.40, 7x4s, 8x6s]\n\nKohli pushed his innings to the fifth gear in the final phase of the play. He took the attack to Sam Curran and Arshdeep before the latter's slower one ended his knock eight short of a fabulous century. Dinesh Karthik and Green continued the onslaught before Harshal Patel bowled a tidy final over in which he scalped three wickets and conceded only three runs to ensure RCB didn't breach the 250-run mark.\n\nPunjab Kings\n\nPowerplay: Bairstow, Rossouw power PBKS to strong start\n\nPhase score - 75/2 [RR:12.50, 13x4s, 2x6s]\n\nPunjab Kings were pegged back early with Prabhsimran Singh getting trapped leg before by Swapnil Singh in the first over. They could've had Rilee Roussow dismissed soon after but Mahipal Lomror put down a straightforward chance at backward square leg. The southpaw cashed in on that opportunity and took the attack to Mohammed Siraj in the fourth over, smashing the pacer for 18 runs. Soon after Bairstow also joined the party but was dismissed towards the end of the phase.\n\nMiddle-overs: PBKS stutter against spin\n\nPhase score - 89/5 [RR:9.89, 7x4s, 5x6s]\n\nLed by three strikes by the RCB spinners - Karn Sharma and Swapnil Singh - RCB kept denting PBKS' progress even as their long list of hard hitters continued to keep up with the required rate. To add to it, a terrific diving throw from Kohli to run Shashank Singh out added to the misery of the hosts. Mohammed Siraj ended this phase by trapping Ashutosh Sharma leg-before wicket, leaving Sam Curran to score at more than 15 an over in the death in the company of the lower-order.\n\nDeath: PBKS dismantled\n\nPhase score - 17/3 in 2 overs [RR: 8.50, 3x4s, 0x6s]\n\nLockie Ferguson knocked over Curran, the last possible threat to RCB's total, three balls into the death overs. Siraj broke little sweat to clean up Punjab Kings' tail, as PBKS lost their last three wickets in 12 deliveries to fold well short of the target.\n\nBrief Scores: Royal Challengers Bengaluru 241/7 in 20 overs (Virat Kohli 92, Rajat Patidar 55; Harshal Patel 3-38, Vidwath Kaverappa 2-36) beat Punjab Kings 181 in 17 overs (Rilee Rossouw 61, Shashank Singh 37; Mohammed Siraj 3-37, Swapnil Singh 2-28) by 60 runs\n\nWhat next?\n\nRCB return home and play the first of their two home games against Delhi Capitals on May 12 (Sunday).

Cameron Green (46 off 27) and Dinesh Karthik (18 off 7) provided crucial late surge to propel the visitors to a formidable 241/7.\n\nA stupendous catch running backwards from Faf du Plessis, a sensational off-balance direct-hit run out from Kohli and a crucial spell of 2/29 from Karn Sharma led RCB's turnaround as they bowled PBKS out for 181 in 17 overs.\n\nDefending 242, RCB got off to a good start as Swapnil Singh trapped Prabhsimran Singh LBW in the first over. Rilee Rossouw started off well with consecutive fours off his first two balls. RCB could have had Rossouw early but on a day of drops, Faf du Plessis couldn't hold on to a tough chance after Rossouw smashed one to backward point. The PBKS batter made RCB pay as he went berserk against Mohd. Siraj in the next over, smacking three fours and a six. Jonny Bairstow too switched gears as the pair added 65 runs off just 30 balls before Lockie Ferguson broke the partnership in the last over of the Powerplay, having Bairstow caught at mid off. Faf du Plessis plucked a brilliant catch running backwards to break the rampaging stand as PBKS reached 75/2 at the end of the Powerplay.\n\nRossouw, though, went from strength to strength and brought up his fifty off just 21 balls, in style, with a four and a six off Green. With Rossouw going great guns, captain Faf du Plessis called on the in-form Karn Sharma to do the job, and he obliged his skipper, having Rossouw (61 off 27) caught at long on, bouncing back strongly after being hit for a four and a six earlier in the over. It turned the match around. The wily leg-spinner displayed his bounceback ability once again as he cleaned up Impact Player Jitesh Sharma in his next over after being hit for a six and a four earlier in the over. PBKS lost three in quick succession as Swapnil Singh sent back Liam Livingstone for a duck in the next over. Shashank Singh was looking confident in the middle but a sensational fielding effort brought an end to his 37-run knock (off 19 balls) as Kohli's off-balance direct hit found him short. It was another crucial moment in the match.\n\nRCB kept picking up wickets regularly as Mohd. Siraj trapped Ashutosh Sharma LBW and Lockie Ferguson cleaned up captain Sam Curran to reduce PBKS to 170/8. Siraj then finished it off in the 17th over, sending back Harshal Patel and Arshdeep Singh as RCB cruised to a big win.\n\nEarlier, PBKS won the toss and elected to field. The match got off to an eventful start as Kohli was dropped twice inside the first three overs. Debutant Vidwath Kaverappa travelled a roller-coaster of mixed emotions in his first two overs. He could have had the wicket of Virat Kohli off the third ball of his IPL career as Kohli top-edged one high in the air on the off side, but Ashutosh Sharma, running backwards, couldn't hold on to a tough chance. Du Plessis then added salt to PBKS's woulds bY ending the over with two fours.\n\nKaverappa, though, didn't have to wait long for his maiden wicket as he had Faf du Plessis caught at deep point in his next over. He could have had Kohli again, in the same over, but Rilee Rossouw couldn't hold on to a difficult chance at cover after Kohli had absolutely smashed it with all the power.\n\nKohli and Jacks then upped the ante, smashing a couple of fours and a six off Sam Curran. Kohli's battle at the other end with Kaverappa was developing into a fascinating one. The RCB batter charged down the track and hit the first ball of the fifth over straight down the ground for a six, but Kaverappa bounced back to have the ominous looking Jacks caught at short fine leg with Harshal Patel pulling off a fine catch. Two balls later, Kaverappa could have had his third wicket when Rajat Patidar swung one uppishly to long leg but to the despair and disappointment of Kaverappan, Harshal dropped an easy chance.\n\nPatidar made Harshal pay for the drop as he hit three fours in his first over, which was the last over of the Powerplay as RCB reached 56/2 at the end of the first six overs. The pair went on a six-hitting spree, hitting five sixes in the next two overs.\n\nBut Patidar got lucky in between, as Jonny Bairstow couldn't hold onto a tough chance after Patidar edged one off Rahul Chahar. The pair brought up the 50-run stand off just 21 balls and Patidar too brought up his fifty off 21 balls with a six off Curran. The PBKS captain, though, bounced back hard in the same over and provided the home side some relief as he had the rampaging Patidar (55 off 23) caught behind three balls later, before rain and hail halted play.\n\nPBKS pulled things back a bit post the break, giving away 14 runs off two overs. Kohli then upped the scoring, hitting consecutive fours off Livingstone as he brought up his sixth fifty-plus score of the season. Kohli and Green continued to play some powerful and delightful strokes and added 92 off 45 balls.\n\nKohli, however, couldn't get to his century as he hit a four and a six off Arshdeep but ended up holing out to deep point off the next ball on 92.\n\nDinesh Karthik played a nice little cameo of 18 off 7 balls, but Harshal Patel bowled a brilliant last over, picking up three wickets (Dinesh Karthik, Mahipal Lomror and Cameron Green (46 off 27)) and giving away just three runs as RCB finished on 241/7. RCB introduced Yash Dayal as their Impact Player, replacing Rajat Patidar at the start of the second innings.", "source": {"uri": "pragativadi.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pragativadi: Leading

But the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) have found a way to stitch together three wins on the trot to lift themselves off the bottom of the points table and keep themselves in the playoff race, mathematically at least.\n\nRCB will be up against the Punjab Kings (PBKS), who are languishing below them in eighth place. Both teams have had ugly campaigns so far, but the HPCA Stadium in Dharamsala will add some beauty to a contest that has had a storied history over the last few years in the IPL.\n\nDuring the reverse fixture, Dinesh Karthik and Mahipal Lomror took advantage of some terrible death bowling from PBKS to take RCB to a memorable win in front of their home crowd. After that, Bengaluru went on a terrible losing spree, before finding their feet in the recent past.\n\nPunjab, meanwhile, have meandered along since then, with Shikhar Dhawan dealing with a suspicious injury. Despite constant reports that the regular PBKS skipper will be available for the next game, Sam Curran has been seen at the toss for a sustained period now.\n\nNevertheless, there's enough talent in both teams to guarantee a spicy contest. Can RCB keep their momentum going? Or will PBKS ensure that a second team is eliminated from IPL 2024?\n\nIPL 2024, PBKS vs RCB Win Probability: Bengaluru have momentum on their side\n\nRCB have turned up as the best versions of themselves lately. Their combination, which features four overseas batters in the top six, seems to be working. Faf du Plessis and Co. have also found the right personnel in the bowling department, relying on canny operators and part-time options to get through their overs.\n\nPBKS have dished out a couple of memorable performances, too. They notched up the highest run-chase in T20 history before upsetting the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) at Chepauk, with Jonny Bairstow and Prabhsimran Singh playing vital roles at the top of the order in both games.\n\nHowever, despite the relative strength of their pace attack on paper, Punjab will start this game as the underdogs. Rahul Chahar and Harpreet Brar have bowled well over the last two games, and Harshal Patel has found his rhythm, but Bengaluru have the tools to counter those styles of bowling.\n\nOn the whole, RCB seem to have more bases covered. PBKS are heavily reliant on Bairstow to take them to a win, and while the Englishman has a good record against the three-time finalists, expecting him to single-handedly come up trumps is a tough ask.\n\nA close contest should be on the cards, with Du Plessis and Co. likely to take two points.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sai_krishna@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Sai Krishna", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himachal_Pradesh_Cricket_Association_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Curran", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Curran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahipal_Lomror", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mahipal Lomror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinesh_Karthik", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dinesh Karthik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikhar_Dhawan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shikhar Dhawan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab,_India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prabhsimran_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prabhsimran Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harpreet_Brar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harpreet Brar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harshal_Patel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harshal Patel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Chahar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Chahar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chennai Super Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowled", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowled"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faf_du_Plessis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Faf du Plessis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonny_Bairstow", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jonny Bairstow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting order (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chepauk", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chepauk"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chepauk"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Lawn_Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Lawn Bowling", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin_Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin Bowling", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/7cc09-17152305704123-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548702", "eventUri": "eng-9548702", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Having won four games out of 11, PBKS are placed eighth in the IPL 2024 standings. On the other hand, RCB are currently placed seventh in the IPL 2024 standings with eight points on the board after winning four matches out of 11.\n\nAhead of another exciting clash between these teams, we look at the predicted XIs of both sides.\n\nPrabhsimran Singh will open the innings for PBKS in the absence of Shikhar Dhawan. He eventually found his form in IPL 2024 and has scored 251 runs in 11 matches. With a fifty-plus score and strike rate of 156.88 to his name, the right-hander will aim to guide his team to a brisk start on Thursday.\n\nJonny Bairstow's recent batting performances have been remarkable. Sporting an impressive average of 32.13 and a strike rate of 163.69, he has amassed 257 runs in nine matches. The English wicketkeeper-batter has even notched a century in IPL 2024 and will be determined to challenge RCB's bowlers in front of the home crowd.\n\nRilee Rossouw didn't have an ideal beginning to his IPL 2024 journey, but he has steadily found a bit of form. In five matches, Rossouw has accumulated 79 runs, highlighted by a rapid 43-run cameo against CSK. Having scored at a strike rate of 151.92, the South African international will be determined to make a significant impact against RCB in the upcoming fixture on Thursday.\n\nShashank Singh plays a crucial role in the Punjab Kings' batting lineup. With 315 runs in 11 matches, the hard-hitting batter flaunts an outstanding average of 63 and an impressive strike rate of 165.79. He is the team's top-scorer this season and could be a game-changer in their upcoming match against RCB.\n\nIn the absence of the injured Shikhar Dhawan, Sam Curran will assume the role of captaincy. While Curran's batting performances have been average, his bowling has shone brightly, with 13 wickets in 11 IPL 2024 matches. He will be eager to make significant contributions with both bat and ball in the upcoming match.\n\nJitesh Sharma certainly bolsters the Punjab Kings' batting lineup. Despite a subpar performance with the bat in IPL 2024, having amassed only 128 runs in 11 matches, Sharma's capacity to unleash powerful shots could catch the RCB bowling unit off guard come Thursday.\n\nAshutosh Sharma\n\nAshutosh Sharma has enjoyed a sensational debut IPL season. The skilled batter has been formidable, accumulating 162 runs in just eight matches. With a half-century to his name and an impressive strike rate of 172.34, Sharma has shown signs of being a match-winner. If allowed to bat against RCB, he has the potential to amass crucial runs and accelerate the innings for his team.\n\nHarpreet Brar\n\nHarpreet Brar is set to spearhead PBKS' spin bowling attack in the upcoming match. With six wickets to his credit in 11 matches and a decent economy rate of 7.56, Brar has showcased his bowling prowess. Along with taking wickets, he is also handy in containing the opposition batters. Additionally, he possesses batting skills and can contribute crucial runs lower down the order.\n\nRahul Chahar\n\nRahul Chahar will partner with Harpreet Brar in the spin bowling attack. His diverse spin arsenal has the potential to outfox even the most seasoned batters, leading him to claim eight wickets in six matches this season. Chahar heads into this match fresh from a three-wicket performance against CSK and will look to add to his wickets tally against RCB.\n\nHarshal Patel\n\nHarshal Patel is a key figure in the pace bowling department for Punjab Kings. The right-arm pacer is currently the second-highest wicket-taker in the ongoing IPL edition with 17 scalps from 11 matches. His proficiency in delivering deceptive slower balls will be instrumental in both containing batters and securing vital breakthroughs for PBKS.\n\nKagiso Rabada\n\nKagiso Rabada is expected to lead the Punjab Kings' bowling attack on Thursday. His ability to take wickets during the powerplay and maintain accurate lengths has resulted in 11 scalps in 11 matches this season. Rabada will be eager to secure early dismissals and put pressure on RCB.\n\nVirat Kohli heads into this match on the back of a 27-ball 42 runs in his last match against Gujarat Titans. Kohli's innings included two boundaries and four sixes, showcasing a striking rate of 155.56. With a total of 542 runs in just 11 matches this season, he is the leading run-scorer in IPL 2024 and will look to contribute again on Thursday.\n\nFaf du Plessis (captain)\n\nRCB captain Faf du Plessis will open the innings along with Virat Kohli in the upcoming match against PBKS. Faf has been in decent form in IPL 2024 with 352 runs in 11 matches including three fifty-plus scores while maintaining an impressive strike rate of 172.55. The former Proteas captain will be eager to put up a big score in the upcoming match.\n\nWill Jacks\n\nIn IPL 2024, Will Jacks announced himself with a blazing 41-ball ton against GT. With 177 runs in six matches at an average of 35.40 and a strike rate of 186.32, the English batter has been outstanding. Jacks has also contributed with the ball, claiming two wickets for RCB. The hard-hitting English cricketer will be eager to showcase his power-hitting skills at Dharamshala.\n\nRajat Patidar\n\nTalented batter Rajat Patidar is an important member of the RCB lineup. With a strike rate of 178.53, Patidar has scored 213 runs in 11 matches in IPL 2024. He did not bat well in the previous match, but Rajat will be keen to bounce back with a fiery performance sooner rather than later.\n\nGlenn Maxwell\n\nWith only 36 runs in eight matches, Glenn Maxwell has yet to have a successful outing with the bat in IPL 2024. However, the Australian all-rounder has managed to claim five wickets and is capable of taking games away with the bat when in form, making him a key player for RCB.\n\nCameron Green\n\nMaxwell's compatriot Cameron Green adds depth to RCB's batting as well as bowling department. Green has had a below-par performance with the bat this season but has been impressive with the ball in hand. The Australian all-rounder has taken seven wickets in nine matches and will aim to produce an all-round performance against PBKS.\n\nDinesh Karthik (wicketkeeper)\n\nThe addition of Dinesh Karthik to RCB's starting lineup injects crucial firepower into their already lethal batting lineup. In 11 matches, the wicketkeeper-batter has accumulated 283 runs, including two fifty-plus scores. He also boasts an impressive average of 56.60 and a striking rate of 193.84. Karthik will look to make a significant impact and further bolster his run tally in the upcoming match against Punjab.\n\nSwapnil Singh\n\nSwapnil Singh has made a bit of an impact with ball in hand in IPL 2024. The off-spinner's ability to outsmart batters with his spin variations has led to him taking three wickets in three matches. He could lead the spin-bowling attack for RCB and will aim to improve his wicket tally against PBKS come Thursday.\n\nKarn Sharma\n\nKarn Sharma is an important member of the RCB spin-bowling outfit and has scalped four wickets in five matches. He is likely to play a crucial role in containing PBKS's hard-hitting batters and will try to provide breakthroughs during the middle overs.\n\nMohammed Siraj\n\nMohammed Siraj will spearhead the pace bowling attack for RCB. While the Indian speedster has taken only eight wickets in 10 matches, he has been slightly expensive, conceding at an economy rate of 9.26. Siraj will hope to provide early breakthroughs with the new ball in the upcoming match.\n\nYash Dayal\n\nYash Dayal's inclusion in RCB's playing XI adds an element of anticipation and excitement to the team's bowling lineup. With his versatile skills, Dayal has taken 10 wickets in as many matches. Known for his deceptive bowling variations, Dayal is the team's top wicket-taker and is poised to have a significant impact on the game.", "source": {"uri": "sports.ndtv.com", "dataType": "news",

They were poor in crunch situations, which led to another defeat and they need to improve on multiple fronts to get back into winning ways. Bengaluru, on the other hand, were clinical, had the right game plan and executed them well to pick up a comfortable win.\n\nBatting first, Virat Kohli gave a scintillating start to the visitors. However, two quick wickets of Faf du Plessis and Will Jacks shifted the momentum for a time, but as soon as Rajat Patidar came out to bat, things changed rapidly. The 30-year-old smacked 55 runs off 23 runs, which changed the momentum. After he walked back to the pavilion, Kohli took control of the situation and made 92 runs off 47 balls. Towards the fag end, Cameron Green was brilliant, which helped RCB post a massive total of 241 runs.\n\nAlso Check: Punjab Kings second innings highlights against Royal Challengers Bengaluru in Match 58\n\nWhen it came to the chase, PBKS lost Prabhsimran Singh early but Jonny Bairstow and Rilee Rossouw looked rock solid. However, Bairstow injured himself in the middle at one point and right after that, he got out for 27 runs off 16 balls. Rossouw managed to keep going and eventually made 61 runs off 27 balls. After he got out, wickets fell like a house of cards as RCB picked up a comfortable win in the end. With the ball, Swapnil Singh and Mohammed Siraj were incredible for RCB.\n\n1. King Kohli reigns supreme\n\nIf you can't stop Virat early, it will be too late in the end. That's what happened in Dharamshala with the Punjab Kings. Once he got settled, the star India batter reigned supreme and looked flawless. Even though he missed his century but he was selfless in his approach and maintained a good strike rate, something that has made a lot of noise in recent times.\n\nDuring the initial phase of the tournament, when Patidar was struggling massively, a huge number of fans wanted the team management to drop Patidar and play Suyash Prabhudesai in the playing XI. However, the management kept their faith in Patidar, who is delivering time and again now. Against Punjab, it was the 30-year-old who changed the momentum for RCB, which was extremely vital at one stage. Notably, Patidar once again proved that he is the man for RCB in the middle order.\n\n3. Sixth defeat for PBKS at home\n\nTo succeed in a competition like IPL, home games are extremely important, especially when one is aware of the conditions. However, PBKS lost six out of their seven home games in IPL 2024. They never looked comfortable in the middle against RCB and can barely take out positives. If everything goes correctly, one can expect another overhaul in PBKS.\n\nA lot of positive signs throughout the season, but not enough to get over the line unfortunately. We knew that we had the best side for the rest of the tournament and feel gutted for the team. Gotta keep our heads up, keep learning and keep becoming better. Really enjoyed leading a great bunch of guys, would have loved a few more wins. We had some highs, and some record run-chases as well,. Lots of disappointment and apologize to the fans, we will keep fighting. The ups and downs have been quite tough, but you gotta keep learning and keep working hard.\n\nThat was a good game. We have scored 200-plus in the last 5-6 games. We have had good conversations, we were making the same mistakes over and over again. Needed aggression with the bat. We just spoke about taking wickets. We have 6-7 options in the bowling department. You need some form in your side. With a bit of luck is also required. We had a few guys looking for wickets and runs at the start of the tournament. The boys have shown character to turn it around. Everyone has chipped in with runs and the bowlers are taking wickets. For us it's important to focus on ourselves.We want to stick to the style of play that we want to do, if we do that it'll prove we are a really good team.", "source": {"uri": "crictracker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricTracker"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rilee_Rossouw", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rilee Rossouw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonny_Bairstow", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jonny Bairstow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Jacks", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Will Jacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himachal_Pradesh_Cricket_Association_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajat_Patidar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajat Patidar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faf_du_Plessis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Faf du Plessis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prabhsimran_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prabhsimran Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swapnil_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swapnil Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Siraj", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Siraj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting order (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.crictracker.com/media/attachments/1715279294348_PBKS-vs-RCB.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548702", "eventUri": "eng-9548702", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Meanwhile, PBKS became the second team after Mumbai Indians (MI) to get eliminated from the race.\n\nAfter being asked to bat first, Virat Kohli (92), Rajat Patidar (55), and Cameron Green (46) played well to power RCB to a massive score of 241/7 in 20 overs. Harshal Patel bowled well for the hosts, picking up three wickets in his 4-over spell.\n\nIn reply, Rilee Rossouw (61) hit a blistering half-century and provided a decent platform for PBKS in the steep chase. His departure in the ninth over proved to be a turning point as the Kings lost their way after that. They kept losing wickets at regular intervals and eventually got bundled out for 181 in 17 overs.\n\nFans on social media enjoyed the high-scoring IPL 2024 match between RCB and PBKS on Thursday night. They expressed their reactions by sharing hilarious memes on social media platforms like X and Instagram.\n\nHere are some of the best memes related to the game:\n\n\"We will come back stronger by learning from the mistakes\"- PBKS captain Sam Curran after loss vs RCB in IPL 2024\n\nAfter the conclusion of the match, PBKS skipper Sam Curran reflected on the dismal loss, saying:\n\n\"It's frustrating. A lot of positive signs throughout the tournament but I am gutted with the defeat. I guess we knew what's going to be around and we know what's the best side of the tournament. We will come back stronger by learning from the mistakes.\"\n\nOn PBKS' mixed IPL 2024 campaign, Curran added:\n\n\"I enjoyed leading the great bunch of guys and we will try to finish on a high by winning the next two matches. We apologise to the fans but we will keep fighting . We had a lot of highs by chasing a record score but lost too many tight matches.

However, after RCB raced to 119/3 in 10 overs, the weather gods intervened, forcing a halt in action.\n\nThe loser of this contest will officially be eliminated from playoff contention and the winner needs to win their remaining games along with other results to go their way.\n\nWith the rain interruption, RCB fans were left wondering about their side's chances should the game be abandoned and the points were shared. If the points were shared, the maximum RCB can reach is 13 points at the end of the league stage.\n\nThree teams, Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), Rajasthan Royals (RR), and SunRisers Hyderabad (SRH), are already on 16, 16 and 14 points, respectively. Unfortunately for RCB, two teams on 12 points, Delhi Capitals (DC) and Lucknow Super Giants (LSG), face off next week, meaning one of the two will reach 14 points.\n\nAs a result, RCB will be eliminated if the ongoing PBKS clash is abandoned and the points are shared. Yet, there is one improbable miracle that RCB fans can hope for should they only grab a point in the PBKS encounter.\n\nIf the DC-LSG clash suffers a similar fate and the match is abandoned, RCB can still garner hopes of qualifying for the playoffs if they win out and the results go against all the other competing teams for the 4th spot.\n\nRCB in a dominant position with the bat against PBKS\n\nRCB were sitting pretty on 119/3 in 10 overs against PBKS when rain stopped play at Dharamsala.\n\nDespite losing skipper Faf du Plessis and the big-hitting Will Jacks for 9 and 12, Virat Kohli raced to 42* off 23 deliveries.

Kohli crossed the 600-run mark in the 15th over bowled by Liam Livingstone.\n\nIt marked the fourth instance of the champion batter scoring 600-plus runs in an IPL season.\n\nKohli scored 634 runs in the 2013 IPL season, the first time he scaled the 600-run mark. His next 600+ season was the unforgettable 2016 campaign, where he scored the most runs in a single IPL edition with 973 runs. After a few mediocre seasons, King Kohli returned to his best last season and finished with 639 runs in 14 games.\n\nThe veteran cricketer is the IPL's all-time leading run-scorer with 7,897 runs and has won the Orange Cap once in 2016. He also became the first batter to score 1000+ runs against three teams (CSK, DC & PBKS) in IPL history.\n\nKohli is also the Orange Cap holder this season with 634 runs at an average of 70.44 and a strike rate of 113.51 in 12 outings.\n\nKohli's heroics propel RCB to massive total against PBKS\n\nVirat Kohli's sensational knock ended eight short of a second century this season on 92 in the 18th over of the innings against PBKS.\n\nHowever, with seven boundaries and six maximums in his 47-ball 92, the RCB opener helped the side post a mammoth total of 241/7 in 20 overs. RCB lost Faf du Plessis and Will Jacks inside the five overs but Rajat Patidar walked in at No. 4 and took the PBKS bowlers to the cleaners.\n\nThe right-handed batter scored a brilliant 23-ball 55 and added a crucial 76-run partnership off just 32 deliveries with Kohli. Aussie all-rounder Cameron Green kept the momentum going with a well-paced 46 off 27.\n\nBoth teams entered the contest with four wins in 11 games, meaning the loser will be officially eliminated from playoff contention.\n\nPBKS pulled off a record IPL chase of 262 against KKR and will look to replicate the same to keep their 2024 season alive.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "venkatesh_ravichandran@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Venkatesh Ravichandran", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowled", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bowled"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_Livingstone", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liam Livingstone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chennai Super Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Jacks", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Will Jacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajat_Patidar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rajat Patidar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faf_du_Plessis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Faf du Plessis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-rounder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-rounder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail_Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail Running", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Running", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/7f8d5-17152717979548-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548702", "eventUri": "eng-9548702", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 170, "textEnd": 175}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

With only one team out of the playoffs race so far, fans can expect riveting encounters in their remaining matches as nine teams battle it out for the top four spots. Two teams whose playoff chances are hanging by a loose thread namely RCB and PBKS will clash against each other in Match 58 on Thursday, May 09 at Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium, Dharamsala.\n\nAfter winning just two games out of their first eight matches, Punjab have somehow kept their hopes alive with back-to-back wins against KKR and CSK in their ninth and tenth fixtures. However, they failed to beat the defending champions at their home in their second clash which put them in a precarious situation. They find themselves on the eighth spot on the points table with four wins from 11 matches having eight points to their names.\n\nOn the other hand, RCB have also revived their campaign after six consecutive losses with a hat-trick of wins against SRH and GT. The Faf du Plessis-led side began their campaign with a six-wicket loss against southern rivals CSK but went on to win their second clash against PBKS. However, since then, their depleted bowling was badly exposed against some of the fiercest teams in the competition who gave them a run for their money. Courtesy of some heroic performances from individuals, RCB are still alive in the competition and will look to once again beat PBKS in a must-win encounter.\n\nIPL 2024 Full Coverage | IPL 2024 Points Table and Standings | 2024 IPL Full Schedule\n\nRCB registered their first win of the ongoing season against PBKS in their second fixture. However, when it comes to historical record between the two sides, it's the PBKS who have an upper hand having won 17 out of the 32 matches played between them.\n\nPunjab have been missing the services of their captain Shikhar Dhawan who got ruled out after the fifth fixture of the season against SRH due to a shoulder injury. The southpaw will remain unavailable in the upcoming fixture as well. On the other hand, RCB have no injury concerns heading into the game and are likely to field the same playing XI as their last fixture.\n\nThere has been just one game played at the venue so far in the tournament where CSK beat PBKS by 28 runs. The surface seemed to be on the slower side as batters found it tough to score against the spinners in the middle overs. Seamers also mixed up their pace to take full advantage of the sluggish pitch. However, the upcoming fixture being a day-night affair, the pitch is expected to be a belter of a track for batters as has been the history in Dharamsala. Captain winning thetoss will most likely look to bowl first as has been the trend this season.\n\nJonny Bairstow, Rilee Rossouw, Shashank Singh, Sam Curran (c), Jitesh Sharma (wk), Ashutosh Sharma,

Chasing a massive 242 for victory, PBKS produced a spirited response, reaching 146-5 in 13 overs. Skipper Sam Curran tucked the 4th delivery of the 14th over to deep mid-wicket and looked for a double.\n\nHowever, an agile Kohli was having none of it as he charged in from the deep mid-wicket region and fired a throw that hit the stumps direct, all in one motion, to catch Shashank inches out of the crease at the non-striker's end.\n\nHere is a video of the magical fielding display from Virat Kohli:\n\nShashank's dismissal on 37 off 19 sparked a collapse as PBKS were bowled out for 181 in 17 overs to suffer a 60-run defeat.\n\nThe result officially eliminated PBKS from playoff contention with an eighth defeat in 12 games. As for RCB, the massive win keeps them in the tournament with 10 points in 12 matches.\n\nVirat Kohli's brilliant 92 set up RCB's win over PBKS\n\nBefore his incredible fielding efforts, Virat Kohli produced another batting masterclass to help RCB post a mammoth 241/7 in 20 overs.\n\nThe 35-year-old smashed his 6th 50+ score of the IPL 2024 season, finishing on 92 from 47 deliveries with seven boundaries and six maximums. Kohli is currently the Orange Cap holder with 634 runs at an average of over 70 and a strike rate of 153.51 in 12 outings.\n\nIt was his second half-century against PBKS this season after his 49-ball 77 helped RCB win the first meeting between the sides. His efforts meant RCB won a fourth straight game to keep their slim playoff hopes alive.\n\nKohli also breached the 600-run mark for the fourth time in his illustrious IPL career and became the first batter to score over 1000 runs against 3 teams (CSK, DC & PBKS).\n\nThe champion batter will be back in action when RCB takes on Delhi Capitals (DC) in another do-or-die encounter on Sunday, May 12.\n\nAs for PBKS, they will play for pride in their final two matches against Rajasthan Royals (RR) and SunRisers Hyderabad (SRH).", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "venkatesh_ravichandran@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Venkatesh Ravichandran", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shashank_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shashank Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Curran", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Curran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowled", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bowled"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stump_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stump (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Capitals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delhi Capitals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rajasthan Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chennai Super Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/c46ce-17152794575304-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548702", "eventUri": "eng-9548702", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 214, "textEnd": 219}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-12", "textStart": 2003, "textEnd": 2009}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

The two sides will square off on Thursday, May 9.\n\nThe venue has been playing host to IPL matches this year for the first time since 2013. PBKS, after playing their initial home games at the newly built Maharaja Yadavindra Singh Stadium in Mullanpur, Mohali, shifted bases to Dharamsala.\n\nAs the tournament approaches its business end, PBKS are all set to host RCB for their upcoming encounter. The last time these two teams clashed in an IPL match in Dharamsala was way back in 2013, when PBKS (then Kings XI Punjab) was led by Adam Gilchrist and RCB (then Royal Challengers Bangalore) was led by Virat Kohli.\n\nIn that game, the hosts won the toss and opted to put runs on board first. They faced an early setback as Paul Valthaty was dismissed in the powerplay courtesy of Charl Langeveldt. What followed next was absolute carnage by the home skipper and top-order batter Shaun Marsh.\n\nGilchrist and Marsh took the opposition bowlers to the cleaners and went on to notch up their respective half-centuries. Towards the end of the first innings, the former managed to go past the three-figure mark and ended up hitting 106 runs off 55 deliveries before being dismissed on the penultimate ball.\n\nGilchrist's knock included eight fours and nine sixes as he struck at 192.72. Marsh played a beautiful innings as well, and walked back unbeaten scoring 79 off 49, including seven fours and five sixes. Courtesy of the 206-run second-wicket partnership between the Aussie duo, Punjab posted a humungous 232/2 in their allotted 20 overs.\n\nPBKS bowled out RCB for 121 to win by 111 runs\n\nRCB had a horrid start to their chase as the top-order batting unit faltered inside the powerplay and they were reduced to 34/3 in six overs. Punjab bowlers kept picking wickets at regular intervals, with Piyush Chawla acting as the wrecker in chief. The leg spinner picked up a four-wicket haul and registered figures of 4/17 in his four-over quota.\n\nRyan Harris (3 wickets), Shalabh Srivastava (2 wickets), and Valthaty (1) contributed equally well as RCB were held to 121 in 17 overs. As a result, the Adam Gilchrist-led side bagged a massive 111-run win.\n\nIn the ongoing IPL 2024, both PBKS and RCB are vying for a spot in the playoff amid tight competition from several other teams in contention. While the latter are placed eighth, the former are just above them at seventh place. Both teams have eight points from 11 games played so far but RCB have a better NRR as compared to PBKS.\n\nWith the competition increasing with every passing game, RCB and PBKS will have to win all their remaining encounters to remain in contention for a spot in the top four.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Punjab, who have won just one out of their six home matches so far in the league, will be under pressure playing at Dharamshala while the Faf du Plessis-led side, which has managed just four wins in 11 matches, will face the heat as well. The team that manages to keep their calm in the middle is likely to get the job done but nevertheless, a high-voltage clash is expected.\n\nIn their last match, RCB defeated Gujarat Titans by four wickets. Their bowlers were terrific and the opening duo of du Plessis and Virat Kohli gave a rapid start. A change in batting template was observed in the last couple of matches and if they manage to keep up with that, RCB can extend their winning run. The bowlers, however, need to deliver consistently.\n\nPunjab, on the other hand, have been inconsistent throughout the tournament. Shashank Singha and Ashutosh Sharma were incredible towards the start but they have lost gas while the likes of Jonny Bairstow and Sam Curran haven't delivered much with the bat. The form of Prabhsimran Singh is a massive boost to the team while with the ball, Rahul Chahar, Harpreet Brar and Arshdeep Singh have done a good job so far. Harshal Patel too has been good but like most PBKS playes, he isn't consistent.\n\nPunjab Kings - Jonny Bairstow, Rilee Rossouw, Shashank Singh, Sam Curran (c), Jitesh Sharma (wk), Ashutosh Sharma, Harpreet Brar, Harshal Patel, Rahul Chahar, Kagiso Rabada, Arshdeep Sing\n\nRoyal Challengers Bengaluru -

So we needed a bit of time to settle but once Cameron and I did, I thought 'I have to go again.' The wicket was a bit two-paced, the ones pitching on the grassy ones were skidding on,\" Kohli said.\n\nALSO READ: KL Rahul Likely To Lead LSG In Last Two Matches Of The Season Amid Captaincy Change Rumours\n\nKohli, who became the first player to go past 600 runs this season, made sure that RCB posted their fourth-highest-ever IPL total.\n\nNotably, the match between RCB and Punjab Kings is a crucial one as the loser of the game will get knocked out of the race to make it to the playoffs.\n\nKohli went past 600 runs for the fourth time in his IPL career, equalling KL Rahul for the most number of 600-plus totals in a season in the tournament.\n\nThe star batter now has 634 runs to his name in 12 matches at an impressive strike-rate of 153.", "source": {"uri": "english.jagran.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jagran English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himachal_Pradesh_Cricket_Association_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat_Titans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gujarat Titans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ahmedabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ahmedabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab,_India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "K.

RCB have won three consecutive games while PBKS have emerged victorious in two out of their last three.\n\nYet, PBKS had their two-match winning streak broken in their last outing against Chennai Super Kings (CSK) at Dharamsala.\n\nWhile, PBKS still maintains an overall edge of 17-15 against RCB in the IPL, the Bengaluru-based franchise has won the last two meetings, including the one earlier in the season.\n\nA closely contested game saw RCB thrill the home fans with a four-wicket win off the final over.\n\nWith a win being a non-negotiable to avoid an embarrassing 10th consecutive exit before the playoffs, PBKS will look to keep their slim hopes alive against the RCB resurgence.\n\nOn that note, let us look at 3 things PBKS must do to upstage RCB in the IPL 2024 clash in Dharamsala.\n\n#1 Break Virat Kohli's recent love affair with PBKS through Kagiso Rabada\n\nIt is stating the obvious that dismissing Virat Kohli is paramount for a team's chances to win. However, the statement holds more truth than usual for PBKS.\n\nWhile the 35-year-old averages only 33.50 against Punjab in IPL history, the numbers have shot up over the last three seasons. Kohli has averaged a sensational 65.70 at a strike rate of almost 142 in four games since 2022.\n\nFurther evidence of his dominance against PBKS is an average of 68 in RCB's two wins during that period. The champion batter was the Player of the Match in the first meeting between the two sides this season, scoring a 49-ball 77 in a tense run-chase.\n\nKohli is also the leading scorer of IPL 2024 with 542 runs at an average of almost 68 in 11 outings. All this makes dismissing him priority No.1 for the PBKS bowlers.\n\nAce pacer Kagiso Rabada might be their best option to dislodge the RCB stalwart, thanks to his excellent record against Kohli in the IPL. The South African pacer has dismissed Kohli times, with the champion batter averaging only 12 at a strike rate of 112.5 in their IPL duels.\n\nConsidering his death-bowling woes, using Rabada for an extensive spell at the top might be PBKS' best bet to remove Virat Kohli and inch ahead against RCB.\n\n#2 PBKS travel as far as their top order takes them\n\nPBKS' sub-par season thus far has been largely due to their brittle and inconsistent top order. While a T20 game is 40 overs long, the overall performances of the Punjab-based franchise have often mirrored their top order's showing.\n\nJust the last few games is concrete evidence of that, with their wins coming in matches the top order sets the tone. In their latest outing against CSK, PBKS were immediately reduced to 9/2 in two overs and a 28-run defeat followed.\n\nHowever, in their back-to-back wins before the CSK clash, PBKS were off to starts of 83/1 in nine overs and 93/0 in six overs.\n\nThe absence of regular skipper Shikhar Dhawan has hurt PBKS badly at the top, with the side trying numerous options in the opening position, resulting in a lack of stability.\n\nThat Shashank Singh, who batted predominantly in the lower middle order, boasts the best average of 63 among PBKS batters is more the problem than the solution. None of the other specialist batters average 35 this season, adding to PBKS' woes with the willow.\n\nFor them to have a chance of dethroning RCB, the top-order batters must come to the party and deliver the goods.\n\n#3 PBKS spin twins must control the middle overs\n\nAs much as the three-pronged pace attack of Kagiso Rabada, Arshdeep Singh and Harshal Patel hog the limelight, the spin duo of Rahul Chahar and Harpreet Brar have been the difference makers for good and bad in PBKS' IPL 2024 season.\n\nWhile Chahar has eight wickets in six outings, Brar has picked up six scalps in 11 matches this season. However, their averages and economies in PBKS' wins and losses make for a staggering reading.\n\nBrar has conceded runs at an economy of just 6.54 in PBKS' wins and shoots up to almost 8.20 in their losses. Yet, Chahar's massive difference in numbers during victories and defeats makes him the key figure in their bowling attack.\n\nThe leggie has traveled at a dismal economy of 10.12 in PBKS defeats, while just 6.83 in their wins. It is crystal clear that PBKS' performances go as the two spinners bowl in tandem.\n\nThe duo bowling economical spells with control on an uncertain RCB middle-order could be where PBKS assert their domination and seize control of the contest.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "venkatesh_ravichandran@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Venkatesh Ravichandran", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chennai Super Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Batting order (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kagiso_Rabada", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kagiso Rabada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Africa national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harpreet_Brar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harpreet Brar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arshdeep_Singh_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arshdeep Singh (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harshal_Patel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harshal Patel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shashank_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shashank Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Chahar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Chahar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikhar_Dhawan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shikhar Dhawan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Lotteries", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Lotteries", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Educational", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Educational", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/3a152-17152458864078-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548702", "eventUri": "eng-9548702", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 158, "textEnd": 163}], "sentiment": 0.5372549019607844, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Virat Kohli rose to the occasion for RCB in the must-win game, playing a match-winning knock of 92 (47). He received support from Rajat Patidar (55) and Cameron Green (46) in the middle order.\n\nRilee Rossouw (61) and Shashank Singh (37) fought for PBKS in the chase but didn't get much backing from the others.

He made a strong comeback in his second spell and wrapped up the tail quickly by picking up three wickets.

Scoring 240 after losing the toss. The method and the aggression is really good to see. We have had some conversations as we felt we were making the same mistakes over and over again. The aggression with the bat was something we wanted to change. You can't just play normal T20 cricket these days.\"\n\nFaf continued:\n\n\"The way we started, we have a few guys were looking for runs. You need guys with character to turn it around. There are few guys now with some form behind them. We want to keep playing in the manner we have been doing. We have proven how good a team we are in the last four games.

However, Kohli remained strong at the crease.\n\nWill Jacks, who played a pivotal role in RCB's recent victory, only contributed 12 runs this time. Rajat Patidar stepped up, forging a robust 76-run partnership with Kohli, propelling the team from 43/2 to 119/3 within the first 10 overs.\n\nPunjab Kings' fielding performance was lackluster, as they dropped several catches that could have saved crucial runs. Despite being dropped by Ashutosh Sharma at 0 and 10 respectively, Kohli capitalized on his chances, scoring a brilliant 92 and extending his lead in the race for the orange cap.\n\nDebutant Vidwath Kaverappa made an impression by taking 2 early wickets, dismissing both Faf du Plessis and Will Jacks. His delivery to Kohli also posed a threat, but the skipper managed to survive and capitalize on the opportunity.\n\nKohli and Cameron Green built another substantial partnership of 92 runs, guiding RCB to a competitive total of 241/7 in their allotted 20 overs as they aim to maintain their momentum in the tournament.\n\nIn reply, it wasn't a pleasant start to the chase for Punjab as they lost opener Prabhsimran Singh in the first over at just 6 runs courtesy of a Swapnil Singh delivery. It was Prabh's opening partner Jonny Bairstow and Rilee Rossouw who started to put the pressure back on RCB with a 65-run partnership but failed to extend it further into the game.\n\nRossouw's 27-ball 61 did give PBKS a reasonable total to chase format the 9-over mark. However, he remained the top scorer for the hosts on the night as 2 quick wickets each by spinners Karn Sharma and Swapnil Singh helped RCB restrict them to just 181 in the end.\n\nPacers Mohd Siraj and Lockie Ferguson also took 3 and 2 wickets respectively in what was a brilliant bowling display by the visitors.\n\nThe win meant that RCB had their playoff hopes alive while Sam Curran and Co. will only be playing for pride as they became the 2nd side to be mathematically out of the playoff spots.", "source": {"uri": "news24online.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News24"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shashwat_nishant@news24online.com", "name": "Shashwat Nishant", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Jacks", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Will Jacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Curran", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Curran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerplay_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Powerplay (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faf_du_Plessis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Faf du Plessis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crease_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crease (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajat_Patidar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rajat Patidar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caught", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caught"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prabhsimran_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prabhsimran Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rilee_Rossouw", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rilee Rossouw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karn_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karn Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swapnil_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swapnil Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonny_Bairstow", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jonny Bairstow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockie_Ferguson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lockie Ferguson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab,_India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://news24online.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/PBKS-vs-RCB-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548702", "eventUri": "eng-9548702", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 390, "textEnd": 395}], "sentiment": 0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

In a high-scoring encounter at the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium in Dharamsala, RCB put up a dominant display to win by 60 runs and force PBKS to pack their bags along with Mumbai Indians.\n\nHaving lost the toss and asked to bat first, RCB got off to a shaky start with debutant pace bowler Vidhwath Kaverappa shining with the new ball. He drew first blood by dismissing rival skipper Faf du Plessis and picked up his second wicket in the form of Will Jacks. Had the PBKS fielders not come up with slippery hands, he could have claimed a couple of more wickets in the powerplay.\n\nVirat Kohli, who was dropped for a duck in the very first over, stitched a crucial partnership with Rajat Patidar and brought RCB back into the game. Kohli's scintillating 92, Rajath Patidar's brilliant half-century knock and Cameron Green's impactful cameo helped RCB post a 240+ total. Jonny Bairstow and Rilee Rossouw gave them a flying start in reply but the RCB bowlers put their team in command with timely strikes.\n\nAlso Check: Who is Vishwath Kaverrappa?\n\nWith Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) beating Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) in match 57, the minimum cut-off point for playoff qualification is now 14. RCB currently have 10 points after their latest 60-run win against PBKS and they have two more matches left to reach 14.\n\nRCB's next two matches are against Delhi Capitals (DC) and Chennai Super Kings (CSK). They need to win both of those games to stay in the hunt for the next round, but qualification is still far from assured, thanks to a dreadful start to the campaign.\n\nAlthough RCB have 14 points in their account (if they win their remaining matches), they need the results of other teams to go their way to make it to the playoffs as the net run rate (NRR) will play a big role. Considering the current situation, RCB can aim for the fourth playoff spot and can hope for CSK to lose at least two of their matches.\n\nAlso Check: IPL 2024 Points Table\n\nThe defending champions currently have 12 points and two defeats in the remaining three matches would mean they would end up with 14 points and if RCB can oust them based on NRR, they could qualify for the playoffs.", "source": {"uri": "crictracker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricTracker"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himachal_Pradesh_Cricket_Association_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka_cricket_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karnataka cricket team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faf_du_Plessis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Faf du Plessis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toss_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toss (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Jacks", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Will Jacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rilee_Rossouw", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rilee Rossouw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajat_Patidar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rajat Patidar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerplay_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Powerplay (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chennai Super Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonny_Bairstow", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jonny Bairstow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Duck (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Capitals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delhi Capitals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_run_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Net run rate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.crictracker.com/media/attachments/1715280729614_PBKS-vs-RCB.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548702", "eventUri": "eng-9548702", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

He also said that at this stage of his career, the quality of his game and batting matters more over his runs.\n\nA fine half-century by Rilee Rossouw went in vain as Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) bowlers delivered a brilliant performance to bundle out Punjab Kings (PBKS) for just 181 runs and secure a 60-run win at Dharamsala on Thursday.\n\nSpeaking in the post-match presentation, Virat said, \"Still quality over quantity. More so at this stage of my career. Understanding your game over so many years allows you to practice but still stay switched on. And still aiming to improve aspects of your game that you want to get better on. I brought out the slog-sweep to the spinners. I know I can hit it as I have done it in the past. I know I need to take risks. It takes more conviction to remove the thought 'What if I get out?'.\"\n\n\"I am trying to keep up with the strike rate for me and the team. The only way to go through a tournament is to be honest with ourselves. We had those losses on the trot, we just had a honest conversation. We needed to pull up our socks. That game against KKR went down to the wire. We wanted to play for our self-respect. We just can't go out there and play in such a way and disappoint our fans. The confidence is back and we are on a roll. We have to depend on several other factors (for playoffs qualification),\" he added.\n\nComing to the game, PBKS opted to field first after winning the toss. After the dismissal of skipper Faf Du Plessis (9) and Will Jacks (12) early, Virat (92 in 47 balls, with seven fours and six sixes) and Rajat Patidar (55 in 23 balls, with three fours and six sixes) steadied the RCB's ship with a 76-run stand, keeping the strike rate high. Then, a fine knock by Cameron Green (46 in 27 balls, with five fours and a six) and his 92-run stand with Virat powered RCB to 241/7 in their 20 overs.\n\nHarshal Patel (3/38) was the pick of the bowlers for PBKS. Vidwath Kaverappa (2/36) also did fine on his debut.\n\nIn the run-chase of 242 runs, Rilee Rossouw (61 in 27 balls, with nine fours and three sixes), Shashank Singh (37 in 19 balls, with four boundaries and two sixes) and Jonny Bairstow (27 in 16 balls, with four boundaries and a six) looked dangerous, but lost their wickets on crucial stages.\n\nThe rest of the batters could not really put up a fight and lost the game by 60 runs as PBKS bundled out for 181 runs.\n\nMohammed Siraj was the top bowler for RCB with 3/43. Karn Sharma, Lockie Ferguson and Swapnil Singh also took two wickets. Virat got the Player of the Match award.

Mentally it relaxes you,\" he said.\n\nRilee Rossouw gave Punjab a promising start, putting on 65 runs for the second wicket with Jonny Bairstow (27).\n\nRossouw, who belted his first half-century of the season, looked set for a bigger score but took a hit on his chin and was out the next ball off Karn Sharma for 61.\n\nHe hit three sixes and nine fours in his 27-ball innings.\n\nAfter Rossouw's dismissal in the ninth over, none of the Punjab batsmen could stand up to the challenge, with the team being bowled out for 181 in 17 overs.\n\nEarlier, Kohli stitched a 76-run partnership with Patidar for the third wicket after Bengaluru were put in to bat.\n\nPatidar looked in fine touch, hitting six sixes and three fours before being caught behind off Curran.\n\nThe leading run-getter of the season, Kohli went on to play some delectable shots including an imperious one-handed six over long off.\n\nKohli also put on 92 runs with Green but fell short of a century after he was caught at deep extra cover off Arshdeep Singh.\n\nHe smashed six sixes and seven fours during his 47-ball 92 at a strike rate of 196.\n\n\"Still quality over quantity. More so at this stage of my career. Understanding your game over so many years allows you to practise but still stay switched on,\" Kohli said.\n\n\"And still aiming to improve aspects of your game that you want to get batter on. I brought out the slog-sweep to the spinners. I know I can hit it as I've done it in the past. I know I need to take risks. Takes more conviction and to remove the thought 'what if I get out?' Means I can improve my strike rate in the middle overs.\"\n\nBengaluru, who registered their fourth win in a row, saw their innings being interrupted briefly by a spell of rain and hailstorm.\n\nBrief scores:\n\nRoyal Challengers Bengaluru beat Punjab Kings by 60 runs.\n\nRoyal Challengers Bengaluru 241/7 oin 20 overs (Virat Kohli 92, Rajat Patidar 55, Cameron Green 46;

The Faf du Plessis-led side secured a comfortable 60-run win over the Punjab Kings (PBKS) in Dharamshala on Thursday, May 9.\n\nRCB posted a mammoth score of 241-7 after being put into bat first by PBKS skipper Sam Curran. Virat Kohli led from the front with a brilliant 92 and was aided by quickfire innings from Rajat Patidar and Cameron Green towards the end. This marked the highest score at the venue when it came to the shortest format.\n\nPBKS made a bright start to the run chase courtesy of Jonny Bairstow and Rille Rossouw. But the steep required rate showed its impact as they began to lose wickets at regular intervals, and could only muster 181 runs before being all out. The defeat officially eliminates PBKS from the playoff race.\n\nFans reacted to RCB still somehow being in contention after losing seven of their first eight matches this season. Here are some of the reactions on Twitter:\n\n\"This RCB with nothing to lose mindset is more dangerous than CSK MI and SRH combined,\" one fan remarked\n\n\"973 would've actually been within reach if RCB had qualified,\" one tweet read\n\n\"4 consecutive wins feels so weird as an rcb fan, hardly been there,\" another tweet read\n\n\"The boys have shown character to turn it around\" - RCB skipper Faf du Plessis\n\nRCB's winning streak began with a win over their Southern rivals, Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH). Following that, they completed the double over the Gujarat Titans (GT) and now completed the double over the Punjab Kings (PBKS). They had already won the reverse fixture in Bengaluru earlier this season.\n\n\" Yeah it was a really good game. Scoring 240 after losing the toss. The method and the aggression is really good to see. We have had some conversations as we felt we were making the same mistakes over and over again. The aggression with the bat was something we wanted to change. You can't just play normal T20 cricket these days,\" Du Plessis said during the post-match presentation.\n\n\"We spoke about how to get more wickets in the powerplay. We challenged a few members. We went to different resources which have worked pretty well. I think you understand that you need some form. The way we started, we have a few guys were looking for runs.

Even Mumbai Indians, with just four wins from 12 games, still have a slim chance, albeit a complex one. Historically, 16 points have often secured a playoff spot, but with the league expanding to ten teams, this threshold is no longer reliable. Consequently, teams like KKR and RR, despite sitting on 16 points, cannot afford to relax. On the other hand, PBKS and RCB can only reach a maximum of 14 points, meaning they heavily rely on other results for qualification.\n\nIn this high-stakes scenario, PBKS and RCB meet in Dharamsala for what is essentially a do-or-die encounter, with the loser joining Mumbai Indians in a position where they can only achieve a maximum of 12 points. This match epitomizes the divergent paths these two teams have taken leading up to this crucial game. Although Punjab Kings have only secured four wins from 11 games so far, the results fail to capture how close they were to victory in many of their seven defeats. While top-order collapses have been a recurring issue, concerns also linger over their death bowling in other losses.\n\nAt present, Punjab occupies the eighth position in the standings, having secured four victories and suffered seven defeats. Their aim is to clinch a triumph against RCB to climb higher in the IPL 2024 leaderboard.\n\nRCB's performance has undergone a significant transformation between their initial six matches and their recent five encounters.\n\nTheir batting lineup has notably improved since their loss to Sunrisers Hyderabad by a narrow 25-run margin in a chase of 288. In their last five games, RCB's lowest total was 152, achieved while chasing 148 against Gujarat Titans in Bengaluru. The resurgence can be attributed to Faf du Plessis returning to form and a consistent top four comprising Virat Kohli, du Plessis, Will Jacks, and Rajat Patidar.\n\nDu Plessis has recorded two half-centuries in the last five matches, leading to a quicker run-scoring rate in the initial six overs. RCB's run rate during the powerplay in the last five matches (12.3) significantly surpasses that of the first six games (8.27). This allows players like Jacks and Patidar to bat during the middle overs, as the additional risks taken early on have often resulted in wickets but have ultimately favored RCB, evident in their improved run rate. With more proficient spin-hitters at the crease, RCB's run rate during the middle overs since April 15 has increased to 11.03 compared to 8.41 in the earlier games.\n\nAnother consequence of this batting revival is that Kohli, who has been consistently performing throughout IPL 2024, now has the freedom to play more aggressively, as indicated by the rise in his strike rate from 141.77 in the first six games to 158.15 in the last five matches. This all contributes to why the upcoming match against PBKS might be arriving at an opportune moment for RCB.\n\nOn the contrary, Royal Challengers Bengaluru appears to have regained momentum. With four wins and seven losses in 11 matches, RCB currently holds the seventh spot in the standings. They aspire to extend their winning streak and secure their fourth consecutive victory of the season.\n\nThe recent absence of pressure, as suggested by Faf in post-match presentations, might have contributed to RCB's resurgence. With qualification prospects appearing slim, RCB has played with greater freedom, particularly in their batting displays. Faf's resurgence in form, coupled with the addition of Will Jacks, has injected vigor into the batting order. Moreover, the bowling unit, previously lacking direction and discipline, has shown improvement in their strategies over the last three games.\n\nIn the unpredictable realm of T20 cricket, the differing trajectories of both teams hold little significance as they find themselves in similar situations. While not officially labeled as such, this match effectively serves as a knockout encounter for both teams.\n\nPBKS have demonstrated their prowess as formidable travelers, yet their performances at home haven't been as reassuring. Over the last two seasons, they've had three home venues - Mohali, Dharamsala, and the recent addition, Mullanpur - the highest number among all teams. In IPL 2024, while they've secured victories in three out of five away games, they've only managed to win one out of six matches at home. This places PBKS with the lowest percentage of home wins over the past two seasons, and their upcoming clash against RCB marks their final match in Dharamsala for IPL 2024.\n\nPunjab's aggressive batting approach led to an astonishing run chase against table-toppers KKR, resulting in the highest T20 chase ever witnessed. Much of their batting reliance has been on younger players like Shashank Singh and Ashutosh Sharma, who had to shoulder the burden after early setbacks. While both have showcased their talent, particularly Shashank, it was the return to form of Jonny Bairstow that truly bolstered Punjab's lineup. Following their remarkable triumph over KKR at Eden Gardens, they delivered another memorable win against CSK at Chepauk. However, the subsequent loss to the defending champions at Dharamsala dented Punjab's aspirations. Despite possessing a skilled roster, their ability to handle pressure will ultimately determine their fate.\n\nPBKS now face the challenge of confronting an RCB squad riding a three-match winning streak. Often considered the IPL's perennial underdogs, RCB had a solitary win in their first eight games, seemingly destined for an early exit. However, Faf du Plessis' team turned the tide with consecutive victories, starting with an upset over Sunrisers Hyderabad followed by two convincing wins over Gujarat Titans. These triumphs, characterized by dominant performances, have breathed new life into the team.\n\nAs the race for playoffs intensifies, a defeat for either team would significantly increase the pressure, pushing them closer to elimination.\n\nThe HPCA stadium in Dharamsala typically favors the bowlers, particularly the pacers who can extract movement from the surface. Therefore, a low-scoring match is anticipated. Opting to bowl first and restricting the opposition to a below-par total could prove to be a strategic advantage.\n\nIn the three IPL matches held at Dharamsala since last year, teams winning the toss have predominantly chosen to bowl first, yet only once has this decision translated into a victory. Even in PBKS' previous match at the venue this season, Chennai Super Kings effectively defended a total of 167 runs. The temperature in Dharamsala is expected to be in the early twenties.\n\nThe first game of the season witnessed a slower surface, offering assistance to seamers early on and spinners later in the innings. However, since that was a day game, the venue historically tends to provide better conditions for batsmen during night matches. Nevertheless, there should still be some assistance for pacers with the new ball.\n\nIn the Punjab Kings camp, Shikhar Dhawan's absence due to non-travel leaves the team likely unchanged from their recent successful outings. This means they will probably maintain their current combination, with Jonny Bairstow set to play a pivotal role, especially considering his exceptional track record against Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB). Bairstow's history against RCB is remarkable, featuring a century and two fifties in just five innings, accumulating 261 runs at an impressive strike rate of 177.55.\n\nNotably, he also boasts a commanding strike rate of 216 against RCB's powerplay specialist Mohammed Siraj, having scored 54 runs off 25 balls with one dismissal. Punjab Kings will heavily rely on Bairstow's consistent performances against RCB to provide them with a strong start and lay a solid foundation for their innings. While there's a slight possibility of Liam Livingstone's return, it seems improbable given their recent success with the current lineup.\n\nFor Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB), Glenn Maxwell's recent return to action saw him contribute with a wicket in their victory over Gujarat Titans in Ahmedabad, although he didn't get a chance to bat. However, in the subsequent fixture, he faced disappointment with a duck, continuing his lean patch. RCB faces a decision whether to persist with Maxwell or introduce Reece Topley and his varied bowling options, particularly on a surface that offered assistance to slower bowlers in the previous PBKS-CSK match. Additionally, there's a possibility of a swap between impact players Rajat Patidar and Yash Dayal.\n\nRajat Patidar has displayed an aggressive intent between overs 7-15, boasting a striking rate of 183. Despite this, he has also been dismissed seven times in 100 deliveries. His approach against spin will be crucial for RCB, especially considering the form of Punjab's spin duo, Rahul Chahar and Harpreet Brar. Given RCB's current three-match winning streak, it's unlikely for them to make significant changes to their lineup, thus maintaining consistency.\n\nIn the previous encounter between PBKS and RCB, Harpreet Brar emerged as Punjab's most economical bowler, producing outstanding figures of 2 for 13. Despite RCB's aggressive run rate, Brar managed to dismiss key players like Rajat Patidar and Glenn Maxwell. However, RCB's failure to post a challenging total undermined the impact of Brar's performance. Interestingly, RCB has struggled against left-arm orthodox spinners in IPL 2024, scoring slower than any other team except Gujarat Titans. With one-third of his 24 IPL wickets coming against RCB, Brar poses a significant threat to their playoff aspirations.\n\nBefore making his IPL debut, Will Jacks predominantly played as an opener in T20 cricket, with 131 of his 155 innings coming in that role. However, since joining RCB, he has been assigned the No. 3 position and has shown glimpses of promise despite mixed returns. While four of his six innings have yielded single-digit scores, he has also notched up a brilliant 55 and an unbeaten century. Against a formidable bowling attack, which has been the second-most economical in the first 16 overs of matches (powerplay and middle overs) and the most economical in the first ten overs in IPL 2024, Jacks faces a challenging task.", "source": {"uri": "technosports.co.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechnoSports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings",

Royal Challengers Bengaluru keep their tournament hopes alive with a dominant 60-run victory at Dharamsala. In the evening clash, Punjab Kings won the toss and chose to field first. Debutant Vidhwath Kaverappa impressed with his bowling, despite three dropped catches and Virat Kohli's survival on two occasions. Kaverappa claimed the wickets of Faf du Plessis and Will Jacks, finishing with 2/36.\n\nCapitalising on the dropped chances, Kohli led an aggressive charge, supported by Rajat Patidar's explosive half-century off just 21 balls. The duo shared a crucial 76-run partnership before Patidar's dismissal by Sam Curran halted play briefly due to a hailstorm.\n\nKohli continued his stellar form, smashing 92 off 47 balls, including 7 fours and 6 sixes, in a partnership of 92 runs with Cameron Green. Harshal Patel's late flurry and Dinesh Karthik's cameo propelled RCB to 241/7, the highest T20 score at Dharamsala.\n\nIn response, Punjab Kings lost early wickets despite a promising start from Jonny Bairstow and Rilee Rossouw. Rossouw's half-century and Shashank Singh's brisk knock were not enough as RCB spinners led by Swapnil Singh and Karn Sharma struck crucial blows.\n\nVirat Kohli's brilliant run-out of Shashank Singh epitomised RCB's fielding effort.

RCB also made a huge comeback with three successive wins after losing six matches in a row.\n\nIPL 2024 PBKS vs RCB: Bowling Squad Comparison\n\nPunjab have a pacer-heavy squad in this season. Arshdeep Singh, Kagiso Rabada, and Harshal Patel all remain expensive despite getting wickets regularly. In the spin department, Rahul Chahar and Harpreet Brar are in decent form. Chahar picked six wickets in his last three matches.\n\nFor RCB, it was always the batters who got all the limelight. A highly batting-heavy team throughout their history maintained their reputation. Yash Dayal, Mohammed Siraj and Cameron Green are the only bowlers from RCB in the top 50 wicket-takers list of the season. Karn Sharma and Vijaykumar Vyshak will be the most probable spinner options for the Bengaluru side.\n\nIPL 2024 PBKS vs RCB: Who Will be the Top Four Wicket-takers in Match 58?\n\nHarshal Patel (PBKS): The Indian right-arm medium-fast bowler is in the second position in the race for the Purple Cap with 17 wickets. The 33-year-old, despite leaking too many runs, has been able to get wickets in the slog overs. He has 11 wickets only from the slog overs. Against the powerful RCB batting line-up, his skill will be important for Punjab.\n\nArshdeep Singh (PBKS): The 25-year-old youngster is the second-highest wicket-taker for Punjab with 15 wickets. The left-arm medium-fast bowler can be crucial against the heavily right-handed RCB batting line-up. along with skipper Sam Curran, it will be a challenge for him to get an early breakthrough during the powerplay overs.\n\nYash Dayal (RCB): With 10 wickets in 10 matches the 26-year-old is a key element in the RCB's sudden comeback. After a below-average start to the season, the left-arm medium-fast bowler has been brilliant in the last few matches. A few early wickets from the Punjab top-order can be detrimental for the host, and for this, the Challengers will be highly dependent on him.\n\nMohammed Siraj (RCB): The 30-year-old right-arm medium-fast bowler is yet to shine up in this IPL. With only 8 wickets so far, Siraj is the only seasoned pacer in the squad. It is high time for him to step up for the team. As he is selected to represent India in T20 WC 2024, a good performance from him will be hoped for.\n\nFor both the teams all the matches are now final. To qualify for the playoffs the most basic criteria is to win all of the upcoming matches along with improving the run rates. RCB will certainly be confident about the fixture due to their recent forms, but PBKS is also known for being unpredictable. Hence, a highly competitive battle can be expected from these two belligerents.", "source": {"uri": "mykhel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "myKhel.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "prateek_mascharak@mykhel.com", "name": "Prateek Mascharak", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab,_India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arshdeep_Singh_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arshdeep Singh (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himachal_Pradesh_Cricket_Association_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harshal_Patel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harshal Patel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chennai Super Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vijaykumar_Vyshak", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vijaykumar Vyshak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yash_Dayal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yash Dayal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harpreet_Brar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harpreet Brar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kagiso_Rabada", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kagiso Rabada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karn_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karn Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Chahar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Chahar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Siraj", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Siraj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Curran", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Curran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/Introduction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/Introduction", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Collecting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Collecting", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.mykhel.com/img/2024/05/harshal-patel-kagiso-rabada-1200-1715219550.jpg?09052024073049", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548702", "eventUri": "eng-9548702", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 131, "textEnd": 136}], "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

But rarely has an almost-hundred been so devastating. Laced with six sixes and seven boundaries, 92 off 47 balls was exactly the kind of platform RCB needed to pile up 241/7 against Punjab Kings at Dharamsala before their bowlers held their nerve to close out a 60-run win and stay in the hunt for the playoffs.\n\nBut Kohli shouldn't have even opened his account. Ashutosh Sharma had ample time to get into a good position after Kohli's miscued hoick off Vidwath Kaverappa sent the ball swirling in the air. But he barely got a hand to it.\n\nGiven a life, Kohli made the most of it as RCB scored 119 in the first 10 overs and 122 in the next 10 after a rain-forced break. Kohli paced his innings like only he can -- his first two sixes coming in the initial 6.1 overs before taking the aerial route again from the 15th over. If his fifty came in 32 balls, the next 42 came off 15.\n\n\"It was important for me to keep up the strike rate right through,\" Kohli told the broadcasters during the innings break. \"There was a two-paced feel with the new ball. We thought anything over 230 would be a good total here. That was the only mindset.\"\n\nAt that stage of the tournament where points alone may not carry a team through to the IPL playoffs, strike rate has assumed critical importance. RCB didn't skimp on that front. If Kohli's strike rate of 195.74 was exhilarating, simply mindblowing was the way Rajat Patidar dismantled Punjab Kings' bowling with a 23-ball 55. Also dropped on zero, Patidar carted six sixes -- half of them off Rahul Chahar -- as RCB rode a 27-ball 46 from Cameron Green and a seven-ball 18 from Dinesh Karthik to score their fourth-highest IPL total, and their highest away from home.\n\nPressed to maintain a rate of over 12 runs, Punjab Kings landed their share of punches too as they raced to 100 in just 8.2 overs. Rilee Rossouw was responsible for this momentum, picking apart Mohammed Siraj for 4,4,4,6 in the fourth over after he too was dropped by Mahipal Lomror at backward point in the previous over.\n\nBut Rossouw's luck ultimately ran out in the ninth over when pulled Karn Sharma to Will Jacks at long-on. Shashank Singh kept hopes alive, striking at almost 200 before Kohli snuffed out Kings' hopes by brilliantly running him out.", "source": {"uri": "tbsnews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Business Standard"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shashank_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shashank Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Jacks", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Will Jacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rilee_Rossouw", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rilee Rossouw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajat_Patidar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rajat Patidar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karn_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karn Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahipal_Lomror", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mahipal Lomror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinesh_Karthik", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dinesh Karthik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Chahar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Chahar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Siraj", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Siraj"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Coaching_and_Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Coaching and Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By_Type", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By Type", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball/Pickleball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball/Pickleball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.tbsnews.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/images/2024/05/10/img_20240510_004704.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548702", "eventUri": "eng-9548702", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

The result means RCB keep their playoffs hopes alive with their fourth win on the trot, while PBKS join Mumbai Indians as the second team to be eliminated from the tournament.\n\nAfter Kohli's knock, along with Rajat Patidar's 55 took RCB to 241/7, their fourth-highest overall total in the tournament, PBKS had a glimmer of hope of reaching the target following a 65-run partnership between Jonny Bairstow and Rilee Rossouw. Though Rossouw made 61, none of PBKS' batters stood up to the challenge as they were bowled out for 181 in 17 overs.\n\nRCB had a superb start to their defence as Swapnil Singh trapped Prabhsimran Singh lbw on the fourth ball. Bairstow hit four boundaries and a six in his 16-ball 27, before falling to Lockie Ferguson on the second-last ball of the powerplay.\n\nRilee Rossouw kept PBKS in the hunt by smashing boundaries at will to hit his first fifty of the competition, which he reached by thumping a six over Cameron Green's head. After getting some attention from the physio for an injury, Rossouw holed out to long off against Karn Sharma, who went on to castle Jitesh Sharma.\n\nThough Shashank Singh was smashing boundaries, it wasn't enough for PBKS as Liam Livingstone was caught at cover for a duck, off a leading edge against Swapnil. Shashank himself needed attention from the physio for a shoulder injury and was run out by a direct hit fired by Virat Kohli from deep mid-wicket on the very next ball, falling for 19-ball 37.\n\nAfter that, PBKS never recovered as Ashutosh Sharma was trapped lbw by Mohammed Siraj, followed by Lockie Ferguson knocking over Sam Curran. Siraj came back to take out the remaining two wickets and finish with 3-43 as RCB managed another clinical win.\n\nBrief scores:\n\nRoyal Challengers Bengaluru 241/7 in 20 overs (Virat Kohli 92, Rajat Patidar 55; Harshal Patel 3-38, Vidwath Kaverappa 2-36) beat Punjab Kings 181 in 17 overs (Rilee Rossouw 61, Shashank Singh 37; Mohammed Siraj 3-43, Swapnil Singh 2-280 by 60 runs", "source": {"uri": "socialnews.xyz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Social News XYZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rilee_Rossouw", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rilee Rossouw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himachal_Pradesh_Cricket_Association_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonny_Bairstow", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jonny Bairstow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prabhsimran_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prabhsimran Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajat_Patidar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rajat Patidar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swapnil_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swapnil Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowled", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bowled"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg_before_wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leg before wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockie_Ferguson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lockie Ferguson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Curran", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Curran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harshal_Patel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harshal Patel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karn_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karn Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shashank_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shashank Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Run out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_Livingstone", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liam Livingstone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jitesh_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jitesh Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Siraj", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Siraj"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By_Type", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By Type", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://boxoffice.socialnews.xyz/get_ians_img.php.jpg?url=IPL+2024%3A+RCB+keep+Playoffs+hopes+alive+as+PBKS+are+eliminated+after+60-run+defeat", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548702", "eventUri": "eng-9548702", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 13, "textEnd": 18}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Their bowlers were all over the CSK batters but the batting unit choked.\n\nIt was an example of how Punjab's season has been this year -- unpredictable.\n\nThey have showcased their potential with away wins over Kolkata Knight Riders, when they recorded the highest successful run chase in T20 cricket, and CSK.\n\nHowever, they have faced difficulties getting the job done at home. They won just one out of five games in Mullanpur, their main home ground.\n\nA change in venue to the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium also didn't go their way in the previous game here.\n\nThe team would hope to end its home run on a high but for that to happen, the PBKS unit has to fire in unison.", "source": {"uri": "mid-day.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mid-day"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Curran", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sam Curran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faf_du_Plessis", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Faf du Plessis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat_Titans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gujarat Titans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Jacks", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Will Jacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chennai Super Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yash_Dayal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yash Dayal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himachal_Pradesh_Cricket_Association_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Siraj", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Siraj"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.mid-day.com/images/images/2024/may/sam-kohli_d.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548702", "eventUri": "eng-9548702", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Kohli and Patidar capitalized on missed opportunities to put on a quick 72-run partnership. Green's 46 also contributed to RCB's strong total. Vidhwath Kaverappa, on his IPL debut, took two early wickets, but his figures were hampered by dropped catches. Kohli's blistering innings and Patidar's six sixes gave RCB the momentum before rain interrupted the match. After resumption, Kohli and Green continued their onslaught to propel RCB past 200.\n\nA classic 47-ball 92 by Virat Kohli and Rajat Patidar's breezy fifty powered Royal Challengers Bengaluru to 241/7 against Punjab Kings in a rain-interrupted IPL match here on Thursday.\n\nThe butterfingered Punjab fielders were guilty of dropping catches as Kohli and Patidar capitalised on the reprieves to put on 72 off 32 balls after they were invited to bat.\n\nKohli, who was dropped on 0 and 10, made PBKS pay as he timed the ball nicely, used his feet and wrists to bring up his sixth IPL fifty this season.\n\nPatidar, who was also given two lives, provided the early momentum as he slammed six maximums and three fours during his 23-ball 55. Kohli and Cameron Green (46 off 27 balls) continued the onslaught, adding 92 runs off 46 balls to take RCB across the 200-mark.\n\nGreen hit five fours and a six before being caught in the final ball of the innings as RCB scored 77 in last five overs.\n\nPacer Vidhwath Kaverappa (2/36) picked up two wickets in the powerplay on his IPL debut but his figures could have been much better had the fielders not dropped three catches off his bowling.\n\nKohli was dropped in the third ball but Kaverappa dismissed Faf du Plessis (9) in his second over to give Punjab the first breakthrough. The IPL debutant could have had Kohli again had Rilee Rossouw held on to a screamer.\n\nPBKS, however, couldn't create pressure as Sam Curran (1/50) conceded 16 runs, which included two fours and a six, with Will Jacks doing the maximum damage.\n\nKohli smashed Kaverappa for a six over long-off, but the bowler removed Jacks at the other end, with Harshal Patel (3/38) taking the catch for his second wicket.\n\nPatel, however, dropped Patidar and then conceded three boundaries while bowling as RCB scored 56 in the powerplay.\n\nIt started raining sixes thereafter as Kohli and Patidar slammed a maximum each to spoil Kaverappa's bowling figures.\n\nPatidar then creamed spinner Rahul Chahar for three mighty maximums before depositing Arshdeep and Sam Curran for two more sixes, the last one bringing up his fifty in 21 balls.\n\nWith Patidar on fire, RCB crossed 100 in the ninth overs. The Punjab skipper, however, got rid off Patidar in the 10th over with Jonny Bairstow holding on to an edge as RCB reached 119/3.\n\nRain briefly interrupted play as the spin duo of Liam Livingstone and Chahar bowled tidy overs after resumption. Kohli completed his fifty in 32 balls and hit Livingstone for two fours.\n\nGreen brought up the 150 with a four off Patel. Kohli then went berserk as he slog swept Livingstone for a six, while Curran was deposited over mid-wicket for a 94-metre maximum. He sent one over long-on for another maximum.\n\nDinesh Karthik (18) then helped RCB move past 240.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajat_Patidar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rajat Patidar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caught", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caught"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Curran", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Curran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harshal_Patel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harshal Patel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerplay_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Powerplay (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faf_du_Plessis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Faf du Plessis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Jacks", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Will Jacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rilee_Rossouw", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rilee Rossouw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinesh_Karthik", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dinesh Karthik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Chahar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Chahar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowled", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowled"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonny_Bairstow", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jonny Bairstow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_analysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowling analysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_Livingstone", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liam Livingstone"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Table_Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Table Tennis", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By_Type", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By Type", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/16_01_2019_13_05_02_5451348.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548702", "eventUri": "eng-9548702", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Not very long ago, there were doubts over his inclusion in the India squad for the T20 World Cup as well.\n\nHowever, the former India skipper hit the ground running for Royal Challengers Bengaluru in IPL 2024 and made it to the India squad. He was the first player this season to touch the 300, 400, and 500-run mark this year. He is now looking set to become the first player to score 600 runs this season as well.\n\nAt present, he is the leading run-scorer in IPL 2024. Virat Kohli started well in the ongoing game against Punjab Kings as well and is looking set to score big against them at the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Stadium in Dharamsala.\n\nAsked to bat first, RCB were off to a poor start as they lost the wickets of their captain Faf du Plessis, and Will Jacks inside the powerplay. However, Kohli stood firm at one end and shared a 76-run stand with Rajat Patidar for the third wicket to steady the ship.\n\nHe was unbeaten on 42 runs before rain halted the game in Dharamsala. Kohli has hit four fours and two sixes so far and one of those sixes was a one-handed hit. It came in the seventh over when the former RCB skipper was facing Vidwath Kaverappa.\n\nOn the first ball of the over, Kaverappa bowled one on the middle stump and Kohli played a brilliant shot over mid-off for a six. However, while hitting the shot, one of his hands came off although he still ended up depositing the ball over the boundary rope.\n\nTalking about the game, RCB were on 119 for 3 in ten overs at the time of writing this report. On the final ball of the tenth over, Sam Curran dismissed Patidar to give PBKS a crucial breakthrough.", "source": {"uri": "cricketaddictor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketAddictor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Jacks", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Will Jacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faf_du_Plessis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Faf du Plessis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himachal_Pradesh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Himachal Pradesh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Himachal Pradesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Curran", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Curran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajat_Patidar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rajat Patidar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowled", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowled"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Not out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stump_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stump (cricket)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static.cricketaddictor.com/images/2024/ViratKohlihitsonehandedsix.webp?q=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548702", "eventUri": "eng-9548702", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

A classic 47-ball 92 by Virat Kohli and Rajat Patidar's breezy fifty powered Royal Challengers Bengaluru to 241/7 against Punjab Kings in a rain-interrupted IPL match here on Thursday.\n\nDharamsala, May 9 (PTI) A classic 47-ball 92 by Virat Kohli and Rajat Patidar's breezy fifty powered Royal Challengers Bengaluru to 241/7 against Punjab Kings in a rain-interrupted IPL match here on Thursday.\n\nThe butterfingered Punjab fielders were guilty of dropping catches as Kohli and Patidar capitalised on the reprieves to put on 72 off 32 balls after they were invited to bat.\n\nAlso Read | ICC T20 World Cup 2024 All Squads: Full Players List of All Teams for Ninth Edition of Men's Twenty20 Cricket WC.\n\nKohli, who was dropped on 0 and 10, made PBKS pay as he timed the ball nicely, used his feet and wrists to bring up his sixth IPL fifty this season.\n\nPatidar, who was also given two lives, provided the early momentum as he slammed six maximums and three fours during his 23-ball 55.\n\nAlso Read | KL Rahul To Resign As LSG Captain? Three Players Who Could Replace the Current Skipper for Remaining IPL 2024 Matches.\n\nKohli and Cameron Green (46 off 27 balls) continued the onslaught, adding 92 runs off 46 balls to take RCB across the 200-mark.\n\nGreen hit five fours and a six before being caught in the final ball of the innings as RCB scored 77 in last five overs.\n\nPacer Vidhwath Kaverappa (2/36) picked up two wickets in the powerplay on his IPL debut but his figures could have been much better had the fielders not dropped three catches off his bowling.\n\nKohli was dropped in the third ball but Kaverappa dismissed Faf du Plessis (9) in his second over to give Punjab the first breakthrough. The IPL debutant could have had Kohli again had Rilee Rossouw held on to a screamer.\n\nPBKS, however, couldn't create pressure as Sam Curran (1/50) conceded 16 runs, which included two fours and a six, with Will Jacks doing the maximum damage.\n\nKohli smashed Kaverappa for a six over long-off, but the bowler removed Jacks at the other end, with Harshal Patel (3/38) taking the catch for his second wicket.\n\nPatel, however, dropped Patidar and then conceded three boundaries while bowling as RCB scored 56 in the powerplay.\n\nIt started raining sixes thereafter as Kohli and Patidar slammed a maximum each to spoil Kaverappa's bowling figures.\n\nPatidar then creamed spinner Rahul Chahar for three mighty maximums before depositing Arshdeep and Sam Curran for two more sixes, the last one bringing up his fifty in 21 balls.\n\nWith Patidar on fire, RCB crossed 100 in the ninth overs. The Punjab skipper, however, got rid off Patidar in the 10th over with Jonny Bairstow holding on to an edge as RCB reached 119/3.\n\nRain briefly interrupted play as the spin duo of Liam Livingstone and Chahar bowled tidy overs after resumption. Kohli completed his fifty in 32 balls and hit Livingstone for two fours.\n\nGreen brought up the 150 with a four off Patel. Kohli then went berserk as he slog swept Livingstone for a six, while Curran was deposited over mid-wicket for a 94-metre maximum. He sent one over long-on for another maximum.\n\nDinesh Karthik (18) then helped RCB move past 240.", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajat_Patidar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rajat Patidar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caught", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caught"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab,_India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Curran", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Curran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "K.

Mumbai Indians, who have just four wins from 12 games, are also in with a shout, albeit a complicated one at that. Over the years, 16 points has been enough to make the cut but with the expansion to ten teams, it is no longer the case, Which is why teams like KKR and RR wouldn't want to relax despite sitting on 16 points. Meanwhile, PBKS and RCB are two teams who can only get as far as 14 points, meaning a host of other results need to go their way for qualification.\n\nIt is in such a scenario that they face-off at Dharamsala in a virtual elimination game with the loser joining Mumbai Indians on that bus that can only get as far as 12 points. By all means, this is a clash between two sides who couldn't have had more contrasting routes leading up to this game. Punjab Kings may have only recorded four wins so far from 11 games but the results don't tell you how close they were in many of their seven defeats to getting across the line. While top order failures cost them in most games, death bowling was also a concern in the other losses.\n\nThe high-intent approach of Punjab's batting did mean that they produced an unthinkable run chase against table toppers KKR, gunning down the highest T20 chase of all time. Most of their batting has revolved around the juniors like Shashank Singh and Ashutosh Sharma who had to do the heavy lifting after all the early damage. The duo have certainly impressed, more so Shashank, but it wasn't until Jonny Bairstow found form that Punjab started to look ominous. The heroics against KKR at Eden Gardens were followed by a special win against CSK at Chepauk but the defeat to the defending champions in the reverse fixture at Dharamsala has hurt Punjab's hopes. They do have the personnel to turn things around but it will boil down to their temperament under pressure.\n\nThe challenge for PBKS is that they are running into a RCB outfit that's on a three-match winning streak. IPL's eternal tragic heroes had just a solitary win in their first eight games, having been outplayed more often than not. Early elimination seemed certain until Faf du Plessis' men started to notch up one win after the other. It started by upstaging Sunrisers Hyderabad in Hyderabad before completing a double over Gujarat Titans. All three wins were achieved with a degree of dominance.\n\nThe lack of pressure in recent games may have been a reason, as suggested by Faf in his post-match presentations. Bangalore's batting line-up struggled for impetus in the first half of the season. But with nothing to lose (qualification chances are extremely complex), RCB has played with more freedom, especially with the bat. Faf's own form has spiked while the entry of Will Jacks has certainly added thrust to the batting unit. The bowling, which lacked purpose and discipline early on, seems to have worked out their strategies better in the last three games.\n\nThe nature of T20 cricket is such that the contrasting roadmaps of the two sides are not of much significance, given that they both find themselves in similar terrain. It may not be advertised as one but this is effectively a knockout game of sorts.\n\nWhen: Thursday, May 9 at 19:30 IST\n\nWhere: Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium, Dharamsala\n\nWhat to expect: The first game of the season saw a surprisingly slower surface with help for seamers with the new ball and spinners with the older ball. However, that was a day game and the venue has historically seen more joy for batters in night games. This could mean a much better batting track on offer. There should still be some help on offer for the pacers with the new ball.\n\nHead to Head: There isn't much to choose when it comes to the head-to-head stats between the two teams. The sides have faced each other 32 times with PBKS holding a slender 17-15 lead. RCB prevailed in the reverse fixture earlier this season in Bengaluru.\n\nTeam watch:\n\nPunjab Kings\n\nInjuries and unavailability: Shikhar Dhawan is yet to return to the setup\n\nTactics and matchups:Jonny Bairstow has had tremendous personal success against RCB. In five innings, he has a century and two fifties, tallying 261 runs at a staggering strike rate of 177.55. He also has a strike rate of 216 against RCB's powerplay specialist Mohammed Siraj, who has conceded 54 runs in 25 balls against the Englishman with one dismissal. Punjab will hope that Bairstow can deliver once more against his favourite franchise. PBKS are expected to be unchanged for this fixture, unless they want to bring back Liam Livingstone into the XI, which would mean an exit for Rilee Rossouw. However, that seems unlikely, as does the option of Shikhar Dhawan returning.\n\nProbable XI: Jonny Bairstow, Rilee Rossouw, Shashank Singh, Sam Curran (c), Jitesh Sharma (wk), Ashutosh Sharma, Harpreet Brar, Harshal Patel, Kagiso Rabada, Rahul Chahar, Arshdeep Singh. [Impact sub: Prabhsimran Singh]\n\nRoyal Challengers Bangalore\n\nInjuries/unavailability: RCB don't have any injury concerns in their camp.\n\nTactics and matchups:Between overs 7-15, Rajat Patidar has been going at a rollicking strike rate of 183. He has also perished seven times in 100 deliveries but his intent against spin will be crucial to RCB's chances, given the form of Punjab's spin duo Rahul Chahar and Harpreet Brar. It's rare for sides to change much when they are on a three-match winning streak and RCB are also expected to go with that pattern.\n\nProbable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Glenn Maxwell, Will Jacks, Cameron Green, Dinesh Karthik, Karn Sharma, Swapnil Singh, Yash Dayal, Vijaykumar Vysakh, Mohammed Siraj. [Impact sub: Rajat Patidar].\n\nDid you know?\n\n- Seven of Mohammed Siraj's eight wickets have come while bowling first this season with an economy of 8.8 while his solitary wicket bowling second has come at an economy of 9.77\n\n- Harshal Patel has been expensive at the death but has also been a wicket-taker. He has 11 wickets in slog overs this season across 16 overs bowled.\n\nWhat they said:\n\n\"Not easy to switch between red and white ball cricket. You need to give your 110% every ball here (in T20s).\" - Mohammed Siraj explains the challenges of being a bowler in the shortest format\n\n\"The wicket was probably slower than we thought, we expected a little more pace and bounce, it was pretty similar throughout the game. Couple of days off and we go against RCB in a few days time so we need to move on and stay headstrong.\" Sam Curran after the loss to CSK", "source": {"uri": "cricbuzz.com", "dataType": "news",

of India\n\nStar batter Virat Kohli slammed a 47-ball 92 as Royal Challengers Bengaluru posted 241/7 after being invited to bat first.\n\nEW DELHI: Virat Kohli and Rajat Patidar delivered impressive fifties before the bowlers shone, helping Royal Challengers Bengaluru keep their playoff hopes alive with a dominant 60-run victory over Punjab Kings in the IPL on Thursday.\n\nKohli's 47-ball 92 was the foundation of RCB's innings, as he excelled in two partnerships: 72 runs off 32 balls with Patidar (55 off 23 balls) and 92 runs off 46 balls with Cameron Green (46 off 27 balls), propelling RCB to 241/7.\n\nThis marked RCB's fourth consecutive win, bringing them to 10 points, while PBKS were eliminated from the playoff race with 8 points, as they can only reach a maximum of 12 points from their remaining two games.\n\nChasing a stiff target, PBKS lost Prabhsimran Singh (6) early but Rossouw looked unstoppable as left-arm spinner Swapnil Singh was carted for two fours before Siraj was belted for three fours and a six.\n\nIn response, Rilee Rossouw dazzled with a 27-ball 61, but Karn Sharma's twin breakthroughs sparked a collapse as PBKS were bowled out for 181 in 17 overs.\n\nThis marked RCB's fourth consecutive win, bringing them to 10 points, while PBKS were eliminated from the playoff race with 8 points, as they can only reach a maximum of 12 points from their remaining two games.\n\nSwapnil Singh (2/28), Karn (2/36) and Lockie Ferguson (2/29) took two each, while Mohammed Siraj (3/43) claimed three wickets for RCB.\n\nChasing a stiff target, PBKS lost Prabhsimran Singh (6) early but Rossouw looked unstoppable as left-arm spinner Swapnil Singh was carted for two fours before Siraj was belted for three fours and a six.\n\nYash Dayal and Ferguson were then hit for 16 and 14 runs by Jonny Bairstow (27) and Rossouw as PBKS scored 75 runs in six overs.\n\nOnce Bairstow was removed by Ferguson, Rossouw turned his attention on Green, blasting two fours and a six on way to his fifty off 21 balls.\n\nJitesh Sharma was then cleaned up by Karn, while Swapnil got rid of Liam Livingstone (0) as Punjab slipped to 126 for 5 in 12th over.", "source": {"uri":

He reached his mark in 32 balls, before slamming another 40 in his next 15 balls. He cracked seven fours and six maximums.\n\nPatidar, who was also given two lives, provided the early momentum as he slammed six maximums and three fours during his 23-ball 55.\n\nAfter Patidar's dismissal, Kohli and Green continued the onslaught to take RCB past the 200-mark. Green hit five fours and a six before being caught in the final ball as RCB scored 77 in last five overs.\n\nPacer Vidhwath Kaverappa (2/36) picked up two wickets in the powerplay on his IPL debut but his figures could have been much better had the fielders not dropped three catches off his bowling.\n\nKohli was dropped in the third ball but Kaverappa dismissed Faf du Plessis (9) and removed Will Jacks (12) but PBKS couldn't create pressure as Sam Curran (1/50) and Harshal Patel (3/38) leaked runs.\n\nPatel, who had dropped Patidar, conceded three boundaries in his first over as RCB scored 56 in the powerplay.\n\nIt started raining sixes thereafter as Kohli and Patidar slammed a maximum each to spoil Kaverappa's bowling figures.\n\nPatidar then creamed spinner Rahul Chahar for three mighty maximums before depositing Arshdeep and Sam Curran for two more sixes, the last one bringing up his fifty in 21 balls.\n\nWith Patidar on fire, RCB crossed 100 in the ninth over. Curran, however, got rid of Patidar in the 10th over, when rain halted play for a brief while.\n\nAfter resumption, Kohli completed his fifty and hit Livingstone for two fours.\n\nGreen brought up the 150 with a four off Patel. Kohli then went berserk as he slog swept Livingstone for a six, while Curran was deposited over mid-wicket for a 94-metre maximum. He sent one over long-on for another maximum.\n\nDinesh Karthik (18) played a cameo before Patel claimed three wickets in last over.

He hammered 7 fours and 6 sixes during his time on the crease.\n\nSpeaking after the first inning, Kohli said it was a tricky phase for the Bengaluru-based franchise when Rajat Patidar was dismissed. Talking about the wicket in Dharamsala, the talisman Indian batter said it was \"two-paced\".\n\n\"It was important to keep up my strike-rate through the innings so I wanted to take on the momentum. It was a tricky phase when Rajat got out, we got three down and the rain came in. So we needed a bit of time to settle but once Cameron and I did, I thought 'I have to go again.' The wicket was a bit two-paced, the ones pitching on the grassy ones were skidding on. Great opportunity for our bowlers to make the early inroads,\" Kohli was quoted by ESPNcricinfo as saying.\n\nRecently, there has been much criticism about Kohli's strike rate and many cricket pundits and fans also questioned the former RCB skipper's approach towards T20 cricket.\n\nKohli is currently the 'orange cap' holder of the IPL 2024, as he scored 634 runs from 12 matches at a strike rate of 153.51.\n\nHe added they thought any run over 230 would be a good total at the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium.\n\n\"We thought 230+ would be a good total here. Bowlers are confident with recent successes. That was the only mindset. I thought that was a hell of an over from Harshal, otherwise, we'd be 250+. (Kaverappa, the new-ball bowler) Difficult to analyse in just one game. He has some swing but when new it is tough to figure them out early. Height is there, swing is also there. Kudos to him for starting well with the new ball, but by the fourth over the swing was gone,\" he added.\n\nRecapping the first inning of the match between PBKS and RCB, after winning the toss Punjab sent Bengaluru to bat first. Virat Kohli's (92) stupendous knock powered RCB to 241/7. Rajat Patidar (55) and Cameron Green (46) were also played a pivotal role in the first inning alongside Kohli.\n\nHarshal Patel led the Punjab bowling attack as he picked up three wickets in his four-over spell. Vidhwath Kaverappa bagged two wickets also. Arshdeep Singh and Sam Curran took one wicket each in their respective spells.\n\nPunjab Kings need to make 242 runs to win the match.

The team winning would stay alive in the race for the playoffs.\n\nThe match is set to take place at Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Cricket Stadium in Dharamshala on the 9th of May 2024 at 7:30 PM (IST). Both teams would be desperate to win this as they do not have any other choice. Both teams have had a similar journey in the tournament so far. Both RCB and PBKS have four wins and seven losses to their in the 11 matches. RCB, with a better net run rate, is placed a position above PBKS. While RCB is in the 7th position, PBKS is in the 8th.\n\nBoth teams have their own strengths and weaknesses. While PBKS is not getting enough contribution with the bat from the likes of Rilee Rossouw, Sam Curran, and Jitesh Sharma, RCB has the likes of Cameron Green and Glenn Maxwell, who have not fired with the bat as well as they would have liked. The winner of the match will secure 7th spot in the points table. But their chances of qualifying for the playoffs will stay alive. A loss would be a tough pill to swallow.", "source": {"uri": "crictracker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricTracker"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himachal_Pradesh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Himachal Pradesh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Himachal Pradesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Curran", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Curran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rilee_Rossouw", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rilee Rossouw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Maxwell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glenn Maxwell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_run_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Net run rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jitesh_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jitesh Sharma"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://media.crictracker.com/media/attachments/1714154422796_pbks.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548702", "eventUri": "eng-9548702", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

He reached his mark in 32 balls, before slamming another 40 in his next 15 balls. He cracked seven fours and six maximums.\n\nPatidar, who was also given two lives, provided the early momentum as he slammed six maximums and three fours during his 23-ball 55.\n\nAfter Patidar's dismissal, Kohli and Green continued the onslaught to take RCB past the 200-mark. Green hit five fours and a six before being caught in the final ball as RCB scored 77 in last five overs.\n\nPacer Vidhwath Kaverappa (2/36) picked up two wickets in the powerplay on his IPL debut but his figures could have been much better had the fielders not dropped three catches off his bowling.\n\nKohli was dropped in the third ball but Kaverappa dismissed Faf du Plessis (9) and removed Will Jacks (12) but PBKS couldn't create pressure as Sam Curran (1/50) and Harshal Patel (3/38) leaked runs.\n\nPatel, who had dropped Patidar, conceded three boundaries in his first over as RCB scored 56 in the powerplay.\n\nIt started raining sixes thereafter as Kohli and Patidar slammed a maximum each to spoil Kaverappa's bowling figures.\n\nPatidar then creamed spinner Rahul Chahar for three mighty maximums before depositing Arshdeep and Sam Curran for two more sixes, the last one bringing up his fifty in 21 balls.\n\nWith Patidar on fire, RCB crossed 100 in the ninth over. Curran, however, got rid of Patidar in the 10th over, when rain halted play for a brief while.\n\nAfter resumption, Kohli completed his fifty and hit Livingstone for two fours.\n\nGreen brought up the 150 with a four off Patel. Kohli then went berserk as he slog swept Livingstone for a six, while Curran was deposited over mid-wicket for a 94-metre maximum. He sent one over long-on for another maximum.\n\nDinesh Karthik (18) played a cameo before Patel claimed three wickets in last over.\n\n(With inputs from PTI)\n\nThe TOI Sports Desk excels in a myriad of roles that capture the essence of live sporting events and deliver compelling content to readers worldwide.

With a global fanbase spanning diverse age groups, Kohli draws admiration from across the cricketing fraternity. In the ongoing edition of the Indian Premier League, Kohli has been one of the best performers, and is currently the highest run-scorer in the season with 542 runs in 11 matches.\n\nCurrently in Dharamsala for RCB's crucial encounter against Punjab Kings in IPL 2024, Kohli broke a sweat during the training session, following which a video of his heartwarming interaction with fellow young cricketers went viral on social media. Kohli could be seen signing autographs as he engaged in an impromptu session with the young players.\n\nWatch:\n\nKohli has been the key player for the Royal Challengers throughout this year; the side, however, made a disappointing start to its campaign and at the halfway mark, had only one win throughout the season. RCB have since made a strong comeback and are currently on a three-match winning streak; with four wins in 11 matches, RCB are seventh in the points table with 8 points to their name.\n\nFollowing his brilliant performances this year, Kohli was also named in India's 15-member squad for the T20 World Cup; there remains suspense over his batting position in India's XI, though. While many believe that Kohli should open alongside Rohit Sharma in the marquee tournament - both have opened only once in the format - there are others who want the India great to retain his third spot in the order.\n\nThe significance of the match is not lost on RCB, as they find themselves in a must-win situation to keep their playoff aspirations alive. With three straight victories under their belt, Faf du Plessis' men are riding a wave of momentum into the showdown against PBKS.\n\nPunjab Kings, meanwhile, faced a setback in their previous match at Dharamsala against the CSK, and face an uphill task against RCB.

It's a must-win game for both teams to keep their slender hopes of qualification alive. The loser will become the second team to be eliminated after Mumbai Indians. This is also the last league game to be played in Dharamsala this season, and the last game for Punjab Kings at home where they have a dismal record of just one win and five losses so far. While they've had decent results on the road, their struggles in both Dharamsala and Mullanpur have been a big reason why they're in eighth place currently. Today they'll be up against a team that's only ahead of them on NRR, but are on a three-match winning run.\n\nPreview:\n\nSuch has been the competitive nature of this year's IPL that no team has officially been eliminated at the final leg of the league stage. Mumbai Indians, who have just four wins from 12 games, are also in with a shout, albeit a complicated one at that. Over the years, 16 points has been enough to make the cut but with the expansion to ten teams, it is no longer the case, Which is why teams like KKR and RR wouldn't want to relax despite sitting on 16 points. Meanwhile, PBKS and RCB are two teams who can only get as far as 14 points, meaning a host of other results need to go their way for qualification.\n\nIt is in such a scenario that they face-off at Dharamsala in a virtual elimination game with the loser joining Mumbai Indians on that bus that can only get as far as 12 points. By all means, this is a clash between two sides who couldn't have had more contrasting routes leading up to this game. Punjab Kings may have only recorded four wins so far from 11 games but the results don't tell you how close they were in many of their seven defeats to getting across the line. While top order failures cost them in most games, death bowling was also a concern in the other losses.\n\nThe high-intent approach of Punjab's batting did mean that they produced an unthinkable run chase against table toppers KKR, gunning down the highest T20 chase of all time. Most of their batting has revolved around the juniors like Shashank Singh and Ashutosh Sharma who had to do the heavy lifting after all the early damage. The duo have certainly impressed, more so Shashank, but it wasn't until Jonny Bairstow found form that Punjab started to look ominous. The heroics against KKR at Eden Gardens were followed by a special win against CSK at Chepauk but the defeat to the defending champions in the reverse fixture at Dharamsala has hurt Punjab's hopes. They do have the personnel to turn things around but it will boil down to their temperament under pressure.\n\nThe challenge for PBKS is that they are running into a RCB outfit that's on a three-match winning streak. IPL's eternal tragic heroes had just a solitary win in their first eight games, having been outplayed more often than not. Early elimination seemed certain until Faf du Plessis' men started to notch up one win after the other. It started by upstaging Sunrisers Hyderabad in Hyderabad before completing a double over Gujarat Titans. All three wins were achieved with a degree of dominance.\n\nThe lack of pressure in recent games may have been a reason, as suggested by Faf in his post-match presentations. Bangalore's batting line-up struggled for impetus in the first half of the season. But with nothing to lose (qualification chances are extremely complex), RCB has played with more freedom, especially with the bat. Faf's own form has spiked while the entry of Will Jacks has certainly added thrust to the batting unit. The bowling, which lacked purpose and discipline early on, seems to have worked out their strategies better in the last three games.\n\nThe nature of T20 cricket is such that the contrasting roadmaps of the two sides are not of much significance, given that they both find themselves in similar terrain. It may not be advertised as one but this is effectively a knockout game of sorts.\n\nWhen: Thursday, May 9 at 19:30 IST\n\nWhere: Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium, Dharamsala\n\nWhat to expect: The first game of the season saw a surprisingly slower surface with help for seamers with the new ball and spinners with the older ball. However, that was a day game and the venue has historically seen more joy for batters in night games. This could mean a much better batting track on offer. There should still be some help on offer for the pacers with the new ball.\n\nHead to Head: There isn't much to choose when it comes to the head-to-head stats between the two teams. The sides have faced each other 32 times with PBKS holding a slender 17-15 lead. RCB prevailed in the reverse fixture earlier this season in Bengaluru.\n\nTeam watch:\n\nPunjab Kings\n\nInjuries and unavailability: Shikhar Dhawan is yet to return to the setup\n\nTactics and matchups: Jonny Bairstow has had tremendous personal success against RCB. In five innings, he has a century and two fifties, tallying 261 runs at a staggering strike rate of 177.55. He also has a strike rate of 216 against RCB's powerplay specialist Mohammed Siraj, who has conceded 54 runs in 25 balls against the Englishman with one dismissal. Punjab will hope that Bairstow can deliver once more against his favourite franchise. PBKS are expected to be unchanged for this fixture, unless they want to bring back Liam Livingstone into the XI, which would mean an exit for Rilee Rossouw. However, that seems unlikely, as does the option of Shikhar Dhawan returning.\n\nProbable XI: Jonny Bairstow, Rilee Rossouw, Shashank Singh, Sam Curran (c), Jitesh Sharma (wk), Ashutosh Sharma, Harpreet Brar, Harshal Patel, Kagiso Rabada, Rahul Chahar, Arshdeep Singh. [Impact sub: Prabhsimran Singh]\n\nRoyal Challengers Bangalore\n\nInjuries/unavailability: RCB don't have any injury concerns in their camp.\n\nTactics and matchups:Between overs 7-15, Rajat Patidar has been going at a rollicking strike rate of 183. He has also perished seven times in 100 deliveries but his intent against spin will be crucial to RCB's chances, given the form of Punjab's spin duo Rahul Chahar and Harpreet Brar. It's rare for sides to change much when they are on a three-match winning streak and RCB are also expected to go with that pattern.\n\nProbable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Glenn Maxwell, Will Jacks, Cameron Green, Dinesh Karthik, Karn Sharma, Swapnil Singh, Yash Dayal, Vijaykumar Vysakh, Mohammed Siraj. [Impact sub: Rajat Patidar].\n\nDid you know?\n\n- Seven of Mohammed Siraj's eight wickets have come while bowling first this season with an economy of 8.8 while his solitary wicket bowling second has come at an economy of 9.77\n\n- Harshal Patel has been expensive at the death but has also been a wicket-taker. He has 11 wickets in slog overs this season across 16 overs bowled.\n\nWhat they said:\n\n\"Not easy to switch between red and white ball cricket. You need to give your 110% every ball here (in T20s).\" - Mohammed Siraj explains the challenges of being a bowler in the shortest format\n\n\"The wicket was probably slower than we thought, we expected a little more pace and bounce, it was pretty similar throughout the game. Couple of days off and we go against RCB in a few days time so we need to move on and stay headstrong.\" Sam Curran after the loss to CSK", "source": {"uri": "cricbuzz.com", "dataType": "news",

The Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium in Dharamshala is hosting this encounter.\n\nThe moment transpired during the final ball of the last over of the first innings. PBKS pacer Harshal Patel tried to keep the ball outside of Cameron Green's hitting range and bowled a full slower ball outside off stump.\n\nGreen heaved it towards the long-on region in search of a boundary. He couldn't get the desired timing on the shot as the fielder Sam Curran ran to his right and took a stunning catch with a well-timed dive.\n\nYou can watch the catch in the video below:\n\nVirat Kohli's 92 powers RCB to a massive total of 241/7 in IPL 2024 clash vs PBKS\n\nAfter being asked to bat first, RCB got off to a brisk start but lost the wicket of Faf du Plessis (9) and Will Jacks (12) in the process. After getting a couple of reprieves early on, Virat Kohli settled at the crease. He held one end while his partner Rajat Patidar (55) smashed a blistering half-century.\n\nAfter Patidar's dismissal at the halfway mark, Kohli took the onus on himself and upped the ante with sumptuous stroke play. He smashed six sixes and seven fours en route to 92 (47) before perishing in the 18th over. Cameron Green (46) and Dinesh Karthik (18) played vital cameos to finish the innings on high for RCB and took them to 241. At the mid-innings break, Virat Kohli reflected on the first innings and said:\n\n\"It was important to keep the strike rate up throughout the innings. There was a bit of tricky phase when Patidar got out and rain came. Green got a couple of boundaries and then I thought it's time for me to go after the bowling.\"\n\nHe added:\n\n\"When the seamers were bowling up front, it was two-paced. It was dry and the ball was stopping it. Due to the two-pace nature, it's an opportunity for our pacers to exploit the swing. We thought anything over 230 would be great. We have a great bowling attack and the bowlers are confident.\"\n\nAfter this match, RCB will next face DC at home on Sunday, May 12.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Curran", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sam Curran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himachal_Pradesh_Cricket_Association_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harshal_Patel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harshal Patel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowled", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bowled"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-rounder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All-rounder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Jacks", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Will Jacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajat_Patidar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rajat Patidar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faf_du_Plessis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Faf du Plessis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crease_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crease (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stump_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stump (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinesh_Karthik", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dinesh Karthik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seam_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seam bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swing bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Lawn_Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Lawn Bowling", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/cc2e6-17152737013237-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548702", "eventUri": "eng-9548702", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 179, "textEnd": 184}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-12", "textStart": 2163, "textEnd": 2169}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

Lockie Ferguson bowled a slightly shortish length, Sam Curran nudged it and looked for a quick second after completing the first run.

He smashed seven 4s and six 6s in his knock and while he missed out on a well-deserved 9th IPL ton, he was able to power RCB to a huge total of 241. The target of 242 proved to be too much for Punjab Kings, who could not get going after losing the momentum midway in their innings. Eventually, RCB defeated PBKS by a huge margin of 60 runs. Rilee Rossouw top-scored for PBKS. He made 61 runs in 27 balls. This is RCB's 4th win on the trot and with that, the hopes of a playoff berth are still alive.

Looks like they've watered the wicket a bit, might be something early on. Looking to put RCB under pressure early. With the side we've picked today, looking to take wickets with the new ball. Pretty simple for us now - need few results to go for us and win our remaining games. Livingstone comes in for Rabada. Our strength is our batting,\" said Sam Curran at the toss.\n\n\"Would've done the same. Been a great turnaround for us. Last few games we've been clinical.

He threw his bat at a wide delivery from Curran, trying to place the ball behind point region. However, the batter could only get an underedge and wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow completed a simple catch.\n\nSam Curran was fired up after the dismissal and he let Rajat Patidar know with his celebration. Here's the video of the dismissal:\n\nPatidar scored 55 runs in just 23 balls in a knock that included three boundaries and six sixes. He added 76 runs alongside Virat Kohli for the second wicket in just 32 balls.\n\nPunjab Kings could have had Rajat Patidar dismissed for a duck\n\nOne of the main reasons why PBKS have conceded 119 runs in 10 overs is because of the dropped chances that they had in the field. Debutant Vidhwath Kaverappa was impressive with the new ball and should have had star RCB batter Virat Kohli as his maiden IPL wicket.\n\nKohli was dropped twice by Punjab fielders Ashutosh Sharma and Rilee Rossouw, both off Kaverappa's bowling. The youngster did pick up the wickets of Faf du Plessis and Will Jacks but could have had Rajat Patidar as well had Harshal Patel not dropped a sitter at fine leg.\n\nKaverappa's figures of 2/36 do not do just to the outing the debutant had but it is the only shining light in a rather disappointing performance in the field. With 119/3 on the board and 10 overs remaining, RCB will want Kohli to score big and set up a mammoth first-innings total.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anuj_nitin_prabhu@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Anuj Nitin Prabhu", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Curran", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sam Curran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajat_Patidar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rajat Patidar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonny_Bairstow", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jonny Bairstow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket-keeper", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wicket-keeper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Duck (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rilee_Rossouw", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rilee Rossouw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harshal_Patel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harshal Patel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka_cricket_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karnataka cricket team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faf_du_Plessis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Faf du Plessis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By_Type", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By Type", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/fc5d8-17152684385690-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548702", "eventUri": "eng-9548702", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 240, "textEnd": 245}], "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

He reached his mark in 32 balls, before slamming another 40 in his next 15 balls. He cracked seven fours and six maximums.\n\nPatidar, who was also given two lives, provided the early momentum as he slammed six maximums and three fours during his 23-ball 55.\n\nAfter Patidar's dismissal, Kohli and Green continued the onslaught to take RCB past the 200-mark. Green hit five fours and a six before being caught in the final ball as RCB scored 77 in last five overs.\n\nPacer Vidhwath Kaverappa (2/36) picked up two wickets in the powerplay on his IPL debut but his figures could have been much better had the fielders not dropped three catches off his bowling.\n\nKohli was dropped in the third ball but Kaverappa dismissed Faf du Plessis (9) and removed Will Jacks (12) but PBKS couldn't create pressure as Sam Curran (1/50) and Harshal Patel (3/38) leaked runs.\n\nPatel, who had dropped Patidar, conceded three boundaries in his first over as RCB scored 56 in the powerplay.\n\nIt started raining sixes thereafter as Kohli and Patidar slammed a maximum each to spoil Kaverappa's bowling figures.\n\nPatidar then creamed spinner Rahul Chahar for three mighty maximums before depositing Arshdeep and Sam Curran for two more sixes, the last one bringing up his fifty in 21 balls.\n\nWith Patidar on fire, RCB crossed 100 in the ninth over. Curran, however, got rid of Patidar in the 10th over, when rain halted play for a brief while.\n\nAfter resumption, Kohli completed his fifty and hit Livingstone for two fours.\n\nGreen brought up the 150 with a four off Patel. Kohli then went berserk as he slog swept Livingstone for a six, while Curran was deposited over mid-wicket for a 94-metre maximum. He sent one over long-on for another maximum.\n\nDinesh Karthik (18) played a cameo before Patel claimed three wickets in last over.

PBKS is eager to bounce back after a disappointing defeat in their previous outing, aiming to regain their momentum and strengthen their position in the tournament. Meanwhile, RCB will enter the contest with a surge in confidence, having secured a convincing victory in their recent match.\n\nThe picturesque HPCA Stadium in Dharamsala will be the backdrop for this highly anticipated showdown between PBKS and RCB.\n\nThe pitch of the HPCA Stadium is renowned for its batter-friendly conditions, often resulting in high-scoring encounters. With its tendency to provide bounce, particularly beneficial for fast bowlers, it has established a reputation as a favourable venue for batters. Situated at an elevated altitude, the pitch is anticipated to facilitate swing with the new ball, offering an advantage to pace bowlers who can capitalize on the movement. However, spinners may find minimal assistance as the pitch typically offers limited turns. Overall, it is expected to be an optimal batting surface, occasionally offering bounce and seam movement for the pacers.\n\nDharamsala Weather Forecast:\n\nThe weather forecast for Dharamshala assures favourable conditions for cricket enthusiasts. Although the sky is expected to be overcast, there are no rainfall predictions. Temperatures are projected to hover around a comfortable 26 degrees Celsius, ensuring a pleasant environment for both players and spectators. Additionally, light breezes, not exceeding 5 kilometres per hour, and moderate humidity levels of about 51% will contribute to an ideal cricketing atmosphere. In summary, the weather conditions are conducive to an enjoyable day of cricket.\n\nAlso WATCH: Mukesh Kumar cleans up Rovman Powell with a stellar delivery in DC vs RR match\n\nSquads:\n\nPunjab

In their last encounter, RCB registered their first victory of the season with 4-wicket win over PBKS. Kohli played a match-winning knock of 77 off 49 balls to help the team chase down a 177-run target in 19.2 overs.\n\nIn a video that went viral on social media, Virat Kohli was seen talking to local Himachal players and cracking some jokes with them in his mother tongue, Punjabi. He also signed autographs for them before joining the team for the practice.\n\nVirat Kohli has been in a incredible form in the ongoing IPL season. The 35-year-old is currently leading run-getter of the season and among the strong contenders to win Orange Cap, with 542 runs, including a century and 4 fifties, at an average of 67.75 and a strike rate of 148.08 in 11 matches.\n\nKohli's best performance came against Rajasthan Royals, where he was the first score a century in this IPL season. He played a brilliant unbeaten knock of 113 off 72 balls.

Consequently, as they began their chase, they were burdened with a daunting target, which seemed to weigh heavily on their batting lineup. The pressure to score runs forced them into a defensive mindset, inhibiting their ability to mount significant partnerships and challenge the target. RCB beat Punjab Kings by 60 runs and secured two points to keep their playoffs hopes alive.\n\nThe chase began with an early setback for Punjab Kings, as Prabhsimran Singh departed cheaply in the opening over. Despite some aggressive stroke play from Jonny Bairstow and Rilee Rossouw, Bairstow's dismissal for 27 by Ferguson provided a breakthrough for the opposition. By the end of the powerplay, Punjab Kings had reached 75/2. However, Rossouw's departure for 61, dismissed by Karn Sharma, further dented their chase, leaving them at 107/3 after nine overs. Subsequent quick dismissals of Jitesh Sharma (5) and Livingstone (0) further compounded their troubles, with Punjab Kings struggling at 132/5 after 12 overs.\n\nA collision between Shashank Singh and Du Plessis resulted in Singh's injury, leading to his run-out on a brilliant direct throw from Virat Kohli. Ashutosh Sharma fell victim to an LBW decision by Siraj, followed by Siraj dismissing Harshal Patel for a duck, reducing Punjab Kings to 174/9. The innings concluded with Sam Curran's dismissal for 22, bowled by Ferguson. Siraj took the last wicket as Arshdeep got out. RCB convincingly beat PBKS by 60 runs.\n\nFirst Innings\n\nIn an electrifying display of cricket, Royal Challengers Bangalore showcased remarkable shot-making prowess, while Punjab Kings were plagued by sloppy fielding and missed opportunities. RCB posted an imposing total of 241/6 in their allotted 20 overs, courtesy of stellar batting performances by Virat Kohli (92) and Rajat Patidar (55). Punjab now face the daunting task of chasing down 242 runs to secure crucial points and stay in contention for the playoffs.\n\nWinning the toss, Punjab Kings elected to field first, hoping to restrict RCB's batting onslaught. However, their fielding woes became evident early on as they grassed five catches within the powerplay, including two chances to dismiss Virat Kohli, who survived on 0 and 10. Despite the early setbacks, RCB managed to reach 56/2 at the end of the powerplay, with Kohli and Patidar at the crease. The duo then orchestrated a blistering 50-run partnership in just 21 balls, primarily fueled by Patidar's aggressive stroke play. Patidar notched up his half-century in the same number of deliveries but fell victim to a delivery outside off stump, caught by Bairstow off Curran's bowling when on 55. Rain briefly interrupted play, causing a delay, but Kohli continued his sublime form, reaching his fifty off 32 balls once the match resumed. However, RCB lost wickets in the final overs, with Dinesh Karthik, Mahipal Lomror, and Camron Green departing, ultimately finishing with a formidable total of 241/6 in their allotted 20 overs.", "source": {"uri": "moneycontrol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MoneyControl"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prabhsimran_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prabhsimran Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rilee_Rossouw", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rilee Rossouw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerplay_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Powerplay (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Curran", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Curran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harshal_Patel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harshal Patel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karn_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karn Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shashank_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shashank Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowled", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bowled"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonny_Bairstow", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jonny Bairstow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Duck (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg_before_wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leg before wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jitesh_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jitesh Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajat_Patidar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rajat Patidar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahipal_Lomror", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mahipal Lomror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinesh_Karthik", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dinesh Karthik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toss_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toss (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caught", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caught"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stump_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stump (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab,_India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Kings_Cribbage", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Kings Cribbage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2024/05/20240509182057_Kohli-vs-PBKS-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548702", "eventUri": "eng-9548702", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

Virat Kohli vs Arshdeep Singh", "body": "The Punjab Kings (PBKS) will play their final home game of their 2024 Indian Premier League (IPL) campaign when they host the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) in Dharamshala on Thursday, May 9. Both teams have made a late surge in the season but are on the brink of elimination.\n\nPBKS' momentum on the back of their record chase was squashed with a tame loss to the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) at the picturesque venue.\n\nRCB, on the other hand, are on the rise after a dismal first half of the campaign. They still somewhat have a chance of qualifying if they win their games in hand and other results go in their favor. Their winning run started with a win over the SunRisers Hyderabad (SRH) and extended to a double over the Gujarat Titans (GT).\n\nRCB came out as victors when they last faced PBKS in the reverse fixture in Bengaluru, as well as their meeting in the 2023 edition. However, in their lone IPL outing in Dharamshala, the three-time finalists suffered a 111-run defeat after conceding 232 runs against the Adam Gilchrist-led Punjab side.\n\nOn that note, let us take a look at three player battles to watch out for in the PBKS vs RCB clash in IPL 2024.\n\n#1 Virat Kohli vs Arshdeep Singh\n\nOrange Cap holder Virat Kohli will be keen on maintaining his form (and 'strike rate', of course) in the intense battle against the people in the box. It was the ace batter who had scored a fifty to steer RCB to victory against PBKS the last time around.\n\nKohli's aggression, particularly in the powerplay, will be met with Arshdeep Singh with the new ball. The left-arm pacer has not been functioning at the peak of his powers, but has managed to pick up 15 wickets and is in the reckoning for the Purple Cap.\n\nHe had a dismal outing against RCB earlier this season, conceding 40 runs off 3.2 overs, and his overall economy for the season is also over 10 runs per over.\n\nIn terms of their head-to-head record on the field across six outings, Kohli has had the upper hand, scoring 56 runs off 30 deliveries at a strike rate of 186 without being dismissed even once.\n\n#2 Faf du Plessis vs Kagiso Rabada\n\nAt the other end, the battle of the Proteas aces will also prove to be defining. Kagiso Rabada has had a good couple of matches and enjoyed himself bowling in Dharamshala with the pace and bounce the surface offered. Overall, he has picked up 11 wickets in 11 matches at an economy rate of 8.86.\n\nThe right-arm pacer will be up against his former national skipper, who finally has some momentum under his belt. After a bleak first half of the IPL season, du Plessis now has three fifties in his last six innings, including a blistering 64 off 23 deliveries in his most recent outing.\n\nIn nine outings against each other in the shortest format, Rabada has managed to dismiss the opening batter on four occasions. Du Plessis has scored 66 runs off 47 deliveries at a strike rate of 140.42. Furthermore, it was Rabada who dismissed Du Plessis in the reverse fixture for just three runs off seven deliveries.\n\n#3 Prabhsimran Singh vs Mohammed Siraj\n\nPrabhsimran SIngh's handy knocks up the order have been a common feature in PBKS' matches of late. The right-handed batter has dominated new ball bowlers but will meet his match in the form of a resurgent Mohammed Siraj.\n\nThe right-arm pacer has turned his form around midway through the campaign and has played a huge role in RCB's revival, with crucial spells in their recent string of wins. He is making the new ball talk and will be on the lookout to dismiss Prabhsimran Singh early to expose PBKS' shaky middle order.\n\nThe pair have come up against each other on three occasions, with Prabhsimran scoring 10 runs off eight deliveries against Siraj. The opening batter will no doubt look to take on the new ball attack from the word go, which is what Siraj would prefer as it would give him a chance to strike early.", "source": {"uri":

The IPL debutant could have had Kohli again had Rilee Rossouw held on to a screamer.\n\nPBKS, however, couldn't create pressure as Sam Curran (1/50) conceded 16 runs, which included two fours and a six, with Will Jacks doing the maximum damage.\n\nKohli smashed Kaverappa for a six over long-off, but the bowler removed Jacks at the other end, with Harshal Patel (3/38) taking the catch for his second wicket.\n\nPatel, however, dropped Patidar and then conceded three boundaries while bowling as RCB scored 56 in the powerplay.\n\nIt started raining sixes thereafter as Kohli and Patidar slammed a maximum each to spoil Kaverappa's bowling figures.\n\nPatidar then creamed spinner Rahul Chahar for three mighty maximums before depositing Arshdeep and Sam Curran for two more sixes, the last one bringing up his fifty in 21 balls.\n\nWith Patidar on fire, RCB crossed 100 in the ninth overs. The Punjab skipper, however, got rid off Patidar in the 10th over with Jonny Bairstow holding on to an edge as RCB reached 119/3.\n\nRain briefly interrupted play as the spin duo of Liam Livingstone and Chahar bowled tidy overs after resumption. Kohli completed his fifty in 32 balls and hit Livingstone for two fours.\n\nGreen brought up the 150 with a four off Patel. Kohli then went berserk as he slog swept Livingstone for a six, while Curran was deposited over mid-wicket for a 94-metre maximum. He sent one over long-on for another maximum.\n\nDinesh Karthik (18) then helped RCB move past 240.

The ace batter wowed fans by playing a stunning 92-run knock against Punjab Kings (PBKS) at Dharamsala on Thursday, May 9.\n\nWhile Kohli hit some impressive strokes during his stay at the crease, his one-handed six off Vidwath Kaverappa's bowling caught the attention of many. On the first ball of the seventh over, the PBKS pacer dished out a full-length delivery.\n\nThe RCB batter countered it by stepping down the track and hitting over the long-off fence. Despite Kohli's bottom hand coming off the bat handle, the ball still sailed over the boundary for a maximum.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that Virat Kohli was dropped twice off Vidwath Kaverappa's bowling in the powerplay. Ashutosh Sharma put down a tough chance in the first over of the match, while Rilee Rossouw failed to complete a difficult catch in the third over.\n\nVirat Kohli missed out on a well-deserved century by just eight runs\n\nVirat Kohli was the top performer with the bat for RCB in their IPL 2024 encounter with PKBS. The seasoned campaigner narrowly missed out on a well-deserved ton, getting out on 92.\n\nThe star batter's innings came to an end in the 18th over. He was caught by Rilee Rossouw at deep backward point off Arshdeep Singh's bowling. Kohli scored 92 runs off 47 balls with the help of seven fours and six maximums.\n\nPunjab won the toss and elected to field first. While Bengaluru lost Faf du Plessis and Will Jacks early, Kohli and Rajat Patidar steadied the ship for their team, contributing 92 and 55, respectively.\n\nKohli has been in wonderful touch this season. The 35-year-old is currently the Orange Cap holder in IPL 2024, chalking up 634 runs in 12 innings at an average of 70.44 and a strike rate of 153.51.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aditya_suketu_desai@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Aditya Suketu Desai", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crease_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crease (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rilee_Rossouw", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rilee Rossouw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerplay_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Powerplay (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arshdeep_Singh_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arshdeep Singh (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Jacks", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Will Jacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajat_Patidar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rajat Patidar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faf_du_Plessis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Faf du Plessis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toss_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toss (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab,_India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Lawn_Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Lawn Bowling", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin_Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin Bowling", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/774c3-17152708684844-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548702", "eventUri": "eng-9548702", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 252, "textEnd": 257}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

This is due to the passing away of Chris Woakes' father, Roger Woakes.\n\nAccording to the Sportsrush, Roger played for the Warwickshire Second XI team. However, he couldn't represent the first XI team and earn a shot to make it to the national team.\n\nMeanwhile, the Punjab-based franchise snapped up Chris in the IPL 2024 auction for a price of INR 4.20 crore.

However, he hasn't featured in any games in the season.\n\nWoakes has played 21 IPL games and scalped 30 wickets and garnered 78 runs. His last appearance came in the Delhi Capitals jersey in 2021. In three games, he picked up five wickets for the Capitals in that season.\n\nThe 35-year-old pulled out of the 2023 auction to focus on the Ashes. He proved his worth by taking 19 wickets in three games at an exceptional average of 18.16.\n\nIPL 2024: RCB post a daunting total of 241 against PBKS\n\nThe Royal Challengers Bengaluru batted first against Punjab Kings on Thursday.

He stitched a 76-run stand with Rajat Patidar (55 off 23) to put the team in the driver's seat.\n\nKohli dictated terms before he was dismissed for a terrific 92 off 47 balls, with seven fours and six maximums. Then, Cameron Green (46) and Dinesh Karthik (18) were the contributors as RCB posted a mammoth 241 on the board.

However, since then Faf du Plessis and Co. have endured a horror time with six defeats on the trot. However, they have performed admirably in their last three matches, winning all of them and climbing to the seventh position in the points table.\n\nMeanwhile, Punjab, as usual, have had an inconsistent run in the league and are eighth in the table with four wins from 11 matches. A loss in the upcoming match will close the doors to the playoffs for both teams. Can RCB keep the momentum going in the survival race against PBKS?\n\nRCB openers have done well in the powerplay so far this season. While Virat Kohli is currently the highest run-scorer in the tournament with over 540 runs, Faf du Plessis is the second-highest run-scorer for RCB. Both are playing aggressively in the initial overs to give the team a quick-fire start to their innings.\n\nIn the last match against Gujarat Titans, they had made a partnership of 92 runs in the Powerplay. Notably, Kohli was adjudged Player of the Match in RCB's win over PBKS in their previous meeting. Du Plessis had a bad day at the office, but the Proteas batter has returned to form recently and will look to continue the momentum.\n\nRCB batters have a slight weakness against spinners but don't include Rajat Patidar in that list. The right-hander has been inconsistent this season, but he has made some impactful cameos in some matches. He is a good hitter against spin bowling and brings much-needed stability in the middle order.\n\nDinesh Karthik will bat in the lower middle order and will be set for a finishing role. He has played some remarkable knocks this season, including against PBKS. The keeper-batter remained unbeaten on 28 runs at an astonishing strike rate of 280 to take his team over the line against PBKS. Mahipal Lomror's batting position will depend on the game situation. He is someone who can chip in with some crucial runs in the late stages of the game.\n\nAlso Check: Orange Cap in IPL 2024- Most Runs\n\nWill Jacks' sensational form has boosted RCB's confidence. The Englishman is equally strong against spinners and batters. Having recently smashed a 41-ball 100 against Gujarat Titans, he seems even more thirsty to achieve more. Jacks is also a handy off-spinner.\n\nNext in the line-up are Glenn Maxwell and Cameron Green. The underperformance of the two Australians has been a headache for the franchise. Fans will not expect much from them in the batting department. Meanwhile, Maxwell had taken two wickets in the last match against PBKS. On the other hand, Green was impressive with his fast bowling in the last match against GT, conceding an economy 7 and picking up a wicket.\n\nKarn Sharma will be RCB's specialist spinner. The right-arm leg-spinner has been not impressive as he has leaked runs in abundance and failed to take wickets consistently. Karn will have the assistance of Impact Player Swapnil Singh in the middle overs.\n\nYash Dayal and Mohammed Siraj will comprise RCB's pace bowling unit. The two performed impressively in the previous clash against PBKS. Siraj took two wickets at an economy rate of 6.50 while Dayal took one wicket at 5.80. RCB will be hoping that both of them will have another effective outing.\n\nAlso Check: Purple Cap in IPL 2024 - Most Wickets\n\nVirat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Will Jacks, Rajat Patidar, Glenn

Kohli then went berserk as he slog swept Livingstone for a six, while Curran was deposited over mid-wicket for a 94-metre maximum.

But rarely has an almost-hundred been so devastating. Laced with six sixes and seven boundaries, 92 off 47 balls was exactly the kind of platform RCB needed to pile up 241/7 against Punjab Kings at Dharamsala before their bowlers held their nerve to close out a 60-run win and stay in the hunt for the playoffs.\n\nBut Kohli shouldn't have even opened his account. Ashutosh Sharma had ample time to get into a good position after Kohli's miscued hoick off Vidwath Kaverappa sent the ball swirling in the air. But he barely got a hand to it.\n\nGiven a life, Kohli made the most of it as RCB scored 119 in the first 10 overs and 122 in the next 10 after a rain-forced break. Kohli paced his innings like only he can -- his first two sixes coming in the initial 6.1 overs before taking the aerial route again from the 15th over. If his fifty came in 32 balls, the next 42 came off 15.\n\n\"It was important for me to keep up the strike rate right through,\" Kohli told the broadcasters during the innings break. \"There was a two-paced feel with the new ball. We thought anything over 230 would be a good total here. That was the only mindset.\"\n\nAt that stage of the tournament where points alone may not carry a team through to the IPL playoffs, strike rate has assumed critical importance. RCB didn't skimp on that front. If Kohli's strike rate of 195.74 was exhilarating, simply mindblowing was the way Rajat Patidar dismantled Punjab Kings' bowling with a 23-ball 55. Also dropped on zero, Patidar carted six sixes -- half of them off Rahul Chahar -- as RCB rode a 27-ball 46 from Cameron Green and a seven-ball 18 from Dinesh Karthik to score their fourth-highest IPL total, and their highest away from home.\n\nPressed to maintain a rate of over 12 runs, Punjab Kings landed their share of punches too as they raced to 100 in just 8.2 overs. Rilee Rossouw was responsible for this momentum, picking apart Mohammed Siraj for 4,4,4,6 in the fourth over after he too was dropped by Mahipal Lomror at backward point in the previous over.\n\nBut Rossouw's luck ultimately ran out in the ninth over when pulled Karn Sharma to Will Jacks at long-on. Shashank Singh kept hopes alive, striking at almost 200 before Kohli snuffed out Kings' hopes by brilliantly running him out.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Jacks", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Will Jacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rilee_Rossouw", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rilee Rossouw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajat_Patidar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rajat Patidar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karn_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karn Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahipal_Lomror", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mahipal Lomror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinesh_Karthik", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dinesh Karthik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shashank_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shashank Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Chahar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Chahar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Siraj", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Siraj"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Coaching_and_Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Coaching and Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By_Type", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By Type", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball/Pickleball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball/Pickleball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/05/09/1600x900/Virat_Kohli_IPL_2024_1715279695224_1715279695476.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548702", "eventUri": "eng-9548702", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

In a video that quickly went viral on social media, Kohli, the star batter of RCB, was seen engaging in an impromptu session with young cricketers, signing autographs and sharing invaluable insights.\n\nAP\n\nThis heartening interaction comes at a crucial juncture for RCB, who have been experiencing a rollercoaster ride in this year's IPL. Despite a slow start to their campaign, with just one win in the first half of the season, Kohli's team has mounted an impressive comeback, securing three consecutive victories.\n\nCurrently occupying the seventh position on the points table with four wins out of 11 matches and 8 points to their name, RCB faces a must-win situation against Punjab Kings to keep their playoff hopes alive.\n\nKohli's individual brilliance has been a standout feature of RCB's resurgence, with the prolific batsman emerging as the highest run-scorer of the season, amassing 542 runs in 11 matches. His stellar performances have not only endeared him to fans worldwide but also earned him a spot in India's 15-member squad for the upcoming T20 World Cup.\n\nAlso Read: A Look Inside Anushka Sharma And Virat Kohli's Luxurious House In Alibaug\n\nHowever, as the anticipation builds for the marquee tournament, there remains speculation regarding Kohli's batting position in the Indian XI. While some advocate for Kohli to open alongside Rohit Sharma, a pairing that has only been tested once in the T20 format, others argue in favor of retaining Kohli's traditional spot at number three in the batting order.\n\nAs RCB gears up for their crucial encounter against Punjab Kings, who are also vying for a spot in the playoffs with the same number of points but a lower net run rate, the stakes couldn't be higher. Led by Faf du Plessis, RCB enters the showdown buoyed by their recent winning streak, aiming to maintain their momentum and secure a vital victory in their quest for IPL glory.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, a sizable crowd of fans assembled at Kangra Airport in Himachal Pradesh to welcome the arrival of the Royal Challengers Bengaluru squad ahead of their upcoming IPL 2024 fixture against Punjab Kings at the HPCA Stadium in Dharamsala.\n\nAlso Read: Did Rinku Singh Finally Receive Another Bat From Virat Kohli After KKR vs RCB?\n\nThe majority of the airport crowd had gathered in anticipation of catching a glimpse of their favorite cricketer, Virat Kohli, who received an enthusiastic welcome as he emerged from the airport building to thunderous cheers.", "source": {"uri": "indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IndiaTimes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anushka_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anushka Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangra_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kangra Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rinku_Singh_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rinku Singh (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himachal_Pradesh_Cricket_Association_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faf_du_Plessis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Faf du Plessis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_run_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Net run rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting order (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himachal_Pradesh", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Himachal Pradesh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Himachal Pradesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://im.indiatimes.in/content/2024/May/ipiccy_image---2024-05-08T143017166_663b3f8224443.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548702", "eventUri": "eng-9548702", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

PBKS will face the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) in an IPL 2024 league game in Dharamsala on Thursday, May 9.\n\nWith eight points from 11 games, PBKS are placed eighth on the points table. A win on Thursday will help them climb above RCB into seventh position, keeping their slim playoff hopes alive and knocking their opponents out of the race.\n\nPreviewing the match in a video shared on his YouTube channel, Chopra pointed out that the Punjab Kings are prone to slipping at crunch moments, citing the example of their loss against the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in their previous league game.\n\n\"When these two teams faced off at the Chinnaswamy Stadium last time, the Bengaluru team had won only one of their first six or seven games, and that was against them (PBKS). So it is a slight payback time. Whenever it seems that Punjab have momentum, they stop themselves,\" he said (0:50).\n\n\"You should have defeated Chennai in the last match, the sort of total you had restricted them to was gettable on a very good batting surface. However, they lost there and that's probably been their story in the last 16 to 17 years. Whenever it seems like they are coming close to qualifying, some things go wrong,\" the former India opener added.\n\nPBKS restricted CSK to 167/9 in an afternoon game in Dharamsala on Sunday, May 5. However, Sam Curran and company managed only 139/9 in the chase and lost the match by 28 runs.\n\n\"Jonny Bairstow's form and their strings to success are tied together\" - Aakash Chopra on Punjab Kings players in focus\n\nAakash Chopra chose Jonny Bairstow as the first Punjab Kings player in focus in Thursday's game.\n\n\"Jonny Bairstow's form and their (PBKS') strings to success are tied together. When he does well, the team automatically does well. However, when he has played slightly badly, the match has gone. It will be an all-Indian bowling lineup in the opposition apart from Cameron Green. So mine and the team's focus is on Bairstow,\" he reasoned (2:10).\n\nThe cricketer-turned-commentator picked Shashank Singh as the other Punjab Kings batter to watch out for against the Royal Challengers Bengaluru.\n\n\"Moving forward from Bairstow, we will talk about Shashank Singh because he gladdens the heart due to the way he is playing. He is playing with maturity. Until he is at the ground, you believe Punjab is alive. He has such a good temperament. He doesn't get flustered. He controls the game,\" Chopra observed.\n\nChopra chose Arshdeep Singh as the Punjab Kings bowler in focus and urged him to be both potent and economical.\n\n\"Harshal (Patel) bowled well in the last match. Rahul Chahal did very well in the last two matches but since it is a night game, I am going with Arshdeep Singh. You have to take wickets and be economical because you have been slightly too expensive thus far and that's not good for me, the Indian team, you and Punjab,\" he elaborated.\n\nWith 15 scalps at an economy rate of 10.06 in 11 games, Arshdeep is PBKS' second-highest wicket-taker in IPL 2024. Only Harshal Patel (17) has taken more wickets for the franchise this season.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kartik_iyer@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Kartik Iyer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chennai Super Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonny_Bairstow", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jonny Bairstow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Curran", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Curran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._Chinnaswamy_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "M.

They won just one out of five games in Mullanpur, their main home ground.\n\nA change in venue to the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium also didn't go their way in the previous game here.The team would hope to end its home run on a high but for that to happen, the PBKS unit has to fire in unison.\n\nMatch starts at 7.30 PM.

Mohammed Siraj picked up 3/43 for RCB, while there were two wickets apiece for Swapnil Singh, Lockie Ferguson and Karn Sharma.\n\nVirat Kohli: The RCB legend continues to shine for the Bengaluru franchise at the top of the order and will look to rely on his consistency as they aim to keep their slim chances of a spot in the playoffs alive.\n\nRuturaj Gaikwad: Despite being handed the responsibility of leading the defending champions, CSK, Gaikwad has managed to continue his consistent form with the bat and the champions will expect the skipper to score the big runs at the top of the order for CSK's remaining games.\n\nTravis Head: The explosive opening batter has shown his class for the Sunrisers and has built a reputation for scoring the big runs and helping the side in a bid to the top four.

His ability to take wickets, particularly in the death makes him a crucial asset for Punjab's bowling unit.\n\nJasprit Bumrah: The ace in the hole for Mumbai Indians is the shining light for the franchise in what has been a disastrous season for the five-time champions. His ability to bowl in all three stages of the innings along with his wicket-taking skills while keeping the run flow on a minimum makes him arguably the best bowler of the tournament.\n\nVarun Chakravarthy: The mystery spinner was definitely one of the weak points in KKR's bowling unit through the initial stages of the tournament, but his persistence finally paid off in dividends and finds himself among the top wicket-takers in IPL 2024.\n\nArshdeep Singh: The best part about the left-arm pacer is his ability to play with both the new and older ball and also be able to pick up wickets regularly. Despite going for runs, his wicket-taking skills will prove to be vital if PBKS are to make it through to the playoffs.\n\nT Natarajan: Despite injuries holding him back in the previous years, he has now been able to get back to his best form with the ball and remains the ace for SRH's bowling unit by being able to bowl in all phases of the innings and also take wickets regularly.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting order (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himachal_Pradesh_Cricket_Association_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasprit_Bumrah", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jasprit Bumrah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rilee_Rossouw", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rilee Rossouw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajat_Patidar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajat Patidar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harshal_Patel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harshal Patel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karn_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karn Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swapnil_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swapnil Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shashank_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shashank Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chennai Super Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockie_Ferguson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lockie Ferguson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Siraj", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Siraj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruturaj_Gaikwad", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ruturaj Gaikwad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanju_Samson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sanju Samson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunil_Narine", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunil Narine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket-keeper", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wicket-keeper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

The spin duo of Swapnil Singh and Karn Sharma picked up four crucial wickets between them as Bengaluru bowled out Punjab for 181 runs in 17 overs.\n\nWith 10 points in 12 matches, Bengaluru are still in the race to qualify while the Punjab Kings have been knocked out of playoff contention.\n\nPunjab won the toss and elected to field first and almost had the perfect start with Kohli skying a swinging delivery from debutant Vidwath Kaverappa high in the sky only for Ashutosh Sharma to drop it. Kohli survived another drop when batting at 10 even as Kaverappa got rid of captain Faf du Plessis and Will Jacks to leave Bengaluru stuttering at 43/2.\n\nNew batter Rajat Patidar and Kohli took charge of the batting as the pair put up 76 runs from just 32 balls. Patidar was the aggressor in the partnership as he brought up his half century in 21 balls with three fours and six sixes.\n\nFollowing Patidar's departure for a 23-ball 55, Kohli then stitched together a 92-run partnership off just 46 balls with Cameron Green (46). Though Kohli missed out on a century, his 92 runs of 47 balls ensured the Bengaluru bowlers had enough runs on the board to defend.\n\nPunjab lost opener Prabhsimran Singh early on in the chase but in Jonny Bairstow and Rilee Roussow, had two aggressive batters who took on the Bengaluru bowlers. The duo put up 65 runs for the second wicket before Du Plessis took a stunning running catch to dismiss Bairstow.\n\nRoussow kept Punjab in the hunt with a 27-ball 67 but the South African's departure spelt the end for Punjab. They kept losing wickets at regular intervals before ultimately folding up for 181.\n\nTurning Point of the match\n\nVidwath Kaverappa was inches away from a dream debut. The 25-year-old Karnataka bowler deceived Kohli with an away swinging delivery with just the third ball of the match. Kohli went to hit it on the on side but ended up slicing it high into the Dharamshala night sky. There were four Punjab fielders converging behind point. Ashuthosh Sharma, who had run backwards from point, looked primed to gobble a tough catch but grassed it.\n\nIn Kaverappa's next over, Kohli played a powerful cover drive towards Rilee Roussow only for the South African to drop it.\n\nKohli was dropped at 0 and 10. He ended up scoring a match-winning 92 in the end.\n\nThe Field's Player of the Match\n\nLook no further than King Kohli. The 35-year-old batter was once again in imperious form as he played the role of the anchor brilliantly. Having survived two dropped chances early on and navigating a tricky over of spin from Liam Livingstone, Kohli found his groove as he brought out his repertoire of classical shots.\n\nKohli even took on the Livingstone and Rahul Chahar later on in the innings as he slog swept a couple of sixes off the spinners. Unfortunately for him, Kohli missed out on his 100th hundred across formats.\n\nKohli was also lightning on the field as he brilliantly ran out Shashank Singh with a direct hit to all but end Punjab's hopes of a win.\n\n'Quality over quantity'\n\nA lot of questions over the past few years have been on Kohli's low strike rate. This season, the former India captain has shown that he can evolve even at his stage of his career.\n\nThursday night's heroics was just another example of Kohli learning from his mistakes and constantly trying to evolve as a batter.", "source": {"uri": "scroll.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Scroll.in"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dilip_unnikrishnan@scroll.in", "name": "Dilip Unnikrishnan",

Kohli scored 92 off 47 deliveries as he answered the criticism towards his strike-rate with a fine knock in Dharamsala.\n\nKohli was given lifelines twice by PBKS in Dharamsala when he was batting on 0 and 10. First, it was Ashutosh Sharma as the RCB star skied a delivery from Kaverappa and the PBKS batter was unable to hold on. The next one also came off the bowling from Kaverappa, as Rilee Rossouw almost produced a stunning effort to dismiss Kohli.\n\nThe RCB star would then change gears and maximised the powerplay and started with a boundary off Sam Curran's bowling in the 4th over. The RCB star kept losing partners at the other end with Faf du Plessis and Will Jacks failing to make an impact. He finally found the right partner in Raja Patidar, who also survived a catch scare in his very first ball.\n\nThe duo would punish PBKS for their errors on the field as the score went past the 100-run mark after 9 overs. Patidar was in destructive mode against the spinners and scored his fifty off 21 balls, before falling to Curran.\n\nKohli's momentum was halted a bit as rain and hailstorms interrupted the game after 10 overs with the score at 119 for 3.

He would go level with KL Rahul for the record. A couple of sixes followed from Kohli, with the one off Curran's bowling an absolute beauty as the crowd in Dharamsala were up on their feet.\n\nKohli was predominantly strong on the leg-side and Curran continued to feel the wrath of the Indian batter.

This knock was a statement of intent, a sign that Kohli is back in prime form just in time for the crucial T20 World Cup later this year.\n\nThe Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) talisman started with a bang, showcasing supreme touch from the very first ball.

Risk-free accumulation is the bedrock of Kohli's batting, even in T20 cricket, and if he gets lives, it makes him even more determined to dig in.\n\nPunjab Kings had already played into Kohli's hands, in some ways, by omitting their pace spearhead Kagiso Rabada and their miserly left-arm finger spinner Harpreet Brar, the style of bowling that has often kept Kohli in check in T20s. That skipper Sam Curran chose to field first meant Punjab Kings were devoid of express pace at the start and economy in the middle. The foundation for the 60-run defeat that knocked them out of play-off contention was laid with the choices made before a ball was bowled.\n\nDespite that, IPL debutant Vidwath Kaverappa should have got the prize wicket, if only Ashutosh Sharma - running back from cover - and Rilee Rossouw - diving at short cover - had held on to admittedly tough chances. Those were not the only catches dropped by the sloppy Punjab Kings, Harshal Patel dropping a dolly at deep backward square to reprieve Rajat Patidar, which kickstarted the onslaught by Royal Challengers Bengaluru.\n\nOther than the dropped catches, Kohli lived a charmed life at the start of his innings, with many of his errant shots landing in vacant territory or in front of fielders. But one knew that it was a passing phase and if he stayed in the middle for any length of time, the fielding side would have to play. The lack of express pace in the bowling attack meant he could step down the track and hit over the top with freedom, one such shot going all the way even though one hand came off the bat.\n\nRCB were 119/3 at the halfway mark, when a short interruption for rain and hail made it easier for batting, with the slightly two-paced nature of the wicket rectified. Hitting against spin has been mentioned as one of the recent issues in Kohli's batting but on Thursday, he slog-swept Rahul Chahar and Liam Livingstone into the stands with impunity.\n\nAt the innings break, Kohli mentioned that he made it a point to maintain a high strike rate, which was very nearly 200 for the whole innings. Even a possible century didn't deter him from going for the big hits in the death overs, perishing in the pursuit of quick runs. But his 92 off 47 balls had taken RCB well on the way to their fourth successive win in the competition. Kohli's evening got even better when he ran out the dangerous Shashank Singh with a direct hit from the outfield.\n\nTurbocharger Patidar\n\nPatidar has taken it on himself to give the team momentum batting first even as Kohli settles in for the long haul. At Dharamsala, he could have been out without scoring, but the let-off only emboldened him to take the attack to the bowlers.\n\nPatidar stood still at the crease, saw the ball early and hit it to all parts of the ground. Harshal Patel got him going with a full ball on leg-stump, which was dispatched through mid-wicket. He then showed both his touch and power in the same over, with a delicate late-cut and a drive past mid-off. Kaverappa was hit for six over long-on, but it was the arrival of Chahar that got Patidar in the mood. The first deliveries were long hops that went way beyond long-on and square leg.\n\nThe fifth ball of the over was full and offered a bit of width and was smashed beyond long-off. When Arshdeep Singh and Curran dug it short, they weren't quick enough to trouble Curran and were deposited over the legside boundary. The second one brought a 21-ball half-century. There's a lot of talk about RCB being a top-heavy team, and Patidar's contribution in the middle order is a key factor as they remain in the running for a playoff spot.\n\nKings in name only\n\nThe last time Punjab Kings made the playoffs was 10 years ago, and if they were a football club in a league having promotion and relegation, they would be fighting to avoid the drop almost every season. The matches they win are one-off achievements -- be it the highest successful T20 chase or two domestic players pulling off a memorable heist.\n\nOn Thursday, with their season on the line, they dropped two of their best bowlers in Rabada and Brar, and dropped at least three catches inside the Powerplay, which left them a mountain to climb in the second innings. Livingstone, brought in for the South African speedster, made a duck off two balls.\n\nEven with the bat, apart from a brief flurry from Jonny Bairstow and Rilee Rossouw and some big shots from Shashank Singh, the rest of the batting was a damp squib, never threatening the score they were supposed to chase. It's as if the team, and the franchise, expected to be knocked out of contention. If it happens every alternate season, it can be put down to inconsistency. But when it is a regular occurrence, the team and the decision-makers have to ask some hard questions and take a good look at themselves.\n\nBrief scores: Royal Challengers Bengaluru 241/7 (Kohli 92,

This was after the commentators - an eclectic group of game's greats and internationals of repute - had been critical about his strike rate and his skills to take on the spinners.\n\n\"It is about winning the game for the team. And there is a reason you have done this for 15 years ... You have done this, day in and day out. You have won games for your team. And I am not quite sure, if you have not been in that situation yourself, to sit and speak about the game from a box,\" Kohli had said. Here the 'you' alternately meant 'I' and the 'commentators'. Kohli didn't take names but it was easy to guess who he was targeting.\n\nOn Saturday evening, the box reacted. Indian great Sunil Gavaskar lashed out at the broadcaster Star Sports for airing clips of Kohli's comments repeatedly. Gavaskar, in the pre-match show before RCB vs GT, said: \"All these guys talk about, 'oh we don't care about outside noise'. Accha! Then why are you replying to any outside noise or whatever it is. We all played a bit of cricket, not a lot of cricket. We don't have agendas. We speak about what we see. We don't necessarily have any likes and dislikes. Even if we have likes and dislikes, we actually speak on what is happening... I hope Star Sports realises that when that clip is shown, questioning the critics, the critics are your own commentators. For you to show the person belittling your own commentators, I'm not sure that's a great thing. You need to realise you have shown it enough times, everybody's got the message. I would be very disappointed if you show it once more.\" (READ MORE)", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab,_India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunil_Gavaskar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunil Gavaskar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himachal_Pradesh_Cricket_Association_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chennai Super Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat_Titans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gujarat Titans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Sports_(Indian_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Star Sports (Indian TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/ICC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/ICC", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/05/PBKS-RCB-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548702", "eventUri": "eng-9548702", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4666666666666666, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

Ahead of the game, Aakash Chopra has noted that Virat Kohli and Faf du Plessis form a formidable opening pair for the visitors.\n\nWith eight points from 11 games, RCB are placed seventh on the points table. They need to win their remaining three league games to stand any chance of qualifying for the playoffs.\n\nIn a video shared on his YouTube channel, Chopra picked Kohli and Du Plessis as the first two RCB players to watch out for in Thursday's game.\n\n\"Virat Kohli is the first. He was probably dropped by (Jonny) Bairstow at slip for zero off Sam Curran's bowling the last time these two teams met but after that, he batted extremely well. I am once again expecting that kind of batting because Virat Kohli bats well in every match. He is the chase master,\" he reasoned (5:05).\n\n\"He nearly scored a century the last time he played at this ground against New Zealand and he batted really well. So he is my first player to watch out for. The second, I am going with Faf du Plessis because one plus one is not two but 11,\" the former India opener added.\n\nChopra reckons the conditions in Dharamsala and the RCB skipper's good recent form should hold him in good stead.\n\n\"He was in good form in the last match and was batting decently in the match before that as well. You won't get to see much spin here because it is Dharamsala. When he starts playing well, he consistently strings together a few innings. So I am assuming Faf will play well,\" he elaborated.\n\nWith 542 runs at a strike rate of 148.08 in 11 innings, Kohli is the highest run-scorer in IPL 2024. Du Plessis, who has smashed 352 runs at a strike of 172.54 in 11 games is RCB's second-highest run-getter.\n\n\"It's going to be a good pitch, so you can think about Will Jacks\" - Aakash Chopra on the 3rd RCB player in focus\n\nAakash Chopra reckons either Will Jacks or Cameron Green can be the third RCB player to watch out for against PBKS.\n\n\"Who can be the third player? I am thinking about Will Jacks. It's going to be a good pitch, so you can think about Will Jacks, or else Cameron Green because a little bowling and batting on this pitch. So one of these two overseas players. Since this team's entire structure is built around overseas players, you can choose anyone between Cameron Green and Will Jacks,\" he explained (6:15).\n\nJacks has aggregated 177 runs at a strike rate of 186.31 in six innings in IPL 2024. Green has scored 112 runs at a strike rate of 125.84 in eight innings and has taken seven wickets at an economy rate of 9.18 in 24.1 overs this season.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kartik_iyer@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Kartik Iyer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faf_du_Plessis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Faf du Plessis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_cricket_team_in_India_in_2021\u201322", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand cricket team in India in 2021\u201322"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Jacks", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Will Jacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Curran", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Curran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/48f3a-17152372396055-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548702", "eventUri": "eng-9548702", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 120, "textEnd": 125}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

The team that loses might be down and out as other teams would progress further in the race to playoffs. The team winning would stay alive in the race for the playoffs.\n\nThe match is set to take place at Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Cricket Stadium in Dharamshala on the 9th of May 2024 at 7:30 PM (IST). Both teams would be desperate to win this as they do not have any other choice. Both teams have had a similar journey in the tournament so far. Both RCB and PBKS have 4 wins and 7 losses to their in the 11 matches. RCB with a better net run rate is placed a position above PBKS. While RCB are placed in 7th position, PBKS are reeling in the eighth position.\n\nBoth teams have their own strengths and weaknesses. While PBKS is not getting enough contribution with the bat from the likes of Rilee Rossouw, Sam Curran, and Jitesh Sharma, RCB has the likes of Cameron Green and Glenn Maxwell who have not fired with the bat as well as they would have liked. The winner of the match will secure 7th spot in the points table. But their chances of qualifying for the playoffs will stay alive. A loss would be a tough pill to swallow.\n\nAt the top of the order, PBKS are likely to continue with the likes of Jonny Bairstow and Prabsimran Singh. The latter will be in the team as an impact substitute and will be used as a pure batter. The emerging player has played fine knocks in the last few games and deserves to be backed despite failing in the last game. If required, he can be handy as a wicketkeeper in case they need to get rid of Jitesh Sharma due to his poor form in the season. Singh can take the game away in a matter of a few overs.\n\nJonny Bairstow has been the best batter of PBKS in the last 4-5 games. The right-handed batter has returned to form after failing to do well in the finest few matches of the season. The English batter played a key role in the highest run chase in the history of the league when PBKS chased 262 against KKR last month. The home side would love to see the opener play a similar knock as a batter and win an important game for the side. When on song, he is difficult to be stopped.\n\nIn the middle order, PBKS has good Indian talents. While many of them stepped up, others have not been at their best. Rilee Rossouw has failed to bat well for the 2014 runner-ups in 4 of the 5 games. The Southpaw has 79 runs in 5 games with a best score of 45 runs. Additionally, Jitesh Sharma has not been firing as a batter. Despite getting a lot of backing from the management, the WK batter has failed to live up to the expectations. He needs to step up as soon as possible.\n\nAlso Check: IPL 2024 Orange Cap\n\nShashank Singh has been the best batter of PBKS this season. The emerging batter was not known to many before this season and has come out as a surprise package. The right-handed batter has finished a lot of games for his side and helped PBKS chase down the biggest total in the history of the league. Ashutosh Sharma has been equally impressive as Shashank. Much like Singh, Sharma has been able to finish games well. The right-handed batter won some games for PBKS as a batter.\n\nPBKS have a good set of All-rounders. One of them is Sam Curran. The interim skipper has done a good job as a bowler and has been impressive as a captain. However, he needs to step up as a batter given the position he is batting. His poor form has cost PBKS a lot of games. The injury of Liam Livingstone came at the wrong time for PBKS as his absence has been felt. The English player's contribution as a batter and a bowler would have helped PBKS a lot.\n\nHarpreet Brar has been handy as a lower-order batter. The emerging player has played fine cameos whenever opportunities came for him. As a bowler, he has been highly impressive. Though he is not a wicket-taker, Brar can make an impact with his economical spells. PBKS has missed the services of Sikandar Raza who did not get to play a lot of games and had to pull out of the tournament midway due to the national services. PBKS needs Brar to be at his best against RCB.\n\nPBKS have one of the best bowling lineups this season. The home conditions assisting the bowlers have also played a key role in it. The 2014 finalists have Kagiso Rabada and Arshdeep Singh as the new-ball pair. While Rabada has been a bit expensive, he has gotten some important wickets. The South African needs to be consistent with his contributions. Arshdeep will also operate at the death and is a wicket-taking option. His form is crucial for PBKS to stay alive in the league.\n\nAlso Check: IPL 2024 Purple Cap\n\nTo deliver at the death alongside Arshdeep, PBKS has Harshal Patel. He is a wicket-taker and can bowl good slower ones at the death. He will also operate in the middle overs alongside Brar and Rahul Chahar. The latter has been the best bowler of PBKS in the last 3-4 games. He has been miserly and has taken wickets as well. The leg-spinner bowled well in both game against CSK and made an impact in the death overs too. All of the bowlers in PBKS can bat a bit, which is a good advantage.\n\nJonny Bairstow, Rilee Rossouw, Sam Curran (C), Jitesh Sharma (WK), Shashank Singh, Ashutosh Sharma, Harpreet Brar, Harshal

With the recent form of the Royal Challengers Bengaluru batsmen, they have a slight advantage.\n\nThis 58th match of the IPL 2024 season carries immense weight, as the loser will likely be eliminated from playoff contention.\n\nRCB's performance has been a tale of two halves. After a sluggish start, their batting unit has recently found its groove. Since a narrow loss to Sunrisers Hyderabad, their top order, consisting of Faf du Plessis, Virat Kohli, Will Jacks, and Rajat Patidar, has provided much-needed stability.\n\nFaf du Plessis' resurgence has been instrumental, providing quick runs in the powerplay and allowing middle-order batsmen like Will Jacks and Patidar to flourish. This newfound momentum could propel them to victory in this crucial match.\n\nWith a reliable top order, Virat Kohli has been freed to play his natural game. His strike rate has jumped significantly in recent matches, reflecting the greater confidence instilled by a solid batting line-up.\n\nPunjab Kings have displayed a contrasting pattern. While they have performed well away from home, their record at home venues has been disappointing.\n\nThis match marks their final home game in Dharamshala for IPL 2024, and they will be desperate to turn things around.\n\nThe upcoming clash between RCB and PBKS is a do-or-die situation for both teams as they fight for survival in the IPL 2024 playoffs race.", "source": {"uri": "businessupturn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Upturn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Batting order (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Jacks", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Will Jacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faf_du_Plessis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Faf du Plessis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajat_Patidar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rajat Patidar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://images.businessupturn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-2024-05-09T151110.033-1024x576.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548702", "eventUri": "eng-9548702", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

He stood firm in the middle and tried to attack the bowlers in which he got a lot of success.\n\nKohli was well supported by Punjab Kings fielders as they gave two lifelines to the batter after dropping his catch. The 35-year-old looked in no mood to stop and he played an attacking brand of cricket throughout his innings.\n\nVirat Kohli entered the 90s by smashing a four and a six to Arshdeep Singh and he was trying to reach the three-figure mark with a boundary. However, one of his shots didn't connect well and he was caught by the Rilee Rossouw in the 18th over, falling short of a century by 8 runs. Kohli finished his innings with 92 runs off 47 balls, with 7 fours and 6 sixes, and he batted with a strike rate of 195.74.\n\nVirat Kohli also unlocked several milestones during his sensational innings against the Punjab Kings. He became the first player to breach the 600-run mark in IPL 2024 and overall this was the 4th time he achieved this feat in the history of the tournament. He also became the first player in IPL history to score over 1000 runs against 3 teams in an IPL season.\n\nSpeaking during the mid-innings break, Virat Kohli once again took a dig at his strike rate critics, saying that he needed to keep his scoring rate up throughout the innings. Kohli said:\n\n\"Was important for me to keep up the strike rate right through the innings (laughs). I was just focused on taking the momentum forward. There was a tricky phase when Rajat got out, and there was a break for rain and hail. We had a bit of stop of momentum. Had to rebuild for 8-10 balls. Once the base was set and Cam got a few boundaries away, I thought I had to go again.\"\n\nTalking about the pitch, Virat Kohli said that it was quite dry and there was a feel of the two-paced wicket. Virat Kohli elaborated:\n\n\"Surface was pretty dry underneath, and there was some grass coverage as well. If you saw Faf and me got done by lack of pace off the pitch. There was a two-paced feel with the new ball, which I think is a great opportunities for our bowlers to make early inroads and exploit that swing out there.\"\n\nVirat Kohli also opined that the target of over 230 was a par score in Dharamsala. He said:\n\n\"We thought anything over 230 would be a good total here. That was the only mindset. That was a hell of an over from Harshal in the last over otherwise we would've been 250-plus.\"\n\nVirat Kohli was also asked to share his views on PBKS debutant Vidwath Kaverappa, who bagged two wickets in the match.

The loss knocked Punjab out of contention for the playoffs.\n\nFast bowler Vidwath Kaverappa in his IPL debut had the wickets of Faf du Plessis (9) and Will Jacks (12) and twice came close to dismissing Kohli, who escaped a chance before he had scored and then Rossouw floored a catch when Kohli had reached 10.\n\nKaverappa should also have had the wicket of Patidar for zero but Harshal Patel fluffed an opportunity at deep backward square leg as the fast bowler finished with 2-36 off his unchanged four-over spell with the new ball.\n\nPatidar got another life on 33 when wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow couldn't grab a thick edge before the power-hitter completed his half-century featuring six sixes and three boundaries. There was a brief stoppage of play due to rain and hail just after Patidar's whirlwind knock ended when he was caught behind.\n\nKohli and Cameron Green (46) continued to countercharge after play resumed as Punjab skipper Sam Curran returned with expensive figures of 0-50 off his three overs and Bengaluru smashed 77 off the last five overs.\n\nKohli became the first batter to cross the 600-run mark this season, but just when he looked set for his second century he sliced Arshdeep Singh (1-41) to Rossouw at deep cover in the 18th over.\n\nPatel (3-38) denied Bengaluru reaching 250 with a brilliant last over which went for just three runs as the fast bowler had Dinesh Karthik (18) and Green caught by Curran and in between clean bowled Mahipal Lomror for zero.", "source": {"uri":

Kohli did not care about an approaching milestone as he tried hitting a six when batting on 92 in the 18th over. He was caught in the deep point region, but Kohli looked content with his knock. The RCB star raised his bat and soaked in the applause from the crowd at the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium as he walked back to the dressing room.\n\nKohli even joked about his strike rate when talking to the broadcasters during the mid-inning break after helping RCB break the record for the highest team total in IPL history in Dharamsala. It was a sly dig at his critics, but Kohli made sure it did not come across as one, unlike his rant against the critics last month.\n\n\"It was important to keep up my strike-rate through the innings so I wanted to take on the momentum,\" Virat Kohli said with a smile on his face.\n\nAfter nearly batting through RCB's innings, Virat Kohli showed no signs of slowing down on the field. The former captain kept RCB's energy high even as Punjab got off to a sensational start in their chase.\n\nVirat Kohli mimicked Rilee Rossouw's trademark rifle celebration after the South African star was dismissed in the 9th over. Rossouw was threatening to take the game away from RCB as he smashed 61 off just 27 balls, hitting 3 sixes and 9 boundaries. Rossouw brought out his trademark rifle celebration after he got to his fifty. Kohli remembered it and gave it back to the South African batter when Karn Sharma got the big wicket in the 9th over when PBKS had already gone past 100.\n\nThe television cameras captured Virat Kohli mimicking Rilee Rossouw's rile celebration gesture and photos of it went viral on social media.\n\nTo top it all, Virat Kohli proved age is just a number with his final act of the day. Kohli ran from the cover region and pulled off a remarkable direct hit to send PBKS' danger man Shashank Singh back to the pavillion.\n\nShasank, who was running to the non-striker's end, fell short of the crease as Kohli fired in a throw even as was completing a dive in one of the most stylish run-outs of the IPL 2024 season.\n\nVirat Kohli's sensational show with the bat and a collective bowling performance from the bowlers saw the former finalists win by 60 runs in Dharamsala.

Punjab Kings will be playing their seventh and last match at home, while this will be the seventh and last match on the road for Royal Challengers Bengaluru.\n\nIn the ongoing tournament, the Kings have won four matches and lost seven matches so far. They are currently in eighth place in the points table. Thus, Punjab Kings would like to come back to their winning momentum. On the other hand, the Challengers have also won four matches and seven five matches as well. They are currently in seventh place in the points table. Thus, the Challengers would like to continue their winning momentum. This will be an important game for both teams concerning the future of the tournament.\n\nThese two teams' last meeting was in match 6 of the IPL 2024 at Bengaluru, where the Kings posted a score of 176 courtesy of Shikhar Dhawan 45(37) who played superbly.

However, he wasn't able to do that as Virat Kohli and Faf du Plessis came in his way and stopped him from doing that.\n\nShashank Singh played a sensational innings and smashed 37 runs off 19 balls, with 4 fours and 2 sixes, before getting run out in the match. Notably, his run out came a delivery after his nasty collision with RCB skipper Faf du Plessis.\n\nOn the third ball of the 14th over, Lockie Ferguson bowled a short-length ball to Sam Curran and he played it towards the leg side and ran two along with Shashank Singh. As Shashank Singh was coming back for two, Faf du Plessis came in his way and there was a massive collision between the players, the effect of which was mostly on the PBKS star, who hurt his shoulder and looked in terrible pain. Despite a nasty collision, Shashank decided to continue but his innings didn't last long as he was dismissed on the next ball.\n\nAfter playing a shortish delivery to the leg-side the PBKS batters once again decided to take two runs, but Virat Kohli didn't let that happen as he came in running from deep mid-wicket and fired a sensational direct hit to catch Shashank Singh short and ended his innings.\n\nIn the end, Royal Challengers Bengaluru won the match by 60 runs against Punjab Kings and Virat Kohli won the player of the match award for his 92-run knock.\n\nSpeaking after winning the Player of the Match award, Virat Kohli explained in detail how he wants to keep improving his game and get better. Virat Kohli said:\n\n\"For me, it's still quality over quantity. For me, it works really well. Also, the understanding of the game allows you to practice less, just try to replicate what I have done in the past. Still aiming to improve aspects of the game that you want to get better at. It's an evolving process. I brought out the slog sweep against the spinners. I didn't practice it, I know I have hit it the past. Always looking to expose that side of the field against spin. I know I need to take risks, it needs a bit of conviction.\"\n\nVirat Kohli further said that he is trying to play with a great strike rate for his team and also spoke about RCB's campaign.

This 58th match of the IPL 2024 season carries immense weight, as the loser will likely be eliminated from playoff contention.\n\nRCB performance has been a tale of two halves. After a sluggish start, their batting unit has recently found its groove. Since a narrow loss to Sunrisers Hyderabad, their top order, consisting of Faf du Plessis, Virat Kohli, Will Jacks, and Rajat Patidar, has provided much-needed stability.\n\nFaf Du Plessis' resurgence has been instrumental, providing quick runs in the powerplay and allowing middle-order batsmen like Will Jacks and Patidar to flourish. This newfound momentum could propel them to victory in this crucial match.\n\nWith a reliable top order, Virat Kohli has been freed to play his natural game. His strike rate has jumped significantly in recent matches, reflecting the greater confidence instilled by a solid batting line-up.\n\nPunjab Kings have displayed a contrasting pattern. While they have performed well away from home, their record at home venues has been disappointing.\n\nThis match, marks their final home game in Dharamshala for IPL 2024, and they will be desperate to turn things around.\n\nWith both teams fighting for survival, a close and exciting match is anticipated.

Buoyed by their newfound momentum, they are determined to extend their winning streak and solidify their position in the tournament.\n\nPunjab Kings, on the other hand, have been characterized by inconsistency throughout the season.

Netizens are criticizing the RCB star for his T20 strike rate and many critics also said that he is playing the game to make a record for himself.\n\nAfter Kohli's knock, Kaif took his 'X' formerly known as twitter to hail Kohli and slam critics, here is the tweet.\n\nKohli hit seven fours and six sixes at a strike-rate of 195.74 in his vintage knock which also took him past the 600-run mark in IPL 2024. He was ably supported by Rajat Patidar, who struck 55, his fourth fifty of the season.\n\nFor PBKS, pacer Harshal Patel took 3-38, taking his IPL 2024 wickets tally to 20, while debutant fast-bowler Vidwath Kaverappa took 2-36, including a terrific Power-play spell, though the hosts were sloppy in their fielding.\n\nKohli could have been out on the third ball of the innings if Ashutosh Sharma had not dropped a difficult catch at point off Kaverappa. Faf du Plessis got going with back-to-back fours through extra-cover off Kaverappa, who had the last laugh by having the RCB skipper hole out to deep point in the third over.\n\nIn the same over of Kaverappa, Kohli got another life on 10 when Rilee Rossouw dropped another difficult catch at extra cover. Kohli and Will Jacks hit three boundaries collectively to take 16 runs off Sam Curran in the fourth over before Kaverappa had the latter sweeping to short fine-leg.\n\nBut Kaverappa had to see a third catch dropped by PBKS off his bowling, as Patidar's chance was shelled by Harshal Patel at deep fine-leg while on zero. Patidar smacked Harshal for three boundaries in a 12-run sixth over, before he and Kohli took a six each in Kaverappa's final over.\n\nPatidar stepped up the attack against spinners by smacking Rahul Chahar for three sixes in his first over and was given another life when Jonny Bairstow was late to react to a catch behind. He would get his fifty in 21 balls when he pulled Sam Curran over a short fine leg for six, before nicking behind to keeper off the left-arm pacer.\n\nFollowing a 33-minute rain and hail interruption, Kohli got his fifty in 32 balls with a vintage flick through mid-wicket for four off Liam Livingstone. He continued to nail authoritative boundaries mixed with nonchalance and vintage stroke-play to the delight of fans chanting 'Kohli, Kohli'.\n\nBut Kohli fell eight runs short of his second century this season when he sliced an Arshdeep Singh delivery to deep third man in the 18th over. Dinesh Karthik hit three quick boundaries before holing out to long-on off Harshal, who castled Mahipal Lomror and had Cameron Green miscuing in the deep on the last ball of the innings.\n\nBrief

I know I can hit it as I've done it in the past,\" he said.\n\n\"I know I need to take risks. Takes more conviction and to remove the thought 'what if I get out?' Means I can improve my strike rate in the middle overs.\"\n\nPunjab skipper Sam Curran said it had been a \"frustrating and disappointing\" end to their campaign.\n\n\"A lot of positive signs but not enough to get over the line and get the wins we needed. Gutted but lots to learn.\"\n\nBengaluru bowler Swapnil Singh, who took two wickets, said the victory meant a lot to the side.\n\n\"Enjoyed it a lot. The ball was swinging initially, so I looked to swing it. Pressure is less when everybody is (scoring) runs. Mentally it relaxes you,\" he said.\n\nRilee Rossouw gave Punjab a promising start, putting on 65 runs for the second wicket with Jonny Bairstow (27).\n\nRossouw, who belted his first half-century of the season, looked set for a bigger score but took a hit on his chin and was out the next ball off Karn Sharma for 61.\n\nHe hit three sixes and nine fours in his 27-ball innings.\n\nAfter Rossouw's dismissal in the ninth over, none of the Punjab batsmen could stand up to the challenge, with the team being bowled out for 181 in 17 overs.\n\nEarlier, Kohli stitched a 76-run partnership with Patidar for the third wicket after Bengaluru were put in to bat.\n\nPatidar looked in fine touch, hitting six sixes and three fours before being caught behind off Curran.\n\nThe leading run-getter of the season, Kohli went on to play some delectable shots including an imperious one-handed six over long off.\n\nKohli also put on 92 runs with Green but fell short of a century after he was caught at deep extra cover off Arshdeep Singh.\n\nHe smashed six sixes and seven fours during his 47-ball 92 at a strike rate of 196.\n\nBengaluru, who registered their fourth win in a row, saw their innings

He lashed out at his critics after scoring a 44-ball 70 against Gujarat in Ahmedabad, taking a swipe at people who make assessments while 'sitting in a box'. In stark contrast to that interview, Kohli was relaxed as he explained why he kept going after the PBKS bowlers in Dharamsala on Thursday.\n\nVirat Kohli hit 6 sixes and 7 boundaries as he was severe against the PBKS's pacers and spinners. He missed out on his 10th T20 hundred by just 8 runs, but the former captain soaked in the applause from the Dharamsala crowd, raising his bat and waving to the fans.\n\nKohli and Rajat Patidar stitched a 76-run stand for the 3rd wicket with the latter getting to his fifty in just 19 balls. However, Rajat was dismissed in the 10th over before rain interrupted play. Kohli took on the onus of scoring big after the resumption of play and continued the charge against PBKS.\n\n\"It was a tricky phase when Rajat got out, we got three down and the rain came in. So we needed a bit of time to settle but once Cameron and I did, I thought 'I have to go again.' The wicket was a bit two-paced, the ones pitching on the grassy ones were skidding on,\" Kohli said.\n\nVirat Kohli's 92 and Rajat Patidar's fifty made sure RCB posted an above-par total of 241 in 20 overs -- the highest total in the history of IPL at the HPCA Stadium in Dharamsala.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himachal_Pradesh_Cricket_Association_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ahmedabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ahmedabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajat_Patidar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rajat Patidar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By_Type", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By Type", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202405/virat-kohli-093835391-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=hiKThiiKFBa1SLqNuxpXjdyA9XkATku0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548702", "eventUri": "eng-9548702", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

The PBKS pacer bowled a slower delivery outside the off stump and Green slogged it towards the right of Sam Curran who was fielding at long on.\n\nAt first, it looked like the ball would run past Sam Curran and cross the boundary rope. However, the PBKS skipper came up with a stunning effort to not only stop the ball but also catch it even before it could land on the field. He ran across to his right and timed his slide perfectly to complete the catch. Green was out for 46 runs off 27 balls.\n\nTalking about the game, RCB finished their innings on a daunting total of 241 for 7 after being asked to bat first. It is their highest total in IPL away from home. In-form Virat Kohli starred with the bat again, smashing 92 runs off just 47 balls. Rajat Patidar also played a crucial 55-run knock off just 23 balls.\n\n\"Was important for me to keep up the strike rate right through. If you saw Faf and me got done by lack of pace off the pitch. There was a two-paced feel with the new ball. We thought anything over 230 would be a good total here. That was the only mindset,\" said Kohli after the innings.\n\nThe game is a do-or-die clash for both teams. While the winning team will remain in contention for the playoffs, the losing team will become the second team after the Mumbai Indians to be eliminated from IPL 2024. Both the teams have four wins and seven losses from 11 games so far and cannot afford any further slipups.", "source": {"uri": "cricketaddictor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketAddictor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Curran", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sam Curran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harshal_Patel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harshal Patel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowled", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bowled"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himachal_Pradesh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Himachal Pradesh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Himachal Pradesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajat_Patidar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rajat Patidar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rounders", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rounders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By_Type", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By Type", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://static.cricketaddictor.com/images/2024/SamCurrancatchtodismissCameronGreen.webp?q=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548702", "eventUri": "eng-9548702", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 25, "textEnd": 30}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

It is also RCB's fourth-highest overall total in the tournament.\n\nKohli hit seven fours and six sixes at a strike-rate of 195.74 in his vintage knock which also took him past the 600-run mark in IPL 2024. He was ably supported by Rajat Patidar, who struck 55, his fourth fifty of the season.\n\nFor PBKS, pacer Harshal Patel took 3-38, taking his IPL 2024 wickets tally to 20, while debutant fast-bowler Vidwath Kaverappa took 2-36, including a terrific Power-play spell, though the hosts were sloppy in their fielding.\n\nKohli could have been out on the third ball of the innings if Ashutosh Sharma had not dropped a difficult catch at point off Kaverappa. Faf du Plessis got going with back-to-back fours through extra-cover off Kaverappa, who had the last laugh by having the RCB skipper hole out to deep point in the third over.\n\nIn the same over of Kaverappa, Kohli got another life on 10 when Rilee Rossouw dropped another difficult catch at extra cover. Kohli and Will Jacks hit three boundaries collectively to take 16 runs off Sam Curran in the fourth over before Kaverappa had the latter sweeping to short fine-leg.\n\nBut Kaverappa had to see a third catch dropped by PBKS off his bowling, as Patidar's chance was shelled by Harshal Patel at deep fine-leg while on zero. Patidar smacked Harshal for three boundaries in a 12-run sixth over, before he and Kohli took a six each in Kaverappa's final over.\n\nPatidar stepped up the attack against spinners by smacking Rahul Chahar for three sixes in his first over and was given another life when Jonny Bairstow was late to react to a catch behind. He would get his fifty in 21 balls when he pulled Sam Curran over a short fine leg for six, before nicking behind to keeper off the left-arm pacer.\n\nFollowing a 33-minute rain and hail interruption, Kohli got his fifty in 32 balls with a vintage flick through mid-wicket for four off Liam Livingstone. He continued to nail authoritative boundaries mixed with nonchalance and vintage stroke-play to the delight of fans chanting 'Kohli, Kohli'.\n\nBut Kohli fell eight runs short of his second century this season when he sliced an Arshdeep Singh delivery to deep third man in the 18th over. Dinesh Karthik hit three quick boundaries before holing out to long-on off Harshal, who castled Mahipal Lomror and had Cameron Green miscuing in the deep on the last ball of the innings.\n\nBrief scores:\n\nRoyal Challengers Bengaluru 241/7 in 20 overs (Virat Kohli 92, Rajat Patidar 55; Harshal Patel 3-38, Vidwath Kaverappa 2-36) against Punjab Kings", "source": {"uri": "weeklyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Weekly Voice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harshal_Patel", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Harshal Patel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himachal_Pradesh_Cricket_Association_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Jacks", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Will Jacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Curran", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Curran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rilee_Rossouw", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rilee Rossouw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajat_Patidar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rajat Patidar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faf_du_Plessis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Faf du Plessis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arshdeep_Singh_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arshdeep Singh (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahipal_Lomror", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mahipal Lomror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinesh_Karthik", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dinesh Karthik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Chahar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Chahar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonny_Bairstow", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jonny Bairstow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_Livingstone", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liam Livingstone"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By_Type", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By Type", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball/Pickleball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball/Pickleball", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://weeklyvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/202405093158777.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548702", "eventUri": "eng-9548702", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 12, "textEnd": 17}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

Kohli passed a wry smile after stating about the strike rate.\n\n'It Was important for me to keep up the strike rate right through (laughs).\"\n\nConsidering the uproar Virat Kohli's strike rate has garnered over the last few days, and at the time of the ICC T20 World Cup squad announcement, his aforementioned reply may have been a shot at his naysayers.\n\nPunjab Kings gave Virat Kohli an early let-off when he batted on not. Ashutosh Sharma dropped a catch and it turned out to be frustrating for PBKS.\n\nHe further elaborated on his knock stating that his focus was to keep the momentum in possession. He pointed out the key moment when Rajat Patidar got out and the rain interrupted play, he said they had to progress cautiously afterwards and hence took 8-10 deliveries to rebuild.\n\n\"I was just focused on taking the momentum forward. There was a tricky phase when Rajat got out, and there was a break for rain and hail. We had a bit of stop of momentum. Had to rebuild for 8-10 balls. Once the base was set and Cam got a few boundaries away, I thought I had to go again.\"", "source": {"uri": "republicworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Republic World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "republic_world_digital@republicworld.com", "name": "Republic World Digital", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajat_Patidar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rajat Patidar"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 5}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://img.republicworld.com/rimages/untitleddesign-2024-05-09t231354.534-171527710378216_9.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548702", "eventUri": "eng-9548702", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

However, Rajat Patidar emerged as a crucial figure, forming a resilient 76-run partnership with Kohli. This collaboration proved pivotal as it propelled RCB from a precarious position of 43/2 to a more imposing 119/3 within the initial 10 overs of the game.\n\nThe partnership between Kohli and Cameron Green further bolstered RCB's innings, with the pair adding an additional 92 runs to the scoreboard. Their combined efforts culminated in RCB posting a competitive total of 241/7 at the conclusion of their innings, setting the stage for a challenging pursuit for the Punjab Kings.\n\nDespite the early setback of skipper Faf du Plessis's departure, the debutant Vidwath Kaverappa made an immediate impact, claiming two vital wickets at opportune moments. Kaverappa's promising performance, including a delivery that nearly dismissed Kohli early on, highlighted his potential on the grand stage.

The losing team will become the second team after Mumbai Indians to be eliminated from the ongoing edition of the IPL.\n\nBoth the teams have four wins and seven losses from 11 games so far. One of them would finish with a maximum of 14 points if they managed to win all of their remaining three league games. 14 points is the minimum number of points a team needs to stay alive in IPL 2024.\n\nThree teams - Kolkata Knight Riders, Rajasthan Royals, and Sunrisers Hyderabad - already have 14 points. With Delhi Capitals and LSG set to face on May 14, one of them would also get 14 points. So the losing team of the ongoing game between RCB and PBKS will be knocked out as it can finish with a maximum of 12 points.\n\nThere is a possibility that both RCB and PBKS get knocked out of IPL 2024 tonight and the reason is the weather conditions in Dharamsala. RCB's innings was interrupted by rain as well as hail after the tenth over. For a result, both teams need to bat at least five overs.\n\nIn case, the game is abandoned due to rain, both teams will be knocked out since they can finish with a maximum of 13 points even if they win their remaining two league games. Fortunately, the game has restarted and both the teams will be hoping that rain stays away for the time being.\n\nBefore the rain interruption, RCB were on 119 for 3 in ten overs after being asked to bat first. They lost the wickets of Faf du Plessis and Will Jacks inside the powerplay before Virat Kohli and Rajat Patidar steadied the ship with a 76-run stand.

The former Sunrisers Hyderabad and Delhi Capitals missed a month of IPL cricket in the 2024 season due to a shoulder injury. With Dhawan missing seven games of the new season, Curran has regularly led the Punjab Kings franchise in the league stage.\n\nDhawan recorded his last appearance for Punjab Kings in match No.23 of the IPL 2024 against his former side - Sunrisers Hyderabad. The Indian southpaw played a forgetful knock of 14 off 16 balls in SRH's thrilling two-run win over PBKS at the Maharaja Yadavindra Singh International Cricket Stadium. Dhawan can make a return to the PBKS side in the remaining two games of the Punjab Kings franchise. With eight points in 11 games, the Dhawan-less PBKS side has failed to emerge as contenders for the playoff stage of the cash-rich league. Should PBKS retain Dhawan as captain for IPL 2024?\n\nALSO READ: 'Rohit Sharma said himself...': Wasim Akram pins blame on Hardik Pandya after MI exit from IPL 2024 playoff race\n\nAccording to the HT Poll, fans have voted in favour of all-rounder Curran leading the Punjab-based franchise for the 2025 season of the cash-rich league. All-rounder Curran has scored 185 runs in 11 games for the Punjab Kings. The stand-in skipper has picked up 13 wickets for PBKS this season. Retained for the IPL 2024, Curran was signed by PBKS for a whopping sum of INR 18.50 crore at the IPL 2023 auction. Curran was also named the Player of the Tournament at the 2022 ICC Men's T20 World Cup hosted by Australia.\n\nSpeaking at the coin toss, Punjab Kings stand-in skipper Curran confirmed that the hosts are without strike pacer Kagiso Rabada against RCB at Dharamsala. Rabada made way for England's Liam Livingstone in the PBKS XI for matchday 58 of the IPL 2024. \"Going to bowl. Looks like they've watered the wicket a bit, might be something early on. Looking to put RCB under pressure early. With the side we've picked today, looking to take wickets with the new ball.

With Brar not in the playing XI, Rahul Chahar is the sole spin bowling option while the pace bowling unit has a new addition in Vidwath Kaverappa.\n\nThe Karnataka pacer has been one of the most consistent names in the domestic circuit and will be hoping to make an instant impression in the IPL as well.

The scenic HPCA Stadium in Dharamsala will provide the stunning backdrop for this eagerly anticipated clash between PBKS and RCB.\n\nPBKS, reeling from a disheartening loss in their last match, are determined to rebound, aiming to recapture their winning form and solidify their standing in the tournament. Conversely, RCB enter the fray brimming with confidence, buoyed by a commanding triumph in their recent outing.\n\nHPCA International Cricket Stadium Pitch Report:\n\nThe HPCA Stadium is renowned for its batter-friendly pitch, featuring a bounce that assists fast bowlers. Historically, it has hosted high-scoring matches, with its elevated position above sea level promising swing for the new ball, favouring pace bowlers who can exploit such conditions. However, spinners often find little assistance here due to minimal turn. Consequently, it is poised to be an ideal batting track, offering occasional bounce and movement for the pacers.\n\nPBKS vs RCB Dream11/ My11Circle Captain and Vice-Captain:\n\nJitesh Sharma, Ashutosh Sharma, Karn Sharma, Dinesh Karthik\n\nPBKS vs RCB Dream11/ My11Circle Team for today's match (May 9, 02:00 PM GMT)\n\nAlso READ: IPL 2024: Playoffs qualification scenario for PBKS after their loss against CSK", "source": {"uri": "crickettimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketTimes.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vishesh_shukla@crickettimes.com", "name": "Vishesh Shukla", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream11", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dream11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himachal_Pradesh_Cricket_Association_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karn_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karn Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinesh_Karthik", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dinesh Karthik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chennai Super Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swing bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jitesh_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jitesh Sharma"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch_and_Putt", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch and Putt", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://crickettimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Dream-11-PBKS-vs-RCB.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548702", "eventUri": "eng-9548702", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2002-05-09", "textStart": 1298, "textEnd": 1307}], "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

AP\n\nPunjab Kings became the second team to get eliminated from the playoffs race in the 2024 Indian Premier League (IPL) following their 60-run defeat at the hands of Royal Challengers Bengaluru in Dharamsala on Thursday.\n\nPowered by Virat Kohli's whirlwind knock of 92 off just 47 deliveries as well as valuable contributions from Rajat Patidar (55) and Cameron Green, RCB posted a humongous score of 241/7 after PBKS skipper Sam Curran opted to field in the second and final match of the season at Dharamsala's HPCA Stadium.\n\nSouth African batter Rilee Rossouw would then lead Punjab's charge during their chase with a knock of 61 off just 27 balls, stitching a 65-run stand for the second wicket with England wicketkeeper-batter Jonny Bairstow (27) that helped them recover from Prabhsimran Singh's (6) early dismissal.\n\nThe Royal Challengers, however, would seize control once Bairstow and Rossouw were back in the hut, the latter getting dismissed by wrist spinner Karn Sharma shortly after guiding his team past the century mark. PBKS's hopes began to gradually fade thereafter with wickets falling at regular intervals, and was virtually over once finisher Shashank Singh was dismissed on 37, with the hosts losing their sixth wicket with 151 on the board.\n\nPBKS were eventually bowled out for 181, with Arshdeep Singh becoming the final batter to depart after getting caught by Karn off Mohammed Siraj's bowling, Siraj finishing with figures of 3/43.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Curran", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sam Curran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shashank_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shashank Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himachal_Pradesh_Cricket_Association_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rilee_Rossouw", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rilee Rossouw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajat_Patidar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rajat Patidar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonny_Bairstow", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jonny Bairstow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Africa national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prabhsimran_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prabhsimran Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arshdeep_Singh_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arshdeep Singh (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karn_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karn Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowled", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowled"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Siraj", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Siraj"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2024/05/Shashank-Singh-dismissed-PBKS-RCB-AP-1200-2024-05-5a92ab451734c77b6bb9cce0894253c3.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548702", "eventUri": "eng-9548702", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

Faf du Plessis and Co. will want to sustain the momentum they have built over the last three matches.\n\nBengaluru have taken six points from their last three fixtures and find themselves seventh in the standings, with four wins from 11 matches. While a playoff berth is likely still going to elude them, they have put up a fight and will want to continue in the same vein over their final league assignments.\n\nRCB have come across a fairly settled combination, and the team management might not be inclined to tinker with it.\n\nRCB's squad for IPL 2024: Faf du Plessis (c), Glenn Maxwell, Virat Kohli, Cameron Green, Rajat Patidar, Anuj Rawat, Dinesh Karthik, Suyash Prabhudessai, Will Jacks, Mahipal Lomror, Karn Sharma, Manoj Bhandage, Mayank Dagar, Akash Deep, Mohammed Siraj, Reece Topley, Himanshu Sharma, Rajan Kumar, Vijaykumar Vyshak, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Tom Curran, Lockie Ferguson, Swapnil Singh, Saurav Chauhan.\n\nOn that note, here's RCB's predicted playing XII (including one impact sub) for Match 58 of IPL 2024 against PBKS.\n\nOpeners: Faf du Plessis (c) and Virat Kohli\n\nRCB's captain had been in some indifferent form for a while, but he truly came into his own in the last game. Faf du Plessis, who has an excellent record against PBKS, will want to keep his good run going.\n\nMeanwhile, Virat Kohli has been impeccably consistent in IPL 2024. Up against Punjab's pace quartet, the veteran batter will be key for the away side.\n\nMiddle Order: Will Jacks, Rajat Patidar, Glenn Maxwell, Cameron Green, and Dinesh Karthik (wk)\n\nRCB are unlikely to make any changes to the middle order, which has worked well over the last few matches.\n\nWill Jacks and Rajat Patidar have mauled anything that has come their way, while Cameron Green's hit-the-deck skills have been useful in the middle overs. Meanwhile, Glenn Maxwell will have an eye on contributing against his former franchise.\n\nIf Bengaluru need an extra batter, they could bring in either Suyash Prabhudessai or Mahipal Lomror. However, that would leave them terribly short in the bowling department, so they are unlikely to adopt that strategy unless they bowl first.\n\nLower Order: Swapnil Singh, Karn Sharma, Vyshak Vijaykumar, Mohammed Siraj, and Yash Dayal\n\nKarn Sharma and Swapnil Singh will be RCB's premier spinners, with Mohammed Siraj leading the pace attack. Vijaykumar Vyshak has been in and out of the side, but he should feature alongside Yash Dayal on Thursday.\n\nRCB's predicted playing XII (inc. impact sub): Faf du Plessis (c), Virat Kohli, Will Jacks, Rajat Patidar, Glenn Maxwell, Cameron Green, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Swapnil Singh, Karn Sharma, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Siraj, Vyshak Vijaykumar.\n\nOther impact sub candidates: Mahipal Lomror, Akash Deep, Suyash Prabhudessai, Himanshu Sharma, Manoj Bhandage.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sai_krishna@sportskeeda.com",

RCB won that game at the Chinnaswamy Stadium, giving their fans hope that this could be the year they changed their poor home form and PBKS looked set to fall flat again.\n\nBut now, the season has gone pretty similarly for both teams. They have struggled immensely in home games and despite finding new heroes, haven't been helped by the poor forms of some of their experienced campaigners. In the second half, both sides have been seen more as \"entertainers\" than competitors for the league.\n\nThat entertainment has brought them to a knockout game. Whoever win the reverse fixture in Dharamshala on Thursday will keep their playoff hope alive (even if barely alive). The loser will be knocked out of the race once and for all.\n\nBelow, we have predicted three bowlers who could be the biggest drivers behind their teams' respective goals by picking up the most wickets:\n\n#3 Harpreet Brar\n\nIn the Chinnaswamy game, when most PBKS bowlers went at an economy rate of 10 or above, Harpreet Brar bowled a four-over spell of 2/13, taking the wickets of Rajat Patidar and Glenn Maxwell in the middle overs. Had Shikhar Dhawan used his quota better, he might have won PBKS that game.\n\nStand-in captain Sam Curran, despite giving Brar just one over against Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in the last match, is unlikely to make that mistake. He'd know that Brar has eight wickets in six games against RCB at an average of 20 - his best against any IPL opponent. Most RCB batters struggle against left-arm spin, including Virat Kohli, who has gotten out to him more than once.\n\nThe Dharamshala wicket offered even more turn than what he got at the Chinnaswamy and that's likely to make his bowling even more effective.\n\n#2 Mohammed Siraj\n\nAfter a lean first half, Mohammed Siraj looks close to his best in IPL 2024. He has three wickets in the last two games and is coming off his best spell of the season against Gujarat Titans where he started by removing both the openers.\n\nThe other game where he took two wickets this season was against PBKS at the Chinnaswamy. Siraj has now found consistency and stopped leaking runs as well.\n\nPBKS' top-order troubles are well-documented. Apart from Prabhsimran Singh, they haven't found anyone to either hold the innings or put pressure on the opposition consistently. Siraj has used that well in the past, taking 10 wickets in nine games, including his IPL-best spell of 4/21 last year.\n\nIf he hits the right areas early, Siraj might produce another breathtaking spell in Dharamshala.\n\n#1 Harshal Patel\n\nThe slower-one PBKS pacer Harshal Patel used to get MS Dhoni out the other night told all you need to know about him. When there's a bit of grip on the surface, he becomes one of the most deceptive fast bowlers in the league. And that grip is available in Dharamshala which got him a spell of 3/24 against CSK.\n\nIn the Chinnaswamy game, he took the important wicket of Virat Kohli. Bowling against his old franchise RCB might bring some extra motivation again. He already has 17 wickets in 11 games at an average of 21.29 (the best since 2021) and is second in the race for the Purple Cap. A few wickets here and he'd be wearing it once again.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rudransh_khurana@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Rudransh Khurana", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harpreet_Brar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harpreet Brar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._Chinnaswamy_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "M.

In the chase, SRH were held to 171-8.\n\nIn their last two IPL 2024 matches, Royal Challengers Bengaluru have registered consecutive wins over Gujarat Titans (GT). They first beat GT by nine wickets at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. Chasing 201, RCB romped home in 16 overs as Will Jacks slammed 100* off 41, while Virat Kohli hit 70* off 44 balls.\n\nBengaluru then got the better of Gujarat by four wickets at the M.Chinnaswamy Stadium as well. Bowling first, RCB knocked over GT for 147 as Mohammed Siraj, Yash Dayal and Vijaykumar Vyshak claimed two scalps each. In the chase, skipper Faf du Plessis led the way with 64 off 23 balls, while Kohli contributed 42 off 27.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "renin_wilben_albert@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Renin Wilben Albert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Capitals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delhi Capitals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Run rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rajasthan Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arun_Jaitley_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arun Jaitley Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tristan_Stubbs", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tristan Stubbs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mukesh_Kumar_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mukesh Kumar (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._Chinnaswamy_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "M.

RCB posted a massive score of 241/7. Virat Kohli led the way with 92. Rajat Patidar smashed 55. In response, PBKS saw Rilee Rossouw show teeth with a fluent fifty. However, RCB picked regular wickets to pick up their 4th successive win.\n\nPBKS paid the price for some ordinary fielding as they dropped several catches. Both Kohli and Patidar were dropped and they went on to smash pivotal half-centuries and shared a telling partnership. Kohli also added quality runs (92) alongside Cameron Green. For Punjab, Harshal Patel claimed a three-fer. In response, PBKS did well in the powerplay but the wicket of Rossouw thereafter hurt them.\n\nPatidar arrived when RCB were 44/2 after 4.4 overs. He was dropped by Harshal Patel off the second ball he faced. Patidar's 23-ball 55 was laced with three fours and six sixes (SR: 239.13). This was Patidar's fourth fifty this season. Notably, it was his 4th successive fifty in away matches this season. Patidar owns 268 runs this season at 26.80 (SR: 183.56).\n\nKohli smashed 92 from 47 balls. As per ESPNcricinfo, Kohli became just the second player in IPL history to smash 1,000-plus runs against Punjab. David Warner holds the record with 1,134 runs from 26 matches at 49.30. Warner owns 13 fifties versus Punjab. Kohli has raced to 1,030 runs from 32 matches at 35.51. He has five fifties and a ton (SR: 133.76).\n\nAs per Cricbuzz, this is only the second instance of Kohli getting dismissed in the 90s in IPL. The first time it happened was a score of 99 versus Delhi Capitals in Delhi (IPL 2013).\n\nPlaying his 249th IPL match, Kohli hit seven fours and six sixes against PBKS (SR: 195.74). He has raced to 7,897 runs at 38.71. His strike rate is 131.63. The 35-year-old clobbered his 55th IPL fifty (100s: 8). He is two shy of 700 fours (698). In the ongoing season, Kohli owns 634 runs from 12 matches at 70.44 (50s: 5, 100s: 1).\n\nKohli is just the second Indian batter with 400-plus T20 sixes. Rohit Sharma has smashed 506 sixes so far in his career. Playing his 388th T20 match (371 innings), Kohli has raced to 401 sixes. MS Dhoni (334 sixes) is the next best among Indian players. Meanwhile, the IPL ace owns 12,628 T20 runs at 42.09. He has hit nine centuries and 96 fifties.\n\nPlaying his 12th match this season, Harshal (3/38) now owns to 20 wickets at 20.00 (ER: 9.75). He is the only bowler to scale 20-plus scalps. Harshal, who clocked 3/38 from his four overs, has displaced Jasprit Bumrah for the IPL 2024 Purple Cap this season. Mumbai Indians pacer Bumrah has 18 scalps from 12 matches at 16.50.\n\nVeteran South African batter Rossouw smashed his 50th half-century in T20 cricket. Notably, Rossouw became the fourth South African batter to accomplish 50 half-centuries in the 20-over format. Only AB de Villiers (69), Faf du Plessis (68), and Quinton de Kock (61) boast more fifties in T20 cricket among Proteas batters. In addition to 50 fifties, Rossouw has six T20 tons.\n\nRossouw hit a 27-ball 61 versus RCB in Dharamsala. He smashed nine fours and three sixes (SR: 225.93). Rossouw has raced to 8,377 runs at 29.70 (SR: 143-plus). Rossouw hit his second fifty in IPL. The first one also came at the same venue last year - 82* for DC vs PBKS. In 20 IPL matches, Rossouw has 402 runs at 22.33.\n\nShashank Singh fought hard for Punjab. He scored 37 from 19 balls. Shashank clobbered four fours and two sixes (SR: 194.74).

Punjab remained eighth with only eight points from 12 games and ended their hopes of advancing in the competition.\n\nIt was RCB's fourth straight win and second consecutive loss for PBKS, as they were all out for 181 runs in 17 overs in chase of 242-run target.\n\nEarlier, Virat Kohli's 47-ball 92 run blitzkrieg and Rajat Patidar's 23-ball 55 lifted RCB to 241/7 as their innings were halted by rain.\n\nRCB's caue was also helped by Punjab's inability to hold on to catches. Both Kohli and Patidar got lives and they made full use of it.\n\nKohli clubbed seven four and six sixes while Patidar thumped three boundaries and six maximums at Dharamsala.\n\nOpener Kohli was

The inning was anchored by a scintillating knock from their former skipper, Virat Kohli, who hammered 92 runs off just 47 deliveries, displaying exceptional batting prowess with seven fours and six sixes. Contributions from Rajat Patidar (55 off 23) and Cameron Green (46 off 27) further bolstered RCB's innings, setting a daunting target for PBKS.\n\nPBKS' bowling attack struggled to contain RCB's aggressive batting lineup, with Harshal Patel being the most successful bowler, claiming three wickets while conceding 38 runs in his spell.\n\nChasing a challenging target of 242 runs, PBKS got off to a shaky start, losing their opener Prabhsimran Singh early for just six runs. Jonny Bairstow provided some resistance with a brisk 27 off 16 balls, but it was Rilee Rossouw who spearheaded the PBKS innings with a blistering 61 off 27 deliveries, including nine fours and three sixes. However, PBKS lost wickets at regular intervals, failing to build substantial partnerships. Eventually, they were bundled out for 181 runs in 17 overs, falling short of the target by 60 runs.\n\nRCB's bowling attack put up a disciplined performance, with Mohammed Siraj leading the charge, claiming three wickets and restricting PBKS batters from gaining momentum.\n\nAfter the match, PBKS skipper Sam Curran reflected on the season, acknowledging positive signs but expressing disappointment at falling short. Despite believing in their team's strength, they couldn't achieve the desired results. Curran appreciated leading his team and their efforts, regretting missed opportunities for more wins. Despite highs and record run-chases, there's disappointment for fans, but Curran promises to keep fighting, learning, and working hard despite the tough journey of ups and downs.\n\nAlso Check: No doubt post World Cup, Abhishek Sharma will start to make some changes' - Mike Hesson predicts shake-up of India's top order\n\n\" A lot of positive signs throughout the season, but not enough to get over the line unfortunately. We knew that we had the best side for the rest of the tournament and feel gutted for the team. Gotta keep our heads up, keep learning and keep becoming better.

And as the race for the playoffs intensifies, it hopes to ride on the momentum against Punjab Kings to stay in the hunt.\n\nHowever, it won't be an easy task against the unpredictable Kings, who will be playing their last home game at the picturesque HPCA Stadium here on Thursday.\n\nThough both teams have eight points from 11 games, RCB enjoys a better Net Run Rate and can still make it to the playoffs if it wins all its remaining three games. However, it would need quite a bit of luck and some other results going its way.\n\nWhile injuries have been a concern, the Kings have had a dismal outing on home turf, having lost five of its six games and need to get the house in order after an inexplicable batting collapse against Chennai Super Kings in its previous outing.\n\nREAD | Shashank Singh: Feels good when someone refers to me as a find\n\nThe absence of its regular captain Shikhar Dhawan has hurt the home team's batting, whereas RCB comes into the game with a lot of confidence.\n\nVirat Kohli has been a consistent performer at the top while captain Faf du Plessis found his mojo with an aggressive 64 against Gujarat Titans in the previous outing. Will Jacks' match-winning century in the game against the Titans in Ahmedabad and Cameron Green's all-round contribution will also bolster the team's balance.\n\nOn a surface that could offer a bit of help to the seamers early on, the Kings will bank on the pacers - Kagiso Rabada and Arshdeep Singh - to make an impact with the new ball while Harshal Patel and captain Sam Curran would look to ensure runs are not leaked in the middle overs.\n\nHowever, if it hopes to end its home run on a high, the Kings' batting department needs to step up and regroup. While the focus will be on the in-form Shashank Singh, it will be important for the seasoned Jonny Bairstow and Prabhsimran Singh to be more consistent and provide a head start to the innings.\n\nLatest on SportstarPBKS vs RCB, IPL 2024: In-form Royal Challengers Bengaluru faces unpredictable Punjab Kings as playoffs race intensifiesShayan AcharyaSRH vs LSG Live Toss Updates, IPL

Both sides can get to as far as 14 points although they might have to bank on the outcome of some other clashes to mathematically find themselves in the top four.\n\nBut the loser of Thursday's contest will join the Mumbai Indians which can only get to 12 points, leaving their chances hanging on by the barest of threads. By all means, no team can afford a loss even as they head into the contest on the back of contrasting outcomes.\n\nPunjab Kings have recorded four victories from 11 games so far, but have gone down by the closest of margins in most of their seven losses, thanks to their inconsistent top order batting and death over bowling. A few nights ago, the Punjab Kings recorded the highest ever T20 chase against Kolkata Knight Riders at the Eden Gardens and followed it up by a special win against Chennai Super Kings at Chepauk but the defeat to the defending champions in the reverse fixture at Dharamsala has hurt Punjab's hopes\n\nPunjab's batting in IPL 2024 has mainly revolved around the unsung heroes like Shashank Singh and Ashutosh Sharma who had to do the heavy lifting after all the early damage. The duo has certainly impressed, more so Shashank, but during the chase against KKR, it was Jonny Bairstow finding his rhythm back at the right time, when Punjab started to look ominous. However, their impressive batting form was rendered hapless by a smart CSK bowling outfit in Dharamsala, and the home side can't afford another below-par performance against RCB.\n\nThe RCB on the other hand, have also managed to win four matches out of their 11 so far, but three of their wins have been part of a late resurgence from the Faf du Plessis-led side. Down and out after seven losses in their first eight games, the RCB bounced back strongly by recording three consecutive victories that started by upstaging Sunrisers Hyderabad in Hyderabad before completing a double over Gujarat Titans.\n\nFaf had rightly pointed out during one of the recent post-match presentations, that the late resurgence could be due to lack of pressure on the team. With their top order, including Faf and his opening partner Virat Kohli going great guns, and the likes of Will Jacks, Cameron Green and Dinesh Karthik adding meat to their scores, it could be a mouth-watering contest against Punjab's high-flying bowling unit led by Kagiso Rabada, and comprising the likes of Sam Curran, Arshdeep Singh, Harshal Patel and the spin duo of Harpreet Brar and Rahul Chahar.\n\nRCB's bowling, which lacked discipline early on, seems to have worked out their strategies better in the last three games with the likes of Mohammed Siraj, Yash Dayal and Cameron Green finally delivering the goods, making the contest all the more exciting", "source": {"uri": "thestatesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Statesman"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He is such a prolific run-scorer that it becomes news even if he misfires once. And if the format is T20s, then scoring runs doesn't help. The chatter shifts to his strike rate. And rightly so, as the format is such. But should there be talk about a player of Kohli's calibre when he is the running Orange Cap holder of IPL 2024 and striking at 148? That's perhaps what has irked Kohli.\n\nThe Royal Challengers Bengaluru batter once again dropped a remark about his strike rate after smashing a blistering 92 off just 47 balls against Punjab Kings in Dharamsala on Thursday. Kohli's strike rate was 195.74 against PBKS and it never really dropped throughout the innings. The result? RCB posted their highest score of the season and Kohli's strike rate jumped from 148 to 153 this year.\n\nKohli strengthened his hold on the Orange Cap by taking a giant lead over CSK skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad. Kohli now has 634 runs in 13 matches.\n\n\"It was important to keep up my strike-rate through the innings, so I wanted to take on the momentum,\" Kohli said with a wry smile during the mid-innings interview with the broadcasters.\n\nKohli hit seven fours and six sixes. The butterfingered Punjab fielders were guilty of dropping catches as Kohli and Patidar capitalised on the reprieves to put on 72 off 32 balls after they were invited to bat.\n\nKohli, who was dropped on 0 and 10, made PBKS pay as he timed the ball nicely, used his feet and wrists to bring up his sixth IPL fifty this season.\n\n\"It was a tricky phase when Rajat got out, we got three down and the rain came in. So we needed a bit of time to settle but once Cameron hit a few, I thought 'I have to go again',\" Kohli said.\n\nPatidar, who was also given two lives, provided the early momentum as he slammed six maximums and three fours during his 23-ball 55. Kohli and Cameron Green (46 off 27 balls) continued the onslaught, adding 92 runs off 46 balls to take RCB across the 200-mark.\n\nGreen hit five fours and a six before being caught in the final ball of the innings as RCB scored 77 in the last five overs.\n\n\"The wicket was a bit two-paced. The ones pitching on the grassy ones were skidding on. Great opportunity for our bowlers to make the early inroads. (Good total batting first today) We weren't thinking about it. We thought 230+ would be a good total here. Bowlers are confident with recent successes. That was the only mindset. I thought that was a hell of an over from Harshal (Patel), otherwise we'd be 250+,\" Kohli added.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruturaj_Gaikwad", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ruturaj Gaikwad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chennai Super Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caught", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caught"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By_Type", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By Type", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/05/09/1600x900/virat_kohli_1715274073973_1715274074182.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548702", "eventUri": "eng-9548702", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

A video capturing their amusing exchange has begun circulating on social media.\n\nPrior to the RCB vs PBKS match, Kohli experienced a light-hearted moment during the training session at the HPCA Stadium. Following this, the heartwarming exchange between Kohli and the young cricketers gained traction on social media. In the video, Kohli is captured signing autographs and spontaneously interacting with the youngsters. Throughout the encounter, the celebrated Indian cricketer displayed his sense of humour by sharing jokes and conversing effortlessly in Punjabi.\n\nIn the current IPL season, Kohli has emerged as one of the top performers, leading the charts as the highest run-scorer with 542 runs in 11 matches. The 35-year-old cricketer has registered one century and four half-centuries, maintaining an outstanding average of 67.75.\n\nAfter his exceptional performances this year, Kohli earned a spot in India's 15-member squad for the T20 World Cup 2024.

He is the highest run-scorer in IPL of all time.\n\nAlso, this is the fifth 200-plus total posted by RCB this season, the most in any season, surpassing the total of four such totals back in 2016, when they reached finals. Coming to the game, PBKS opted to field first after winning the toss. After the dismissal of skipper Faf Du Plessis (9) and Will Jacks (12) early, Virat (92 in 47 balls, with seven fours and six sixes) and Rajat Patidar (55 in 23 balls, with three fours and six sixes) steadied the RCB's ship with a 76-run stand, keeping the strike rate high. Then, a fine knock by Cameron Green (46 in 27 balls, with five fours and a six) and his 92-run stand with Virat powered RCB to 241/7 in their 20 overs.\n\nHarshal Patel (3/38) was the pick of the bowlers for PBKS. Vidwath Kaverappa (2/36) also did fine on his debut.

The RCB batsman, however, failed to make a good connection although it still looked like he would be safe. However, Harshal Patel dived to his left to take a brilliant catch and sent back the hard-hitting batsman.\n\nTalking about the game, RCB were on 84 for 2 in the seventh over at the time of writing this report. Virat Kohli and Rajat Patidar were batting in the middle for the Bengaluru-based outfit. Asked to bat first, RCB were off to a poor start as Vidhwath Kaverappa dismissed their captain Faf du Plessis (9), and Jacks cheaply inside the powerplay.\n\nHowever, Kohli and Patidar have steadied the ship for the visitors in Dharamsala. RCB will be hoping that the duo make the most of their start and guide them to a winning total.

However, the match has already garnered significant attention due to the absence of two cricketing superstars, Glenn Maxwell and Kagiso Rabada, from their respective teams.\n\nThe Royal Challengers Bangalore have made a surprising decision to leave out their veteran all-rounder, Glenn Maxwell, for this crucial encounter. Known for his explosive batting and crafty off-spin, Maxwell has been a pivotal figure for RCB in recent seasons, often single-handedly turning matches with his blistering knocks and crucial breakthroughs with the ball.\n\nWhile the exact reasons behind Maxwell's omission remain undisclosed, speculation suggests that the team management might have opted for a more balanced bowling attack, sacrificing the Australian's all-round abilities to accommodate the express pace of Lockie Ferguson.\n\nOn the other hand, the Punjab Kings have been dealt a significant blow with the unavailability of their premier fast bowler, Kagiso Rabada. The South African spearhead has been a standout performer for Punjab, consistently delivering match-winning spells with his lethal pace and impeccable control. Rabada's absence will undoubtedly impact Punjab's bowling strategy, as they will sorely miss his ability to make early inroads and stem the flow of runs in the death overs. The team has drafted in the hard-hitting Liam Livingstone to bolster their batting firepower, but the lack of a world-class fast bowler could prove costly against RCB's formidable batting lineup.\n\nBoth teams have endured contrasting fortunes in the IPL 2024 thus far, with RCB finding their groove under the astute leadership of Faf du Plessis, while Punjab Kings have struggled to maintain consistency, currently languishing in the lower echelons of the points table.\n\nDu Plessis, the wily South African, has marshaled his troops effectively, extracting the best from his star-studded batting lineup while ensuring a balanced bowling attack. On the other hand, Sam Curran, the young English all-rounder leading Punjab Kings, has faced the arduous task of managing a star-studded yet underperforming unit.\n\nAs the teams gear up for this high-octane clash, several individual battles promise to shape the narrative of the match. Virat Kohli's quest for a blistering innings against his former franchise, Faf du Plessis' calming presence at the crease, and the exploits of the emerging talents like Will Jacks and Cameron Green for RCB will be closely watched. Meanwhile, the Punjab Kings will heavily rely on the swashbuckling performances of Jonny Bairstow, Liam Livingstone, and the ever-reliable Arshdeep Singh to counter RCB's might. The match promises to be a captivating affair, with momentum shifts, game-defining moments, and the roar of the passionate Bengaluru crowd adding to the electric atmosphere.", "source": {"uri": "zeenews.india.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zee News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Maxwell", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Glenn Maxwell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kagiso_Rabada", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kagiso Rabada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._Chinnaswamy_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "M.

In 32 matches against the franchise, Virat has scored 1,030 runs at an average of 35.51 and a strike rate of 133.76, with a century and five fifties.

He is the highest run-scorer in IPL of all time.\n\nAlso, this is the fifth 200-plus total posted by RCB this season, the most in any season, surpassing the total of four such totals back in 2016, when they reached finals.\n\nComing to the game, PBKS opted to field first after winning the toss. After the dismissal of skipper Faf Du Plessis (9) and Will Jacks (12) early, Virat (92 in 47 balls, with seven fours and six sixes) and Rajat Patidar (55 in 23 balls, with three fours and six sixes) steadied the RCB's ship with a 76-run stand, keeping the strike rate high. Then, a fine knock by Cameron Green (46 in 27 balls, with five fours and a six) and his 92-run stand with Virat powered RCB to 241/7 in their 20 overs.\n\nHarshal Patel (3/38) was the pick of the bowlers for PBKS.

His runs came at a strike rate of 195.74.\n\nIn the ongoing season, Virat holds the Orange Cap for the most runs, with 634 runs in 12 matches at an average of 70.44 and a strike rate of 153.51. He has scored a century and five fifties and his best score is 113*.\n\nVirat has four seasons with 600 or more runs in the IPL, tied with Lucknow Super Giants skipper KL Rahul.\n\nThe previous 600-plus runs seasons for Virat came in: 2023 (639 runs in 14 matches at an average of 53.25, with two centuries and six fifties), 2016 (973 runs in 16 matches at an average of 81.08, with four centuries and seven fifties) and 2013 (634 runs in 16 matches at an average of 45.29, with six fifties).\n\nOther than Virat, West Indies legend Chris Gayle and Australian opener David Warner have three seasons each of 600-plus runs while Virat's skipper in RCB, Faf Du Plessis has two such seasons.\n\nAlso, Virat completed his 1,000 runs against Punjab Kings, continuing his good run against the franchise. In 32 matches against the franchise, Virat has scored 1,030 runs at an average of 35.51 and a strike rate of 133.76, with a century and five fifties. His best score is 113.\n\nThe star batter also has 1,000 runs against Delhi Capitals (DC) and Chennai Super Kings (CSK), making him the first player in IPL to have 1,000 runs or more against three different opponents.\n\nIn 249 IPL matches, Virat has scored 7,897 runs at an average of 38.71 and a strike rate of 131.63, with eight centuries and 55 fifties. His best score is 113*. He is the highest run-scorer in IPL of all time.\n\nAlso, this is the fifth 200-plus total posted by RCB this season, the most in any season, surpassing the total of four such totals back in 2016, when they reached finals.\n\nComing to the game, PBKS opted to field first after winning the toss. After the dismissal of skipper Faf Du Plessis (9) and Will Jacks (12) early, Virat (92 in 47 balls, with seven fours and six sixes) and Rajat Patidar (55 in 23 balls, with three fours and six sixes) steadied the RCB's ship with a 76-run stand, keeping the strike rate high. Then, a fine knock by Cameron Green (46 in 27 balls, with five fours and a six) and his 92-run stand with Virat powered RCB to 241/7 in their 20 overs.\n\nHarshal Patel (3/38) was the pick of the bowlers for PBKS. Vidwath Kaverappa (2/36) also did fine on his debut.

His knock consisted of seven four and six sixes. The Dharamsala crowd was eagerly anticipating to see legendary batter to score his second century of the season.\n\nHowever, Virat Kohli was caught out by Rilee Rossouw off Arshdeep Singh's delivery when he attempted for a six towards deep extra cover. While walking back to the pavilion, Kohli received a standing ovation from the Dharamsala crowd for his spectacular innings.\n\nNetizens were full of high praise for Virat Kohli's incredible innings. Taking to their social media handles, especially X (formerly Twitter), fans lauded the RCB talismanic batter with admiration and reverence for his splendid knock. Many hailed Kohli for playing a selfless innings as he didn't bother about his century when he required just 8 runs to complete the milestone, while others said that the batter proved the critics wrong who questioned his strike rate.\n\nHere's how netizens reacted to Virat Kohli's incredible innings.\n\nFor unversed, Virat Kohli has often come under the scrutiny of experts and commentators for his slow paced knock and strike rate. Some commentators believe that Kohli's strike rate compromises the team's scoring momentum, especially in the middle overs.\n\nWhen Virat Kohli was asked by Harsha Bhogle about his strike rate after the match-winning knock of 70 off 44 balls against Gujarat Titans in Ahmedabad, the RCB batter stated that people are not qualified enough to sit and talk about his strike rate if they haven't been in that situation themselves.", "source": {"uri": "freepressjournal.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Free Press Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himachal_Pradesh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Himachal Pradesh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Himachal Pradesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arshdeep_Singh_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arshdeep Singh (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rilee_Rossouw", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rilee Rossouw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat_Titans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gujarat Titans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harsha_Bhogle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harsha Bhogle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ahmedabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ahmedabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2024-05/32db393c-5584-4733-a020-4a24155a89af/Virat_Kohli_IPL_2024_OC.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548702", "eventUri": "eng-9548702", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 390, "textEnd": 395}], "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

The Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) hammered them by 60 runs in Dharamsala. While the Punjab batters did their best, the 242-run target proved to be a bit too much for the hosts.\n\nAt the post-match presentation, Curran took pride in the Punjab Kings chasing down the highest-ever score in IPL history earlier this season. He elaborated:\n\n\"We had some highs, and some record run-chases as well. Lots of disappointment and apologize to the fans, we will keep fighting. The ups and downs have been quite tough, but you gotta keep learning and keep working hard.\"\n\nThe home side were poor on the field in Dharamsala, dropping a couple of catches of Virat Kohli, who went on to make 92. Kohli headlined RCB's batting as they piled on 241 in 20 overs.\n\n\"Really enjoyed leading a great bunch of guys\" - Sam Curran\n\nThe Surrey all-rounder further underlined the need to keep learning and come back harder next year and added:\n\n\"A lot of positive signs throughout the season, but not enough to get over the line unfortunately. We knew that we had the best side for the rest of the tournament and feel gutted for the team. Gotta keep our heads up, keep learning and keep becoming better.

Of the 17 balls bowled by Brar to Maxwell, 10 have been dot.\n\nArshdeep Singh would aim to stop veteran Faf du Plessis at the start.

Kohli's exceptional innings, embellished with a breathtaking display of skill and precision, exerted immense pressure on the PBKS team, exposing their vulnerabilities on the field. His sublime knock of 92 runs off just 47 deliveries, showcased at the magnificent setting of Dharamsala, was a testament to his unrivaled talent and unwavering determination.\n\nKohli's innings, however, didn't commence on the most auspicious note, as he encountered early challenges against the PBKS. Twice within the early stages of his innings, Kohli found himself offered lifelines by the opposition. The first reprieve came when Ashutosh Sharma failed to grasp a catch after Kohli skied a delivery from debutant Vidhwath Kaverappa. Shortly after, Kohli survived another scare as Rilee Rossouw nearly pulled off a spectacular catch off Kaverappa's bowling.\n\nFollowing his initial setbacks, Kohli swiftly shifted gears, capitalizing on the powerplay by unleashing an onslaught against PBKS' bowling attack. His assault began with a boundary off Sam Curran's bowling in the fourth over, signaling his intent to seize control of the proceedings. Despite losing partners such as Faf du Plessis and Will Jacks, Kohli persevered until he found an ideal ally in Rajat Patidar. Patidar, despite surviving an early catch scare, complemented Kohli's aggression with his own devastating stroke play, propelling the RCB's score past the 100 runs mark within nine overs. Patidar's blistering fifty off just 21 balls further bolstered the team's total before his departure, leaving a significant impact on the match.\n\nAs the partnership flourished, Kohli's momentum encountered a temporary disruption due to rain and hailstorms, halting the game after the completion of ten overs with the score standing at 119/3. Resuming play alongside Cameron Green, Kohli gradually regained his rhythm, punctuating his innings with two consecutive boundaries against Liam Livingstone. The Indian stalwart then unleashed a flurry of boundaries and sixes, captivating the crowd with his exquisite stroke play. His sublime batting display, exemplified by a majestic two sixes off Curran's bowling, reignited the atmosphere in the stadium.\n\nKohli's batting prowess was particularly pronounced on the leg-side, a domain where he exhibited sheer dominance against the bowling onslaught of Curran. Despite Curran's best efforts, Kohli's relentless assault persisted, driving home the advantage with boundaries and sixes that left the bowler reeling. With his sights set on a century, Kohli seemed destined for cricketing immortality as he dispatched deliveries from Arshdeep Singh for a boundary and a six. Nevertheless, fate had other plans, as his innings culminated at 92 runs when Rossouw clung on to a crucial catch, denying Kohli the milestone he so fervently pursued.\n\nNevertheless, Kohli's contribution proved monumental as RCB effortlessly breached the 200 runs mark, propelled by his seven boundaries and six towering sixes. Green's valiant knock of 46 runs further complemented Kohli's heroics, propelling RCB to a competitive score of 241/7 in their allotted 20 overs, thereby fortifying their quest for supremacy in the tournament.\n\nIn addition to his on-field exploits, Kohli etched his name in the annals of IPL history by becoming the first player to amass over 600 runs in this season, amassing a staggering total of 634 runs from his 12 outings. This remarkable feat not only underscored Kohli's unparalleled consistency but also elevated him to a league of his own, as he equaled KL Rahul's record of surpassing the 600 runs mark for the fourth time in IPL history.", "source": {"uri": "crickettimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketTimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka_cricket_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karnataka cricket team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Jacks", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Will Jacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Curran", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Curran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rilee_Rossouw", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rilee Rossouw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajat_Patidar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rajat Patidar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerplay_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Powerplay (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faf_du_Plessis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Faf du Plessis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arshdeep_Singh_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arshdeep Singh (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_Livingstone", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liam Livingstone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kuala Lumpur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kuala Lumpur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://crickettimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Virat-Kohli-2.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548702", "eventUri": "eng-9548702", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 250, "textEnd": 255}], "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1}

Kohli enjoyed a slice of luck and capitalized on the same to the hilt. After a shaky start, where he was dropped on several occasions, he consolidated his game and stayed almost till the very end to guide his team to a challenging score.\n\nInitially, the pitch had something for the bowlers, but after a while -- in particular after the break due to rain -- it eased out. The rain-induced break gave Kohli the required rest and quickly analysed his game. He was a different batter from then and runs flowed from the meat of the blade. When he looked set for a century, Kohli got out to Arshdeep Singh, caught by Rossouw at the sweeper covers. Cameron Green towards the end put the long handle to effective use, making 46 off 27 balls.\n\nEarlier, put in to bat, RCB got off to a disastrous start as they lost skipper Faf du Plessis cheaply. Du Plessis had struck Vidwath Kaverappa for a couple of boundaries . In the very next over, Kaverappa changed lines and was rewarded. He bowled a back of length ball outside the off stump and induced Plessis to play a false stroke. Shashank Singh at deep point lapped up the offering.\n\nEarlier, Kaverappa had a chance to get Kohli out (who was yet to open his account). Kohli looked to whip a full length delivery through the on-side, but it swung away and went high off a thick leading edge. Ashutosh Sharma jogged back from point looking to settle under it, but missed it. Kaverappa was once again unlucky as Kohli was dropped yet again, this time by Rilee Rossouw at short cover.\n\nOnce Kaverappa accounted for Will Jacks, Patidar proved to be a thorn in the flesh of Punjab bowlers. He struck three sixes in a Rahul Chahar over. He too was dropped once and capitalized on it by scoring runs effortlessly of each and every bowler to reach his half century.

It played a lot slower than anyone anticipated as 167 was defended quite easily. There was help for the bowlers, both the seamers and the spinners as the likes of Simarjeet Singh were taking the ball from near the head high of the batters while Ravindra Jadeja and Rahul Chahar got purchase off the wicket. Expect a very similar surface for the RCB game as well, however, there will be one difference between the two games.\n\nThe CSK game was a day game and this one is in the evening and hence a bit more help for the bowlers in the second half and for the batters too as under the lights the ball could skid on and come better on the bat. With the lower temperatures, there is an expectation of dew as well and the captain winning the toss is expected to field first.

Both teams need a win to keep their IPL 2024 playoff hopes alive, and the bowler-friendly HPCA Stadium will play a key role in shaping the game's outcome. Before the PBKS vs RCB clash, let's examine how the pitch conditions might influence the game.\n\nThe hybrid pitch at Dharamshala's HPCA Stadium, located amidst the stunning Himalayan backdrop, posed a lot of uncertainties during the first match of the season when Punjab Kings played Chennai Super Kings. It played slower than expected, with 167 runs proving enough for a successful defence. This pitch is generally known for its pace, bounce, and lateral movement, favouring the fast bowlers.\n\nPacers thrive on this surface, especially during the powerplay, where there's ample movement and bounce. However, spinners find little assistance from the pitch, as there's minimal turn. Consequently, it's a great track for batting, providing occasional bounce and movement to keep things interesting for the bowlers.\n\nGiven these conditions, the team winning the toss typically opts to bowl first and chase the target.

Singh played his first match for RCB against Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in Hyderabad.\n\nPlaying against a dangerous batting lineup, Singh came in to bowl the fifth over, with Aiden Markram and Nitish Kumar Reddy batting in the middle. He got rid of Markram and an in-form Heinrich Klaasen in his first over itself.\n\nIn a chat with IPLT20.com before the match against Punjab Kings, Swapnil said that he had told at home that he would bowl at least six balls this season. However, he ended up bowling a no-ball in his first over, which led to an extra delivery. Interestingly, Swapnil bagged Klaasen's wicket on the seventh ball of that over.\n\n\"I had told at home that if I get to play, I will bowl at least six balls, but in that over, I ended up bowling seven balls. So, I believe it was God's plan. In my mind, I was thinking that I should use my experience and bowl accordingly. I wanted to bowl the delivery which I have practiced,\" Singh said.\n\n\"Klaasen's wicket was a prime example. Before the wicket, he hit me for a six on a ball that dipped. I was thinking that I have already conceded a six, so I should bowl my best ball on the last ball. With God's blessing, I got him out,\" Swapnil Singh added.\n\nSwapnil's double strike helped RCB defend a 207-run target against SRH and win the match by 35 runs. He has been a regular part of the team since then.\n\nRCB have not lost a single match in IPL 2024 where Swapnil Singh has played\n\nRCB had a disappointing first half in IPL 2024 as they lost seven out of their first eight matches. In the ninth game against SRH, Bengaluru handed Swapnil Singh his maiden RCB cap, and the uncapped all-rounder impressed straightaway.\n\nHe then featured in RCB's successive matches against Gujarat Titans, with Bengaluru emerging victorious on both occasions.

Patidar hit a 23-ball 55 before being dismissed by Sam Curran in the 10th over. He went on to add a pivotal 76-run stand alongside Virat Kohli for the third wicket.\n\nPatidar arrived when RCB were 44/2 after 4.4 overs. He was dropped by Harshal Patel off the second ball he faced. Vidhwath Kaverappa was the bowler. This proved to be costly as Patidar smashed Harshal for three fours in the 6th over. Kaverappa was dispatched next for a six before Rahul Chahar was smacked for three maximums. Patidar continued his onslaught against Punjab thereafter.\n\nPatidar got to his fifty from 21 balls with a six hit against Curran. However, the Englishman got his reward after bowling a delivery full and wide which made Patidar reach out on the drive as an edge was derived.\n\nPatidar's 23-ball 55 was laced with three fours and six sixes (SR: 239.13). This was Patidar's fourth fifty this season. Notably, it was his 4th successive fifty in away matches this season.

The result kept RCB's hopes of making the IPL 2024 playoffs alive, if only just, but knocked PBKS out of contention.\n\nRCB batted first and blasted their way to 241 for 7, with Rajat Patidar crashing 55 off 23, and Cameron Green hitting 46 off 27. Both had productive partnerships with Kohli, worth 76 off 32 and 92 off 46 respectively.\n\nIn response, PBKS started strong, but RCB's spinners - Karn Sharma and Swapnil Singh - were effective through the early middle overs, dismissing Rilee Rossouw in the ninth, Jitesh Sharma in the 11th, and Liam Livingstone in the 12th.\n\nWith the required rate now high above the run rate, it was curtains for PBKS. They ended 181 all out after 17 overs.\n\nKohli anyway started the match as the IPL's highest run-scorer. But having been reprieved on zero, he went on to play one of his best innings of a stellar season, finding boundaries through the covers, through midwicket, and down the ground - his footwork often immaculate.\n\nThough he opened the batting, he didn't have a lot of the strike, facing only 14 balls in the powerplay. But before long he was striking at well over 150, as he found capable partners in Patidar (who was the more aggressive partner in their stand), and then Green.\n\nIt was a vintage Kohli innings, full of powerful wristy flicks and hard running, though towards the end he also got his six-hitting game going, finishing with six maximums overall.\n\nHe seemed poised to make his second triple-figure score of the season, but sliced a wide Arshdeep Singh delivery and was caught at deep cover in the 18th over.\n\nKohli's wild gesticulations, it turns out, are not the only expenditure of his energy on the field.\n\nFourth ball of the 14th over into the PBKS innings, they needed 92 runs off 39 balls, and as long as Shashank was at the crease, they had an outside chance. But that's when Sam Curran dropped one towards midwicket and called for two, and that was when Kohli took off from deep midwicket, speeding towards the ball, swooping on it, and skidding it mid-dive towards the one wicket he had to aim at, and found his target.\n\nShashank was not as committed to the run as Kohli was to this piece of fielding, and Shashank was centimetres short of his ground, not having put in a dive. He was out for 39 off 19 balls, leaving PBKS 151 for 6. They would end up losing their last five wickets for 30 runs.\n\nBefore that Kohli run out, however, legspinner Karn and left-arm spinner Swapnil had made vital strikes as well. Swapnil removed Prabhsimran Singh in the first over of the innings, before coming back in the middle overs to get Liam Livingstone tamely offer a leading edge into the covers.\n\nKarn took two big wickets too. He first had the opposition's best batter Rossouw caught at long-on in the ninth over, and then bowled a big, juicy legbreak that clattered into Jitesh's stumps in the 11th over.\n\nAlthough they would fall well short, PBKS did look capable of chasing down 242 at the start. They made 75 in the powerplay, thanks largely to Rossouw, who had clobbered seven fours and a six while the fielding restrictions were in place.\n\nRossouw continued to blast RCB's seam bowlers in particular, motoring his way to a 21-ball half-century, before Karn eventually got him. Jonny Bairstow's 27 off 16, and Shashank's knock were the other serious contributors.", "source": {"uri": "espn.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

They comprehensively best the Punjab Kings (PBKS) with a huge margin of 60 runs.\n\nIt was a complete team effort as RCB batters joined together to accumulate 241 runs in their first innings. While Rilee Rossouw looked threatening in the run-chase, it was uncomplicated for RCB, who kept dishing out brilliant deliveries to bundle PBKS out for 181.\n\nVirat Kohli (9.5/10): A record-breaking knock by the modern-day master as he agonizingly missed his ninth IPL hundred by just eight runs. The RCB talisman played with superb intent and struck at a fantastic rate of 195. Kohli even pulled off a stunning run-out in the second innings.\n\nFaf du Plessis (6.5/10): The intent was there for RCB skipper as well but failed to go past 9-run mark. However, he plucked a superb flying catch to dismiss Jonny Bairstow.\n\nWill Jacks (6/10): The Englishman smashed one four and a six in the 7 balls he faced but failed to capitalize.\n\nRajat Patidar (8.5/10): The underrated star of the night for certainly Rajat Patidar, who clubbed 55 off a mere 23 balls. He looked in supreme touch as he took apart the PBKS bowlers with ease.\n\nCameron Green (7.5/10): The mighty Australian provided a superb finish down the order as he scored 46 off only 27 deliveries.\n\nDinesh Karthik (8.5/10): The Indian veteran continued his remarkable season with another effective cameo (18 off 7).\n\nMahipal Lomror (2/10): Came to bat in the last over but recorded a two-ball duck.\n\nSwapnil Singh (8/10): Was superb with the ball as he took two wickets in his three overs. Swapnil has been great for RCB.\n\nKarn Sharma (8/10): From one spinner to another, Karn Sharma bagged two big wickets of Rilee Rossouw and Jitesh Sharma.\n\nMohd Siraj (7.5/10): Looked wayward with the new ball but showed great courage to come at death and took three wickets in total.\n\nLockie Ferguson 8/10): The Kiwi speedster looked in great touch. With two wickets to his name, Ferguson even varied his pace quite brilliantly.\n\nJonny Bairstow (6.5/10): Bairstow would've kicked himself for not converting the start he got vs RCB. He was deceived by a slower one from Ferguson.\n\nRilee Rossouw (8/10): The left-hander was undoubtedly PBKS' best batsman on the night, striking 61 off a mere 27 deliveries. He needed support from the other end but was eventually dismissed by Karn Sharma.\n\nShashank Singh (7/10): Shashank batted slightly higher and looked superb for his 37. He, however, was involved in a crash against Faf before getting run-out with a superb fielding effort by Virat Kohli.\n\nJitesh Sharma (2/10): Dropped to the substitutes, the Indian international once again failed. He got only five runs before getting castled.\n\nLiam Livingstone (1/10): Brought in the team in place of Kagiso Rabada, the Englishman failed miserably.\n\nSam Curran (3/10): Giving the penultimate over to spinner Rahul Chahar, Curran's tactics were a little off vs RCB. He even failed to contribute with either bat or bowl, recording 1/50 and 22, respectively.\n\nAshutosh Sharma (3/10): Ashutosh would be the individual to bore the brunt from Kohli's heroics the most. It was him who dropped the RCB legend when he was at zero. The India uncapped failed to do something with his batting as well.\n\nHarshal Patel (8/10): Bowled a dream last over, where he bagged three wickets and leaked only three runs. The wily pacer has now attained the Purple Cap as well.\n\nRahul Chahar (3/10): Chahar was understandably hit on a batting-friendly track. He leaked 47 runs in his three overs and lacked any sort of penetration.\n\nVidhwath Kaverappa (8/10): His debut IPL game could have been a something else if Ashutosh would have grabbed the chance of Virat Kohli. Regardless, Kaverappa looked mightily impressive as he bowled a tightly spell.", "source": {"uri": "insidesport.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inside Sport India"}, "authors": [{"uri":

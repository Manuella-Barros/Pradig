She performs two flips and three twists while soaring in the air -- one of her most impressive tricks. NBC's official Olympics account posted a video of Biles' floor routine on X, which caught Swift's attention.\n\nWhile Swift is currently in Dublin, Ireland performing her sold-out \"Eras\" tour, she posted a message under the video.\n\n\"Watched this so many times and still unready.

Biles also retweeted Swift's response, because the best recognizes the best.\n\nOn Friday, Biles kicked off her near-perfect floor routine with Swift's hit 2017 song from her album Reputation.

My anxiety kicks in.\"\n\nThe media attention arguably hit a fever pitch for the athlete after she withdrew from the Tokyo Olympics -- a decision that ultimately highlighted the importance of prioritizing one's mental health.\n\nIn the same interview, Biles discussed life as the wife of NFL player Jonathan Owens, and the increased media attention at pro football games last year after Swift started dating Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce.\n\nLast year, Biles' husband and Kelce competed against one another in a matchup that brought both Biles and Swift to the stands.\n\n\"It's a little bit weird because I'm like, This is definitely not my gig,\" Biles said in response to the fan frenzy over her and Swift in attendance, and even seeing posters featuring her face. \"But I know how excited [the fans] are.\"\n\nBiles went on to say that there \"was no selfie\" taken of Biles and Swift before, during or after the game, adding that the two were sitting in different sections \"and I'm not sure they were exactly happy that the Packers were beating them.\"", "source": {"uri": "marieclaire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Marie Claire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "danielle_campoamor@marieclaire.com", "name": "Danielle Campoamor", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Olympic_broadcasts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC Olympic broadcasts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanity_Fair_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vanity Fair (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Selfie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anxiety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t9Vaxxpn5PY6bdfW29mEwX-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9694178", "eventUri": "eng-9694178", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-29", "textStart": 84, "textEnd": 91}], "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

Biles, ever the show-woman, enchanted the Target Center faithful with flips, spins, and a triple-double pass, for good measure. Notably, she did all of that while being soundtracked by a mash-up of Swift's \"Ready for It?\" and Travis Scott and Beyonce's \"Delresto (Echoes).\"\n\nIt took the gymnastics world by storm, drawing raucous applause from those who filled up the concourses. Biles earned quite the reward for her showcase, receiving a 14.850 score, by far the best of the night.\n\nMORE: Tracking live scores, standings at 2024 U.S. Olympic gymnastics trials\n\nIf that wasn't enough, she garnered praise from an unlikely source: Swift herself, who responded to a clip of Biles' excellence with a pleasant message on X, the website formerly known as Twitter.\n\nShe wasn't the only one impressed with Biles' exploits. Former Olympic gold medalist Dominique Moceanu was also taken aback with Biles' showcase, a feeling she expressed on X.\n\nThis isn't the first time Swift and Biles have crossed paths. The two have a kindred relationship, fortified by the spotlights both have lived under. It was Swift who provided a monologue for Biles during the 2021 Olympics amid her mental health struggles.\n\n\"Throughout the last week, her voice has been as significant as her talents. Her honesty as beautiful as the perfection that had long been her signature,\" Swift said. \"But don't you see? It still is. She's perfectly human, and that's what makes it so easy to call her a hero. Simone Biles, back on the beam in Tokyo.\"\n\nThe gesture that drew tears from both Swift and Biles\n\nThe duo also appeared at the Chiefs-Packers game at Lambeau Field last December, each supporting their respective beaus -- Swift was there for Kansas City star Travis Kelce, while Biles watched for then-Green Bay safety Jonathan Owens. Despite their collective fame, the pairing did not touch base during the matchup.\n\nMORE: USA Olympic gymnastics qualifying, explained\n\n\"I'm not sure they were exactly happy that the Packers were beating them,\" Biles jokingly said of Swift and her crew in a Vanity Fair article released in January.\n\nBiles unveiled her floor routine ahead of May's Prefontaine Classic.

Popstar Taylor Swift recently championed gymnastics GOAT Simone Biles after her floor routine for the final Olympic trials went viral.\n\nBiles, who has been neck deep in Olympic trials prep stunned the Minneapolis crowd with her finesse and grace. As an all-around category icon, she managed to keep up her poise so well that one couldn't pick out faults from her routine. The worldwide support for the Olympian isn't surprising since this year, it looks like she came to win.\n\nHer floor routine for the Olympic trials finals was special as she performed to a song by Swift, called '...Ready for it?'. With high leaps, twists, and a huge smile on her face, the outcome seemed promising for her.\n\nThe official X account of the NBC Olympics & Paralympics posted Biles' floor routine, referencing the singer's recent hit. Hyping fans up for what was about to come, they offered the rare footage for them to get mesmerized by.\n\nSwift, who seemed overjoyed at the song choice already, was quick to chime in with her support. She revealed how she had been watching the clip constantly, presumably with disbelief surrounding Biles' talent and precision.\n\n\"Watched this so many times and still unready. She's ready for it tho...\"\n\nBiles and Swift go way back, with their friendly camaraderie being quite a popular sight to witness. Even before their glamorous NFL WAG life, courtesy of Biles' husband Jonathan Owens, and Swift's partner, Travis Kelce, the stars had shared some heartwarming moments online.\n\nThe Tokyo Olympics was a poignant moment in the history of gymnastics, where Biles had to part ways after 'Twisties' caused some danger. She still managed to bag the bronze for her balance beam routine, and Swift was in awe of it all.\n\nDuring the NBC broadcast of the competition, the Eras Tour star couldn't help but get emotional about how things had played out. Calling Biles 'a hero', she went on to cheer for her passionately as the gymnast fought her demons. Biles could neither contain her joy nor her tears watching all of this unfold, and the women shared a beautiful moment of support and resilience.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "radha_iyer@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Radha Iyer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cultural icon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Olympic_broadcasts", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC Olympic broadcasts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Eras Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Demon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_beam", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Balance beam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2023/10/818a630b-swift.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9694178", "eventUri": "eng-9694178", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5215686274509803, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

Her floor routine received a 14.850, and she was awarded an overall score of 58.900. Just behind her were teammates Jordan Chiles at 56.400 and Suni Lee with 56.025.\n\nThe floor routine was particularly stunning and celebrated by fans online, especially because it was set to an instrumental version of Taylor Swift's \"...Ready For It?\" off of 2017's Reputation and ended with a clip of \"Delresto (Echoes),\" a song by Travis Scott that featured Beyonc\u00e9.\n\nBiles started using Swift's song at the 2024 Core Hydration Classic in May during her floor routine. NBC reports that Biles was involved in the musical mix. Her routine was choreographed by French dancer Gregory Milan, who has worked with the French national team.\n\n\"Everybody kind of wanted something different -- choreographer, as well as music,\" Biles said of the experience. \"I actually hate learning a new floor routine, that's the worst part for me. So, I just kind of let everybody pick whatever they wanted. Actually, my agent suggested Taylor Swift (and) then I found this Beyonc\u00e9 song that I really liked and we kind of collabed it together. I do love Taylor Swift and I do love Beyonc\u00e9. ...

She's ready for it tho,\" Swift gushed via X on Saturday, June 29, replying to NBC Sports' coverage of the choreography. Swift also added three clapping emojis, as well as ones representing a gold medal, an American flag and a red heart.\n\nThe Swift-inspired routine earned a score of 14.850, helping Biles land at the top of the all-around leaderboard going into the next round of qualifying events.

Kelce has not attended all of his girlfriend's performances as he has a packed schedule of other business commitments and NFL training sessions.\n\n\"They're in an easy era,\" a source exclusively reveals of \"wildly in love\" Swift and Kelce in the latest issue of Us Weekly. \"They have daily FaceTimes when they're apart and send cute texts to each other.\"\n\nBiles also has a supportive significant other with Owens currently joining her in Minneapolis to cheer on her Olympic Trials bid.

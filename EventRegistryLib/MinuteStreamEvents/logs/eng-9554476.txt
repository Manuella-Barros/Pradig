Why he quit dream job in NC to run", "body": "Twelve days before Brad Knott faced Kelly Daughtry in a runoff election, he began receiving congratulatory messages.\n\nThe first came from Daughtry: \"Brad Knott will be the Republican nominee on May 14th. I extend my congratulations to him and wish him well.\"\n\nThen came congratulations from Jason Simmons, chairman of the state Republican Party.\n\nFinally the messages on social media began.\n\nIt's one of those moments that, if this were a television show, you would hear the record scratch, see the video freeze on Knott's face and hear the narrator say, \"Yep, that's me. You may have wondered how I got here.\"\n\nBecause somehow, despite coming in second place in the Republican primary and forcing Daughtry into a runoff election, he is being declared a winner.\n\nBut congratulations are a bit premature.\n\nThough he secured the endorsement of former President Donald Trump, making Daughtry feel as though she has no path forward and is better off quitting her campaign, he isn't officially the winner.\n\nAnd his campaign staff seems painfully aware of that, because they continued to post on social media asking for volunteers to fan out over the 13th Congressional District, knock on doors and ask voters to cast their ballots for him.\n\nDaughtry remains on the ballot. And by the time she left the race, 3,100 votes were cast in the district and voters have continued going to the polls.\n\nSince runoffs tend to bring out the most politically aware electorate, it's anyone's guess who received the first 3,100 votes and who voters are casting ballots for now.\n\nAnd without an official way to leave the race, Daughtry could change her mind and take the win if she collects the most votes. If she chooses to stand by her decision and leave the race, the local GOP gets to choose the nominee, and that doesn't necessarily mean they will choose Knott.\n\nThat means Knott must amass the most votes and has to continue knocking on doors, earning votes and ensuring his constituents understand who he is before the May 14 runoff election.\n\nWho is Brad Knott?\n\nKnott told McClatchy in an interview he was \"way under-qualified\" the first time he prosecuted a case as an assistant U.S. attorney.\n\nHis father, Joe Knott, worked in this role first and his stories inspired Knott to follow in his footsteps. That, along with a childhood of playing cops and robbers with his two brothers, Tom and Tucker, who, along with Knott, make up three-fourths of a set of quadruplets.\n\nIn 2016, Knott jumped at the opportunity to take a temporary position under acting U.S. Attorney John Bruce.\n\nKnott began working on the case of Antonio Kevin McCoy, a drug kingpin who had led one of the largest operations North Carolina had seen in decades.\n\nKnott's work resulted in a life sentence for McKoy.\n\nAnd while he was prosecuting the case, Trump appointed U.S. Attorney Robert Higdon Jr. to oversee the office. Higdon decided based on Knott's work on the McKoy case to give him a full-time position.\n\n\"The greatest thing you could ever do as a lawyer is to get up and say, 'I represent the United States of America,'\" Knott said. \"I'll never forget saying that to the jury, for the first time.\n\n\"It was one of those dream-come-true moments.\"\n\nBut Knott said after President Joe Biden took office, a change in policies and procedures made it harder for him to do his job and worsened morale among law enforcement.\n\nKnott decided to quit his job and run for Congress.\n\nMarch primary\n\nOn Dec. 9, 2023, Knott made it official, filing his candidacy with the board of elections.\n\nThree months later, Knott finished in second place to Daughtry, a Johnston County attorney and the daughter of former state Rep. Leo Daughtry.\n\nBut Daughtry did not capture enough of the vote to stop Knott from requesting a runoff election, which he did almost immediately.\n\nAnd he bolstered his campaign with the Trump endorsement that is coveted by Republican candidates.\n\n\"Brad Knott is a Strong Patriot who is running for Congress in North Carolina's 13th Congressional District against a RINO, Kelly Daughtry, who has given money to Far Left Democrats, pledged to vote for Obama, and is no friend to MAGA,\" Trump posted on Truth Social.\n\nKnott and Daughtry have similar backgrounds, so their campaigns worked to prove who is the most local and most conservative candidate.\n\nKnott's background\n\nKnott considers himself a lifelong Eastern North Carolinian.\n\nHis mother's family, the Tuckers, has deep roots in Raleigh and Wilson. His father's family is from the Wendell, Knightdale and Zebulon areas and into Wake Forest.\n\nHis parents had already had two daughters when they decided to try for a third child. They didn't expect four, which includes the Knott brothers' third sister.\n\nKnott said having quadruplets forced his father to quit his job as an assistant U.S. attorney in order to afford groceries. But throughout Knott's childhood they would hear tales from his career.\n\n\"He would tell us stories,\" Knott said, \"and I was always intrigued by them. Back then, it was bootleggers, marijuana dealers and things like that. Much, much less serious but very dramatic and interesting.\"\n\nKnott said he had an idyllic childhood and enjoyed visiting his grandparents' farms in Wilson and Knightdale. He spent most of his time with his brothers, who, being the same age, played the same sports and had the same hobbies as him.\n\nThose hobbies include fishing and hunting. He considers himself an outdoorsman.\n\nThey attended St. David's School, a private Episcopal school in Raleigh, which has a current price tag of $27,900 per year for 7th-12th grade. After his high school graduation, he attended Baylor University, a private Baptist school in Waco, Texas, and then attended Wake Forest University's School of Law.\n\nDuring law school, he held externships in local district attorney's offices, worked on litigation and participated on the Mock Trial Team.\n\nAfter graduation he worked in a civil practice and did a short stint in former N.C. Gov. Pat McCrory's administration.\n\nBut Knott said from the time he graduated, anytime he saw an opening at the U.S. attorney's office he would send in an application.\n\nKnott takes a chance\n\nThat opportunity finally presented itself in 2016, when Bruce needed someone to fill his temporary opening for an assistant district attorney, while someone else was on a special assignment. He hired Knott.\n\n\"It was a gamble,\" Knott said. \"There was no guarantee I would be hired. But again, that was what I always wanted to do. I wanted to prosecute the biggest cases with the worst people at the highest level.\"\n\nThe excitement Knott felt prosecuting McKoy is still palpable in his voice when he retells the story today.\n\n\"The long and short of it is, I have a drug dealer who was meticulously organized, and candidly, brilliant in his ability to hide and use rural North Carolina to his advantage,\" Knott said. \"You know: finding dirt roads that only had one way in and one way out. Using family who was very loyal to him. Having stash houses spread around at various locations that made it hard to pin down just where the contraband was going. Using people there that were two or three steps removed from himself to commit grievous violence.\"\n\nKnott said McKoy was able to scale this into a multi-million dollar organization.\n\nThe investigation resulted in what Knott estimates to be around 50 people indicted, millions of dollars in forfeitures and thousands of kilograms of various drugs seized.\n\nKnott went from a temporary position to seven years traveling the country working on the prosecution of serious cases.\n\nEnter the Biden administration\n\nBut Knott's said everything changed when Biden took office.\n\n\"It became hard to do the job well,\" Knott said.\n\nFrom policy to procedural changes, Knott said everything was different -- especially when it came to immigration.\n\n\"It's no secret that the Biden administration's policies tie the hands of Border Patrol, not the illegal immigrant,\" Knott said. \"I have U.S. marshals who ... were told you cannot arrest, you can not restrain, all you can do is direct them to these processing centers.\"\n\nKnott said it affected morale, caused attrition and was incredibly punitive.\n\nIt also affected Knott's job.\n\nHe said when people knew they would be going to prison for a long time, they would cooperate, help the prosecutors and tell law enforcement where the drugs were coming from.\n\nBut without strict immigration policies, Knott said, he personally prosecuted people who repeatedly entered the U.S. without permission, committed a crime, got caught, and came right back to do it again. When he asked them why, he said the answer was some form of, \"Why wouldn't I come back?\"\n\nUnder Trump, Knott said when he visited prisons, he would witness immigrants chained, surrounded by guards and in the process of being deported for committing a crime while in the U.S. without permission. Under Biden, he said he watched as that same group of people would be allowed to walk out of prison at the end of their sentence.\n\nHe said more lenient border policies allowed drug prices to decrease and the amount of drugs to increase.\n\n\"What used to be your dimebag dealer now had hundreds of doses for the same price and it was a real problem,\" Knott said. \"Morale was really challenged during that time and the effects were real.\"\n\nKnott added that he is not against immigration.\n\n\"If we need workers, if we need support in certain areas, make the legal pathway clear and enforceable,\" Knott said.\n\nBut when it comes to entering the U.S. illegally, he wants stricter enforcement.\n\n\"You have to strengthen the penalties of the illegal immigrants from coming here to commit crimes,\" Knott said. \"I would advocate for a special class of punishments for people who come here illegally to commit crimes.\"\n\nAnd he added that he is against birthright citizenship, which makes everyone born in the United States a citizen.\n\nRunning for Congress\n\nKnott said those changes weighed into his decision to run for Congress.\n\n\"A few years ago I was content chasing bad guys and locking them up,\" Knott said. \"I was honored to work with law enforcement and I had a stellar record.\"\n\nHe finished out his prosecutorial career with the conviction of Don Eugene Nixon Jr., a 48-year-old Bloods leader on charges of trafficking heroin, fentanyl and cocaine.\n\nA news release about the prosecution said that Nixon operated for more than a decade in Eastern North Carolina and finding witnesses who would cooperate in his prosecution proved difficult due to threats because of Nixon's rank within the Bloods.\n\nAfter Knott ensured Nixon would spend the rest of his life behind bars, he walked away from his dream job to run for Congress.\n\nThe campaign\n\nKnott and Daughtry's campaigns have become messy since the March 5 primary.\n\nIn a campaign field of 14, Daughtry out-raised all of her opponents with more than $4.4 million, though she only had just over $621,000 as of April 24.\n\nKnott raised more than $1.7 million and had less than $94,000 cash on hand at the end of April.\n\nBut Knott's family was also raising money for him through the American Foundations Committee, which raised $1.1 million this cycle but has about $8,400 left. The committee has purchased additional ads to run this week.\n\nAnd both campaigns have not spared each other attacks throughout the last three months.\n\nKnott's been accused of working for Biden and former President Barack Obama. He's quick to point out that when he took on the temporary position in 2016, the Obama appointee had already resigned. Later, Knott stayed on in the U.S. attorney's office under Biden long enough to wrap up his larger cases, or at least get them into a place where he could transition them to another prosecutor.\n\nBut he said it shouldn't matter. He said his job was to prosecute.\n\n\"If I'm a soldier, under Trump and Biden, I'm not Trump's soldier, I'm a soldier of the American people,\" Knott said. \"Same thing with a prosecutor. But the accusation on its face, it doesn't hold water. I had no contact with Barack Obama. I'd never spoken to Barack Obama.\"\n\nHe added that Bruce was hired under former President Ronald Reagan.\n\nKnott also admitted to voting five times using the address he grew up at, instead of the address he moved to, but told WRAL it was a paperwork issue.\n\nKnott has also been accused of being a \"never Trumper,\" despite getting Trump's endorsement. Daughtry's campaign made the accusations after Knott failed to vote during Trump's elections. Knott said he's not sure why he missed those votes, but he assumes something came up at work.\n\n\"One of the two candidates donated to Trump and it wasn't Kelly, it was me,\" Knott said.\n\nHe also attacked Daughtry for donating to Democrats in past election cycles, and for saying she would vote for Obama. Daughtry told The Assembly she voted for former Gov. Mitt Romney over Obama in 2012.\n\nComing to Congress\n\nIf Knott does secure the victory on May 14, he will face off against Frank Pierce, a Democrat, in November.\n\nBut members of the state's General Assembly redrew the district last October in a way that will more than likely give the win to the Republican. Rep.

State lawmakers and right-wing justices are also doing their part. Partisan gerrymandering is crippling representative government. The U.S. Supreme Court could have outlawed it in a 2019 North Carolina case, Rucho v. Common Cause, but declined by a vote of 5-4.\n\nTo see the consequences, consider the mess in North Carolina's 13th Congressional District.\n\nThe district covering southern Wake County, all of Johnston County and parts of Wayne and Harnett counties was drawn by court order after the then-Democratic majority state Supreme Court rejected gerrymandered maps passed by the Republican-controlled General Assembly. As a result, the 13th District in 2022 was compact and politically balanced.\n\nWiley Nickel, then a Democratic state senator, won the district by 3% over Republican Bo Hines, who gained his party's nomination on the strength of Trump's endorsement. But after Republicans took control of the state Supreme Court in 2022, Republican lawmakers were given a green light to gerrymander again.\n\nThree North Carolina Democratic members of Congress decided not to seek reelection after looking at their redrawn districts. One of them was Nickel. The new 13th District district takes in much less of Wake and adds several Republican-leaning counties. In 2020, President Joe Biden was supported by voters in the previous district by 1 percent. Voters in the new version favored Trump by 17 percent.\n\nWith Nickel out and no real chance for a Democrat, 14 candidates piled into this year's District 13 Republican primary. None received the 30 percent necessary to win outright. Kelly Daughtry, a Johnston County lawyer came close with 27%. Brad Knott, a former assistant U.S. attorney from Wake County, took second with 18 percent. Knott requested a runoff.\n\nDaughtry and Knott traded negative ads about who was the real conservative, but when Trump stepped in and endorsed Knott, Daughtry's lead in the polls evaporated. Last week, she suspended her campaign despite having loaned it $4.3 million. She announced her support for Knott.\n\nDaughtry's father, the former longtime Republican state lawmaker Leo Daughtry, said his daughter saw no path to winning after Trump endorsed her opponent. \"That was that,\" he said. He accepted the outcome with resignation. \"In politics,\" he said, \"somebody wins and somebody loses.\"\n\nBut in this race, the real loser was democracy.\n\nIn the 2022 general election, more than 277,000 people voted in the congressional race. Fewer than one-third of that number (83,894) voted in this year's GOP primary. Of that group, only 15,664 voted for Knott.\n\nThose numbers mean that in a district in which more than 270,000 people are likely to vote in November's election, Knott has already won by drawing support from a small fraction of district voters. It also means that in a district of more than 700,000 residents, Knott will effectively represent a constituency of one - Donald Trump.\n\nA once politically balanced district has become a MAGA fiefdom.\n\n\"It's such a shame,\" Nickel told me on Monday, \"because the (race) I won was one in which voters had a choice. The district could have gone either way.\"\n\nNickel, who served the White House national advance staff under President Barack Obama, is a progressive, but the politics of his district made him work in the middle.\n\n\"I learned there are so many people who are not on the far left or far right. They just want someone to make positive change for the district and work across the aisle,\" he said.\n\nThat kind of representation will be ending in District 13.\n\nEven if Daughtry had stayed in the race, it was assured that the district's next representative would be a Trump loyalist. But it's even worse that the outcome was determined by line drawers in the legislature, enablers on the state Supreme Court and a nod from Mar-a-Lago.", "source": {"uri": "charlotteobserver.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Charlotte Observer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ned_barnett@charlotteobserver.com", "name": "Ned Barnett", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gerrymandering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knott_County,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Knott County, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Knott County, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daughtry_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Daughtry (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnston_County,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Johnston County, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Johnston County, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiley_Nickel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wiley Nickel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rucho_v._Common_Cause", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rucho v.

(WGHP) -- North Carolina's second primaries are nearing their end.\n\nIn-person early voting for the second primary election, also known as a runoff, began on April 25 and will end at 3 p.m. on Saturday. Election Day for the 2024 second primary election is Tuesday.\n\nThere are three Republican races and one nonpartisan race still yet to be decided. No other parties will have second primaries in North Carolina.\n\nStatewide\n\nThe Republican primary for lieutenant governor has narrowed down to Hal Weatherman and Jim O'Neill. In the first primary, Weatherman took the lead with 19.62% of the vote, and Forsyth County District Attorney Jim O'Neill lagged a short distance behind by around 34,000 votes, sitting at 15.85%. The winner will go on to face Democrat Rachel Hunt and Libertarian Dee Watson.\n\nFinally, Jim Bailey and Ronnie Worley will be on the ballot competing for the Republican nomination to represent Gaston County Board of Commissioners's South Point Township District.\n\nOrange County\n\nThe sole nonpartisan primary race yet to be decided will be for the third seat on the Orange County Schools Board of Education. Jennifer Moore and Bonnie Hauser were the top two vote-getters.\n\nU.S. House District 6\n\nNorth Carolina's 6th Congressional District was heading for a second primary between former U.S. Rep. Mark Walker (R-Greensboro) and Addison McDowell, a former staffer for Sen. Ted Budd (R-NC) until Walker announced in March that he would be bowing out to accept a role working on former Pres. Donald Trump's campaign.\n\nWalker told FOX8 that the former president offered him the job during a phone conversation at 5 p.m. on March 12, an hour after he publicly accepted an invitation to debate McDowell. In his new role, Walker would serve as the Trump campaign's director of outreach for faith and minority communities.\n\nWalker formerly represented the 6th District but chose not to run for reelection in 2020. He suspended a 2024 campaign for governor and launched a campaign to reclaim the District 6 seat after Republicans released maps that heavily favored Republicans.\n\nMcDowell now goes on to the general election with no other candidates formally on the ballot but not without opposition. Democrat Andy Craighill-Middleton began gathering signatures in early April to become an authorized write-in candidate to challenge McDowell.\n\nU.S. House District 13\n\nTrump once again had a hand in deciding the winner of a runoff when Kelly Daughtry, the top vote-getter in the Republican primary for U.S. House District 13, bowed out of the race and handed the nomination to former president's pick.\n\nDaughtry, who came out on top in the first primary with 27.39% of the vote, handed the victory to Brad Knott, who earned 18.67% of the vote. The race had already entered early voting in a second primary.\n\n\"In light of President Trump's endorsement of Brad Knott for the Congressional seat in District 13, it has become clear that a pathway to victory is no longer feasible,\" Daughtry said. \"I believe in the democratic process and respect the endorsement of our President.\"\n\nIn her concession, Daughtry thanked her supporters and endorsed Knott.\n\n\"I have asked my supporters to formally support Brad's campaign,\" Daughtry said. \"Likewise, I have spoken with Brad and know he will advocate and fight for the entire District. We are all on the same team and I hope that the ending of my campaign at this time will show and foster our unity as a party. The future of our republic is too important to be divided by inter-party politics.\"\n\nDespite ending her race, she says she intends to dedicate her time to \"conservative voter registration operations and supporting the nominated conservative judicial candidates running in November.\"\n\nKnott will now go on to face Democrat Frank Pierce in November's general election.\n\nTo find your district, you can use the North Carolina General Assembly's online map tool.\n\nThe North Carolina State Board of Elections does not allow new voter registrations or party changes for a second primary election. Individuals who become eligible to vote between the primary and second primary and who are otherwise eligible to vote in the second primary may register and vote on the day of the second primary, May 14.\n\nSame-day voter registration will not be available at early voting sites during the early voting period.\n\nUnaffiliated voters should be aware that there are some additional rules when voting in second primaries. In order to vote in a given party's second primary, an unaffiliated voter must have either voted in that party's first primary or not voted in the first primary. In other words, to vote in the Republican second primary, an unaffiliated voter must have either voted in the Republican primary in March or not voted in March. Unaffiliated voters who voted in the Democratic primary or a third-party primary cannot vote in the Republican second primary.\n\nIf you want to vote early, you can go to any One-Stop Voting Site in your county. Find where you can vote early using this One-Stop Voting Sites search tool.\n\nTo find out where to vote on Election Day for the second primary, May 14, you can put your first and last name into the North Carolina Voter Search tool and click on your profile to find your \"Election Day Polling Place.\"\n\nOn May 14, this is the only location where you will be allowed to vote.\n\nThe deadline has now passed to request an absentee ballot for the second primary election. The deadline was May 7.\n\nIf you have an absentee ballot, you must turn it in to your county board of elections by 7:30 p.m. May 14 for your vote to be counted.\n\nIn the past, North Carolina would offer a grace period determined by your ballot's postmark, but that is no longer the case.", "source": {"uri": "myfox8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "myfox8.com"}, "authors": [{"uri":

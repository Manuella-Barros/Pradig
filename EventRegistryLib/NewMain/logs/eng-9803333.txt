I rounded up everyone- my mom, my dad, my brother. It was late at night, I told them 'there is this film I want to do in India.\"\n\nShe added, \"Everyone was like....no one cared.

When I repeated that it is Shah Rukh Khan, she told me that I was lying. 'Shah Rukh Khan is your ...' she said while crying and I told her 'yes'.\"\n\nMahira Khan further talked about how she bagged the role by saying, \"I went to Mumbai for the promotions of Humsafar that they were airing three years later. A few phone calls kept coming and I could not pick. Then I got a message 'big film, pick up.' I thought, I will enjoy this call if nothing else.\"\n\n\"They explained the film to me, but it I could not understand. Then they said it is an Excel production. That rang a bell, they had done some great films such as Dil Chahta Hai. So I said 'okay'. Then I was asked to meet the director the next day. I got up early morning, met them. I was told a bit about the story but Shah Rukh Khan remained a secret. I auditioned for them the next day and later got a call saying 'you have got the part'. I asked them, what part it was and I was told 'you are the lead opposite Shah Rukh Khan,\" she continued.\n\nDirected by Rahul Dholakia, Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub, Narendra Jha, Sheeba Chaddha, Atul Kulkarni, and Jaideep Ahlawat among others were also seen in pivotal roles in Raees.

A true 'people's hero', sophisticated and down to earth, Shah Rukh Khan is a legend of our times.\"\n\nShah Rukh will receive the award on August 10 at the open-air venue Piazza Grande. One of his most iconic films, Devdas, directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali, will also be screened during the festival. Shah Rukh is all set to appear at the Forum @Spazio Cinema for a conversation on August 11.\n\nPrevious recipients of Locarno's Honorary Leopard include Tsai Ming-liang, Francesco Rosi, Claudia Cardinale, Johnnie To, Harry Belafonte, Mario Adorf, Jane Birkin, and Costa-Gavras.\n\nThe award comes on the heels of SRK's highly successful 2023, which saw the release of his three blockbusters Pathaan, Jawan and Dunki, all of which were huge hits.\n\nThe actor will reportedly begin shooting for his upcoming film 'King.' Recently, a video of SRK was widely shared on social media where eagle-eyed fans noticed the film's script lying on the table beside him. Reportedly, the film is also set to star Shah Rukh's daughter and actor, Suhana.\n\nThe video happened to be from a clip of Shah Rukh congratulating cinematographer Santosh Sivan after he received the prestigious Pierre Angenieux Excel Lens Award at this year's Cannes Film Festival. In the aforementioned video, a section of the Internet spotted the script of 'King' on the table next to him.\n\nIt also contained some additional details on its cover, which were not clearly visible in the video.\n\nIf reports are to be believed, 'King' will be directed by Sujoy Ghosh.

He reads a lot. He can talk about any topic and he will have his point of view on that. He is a good listener. He is well read and he is also interested in people. He is curious and adventurous. He likes to have a nice time and he doesn't like the weight of things too much.

While many actors are passionate about their work, Khan's obsessive drive sets him apart, according to Akhtar. He explained, \"There is this inherent charm he has that is magnetic and it is both on and off the screen. He is easy, it doesn't feel laboured and that ease makes you feel comfortable. He works really hard and that has kept him where he is. I have met many people who love what they do. I have worked with Aamir Khan and Priyanka Chopra.

He also talked about Pathaan's stupendous success and that they were together on the opening day of the film, last year.\n\nJohn Abraham was with Shah Rukh Khan when Pathaan was declared a hit on first day; speaks about their camaraderie: \"We got along and that was really special\"\n\nRecalling last year when they got the news that Pathaan was a huge hit on the first day itself, John Abraham said, \"We were together only. We were there, we saw the film and realised that the film has something really good and both looked at each other and we said, 'Damn good, ya!'\"\n\nSpeaking about camaraderie, he added, \"Aditya Chopra is a strict producer. He doesn't show the film to anyone, except Shah Rukh Khan. So whatever information I got for the film was from Shah Rukh Khan. I would ask, 'How's the film?' before the film's release. He would give all the information. He is very sweet.\"\n\nAbraham's candid remarks about Khan highlighted the deep respect and camaraderie shared between the two actors. \"I also think the energy was good in the film. Shah Rukh Khan was a judge [on a show] when my career began and then I was working with him on Pathaan. There was respect, and love. As a person, he is very intelligent and smart. But, he is also very caring. He is a very cute person and we got along and I think that was really special,\" he said.\n\nDirected by Siddharth Anand, Pathaan also starred Deepika Padukone, Dimple Kapadia and Ashutosh Rana. The film was released in 2023 on Republic Day weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, John Abraham is gearing up for his next release Vedaa.

In a candid conversation, Abraham shared how Khan played a pivotal role in his early career, acting as a discerning judge of his work.\n\nIn a recent conversation with Ranveer Allahbadia, the actor said, \"Shah Rukh Khan was the judge at the start of my career.\" Abraham further shed light on how his dynamic with SRK during the release of their film Pathan, SRK gave him insights about the final cut. The actor said, \"Aditya Chopra never shows the film to anyone before the release not even the actors. But only Shah Rukh Khan can see, so, he used to tell me about the movie\"\n\nThe revelation underscores the immense influence Shah Rukh Khan holds in the Indian film industry. Beyond his unparalleled stardom and global fan following, his opinion carries significant weight, even among his contemporaries. It's a testament to the respect and admiration that actors, who are themselves icons, have for the 'King of Romance'.\n\nJohn Abraham's statement about Adi Chopra showing the completed film only to Shah Rukh Khan further cemented this image of Khan as a cinematic barometer. Chopra, a renowned filmmaker and producer, clearly places immense trust in Khan's judgment. It's a privilege accorded to few, highlighting Khan's unique position in the industry.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by John Abraham (@thejohnabraham)\n\nThis anecdote offers a rare glimpse into the inner workings of Bollywood. It humanizes these larger-than-life stars, revealing their professional relationships and mutual admiration.

Just this basic faith that you can tell a story through your persona and touch on the very profound building blocks of emotions.\"\n\nNazzaro, it is fair to say, is a Khan fanboy. Discussing the Bollywood superstar -- winner of Locarno's 2024 lifetime achievement award, the Pardo alla Carriera Ascona-Locarno Tourism -- he compares Khan to the \"popular glamor of a hero of the working class, like Marcello Mastroianni\" combined with the \"elegance, the arrogant elegance, of someone like Alain Delon... In Shah Ruhk Khan, I can see the trajectory from Rudolph Valentino to Tom Cruise, and it's all there in one person. And this guy doesn't even seem to break a sweat when he does it.\"\n\nKhan will be honored with Locarno's lifetime achievement honor on August 10 and will take part in a Q&A session at the festival on Aug. 11.\n\nAs part of its tribute, Locarno will screen Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Devdas, the 2002 drama starring Khan as a wealthy law graduate who returns from London to marry his childhood friend, Parvati (played by Aishwarya Rai). When his family rejects their marriage, however, he descends into alcoholism and seeks refuge with a warm-hearted courtesan, played by Madhuri Dixit.\n\nNazzaro notes Locarno could have picked almost any film from Khan's decades-long career to illustrate his big-screen impact.\n\n\"I've seen some of his films only in India because there are no subtitled versions available, and everyone is perfectly understandable, without the dialog,\" says Nazzaro. \" I mean that you see the trajectory of a hero, [the] basic belief that if you are a working person, if you are a decent person, you can be a hero. He embodies it. He's a devout Muslim, he's never made films that are not consistent with his own beliefs.\"\n\nWhile creating a global career, Nazzaro says, Khan has remained entirely true to himself and the traditions of Indian cinema.\n\n\"In Khan, you have the true unmistakable elements of Indian cinema, the music, the dances, the songs,\" says Nazzaro, \"and then you have this astounding understanding of how all to put these mythological elements of narrative into a modern context, using modern technology to reach an apex of what I would say is an almost pre-modern understanding of the power of cinema...I don't want to wax poetic, but [in Western cinema] we needed modernism to understand our narrative structures. Then we needed to question that, with post-modernism. Now we have post-post-modernism. It seems we cannot regain the last innocence in the pleasure of narration.

If you ask me the takeaway, I learnt how to be a fighter from him. He is a great fighter, a magician at that. He knows how to bounce back, create a path for himself. The equation hasn't changed. A person like Shah Rukh Khan will never change equation based on hits and flops,\" he added.\n\nAnand L Rai's latest production is the Taapsee Pannu-Vikrant Massey starrer Phir Aayi Hasseen Dilruba, currently streaming on Netflix. After Zero, Rai made Akshay Kumar starrer Raksha Bandhan, which was also a flop. Up next, he has teamed up with Dhanush for Tere Ishq Mein. Shah Rukh Khan, meanwhile, will be next seen in The King, co-starring his daughter Suhana Khan.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "entertainment_desk@indianexpress.com", "name": "Entertainment Desk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aanand_L._Rai", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aanand L.

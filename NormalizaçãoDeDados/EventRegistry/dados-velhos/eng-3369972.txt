Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) may not be the best person to convince President Trump about the merits of unequivocally condemning neo-Nazis and white supremacists, given their history and especially when he uses a Trump bobble-head, but he gave it a try anyway on Thursday night. \"The only way to beat the loud and angry voices of hate is to meet them with louder and more reasonable voices,\" he said in a video for ATTN, and that includes Trump, who, \"as president of this great country,\" has \"a moral responsibility to send an unequivocal that you won't stand for hate and racism.\" In case Trump was unsure what such a statement would sound like, Schwarzenegger offered him a Republican-specific template.\n\nMore interesting was his \"blunt\" message to \"the neo-Nazis and to the white supremacists and to the neo-Confederates,\" which began: \"Your heroes are losers. You are supporting a lost cause. Believe me, I knew the original Nazis.\" He explained that he was born in Austria in 1947, right after World War II, and growing up he \"was surrounded by broken men, men who came home from the war filled with shrapnel and guilt, men who were misled by into a losing ideology. And I can tell you that these ghosts that you idolize spent the rest of their lives living in shame. And right now, they're resting in hell.\" He said it isn't too late to change course, and he wasn't buying Trump's \"fine people\" excuse for the Charlottesville marchers.\n\n\"If you say 'Arnold, hey, I was just at the march, don't call me a Nazi, I have nothing to do with Nazis at all,'\" Schwarzenegger said, \"let me help you: Don't hang around people who carry Nazi flags, give Nazi salutes, or shout Nazi slogans. Go home. Or better yet, tell them they are wrong to celebrate an ideology that murdered millions of people. And then go home.\" Schwarzenegger also had some advice for people who are not Nazis or Nazi sympathizers and think it's best to stay quiet or keep their heads down, and he only used one of his famous movie catchphrases.

Schwarzenegger said that as president, Trump had a moral responsibility to do so.\n\nSince Trump did not send an unequivocal anti-racist message, Schwarzenegger offered to write what he thought should have been communicated. \"As president of the United States and as a Republican, I reject the support of white supremacists,\" Schwarzenegger said in the speech he would've liked to have heard. \"The country that defeated Hitler's armies is no place for Nazi flags. The party of Lincoln won't stand with those who carry the battle flag of the failed Confederacy.\"\n\nAfter Schwarzenegger's impassioned delivery, he turned to a Trump bobblehead and said, \"Was that that difficult?\" Then he added, laughing, \"You see, I told you.\"\n\nHe then turned his attention to the hate groups. \"I have a message to the Neo-Nazis, the White Nationalists and the neo-Confederates. Let me be just as blunt as possible: Your heroes are losers. You're supporting a lost cause.\"\n\n\"Believe me, I know the original Nazis. I was born in Austria in 1947, shortly after the Second World War, and growing up I was surrounded by broken men,\" he continued. \"Men who came home from the war filled with shrapnel and guilt, men who were misled into a losing ideology. And I can tell you that these ghosts that you idolize spent the rest of their lives living in shame. And right now, they're resting in hell.\"\n\nAddressing what had transpired over the weekend, Schwarzenegger said that people are not born with hateful views and said he believed that people can evolve and come to the understanding \"that all human beings have equal value.\"\n\n\"You are so lucky to live in a country that gives you every right to say horrible things,\" he added. \"But think about how you could actually use that power for something good.\"\n\nWhile he addressed the hate groups head-on, he also beckoned those who have been silent to stand up against the hatred, adding that racism must be faced directly, though he acknowledged it would take courage to do so. One of the actions Schwarzenegger said he has taken is to donate $100,000 to Simon Wiesenthal Center. \"I hope you will join me by supporting your favorite anti-hate organization,\" he said.\n\n\"Let's all commit right now to leaving the terrible ghosts of the past in the trash heap of history,\" he concluded. \"That's where they belong....Let's terminate hate.\"", "id": "9811742",

There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\n\n-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 17, 2017\n\nThis wasn't the first time Trump had brought up General John Joseph Pershing. During a campaign rally in February 2016, Trump shared a historically dubious tale about how Pershing, in an effort to pacify the Philippines in the years following the Spanish-American War of 1899-1902, slaughtered terrorists using bullets that had been dipped in pig's blood.\n\nHere's what Trump said at that rally in South Carolina:\n\nThey were having terrorism problems, just like we do. And [Pershing] caught 50 terrorists who did tremendous damage and killed many people. And he took the 50 terrorists, and he took 50 men and he dipped 50 bullets in pigs' blood -- you heard that, right? He took 50 bullets, and he dipped them in pigs' blood. And he had his men load his rifles, and he lined up the 50 people, and they shot 49 of those people. And the 50th person, he said: You go back to your people, and you tell them what happened. And for 25 years, there wasn't a problem. Okay? Twenty-five years, there wasn't a problem.\n\nAs ThinkProgress detailed shortly after that rally, the story about Pershing slaughtering Muslims with bullets using pig's blood has its origin in hoax email chains, and the idea that pig's blood is some sort of kryptonite stems from a 1939 film, according to Snopes.\n\nTrump's tweets about the Barcelona attack -- tweets he posted before definitive information about the names of the attackers or their motives has been publicly released -- stands in contrast to the approach he took following a white supremacist attack in Charlottesville, Virginia over the weekend.\n\nOn Saturday, an alleged Nazi sympathizer drove a car into a crowd of people who had gathered to demonstrate against white supremacy, killing one and injuring 19 others. But instead of immediately condemning the attack -- something Trump has regularly done in situations where Muslims are the suspected perpetrators -- the president instead tried to pin blame \"on many sides.\"\n\nDuring a news conference Tuesday, Trump said his \"many sides\" statements was a product of wanting to make sure his statement was correct and supported by the facts.\n\n\"I had to see the facts, unlike a lot of reporters,\" he said, before going on to say that while a Nazi sympathizer may have murdered a woman and injured 19 more, some of the white supremacists who rallied with him \"were very fine people.\"", "id": "9762435", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Trump responds to Barcelona attack by suggesting that mass murder of Muslims would prevent terrorism", "image": "https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/t4.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 648, "freq": 2, "date": "2017-08-17", "amb": false, "textEnd": 663}, {"textStart": 1259, "date": "2016-02-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1272}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Morocco"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "137", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Morocco"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "177", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "151106", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "196726", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "200134", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Blood"}, "id": "302514", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nazism"}, "id": "302813", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "Violence"}, "id": "302966", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence"}, {"label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}, "id": "303057", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Islam"}, "id": "303218", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam"}, {"label": {"eng": "Spanish language"}, "id": "303577", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language"}, {"label": {"eng": "Muslim"}, "id": "303629", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "id": "305969", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Animal slaughter"}, "id": "307482", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_slaughter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pig"}, "id": "314033", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rallying"}, "id": "315718", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rallying"}, {"label": {"eng": "Spanish people"}, "id": "319789", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_people"}, {"label": {"eng": "ThinkProgress"}, "id": "324856", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkProgress"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kryptonite"}, "id": "378361", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kryptonite"}, {"label": {"eng": "Spanish\u2013American War"}, "id": "438243", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish\u2013American_War"}, {"label": {"eng": "John J.

There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\n\n-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 17, 2017\n\nSo, what is Trump going on about? Well, he has referenced the legend of General \"Black Jack\" Pershing before - at a rally in South Carolina last year while Trump was on his campaign trail.\n\nAccording to Trump back then, Pershing had managed to halt Muslim attacks in the Philippines where he was based by shooting Islamic militants with bullets dipped in pig's blood - pork being a taboo in Muslim culture.\n\n\"He caught 50 terrorists who did tremendous damage and killed many people,\" said Trump at the rally. \"They shot 49 of those people. And the 50th person, he said: You go back to your people, and you tell them what happened.\"\n\nTrump claimed \"for 25 years there wasn't a problem\" - a number he has seemingly increased to 35 in his tweet.\n\nTrump's story was widely discredited and debunked, with fact-checking organisation Politifact rating the claims about Pershing as false. However, they note the general did write in a memoir that he saw other commanding officers publicly burying Muslim insurgents in the same grave as a dead pig.\n\n\"It was not pleasant to have to take such measures, but the prospect of going to hell instead of heaven sometimes deterred the would-be assassins,\" wrote Pershing.\n\nRead More\n\nLacking more specifics, it is not certain Trump is referring to the same story he gave in February 2016 in his latest tweet - but the allusion to it in the wake of the fatalities in Spain has drawn severe criticism.\n\nTrump is celebrating torture and mass executions here.

There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!' the president tweeted.\n\nTrump had already issued a more prosaic tweet 45 minutes earlier, writing: 'The United States condemns the terror attack in Barcelona, Spain, and will do whatever is necessary to help. Be tough & strong, we love you!'\n\nBut the reference to Gen. John 'Black Jack' Pershing inserted Trump into the day's most riveting news story in a way his White House could come to regret.\n\nThere was criticism of the president for his use of it, with CNN anchor Jake Tapper calling it a 'lie', something unlikely to improve his network's relations with the White House.\n\nSCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO\n\nPresident Donald Trump, pictured Tuesday during a press conference in New York, tweeted his response to Thursday's Barcelona terror attack by citing a military story that never happened\n\nTrump's tweet about Gen. Pershing refers to a story he told on the campaign trail about deterring Muslim terrorists by capturing them and executing them with bullets dipped in pig's blood\n\nTrump had already tweeted a more ordinary message of support, but his White House may come to regret the follow-up\n\nCriticism: Factchecking group PolitiFact rated Trump at the worst end of its scale of error, CNN ancor Jake Tapper called the tweet a 'lie', while Democratic Congressman Ted Lieu and anti-Trump Republican Bill Kristol were united in attacking the tweet\n\nDen. Jack Pershing was a military governor of a Philippines province but certainly never carried out mass executions designed to scare Muslims about the fate of their souls\n\nTrump's anecdote is a fictional story that he told in South Carolina ahead of the state's Republican presidential primary in February 2016.\n\nThe story centers on Pershing's supposed killing of prisoners during the early 1900s when his army was targeted by an insurgent guerrilla campaign of Muslim 'Juramentados' who targeted Christians with gruesome sword attacks.\n\nPershing was governor of the Philippines' Moro Province at the time.\n\n'They were having terrorism problems, just like we do,' Trump said. 'He caught 50 terrorists that did tremendous damage and killed many people and he took the 50 terrorists and he took 50 men and he dipped 50 bullets in pig's blood.'\n\n'And he had his men load his rifles, and he lined up the 50 people, and they shot 49 of those people, and the 50th person, he said; 'You go back to your people and you tell them what happened'.'\n\n'And for 25 years,' Trump ended, 'there wasn't a problem. For 25 years there wasn't a problem. Okay? Twenty-five years, there wasn't a problem. So we better start getting tough!'\n\nOn Thursday Trump upped Pershing's effectiveness by 10 years, to 35.\n\nProblematically for him, the bullets-in-pigs-blood episode never happened.\n\nTrump told his unbelievable story during the Republican primary season in the early state of South Carolina\n\nIt seems to have had its genesis in a 1927 Chicago Daily Tribune article that described Pershing sprinkling some Muslim prisoners with pig's blood, which the Juramentados believed would condemn their souls.\n\nAfter that, however, he let them go.\n\nThe Tribune article claimed that 'those drops of porcine gore proved more powerful than bullets.'\n\nEven the newspaper's story, rendered without mention of summary executions, may have been made-up.\n\nTexas A&M University historian Brian McAllister Linn told Politifact last year that it's 'a fabrication and has long been discredited. I am amazed it is still making the rounds.'\n\nChristopher Einolf, a DePaul University expert and author, added: 'I never found any indication that it was true in extensive research on his Moro experiences. This kind of thing would have run completely against his character.'\n\nIt's also not clear that the Moro were particularly observant Muslims.\n\nAnd Michael H. Hunt, an emeritus historian at the University of North Carolina told Politifact that Pershing hardly crushed a rebellion.\n\nThe region 'remained in constant unrest during the period of American rule and into the period of independence, right down to the present.'\n\nBut in the South Carolina rally 18 months ago, Trump said the story was evidence that 'we better start getting tough and we better start getting vigilant, and we better start using our heads or we're not gonna have a country, folks.'\n\n'By the way,' he added, 'this is something you can read in the history books. Not a lot of history books, because they don't like teaching this.'\n\nA NOT SO DIRTY WAR AND A RACIALLY-LOADED NICKNAME\n\nWHO WAS PERSHING?\n\nGen. John 'Black Jack' Pershing, who would rise to fame in World War I, was a U.S. Army commander and served as governor of the southern Philippines' mainly Muslim Moro province between 1909 and 1913. His tenure came as the U.S. was consolidating its control over the Philippines, which it had won as a result of the Spanish-American War. Pershing was confronted with a Moro insurgency, which he largely broke in June 1913 in a battle that killed some 500 Moro fighters.\n\nHis nickname has an unfortunate history - and was not one of his own making. During a distinguished military career he had commanded the 10th Cavalry in the West . It was one of the original Buffalo Soldiers regiments - African-American troops under the command of white officers.\n\nBut when he was posted to West Point as an instructor, he was widely-disliked as a disciplinarian and cadets called him N****r Jack because of his previous command of the Buffalo Soldiers. Over time at West Point it was softened to Black Jack. By 1917, with entry into World War One, Pershing had become famous beyond just the military and the nickname stuck.\n\nHis own views on race are complicated. On one hand, he commanded racially-segregated forces in Europe in World War One, and sent messages to the French resisting anything which would appear to challenge segregation and the perceived inferiority of black troops. On the other hand, he wrote after the war: 'I cannot commend too highly the spirit shown among the colored combat troops, who exhibit fine capacity for quick training and eagerness for the most dangerous work.'\n\nWHAT TACTICS IS TRUMP PRAISING?\n\nIt's unclear. Trump did not cite any specific tactic employed by Pershing in his tweet on Thursday. But during the presidential campaign, he told a widely discredited story that Pershing had halted Muslim attacks in the Philippines by shooting rebels with bullets dipped in pigs' blood. Pork is taboo for Muslims, but that story has been widely debunked by historians as unsubstantiated or exaggerated. Fact-checking organizations such as Politifact rated Trump's claim as false.\n\nWar: There is little doubt that the Moro Rebellion was an unpleasant war with nasty actions, including the execution of prisoners. But historians say there is no evidence for the claims Trump alluded to on Twitter\n\nHowever, according to Politifact, Pershing wrote in a memoir that another U.S. commander in the Philippines had at least once 'seen to it' that Muslim insurgents' bodies were buried in the same grave as a dead pig to serve as a warning to others.\n\n'It was not pleasant to have to take such measures, but the prospect of going to hell instead of heaven sometimes deterred the would-be assassins,' Pershing wrote.\n\nAccording to Politifact, a footnote to the 2013 edition of the memoir cited another general as telling Pershing in a letter that the practice had long been a custom 'to discourage crazy lunatics.'", "id": "9863148", "details": {"pinCnt": 4}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Trump's

Be tough & strong, we love you! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\nAlmost an hour after his initial tweet -- which appeared more measured in nature than some of his past responses to terror attacks -- Trump followed up, implying the attack in Barcelona was thanks to \"Radical Islamic Terror\":\n\nStudy what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught. There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\nDuring the presidential primary race, Trump told crowds a story about Pershing, a U.S. Army general who commanded forces in World War I. According to Mother Jones, Trump spoke of Pershing executing Muslim insurgents with bullets dipped in pig's blood:\n\nHe caught 50 terrorists who did tremendous damage...and he took the 50 terrorists and he took 50 men and dipped 50 bullets in pig's blood. You heard about that? He took 50 bullets and dipped them in pig's blood [which is considered haram]. And he has his men load up their rifles and he lined up the 50 people and they shot 49 of those people. And the 50th person, he said, you go back to your people and you tell them what happened. And for 25 years there wasn't a problem.\n\nAfter telling that story, Trump claimed \"we've got to start getting tough and we've got to start being vigilant and we've got to start using our heads or we're not gonna have a country, folks.\" (As Time reports, there's no evidence of Pershing actually doing this.)\n\nTrump's comments on Barcelona came just hours after news first broke of the incident, which police confirmed they were treating as a terrorist attack. However, no group has claimed responsibility for the car attack. White House chief of staff John Kelly briefed Trump on the incident Thursday afternoon.\n\nTrump's quick response sharply contrasts with his reactions to the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, last Saturday.\n\nTrump argued in his initial response on Saturday that \"many sides\" were to blame for the tumult, which erupted amid a white supremacist protest against efforts to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. The president didn't explicitly condemn hate groups until Monday, two days after a car allegedly driven by a white supremacist plowed into a group of counterprotesters, killing a 32-year-old woman.\n\nIn a rambling press conference Tuesday, Trump defended his initial statement, arguing he needed to get \"the facts\" before making more definitive remarks against racist groups.\n\nIt is a very important statement. So I don't want to go quickly and just make a statement for the sake of making a political statement. President Donald Trump\n\n\"I wanted to make sure, unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct, not make a quick statement. The statement I made on Saturday, the first statement, was a fine statement, but you don't make statements that direct unless you know the facts,\" Trump said Tuesday. \"It takes a little while to get the facts. You still don't know the facts. It is a very, very important process to me. It is a very important statement. So I don't want to go quickly and just make a statement for the sake of making a political statement. I want to know the facts.\"\n\nTrump on Tuesday also again blamed \"both sides\" for the clashes in Charlottesville. \"You had a group on one side that was bad. You had a group on the other side that was also very violent,\" Trump said. \"Nobody wants to say that. I'll say it right now.\"\n\nUsing Twitter, Trump in the past has offered much quicker responses to violent incidents around the world. It took him less than a day to respond to terrorist attacks in Paris, Manchester, England, and London, the last of which he used as a reason to plug his proposal for a travel ban from several Muslim-majority countries.\n\nAs Vox has pointed out, Trump has been generally slow to respond to violent incidents where Muslims are the victims.\n\nTrump also has claimed he can \"predict\" terrorism, saying he \"can feel it.\" After a gunman who claimed allegiance to the Islamic State attacked a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in June 2016, killing 49 and wounding scores more, Trump bragged about \"being right on radical Islamic terrorism.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on HuffPost.", "id": "9765494", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Trump Points To 'Radical

Pershing that he first told publicly during a campaign rally in Charleston, South Carolina, in February 2016. According to Trump, Pershing dipped the bullets used to execute Muslim terrorists in pig blood. The Quran prohibits the consumption of pork, which is considered to be \"impure.\"\n\n\"They had a terrorism problem and there's a whole thing with swine and pigs and you know the story they don't like them ... and Gen.

Twenty-five years there wasn't a problem!\"\n\nAt the time the story was told, Politifact, an organization that fact-checks the claims of politicians, evaluated Trump's tale and concluded it to be \"ridiculous.\" Politifact cited eight historians who not only noted that the evidence for the blood-dipped bullet aspect of the story \"is thin,\" but also that violence and unrest continued in the referenced region in the Philippines for years during and after U.S. involvement.\n\nIt is unclear why Trump's original claim of \"25 years\" without \"a problem\" increased to \"35 years\" in his tweet Thursday.\n\nSnopes, an additional fact-checking outlet, similarly rated the story as false. In its analysis, Snopes writes of a 1927 Chicago Daily Tribune story noting Pershing \"sprinkled some prisoners with pig's blood,\" which was ultimately \"more powerful than bullets\" as a warning before releasing the prisoners, as well of a separate account that \"attributed the deed to someone other than Pershing.\"\n\nAt a press conference from Trump Tower in New York Tuesday, the president outlined his stance on adhering to factual information in response to a question about his hesitancy to condemn hate groups following violent protests last weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\n\"It takes a little while to get the facts. You still don't know the facts. And it's a very, very important process to me,\" said Trump, continuing, \"So I don't want to go quickly and just make a statement for the sake of making a political statement.

The tweet cited a debunked myth that Trump used to tell during his presidential campaign.\n\nPeople should \"study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught. There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\" Trump's tweet said.\n\nTrump did not cite any specific tactic employed by Pershing in his tweet on Thursday. But during the presidential campaign, he told a widely discredited story that Pershing had halted Muslim attacks in the Philippines by shooting rebels with bullets dipped in pigs' blood. Pork is taboo for Muslims, but that story has been widely debunked by historians as unsubstantiated or exaggerated. Fact-checking organizations such as Politifact rated Trump's claim as false.\n\nGen. John \"Black Jack\" Pershing, who would rise to fame in World War I, was a U.S. Army commander and served as governor of the southern Philippines' mainly Muslim Moro province between 1909 and 1913. His tenure came as the U.S. was consolidating its control over the Philippines, which it had won as a result of the Spanish-American War. Pershing was confronted with a Moro insurgency, which he largely broke in June 1913 in a battle that killed some 500 Moro fighters.\n\nAccording to Politifact, Pershing wrote in a memoir that another U.S. commander in the Philippines had at least once \"seen to it\" that Muslim insurgents' bodies were buried in the same grave as a dead pig to serve as a warning to others.\n\n\"It was not pleasant to have to take such measures, but the prospect of going to hell instead of heaven sometimes deterred the would-be assassins,\" Pershing wrote. According to Politifact, a footnote to the 2013 edition of the memoir cited another general as telling Pershing in a letter that the practice had long been a custom \"to discourage crazy lunatics.\"\n\nMany critical commentators believe Trump's tweet revived the story about Pershing and the bullets dipped in pigs' blood that he told during the campaign. It is however possible that Trump may have been referring to the burials cited in Pershing's memoirs.

Pershing, who led the U.S. Army force in World War I.\n\nIn his response to the August 17 attack in Barcelona, President Donald Trump told his followers to \"Study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught.\" But the story he is referring to is a myth that never happened.\n\nDuring the presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly referred to a story that General John J. Pershing executed Muslim prisoners in the Philippines during the early 1900s. Pershing, who is famous for leading the American Army forces in Europe during World War I, \"caught 50 terrorists that did tremendous damage and killed many people and he took the 50 terrorists and he took 50 men and he dipped 50 bullets in pig's blood,\" as Trump said during one rally in 2016.\n\nTrump continued, \"And he had his men load his rifles, and he lined up the 50 people, and they shot 49 of those people. And the 50th person, he said: 'You go back to your people, and you tell them what happened.'\"\n\nHowever, there is no evidence to back up this story.\n\nHere's a look at the myth that Pershing \"dipped 50 bullets in pig's blood\" then executed Muslims.\n\nTrump began telling the story in February 2016, while on the campaign trail, as an example of how to deal with \"radical Islamic terrorists.\" As The Washington Post notes, Trump told the story while he advocated for the return of waterboarding. This led to Trump telling a crowd in South Carolina a story about the \"rough guy, rough guy\" Pershing.\n\nTrump said:\n\n\"They were having terrorism problems, just like we do... And he caught 50 terrorists who did tremendous damage and killed many people. And he took the 50 terrorists, and he took 50 men and he dipped 50 bullets in pigs' blood -- you heard that, right? He took 50 bullets, and he dipped them in pigs' blood. And he had his men load his rifles, and he lined up the 50 people, and they shot 49 of those people. And the 50th person, he said: You go back to your people, and you tell them what happened. And for 25 years, there wasn't a problem. Okay? Twenty-five years, there wasn't a problem. By the way, this is something you can read in the history books -- not a lot of history books because they don't like teaching this.\"\n\nTrump didn't say the word \"Muslim\" in the story, but he noted, \"There's a whole thing with swine and animals and pigs, and -- you know the story, you know they don't like that.\" Eating pork is forbidden in Islam.\n\nThe story has its roots in Pershing's tenure as the Governor of the Moro Province in the Philippines, as Snopes explains. After the Spanish-American War in 1898, the U.S. took control of the Philippines until its independence in 1946. Between 1898 and 1945, the American military fought off independence movements. The Philippine-American War lasted from 1899 to 1902.\n\nBut while that war was over, the military continued fighting the Moro Rebellion until 1913. \"Moro\" is a term describing the ethnic Muslims who lived in the Moro Province. Pershing was the Governor of the province from 1909 to 1913.\n\nSnopes points out that there is no evidence that Pershing specifically did what Trump said he did in Pershing biographies. There is an incident when Pershing's order to ban firearms was ignored. This led to the Second Battle of Bud Dajo in 1911. Pershing wanted to avoid a repeat of the First Battle of Bud Dajo in 1906, which was a disaster. Almost 1,000 Moro people died and it became known as the \"Bud Dajo Massacre.\"\n\nPershing succeeded in keeping casualties on both sides limited. Only 12 Moro people died in the Second Battle of Bud Dajo. However, the rebellion continued until 1913.\n\nPershing also wanted to avoid inspiring religious fanaticism. He had avoided turning the Second Battle of Bud Dajo into a massacre by negotiating with those assembled after his forces cut off their supply. He wrote that the Moro who had assembled to fight \"were chagrined and disappointed in that they were not encouraged to die the death of Mohammedan fanatics.\"\n\nPershing remained in the Philippines until 1913. After that, he took part in the Pancho Villa expedition, following the deaths of his three young daughters and wife from smoke inhalation.\n\nDuring World War I, Pershing was made Commander of the American Expeditionary Force. After the war, he was made General of the Armies of the United States, the highest possible rank in the U.S. military. The position was created just for him. Pershing died in July 1948 and is buried at Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nPolitifact notes that a Pershing memoir titled My Life Before The World War, 1860-1917 includes a story of Col. Frank West. Pershing wrote that West had Muslim insurgents \"publicly buried in the same grave with a dead pig. It was not pleasant to have to take such measures, but the prospect of going to hell instead of heaven sometimes deterred the would-be assassins.\"\n\nThe editor of the new edition of My Life Before The War, John T. Greenwood, added that Maj. Gen. J. Franklin Bell wrote to Pershing that he thought it was \"good plan, for if anything will discourage the (insurgents) it is the prospect of going to hell instead of to heaven.\" Bell also wrote that he endorsed the custom \"to discourage crazy fanatics.\"\n\nThe letters prove that the U.S. military did use pigs to threaten Muslim insurgents in the Philippines, but it doesn't make Trump's story true. It also fails to prove his point that these practices dissuaded violence from Muslims for over a quarter-century.\n\nAuthor William Lambers wrote in February that there was a story about Pershing using pig's blood, but it was published in a Chicago paper 14 years after Pershing left the Philippines. The story didn't even involve Pershing firing blood-dipped bullets at the Moro rebels.\n\nLambers writes that the Chicago Daily Tribune reported in 1927 that Pershing sprinkle pig's blood on Moro prisoners who thought it would condemn them for eternity. However, didn't kill them. He let them go with a warning that others would be sprinkled with pig's blood as well. \"Those drops of porcine gore proved more powerful than bullets,\" the Tribune story read.\n\n\"If Pershing were around today he would be advocating food for the hungry child refugees, which are at unprecedented levels today because of the war in Syria,\" Lambers wrote. \"They never talk about hunger during the presidential debates, but it's a top foreign policy issue, which Pershing and other great leaders have understood. Pershing was also deeply concerned about high levels of military spending. He often spoke about achieving global arms reductions and disarmament. Nations could work together to achieve this noble goal.\"\n\nThen, as Snopes found, there is a story from the 1938 book Jungle Patrol that credits this to another military commander. The passage reads:\n\nIt was Colonel Alexander Rodgers of the 6th Cavalry who accomplished by taking advantage of religious prejudice what the bayonets and Krags had been unable to accomplish. Rodgers inaugurated a system of burying all dead juramentados in a common grave with the carcasses of slaughtered pigs. The Mohammedan religion forbids contact with pork; and this relatively simple device resulted in the withdrawal of juramentados to sections not containing a Rodgers. Other officers took up the principle, adding new refinements to make it additionally unattractive to the Moros. In some sections the Moro juramentado was beheaded after death and the head sewn inside the carcass of a pig. And so the rite of running juramentado, at least semi-religious in character, ceased to be in Sulu. The last cases of this religious mania occurred in the early decades of the century. The juramentados were replaced by the amucks. .. who were simply homicidal maniacs with no religious significance attaching to their acts.\n\nTrump's story reached a wider audience in the age of the Internet. It was so widespread in the days after the September 11, 2001 terror attacks, that it ended up being told by members of the government. In 2005, it ended up on a poster at the California National Guard headquarters in Sacramento and was later removed.\n\nIn October 2001, The Los Angeles Times reported that then-Senate Intelligence Committee Bob Graham (D-Fla.) recalled a dinner with people who had connections to the intelligence committee and they mentioned the story. Graham said Pergshin's soldiers captured 12 Muslims and killed six of them with \"bullets dipped into the fat of pigs.\"\n\nGraham said that U.S. soldiers wrapped Muslim rebels in pigskin shrouds and \"buried them face down so they could not see Mecca. Then they poured the entrails of the pigs over them. The other six were forced to watch. And that was the end of the insurrection on Mindanao.\"\n\nAnother way the story of using pig's blood to threaten Muslims during the Philippine-American War came in a 1939 Gary Cooper movie called The Real Glory. In the film, Cooper stars as an Army doctor in 1906 Manlia who drapes pigskin around a Muslim prisoner and tells him that all killed Muslim rebels will be buried in pig skins.\n\nHistorians told Politifact that evidence that things like the incident in the Cooper movie happened is also thin. The historians told the site that Pershing tried to be a more peaceful governor compared to his predecessor, Leonard Wood.\n\n\"He did a lot of what we would call 'winning hearts and minds' and embraced reforms which helped end their resistance,\" Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University, told Politifact. \"He fought too, but only when he had to, and only against tribes or bands that just wouldn't negotiate with him. He wasn't solely committed to fighting as people like Trump who tell the pig blood story imply.\"", "id": "9805994", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "General Pershing Pig's Blood Myth: 5

There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\nSo, what is Trump going on about? Well, he has referenced the legend of General \"Black Jack\" Pershing before - at a rally in South Carolina last year while Trump was on his campaign trail.\n\nAccording to Trump back then, Pershing had managed to halt Muslim attacks in the Philippines where he was based by shooting Islamic militants with bullets dipped in pig's blood - pork being a taboo in Muslim culture.\n\n\"He caught 50 terrorists who did tremendous damage and killed many people,\" said Trump at the rally. \"They shot 49 of those people. And the 50th person, he said: You go back to your people, and you tell them what happened.\"\n\nTrump claimed \"for 25 years there wasn't a problem\" - a number he has seemingly increased to 35 in his tweet.\n\nTrump's story was widely discredited and debunked, with fact-checking organisation Politifact rating the claims about Pershing as false. However, they note the general did write in a memoir that he saw other commanding officers publicly burying Muslim insurgents in the same grave as a dead pig.\n\n\"It was not pleasant to have to take such measures, but the prospect of going to hell instead of heaven sometimes deterred the would-be assassins,\" wrote Pershing.\n\nLacking more specifics, it is not certain Trump is referring to the same story he gave in February 2016 in his latest tweet - but the allusion to it in the wake of the fatalities in Spain has drawn severe criticism.\n\nTrump is celebrating torture and mass executions here.

(AP)\n\nHours after an apparent terrorist attack in Barcelona, President Trump on Thursday recycled a largely discredited Internet tale that he promoted on the campaign trail as a way to call attention to what he has called \"radical Islamic terrorism.\"\n\nIn a Twitter message, Trump instructed his 36 million followers to look to the example of Gen. John J. Pershing, who is said, in stories circulating online, to have dipped bullets in pigs' blood to execute Islamic terrorists in the Philippines whose religion forbid contact with the animals.\n\nThe story has been found to be unsubstantiated by numerous fact-checkers in the media. But Trump first told the story during a campaign rally in February 2016, as he defended his position of supporting methods of torture, such as waterboarding, on terrorist suspects.\n\nStudy what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught. There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\n\n-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 17, 2017\n\nTrump's tweet came hours after a man in Barcelona drove a van at high speeds into a crowd at a popular tourist destination, killing 12 and injuring 50 more, according to local police who are calling the attack an act of terrorism. One man is reportedly in custody in the investigation.\n\nTrump also tweeted message of support for the victims, in which he said the United States \"condemns the terror attack.\"\n\nThe United States condemns the terror attack in Barcelona, Spain, and will do whatever is necessary to help. Be tough & strong, we love you!\n\n-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 17, 2017\n\nThe message stood in sharp contrast to Trump's reaction Saturday to an attack in Charlottesville, when a man drove a car into a group of people protesting a white nationalist rally, killing a woman and injuring 19 others. An alleged Nazi sympathizer who had attended the rally is charged with second-degree murder in the case.\n\nAfter than incident, Trump blamed the actions of people \"on many sides\" of the violent clashes.\n\nPresident Trump speaks about the violence, injuries and deaths at the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville as he talks to the media in the lobby of Trump Tower in Manhattan on Aug. 15, 2017. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)\n\nThough he denounced the white supremacist hate groups directly two days later, Trump then reversed course and again blamed \"both sides\" on Tuesday, prompting a widespread political backlash. The president on Tuesday explained that his initial reaction had been muted because he did not have all the \"facts\" in the case and wanted to be cautious.\n\n[Trump mourns loss of 'beautiful statues and monuments' in wake of Charlottesville rally over Robert E. Lee statue]\n\nIn his February recitation of the Pershing story, Trump told a crowd of supporters that the general was having trouble dealing with terrorist attacks and caught 50 suspects.\n\n\"He took the 50 terrorists, and he took 50 men and he dipped 50 bullets in pigs' blood -- you heard that, right? He took 50 bullets, and he dipped them in pigs' blood,\" Trump continued. \"And he had his men load his rifles, and he lined up the 50 people, and they shot 49 of those people. And the 50th person, he said: You go back to your people, and you tell them what happened. And for 25 years, there wasn't a problem. Okay? Twenty-five years, there wasn't a problem.\"\n\nAt one point in telling this story, Trump said: \"By the way, this is something you can read in the history books -- not a lot of history books because they don't like teaching this.\"\n\nAlthough Trump never used the word \"Muslim\" in this story, he was clearly referring to Muslim terrorists and at one point commented: \"There's a whole thing with swine and animals and pigs, and -- you know the story, you know they don't like that.\" Pigs are deemed impure by the Koran.\n\nThere are several versions of the tale circulating, including one in which the prisoners were buried with dead pigs. The pigs' blood on the bullets, according to at least one version, would keep a Muslim from entering heaven.\n\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations denounced Trump's remarks last year in a sharply worded statement that accused the then-candidate of inciting anti-Muslim attacks.\n\nJenna Johnson contributed to this report.", "id": "9769103", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title":

There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\" Trump tweeted.\n\nWhile it was not 100 percent clear exactly what the president is referring to in the post, he has talked about Pershing ridding an area of terrorists in the past. And the claims he made about Pershing's tactics were widely debunked as false.\n\nDaily Emails and Alerts - Get the best of Newsweek delivered to your inbox\n\nTrump first told his version of Pershing's life at a rally in February 2016 in South Carolina, saying to the crowd, \"It's a terrible story, but I'll tell you.\" He said Pershing had dealt with terrorists in the early 1900s, presumably in the Philippines, according to a Washington Post write-up of the rally. Trump said Pershing used the blood of pigs, deemed impure in the Koran, to combat terrorists.\n\n\"They were having terrorism problems, just like we do,\" Trump said. \"And he caught 50 terrorists who did tremendous damage and killed many people. And he took the 50 terrorists, and he took 50 men and he dipped 50 bullets in pigs' blood -- you heard that, right? He took 50 bullets, and he dipped them in pigs' blood. And he had his men load his rifles, and he lined up the 50 people, and they shot 49 of those people. And the 50th person, he said, 'You go back to your people, and you tell them what happened.' And for 25 years, there wasn't a problem. Okay? Twenty-five years, there wasn't a problem.\"\n\nThe fact-checking website Snopes debunked this as an internet-created rumor that picked up steam after the September attack. Pershing was the governor of the Moro province in the Philippines between 1909 and 1913. He seemed to truly regret the loss of life in the province, Snopes wrote.\n\nPolitiFact, also a fact-checking site, asked eight scholars about the story at the time, and \"most expressed skepticism that the specific story ever happened, and many added that Trump's takeaway is wrong-headed.\"\n\n\"This story is a fabrication and has long been discredited,\" Brian McAllister Linn, a Texas A&M University historian and author of the book Guardians of Empire: The U.S. Army and the Pacific, 1902-1940, told PolitiFact. \"I am amazed it is still making the rounds.\"\n\nPershing, who was born in 1860 and died in 1948, served in World War I, heading up the American Expeditionary Force in Europe. After the war he was promoted to general of the armies, the highest rank in the Army at the time.

The General met with the Moros and read from the Koran with them. Pershing wanted to build bridges.\"\n\nFact-checking website Politifact asked eight historians about the story, and reported: \"Most expressed skepticism that the specific story ever happened, and

The president was asking the world to \"study\" an online hoax.\n\n\"Study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught,\" Trump wrote on Twitter on Thursday afternoon. \"There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\"\n\nTrump did not elaborate, this time, on what the late U.S. general John Pershing supposedly did. But he told a detailed (and false) story about Pershing's actions at a campaign rally during the Republicans' South Carolina primary in February 2016.\n\nHe claimed then that Pershing had executed 49 Muslim prisoners during the U.S. occupation of the Philippines in the early-1900s, adding religious insult by dipping the bullets in the bloods of pigs, which Muslims are forbidden to consume.\n\n\"This was a terrible problem. They were having terrorism problems just like we do,\" Trump said then. \"And he caught 50 terrorists who did tremendous damage and killed many people.

Twenty-five years there wasn't a problem.\"\n\nThe myth-busting website Snopes found no evidence of the story, which has circulated by email since at least 2001. Snopes found anecdotal accounts that Pershing or other military leaders had threatened to bury Muslims along with pig carcasses.\n\nThis time, Trump said the non-massacre deterred terror for \"35 years,\" adding an extra 10 years to the original lie.\n\nThe Thursday tweet came 45 minutes after he issued a conventional response to the terrorist attack in Barcelona. Trump has sometimes chafed at aides' advice to adopt a more traditionally presidential manner.\n\n\"The United States condemns the terror attack in Barcelona, Spain, and will do whatever is necessary to help. Be tough & strong, we love you!\" he wrote in the original tweet.\n\nTrump reignited talk of his anti-Muslim bigotry as he continued to stoke the controversy over his general racial attitudes that has led to his greatest crisis as president to date, with Republican legislators continuing to denounce him Thursday for blaming \"both sides\" for the violence at a white supremacist demonstration in Charlottesville, Va., on Saturday.\n\nOn Thursday morning, he issued a series of tweets in support of the preservation of Confederate monuments -- describing them not only as part of U.S. historical but a \"beautiful\" part of U.S. \"culture.\"\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" he wrote. \"You can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson -- who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish! Also ... the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\nTennessee Sen. Bob Corker, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, ripped Trump at an event in his home state, calling for \"radical\" changes in the White House saying \"he has not demonstrated that

Most expressed skepticism that the specific story ever happened, and many added that Trump's takeaway is wrong-headed.\"\n\nThey pointed out, that, in addition to the shootings likely never having happened, Mr Trump's conclusion that it resulted in an era of peace was also misguided.\n\nHow the Barcelona terror attack unfolded 01:10", "id": "9783431", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Donald Trump responds to Barcelona attack by reviving myth of US general dipping bullets in pigs' blood to kill Muslims", "image": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/08/16/TELEMMGLPICT000137537903-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqWxGSA6EqCkNPLXCjaqkxzZHOo1FY8WulCaIUrBPxM2E.jpeg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 538, "freq": 2, "date": "2017-08-17", "amb": false, "textEnd": 553}, {"textStart": 1054, "date": "2016-02-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1067}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "67", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "177", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "151106", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Blood"}, "id": "302514", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}, "id": "303057", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Islam"}, "id": "303218", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam"}, {"label": {"eng": "Muslim"}, "id": "303629", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim"}, {"label": {"eng": "Capital punishment"}, "id": "304224", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment"}, {"label": {"eng": "General officer"}, "id": "304309", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"}, {"label": {"eng": "Islamic terrorism"}, "id": "308026", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_terrorism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pig"}, "id": "314033", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"}, {"label": {"eng": "PolitiFact.com"}, "id": "323532", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PolitiFact.com"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fact checker"}, "id": "323533", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact_checker"}, {"label": {"eng": "Eminent domain"}, "id": "324837", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eminent_domain"}, {"label": {"eng": "Skepticism"}, "id": "336168", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skepticism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Insurgency"}, "id": "344694", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurgency"}, {"label": {"eng": "Snopes.com"}, "id": "347247", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snopes.com"}, {"label": {"eng": "John J.

John J. Pershing and what he did to Muslim terrorists when they were caught.\n\nStudy what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught. There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\n\n-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 17, 2017\n\nTrump was referencing the discredited story about how Pershing executed 49 Muslims with bullets that had been dipped in pig's blood during the Philippine-American War of 1899-1902. According to legend, Pershing told the 50th Muslim to take one of those bullets back to his people as a warning of what would happen should they persist, and this supposedly led to a massive decline in radical terrorism from jihadists for the next several decades.\n\nPeople who believe in this myth say Pershing's tactic worked because under Islam, pig blood is considered unholy. During the campaign, Trump repeatedly trotted out this story.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that Trump told the story at a rally in North Charleston, S.C., in February 2016.\n\n\"They were having terrorism problems, just like we do. And he caught 50 terrorists who did tremendous damage and killed many people. And he took the 50 terrorists, and he took 50 men, and he dipped 50 bullets in pigs' blood -- you heard that, right? He took 50 bullets, and he dipped them in pigs' blood. And he had his men load his rifles, and he lined up the 50 people, and they shot 49 of those people. And the 50th person, he said: 'You go back to your people, and you tell them what happened.' And for 25 years, there wasn't a problem. OK? Twenty-five years, there wasn't a problem.\"\n\nPolitiFact, the fact-checking website, rated this statement \"pants on fire\" at the time. PolitiFact tried to verify Trump's account of Pershing's actions with eight different historians. All were skeptical that these events ever happened.\n\nLouis Jacobson, a correspondent for PolitiFact, noted that Pershing's memoir and a letter from Maj. Gen. J. Franklin Bell, the commander of the Philippines Division, to Pershing provide \"strong evidence\" that the U.S. forces did use pigs as a tactic against Muslim insurgents during that era. Nevertheless, they do not support the claims that Trump made, he said.\n\n\"There is no evidence that Pershing himself committed these acts, there is nothing said about the use of 50 bullets dipped in pig's blood, and most important, there is no evidence to support Trump's claim that this tactic was effective in stopping violence -- or that it would provide a useful policy today,\" Jacobson wrote.\n\nSnopes judged a similar story about Pershing killing Muslim terrorists and burying their bodies with pigs to be false.\n\nThe president is citing a fake story about shooting Muslims with bullets soaked in pig's blood.

To Muslims, pigs are unholy and the insurgents feared that if they died, Pershing's practice would deny them entry into heaven.\n\nThe story is highly controversial because it suggests that the government has used a deliberate form of religious discrimination as a successful anti-terror tactic. A 2009 biography of Pershing by Jim Lacey, a military analyst for the Institute for Defense Analyses, claimed to confirm that Pershing did use the tactic.\n\n\"Until now the historical verdict is that this was a vicious rumor and while it may have happened in occasion, Pershing neither knew about it nor, given his humane outlook, would have condoned such an action. That verdict is wrong as Pershing's own unpublished autobiography states,\" Lacey wrote in Pershing: A Biography, published by PalGrave MacMillan.\n\nThe book then cites an unpublished letter by Pershing, stating: \"These juramentado attacks were materially reduced in number by a practice the Army had already adopted, one that the Mohammedans held in abhorrence: The bodies were publicly buried in the same grave with a dead pig.

Initially, Trump's remarks were \"measured\" and safe, as he promised to \"do whatever is necessary to help\" victims of the attack. Less than an hour later, Trump posted another tweet, alleging that \"radical Islamic terror\" was behind the incident, while referencing John \"Black Jack\" Pershing, an Army general who led the U.S. military and governed Moro province in the Philippines in the early 1900s.\n\n\"Study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught. There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\"\n\nTrump's post-Barcelona attack remarks aren't unprecedented, as today wasn't the first time he referred to General John Pershing. According to Mother Jones, Trump described Pershing as a \"rough guy\" at the South Carolina Republican primaries in February 2016, telling the tale of a general who took a rather unorthodox approach to dealing with Muslim insurgents in the Philippines, in the early 1900s.\n\n\"He caught 50 terrorists who did tremendous damage...and he took the 50 terrorists and he took 50 men and dipped 50 bullets in pig's blood. You heard about that? He took 50 bullets and dipped them in pig's blood. And he has his men load up their rifles and he lined up the 50 people and they shot 49 of those people. And the 50th person, he said, you go back to your people and you tell them what happened. And for 25 years there wasn't a problem.\"\n\nThe above quote suggests that Trump might have been 10 years off in his post-Barcelona attack tweet. But many people took issue with the tweet because the General Pershing story may have been an urban legend all along. Snopes first debunked the story more than 15 years ago, and subsequent updates to the publication's fact-checking article have also suggested that the mass execution supposedly spearheaded by Pershing is nothing but a \"rumor created on the internet,\" and that the general had actually favored peace talks with the Moros, as opposed to violent solutions.\n\nReactions to Donald Trump's Barcelona statement have mostly been negative, with several Twitter users accusing the President of enforcing double standards and citing a story that is believed to be untrue. Moreover, publications such as the Guardian pointed out how quickly Trump found a group to blame for the Barcelona incident, not long after it took him two days to blame the Charlottesville rallies on the far right, only for him to defend his original statement blaming \"both sides\" a day later.\n\n\"I wanted to make sure, unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct, not make a quick statement,\" said Trump on Tuesday, as quoted by the HuffPost.\n\n\"The statement I made on Saturday, the first statement, was a fine statement, but you don't make statements that direct unless you know the facts.\"\n\nThe HuffPost noted that Trump's quick reaction to the Barcelona attack is not the first time he has blamed \"radical Islamic terrorism\" for attacks, as he had issued similar statements, albeit without the General Pershing reference, following recent terrorist attacks in Paris, Manchester, and London.", "id": "9782595", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title":

There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\"\n\nWhat is behind the tweet and the criticism? The AP explains:\n\nPERSHING AND THE PHILIPPINES\n\nGen. John \"Black Jack\" Pershing, who would rise to fame in World War I, was a U.S. Army commander and served as governor of the southern Philippines' mainly Muslim Moro province between 1909 and 1913. His tenure came as the U.S. was consolidating its control over the Philippines, which it had won as a result of the Spanish-American War. Pershing was confronted with a Moro insurgency, which he largely broke in June 1913 in a battle that killed some 500 Moro fighters.\n\nTRUMP AND TACTICS AGAINST TERRORISM\n\nIt's unclear. Trump did not cite any specific tactic employed by Pershing in his tweet on Thursday. But during the presidential campaign, he told a widely discredited story that Pershing had halted Muslim attacks in the Philippines by shooting rebels with bullets dipped in pigs' blood. Pork is taboo for Muslims, but that story has been widely debunked by historians as unsubstantiated or exaggerated. Fact-checking organizations such as Politifact rated Trump's claim as false.\n\nHowever, according to Politifact, Pershing wrote in a memoir that another U.S. commander in the Philippines had at least once \"seen to it\" that Muslim insurgents' bodies were buried in the same grave as a dead pig to serve as a warning to others. \"It was not pleasant to have to take such measures, but the prospect of going to hell instead of heaven sometimes deterred the would-be assassins,\" Pershing wrote. According to Politifact, a footnote to the 2013 edition of the memoir cited another general as telling Pershing in a letter that the practice had long been a custom \"to discourage crazy lunatics.\"\n\nTRUMP TWEETS A DEBUNKED STORY\n\nMany critical commentators believe Trump's tweet revived the specific story about Pershing and the bullets dipped in pigs' blood that he told during the campaign. But because Trump was not specific about the tactics he was referring to, it is not possible to tell with certainty. He could also have been referring to the burials cited in Pershing's memoirs. In either case, Trump's claim that Pershing's treatment of captured militants was the prime reason for the end of the insurgency is not supported by historical fact.", "id": "9786612", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "AP Explains: Why is Trump tweeting about a WWI general?", "image": "http://img.etimg.com/photo/6325547.cms", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "177", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}, "id": "303057", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Islam"}, "id": "303218", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam"}, {"label": {"eng": "Muslim"}, "id": "303629", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}, "id": "304754", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press"}, {"label": {"eng": "United States Army"}, "id": "306135", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pork"}, "id": "309547", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pork"}, {"label": {"eng": "World War I"}, "id": "309993", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pig"}, "id": "314033", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"}, {"label": {"eng": "PolitiFact.com"}, "id": "323532", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PolitiFact.com"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fact checker"}, "id": "323533", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact_checker"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mindanao"}, "id": "340021", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindanao"}, {"label": {"eng": "Insurgency"}, "id": "344694", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurgency"}, {"label": {"eng": "Moro people"}, "id": "350264", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moro_people"}, {"label": {"eng": "Spanish\u2013American War"}, "id": "438243", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish\u2013American_War"}, {"label": {"eng": "John J.

But he told a detailed (and false) story about Pershing's actions at a campaign rally during the Republicans' South Carolina primary in February 2016.\n\nHe claimed then that Pershing had executed 49 Muslim prisoners during the U.S. occupation of the Philippines in the early-1900s, adding religious insult by dipping the bullets in the bloods of pigs, which Muslims are forbidden to consume.\n\n\"This was a terrible problem.

Twenty-five years there wasn't a problem.\"\n\nThe myth-busting website Snopes found no evidence to support the story, which has circulated by email since at least 2001. Snopes found anecdotal accounts that Pershing or other military leaders had threatened to bury Muslims along with pig carcasses.\n\nThis time, Trump said the non-massacre deterred terror for \"35 years,\" adding an extra 10 years to the original lie.\n\nThe Thursday tweet came 45 minutes after he issued a conventional response to the terrorist attack in Barcelona. Trump has sometimes chafed at aides' advice to adopt a more traditionally presidential manner.\n\n\"The United States condemns the terror attack in Barcelona, Spain, and will do whatever is necessary to help. Be tough & strong, we love you!\" he wrote in the original tweet.\n\nTrump reignited talk of his anti-Muslim bigotry as he continued to stoke the controversy over his general racial attitudes that has led to his greatest crisis as president to date, with Republican legislators continuing to denounce him Thursday for blaming \"both sides\" for the violence at a white supremacist demonstration in Charlottesville, Va., on Saturday.\n\nOn Thursday morning, he issued a series of tweets in support of the preservation of Confederate monuments -- describing them not only as part of U.S. historical but a \"beautiful\" part of U.S. \"culture.\"\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" he wrote. \"You can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson -- who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish! Also ... the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\nTennessee Sen. Bob Corker, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, ripped Trump at an event in his home state, calling for \"radical\" changes in the White House saying \"he has not demonstrated that he understands what makes this nation great and what it is today.\"", "id": "9766884", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Donald Trump endorses racist mass murder as an anti-terror tactic,

For some time, there have been rumors that claim Gen. John J. Pershing employed such tactics following the Philippine-American War in order to deter insurgents.\n\nTrump previously referred to this during a February 2016 rally. In the story Trump told at that time, Pershing's forces captured 50 Muslim prisoners. Pershing then, Trump said, \"took 50 bullets, and he dipped them in pigs' blood. And he had his men load his rifles, and he lined up the 50 people, and they shot 49 of those people. And the 50th person, he said, 'You go back to your people, and you tell them what happened.' And for 25 years, there wasn't a problem.\"\n\nThere is no evidence to support this claim. Snopes, a website that fact-checks Internet rumors, declared it to be false. Politifact, another fact-checking website, gave it a \"Pants on Fire\" rating.\n\nIn Pershing's memoir, \"My Life Before the World War, 1860-1917,\" he wrote of another commanding officer in the Philippines who had at least once buried Muslims \"in the same grave as a dead pig.\" But as Politifact noted, this anecdote does not support Trump's claim -- either the specific story he told, or the idea that it was effective at deterring future attacks.\n\n\"There is no evidence that Pershing himself committed these acts, there is nothing said about the use of 50 bullets dipped in pig's blood, and most important, there is no evidence to support Trump's claim that this tactic was effective in stopping violence -- or that it would provide a useful policy today,\" Politifact said in its story debunking the claim.\n\nMoreover, the idea that all Muslims believe that if they are shot with pigs' blood they would be sent to hell, the foundation of the supposed tactic, is incorrect. Islam forbids its followers from consuming pork, but \"there is no penalty for coming into contact with pork given by the Quran,\" Shannon Dunn, an assistant professor of religious studies at Gonzaga University, told HuffPost.\n\nA spokesperson for the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThursday's attack in Barcelona left at least 13 dead and 80 injured.

John Pershing?\n\nIn urging people to \"study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught\" Trump is once again dredging up a widely debunked story about Pershing, the U.S. Army general who commanded the American Expeditionary Force in World War I and also served during the Philippine-American War.\n\nThis isn't the first time Trump has sought to use Pershing to advocate for a harsher response to terrorism. Trump first mentioned the unproven Pershing story while campaigning in South Carolina in February of 2016. At a rally in North Charleston, Trump used the story to advocate for the use of waterboarding, an interrogation technique the Obama administration considered to be torture. He claimed Pershing ordered 49 terrorists to be executed with bullets dipped in pigs blood with the 50th terrorist told to return home and tell his people what happened. \"And for 25 years, there wasn't a problem,\" Trump alleged.\n\nIn a tweet posted Thursday, Trump appeared to inflate his claim, alleging Pershing's actions had wiped out \"radical Islamic terror for 35 years.\"\n\nBut while some historians have noted there are recorded instances where American military members deliberately attempted to offend Filipino Muslims' through the use of pigs during the Philippine-American war, they also emphasized - in comments to Time - that there was no evidence to prove Pershing carried out the event Trump hinted at.\n\nThe myth-busting website Snopes also reported finding \"no references to this alleged incident in Pershing biographies,\" adding such myths did not match up with how Gen. Pershing is \"generally recorded as having dealt with the Moros in 1911.\" The fact-checking website PolitiFact also spoke with multiple historians and came to a similar conclusion last year.\n\n\"[Pershing] did a lot of what we would call 'winning hearts and minds' and embraced reforms which helped end [Moro] resistance,\" Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University, told PolitiFact. \"He fought too, but only when he had to, and only against tribes or bands that just wouldn't negotiate with him. He wasn't solely committed to fighting as people like Trump who tell the pig blood story imply.\"\n\nMilitary historian Dr. Frank E. Vandiver also refuted the story in 2003, telling ThoughtCo. he \"never found any indication that it was true in extensive research on [Pershing's] Moro experiences. Vandiver also argued such an incident \"would have run completely against [Pershing's] character.\"\n\nBorn near Laclede, Missouri in 1860, Pershing is one of only two people to have ever been promoted to \"General of the Armies\" for his service in World War I. From 1921 to 1924 Pershing served as U.S. Army Chief of Staff. He retired from the military at age 64 in 1924 and later died in his sleep in 1948.

There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\"\n\nTrump: Study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught. There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\n\nThe president shared the purported story as a candidate in February 2016, as he brought up his support for waterboarding, according to The Washington Post. The tale, often characterized as a myth, has made rounds on the internet but historians do not see real evidence to back it, according to PolitiFact.\n\nTrump pushed the Pershing tale during a week in which he faced stark criticism from bipartisan lawmakers and business leaders for his response to an attack at a white nationalist rally in Virginia over the weekend. Trump appeared to suggest a moral equivalency between people marching in the white nationalist rally and other protesting against them.\n\nWhen Trump last year told the story about Gen. John Pershing, he said it took place in the early 1900s but did not specify a location, according to the Post. Pershing served as governor of a largely Muslim province in the Philippines from 1909-1913 as the United States tried to establish control of the area, PolitiFact said.\n\nHere's how Trump told the tale last year, according to the Post:\n\n\"They were having terrorism problems, just like we do. And he caught 50 terrorists who did tremendous damage and killed many people. And he took the 50 terrorists, and he took 50 men and he dipped 50 bullets in pigs' blood -- you heard that, right? He took 50 bullets, and he dipped them in pigs' blood. And he had his men load his rifles, and he lined up the 50 people, and they shot 49 of those people. And the 50th person, he said: You go back to your people, and you tell them what happened. And for 25 years, there wasn't a problem. Okay? Twenty-five years, there wasn't a problem.\"\n\nAside from the story's questionable accuracy, it would be an extrajudicial, religiously charged mass killing.\n\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations denounced the tale when Trump first told it.\n\n\"By directly stating that the only way to stop terrorism is to murder Muslims in graphic and religiously-offensive ways, he places the millions of innocent, law-abiding citizens in the American Muslim community at risk from rogue vigilantes,\" Nihad Awad, national executive director of CAIR, said in a February 2016 statement.\n\nThe tweet Thursday likely will not make life any easier for Trump during a week in which he has faced backlash for his response to racially charged violence.", "id": "9780122", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Trump promotes unfounded story about mass killing of terrorists", "image": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2017/08/17/104659317-GettyImages-831967292-trump.1910x1000.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 551, "freq": 2, "date": "2016-02-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 564}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "177", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "151106", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "242096", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Law"}, "id": "302557", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"}, {"label": {"eng": "Internet"}, "id": "302869", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "Murder"}, "id": "302958", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder"}, {"label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}, "id": "303057", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Islam"}, "id": "303218", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam"}, {"label": {"eng": "Citizenship"}, "id": "303514", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Muslim"}, "id": "303629", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}, "id": "304270", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post"}, {"label": {"eng": "Islam in the United States"}, "id": "304312", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}, "id": "305187", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mass murder"}, "id": "312474", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_murder"}, {"label": {"eng": "Council on American\u2013Islamic Relations"}, "id": "313177", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_on_American\u2013Islamic_Relations"}, {"label": {"eng": "PolitiFact.com"}, "id": "323532", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PolitiFact.com"}, {"label": {"eng": "Extrajudicial punishment"}, "id": "340180", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrajudicial_punishment"}, {"label": {"eng": "Waterboarding"}, "id": "342942", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterboarding"}, {"label": {"eng": "Moral equivalence"}, "id": "360451", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_equivalence"}, {"label": {"eng": "White nationalism"}, "id": "394340", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_nationalism"}, {"label": {"eng": "John J.

For some time, there have been rumors that claim Gen. John J. Pershing employed such tactics following the Philippine-American War in order to deter insurgents.\n\nTrump previously referred to this during a February 2016 rally. In the story Trump told at that time, Pershing's forces captured 50 Muslim prisoners. Pershing then, Trump said, \"took 50 bullets, and he dipped them in pigs' blood. And he had his men load his rifles, and he lined up the 50 people, and they shot 49 of those people. And the 50th person, he said, 'You go back to your people, and you tell them what happened.' And for 25 years, there wasn't a problem.\"\n\nThere is no evidence to support this claim. Snopes, a website that fact-checks Internet rumors, declared it to be false. Politifact, another fact-checking website, gave it a \"Pants on Fire\" rating.\n\nIn Pershing's memoir, \"My Life Before the World War, 1860-1917,\" he wrote of another commanding officer in the Philippines who had at least once buried Muslims \"in the same grave as a dead pig.\" But as Politifact noted, this anecdote does not support Trump's claim -- either the specific story he told, or the idea that it was effective at deterring future attacks.\n\n\"There is no evidence that Pershing himself committed these acts, there is nothing said about the use of 50 bullets dipped in pig's blood, and most important, there is no evidence to support Trump's claim that this tactic was effective in stopping violence -- or that it would provide a useful policy today,\" Politifact said in its story debunking the claim.\n\nMoreover, the idea that all Muslims believe that if they are shot with pigs' blood they would be sent to hell, the foundation of the supposed tactic, is incorrect. Islam forbids its followers from consuming pork, but \"there is no penalty for coming into contact with pork given by the Quran,\" Shannon Dunn, an assistant professor of religious studies at Gonzaga University, told HuffPost.\n\nA spokesperson for the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThursday's attack in Barcelona left at least 13 dead and 80 injured. Authorities have arrested two people. ISIS' media wing, Amaq, issued a statement through social media calling the perpetrators of the attack \"soldiers of the Islamic State.\"\n\nTM & \u00a9 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

The General met with the Moros and read from the Koran with them. Pershing wanted to build bridges.\"\n\nFact-checking website Politifact asked eight historians about the story, and reported: \"Most expressed skepticism that the specific story ever happened, and many added that Trump's takeaway is wrong-headed.\"\n\nThe story has, however, been circulated widely online in the years since 9/11.\n\nWow.\n\nYeah.\n\nOn Tuesday, Donald Trump excused himself from

For some time, there have been rumors that claim Gen. John J. Pershing employed such tactics following the Philippine-American War in order to deter insurgents.\n\nTrump previously referred to this during a February 2016 rally. In the story Trump told at that time, Pershing's forces captured 50 Muslim prisoners. Pershing then, Trump said, \"took 50 bullets, and he dipped them in pigs' blood. And he had his men load his rifles, and he lined up the 50 people, and they shot 49 of those people. And the 50th person, he said, 'You go back to your people, and you tell them what happened.' And for 25 years, there wasn't a problem.\"\n\nClick here to for the latest on Barcelona.\n\nThere is no evidence to support this claim. Snopes, a website that fact-checks Internet rumors, declared it to be false. Politifact, another fact-checking website, gave it a \"Pants on Fire\" rating.\n\nIn Pershing's memoir, \"My Life Before the World War, 1860-1917,\" he wrote of another commanding officer in the Philippines who had at least once buried Muslims \"in the same grave as a dead pig.\" But as Politifact noted, this anecdote does not support Trump's claim -- either the specific story he told, or the idea that it was effective at deterring future attacks.\n\n\"There is no evidence that Pershing himself committed these acts, there is nothing said about the use of 50 bullets dipped in pig's blood, and most important, there is no evidence to support Trump's claim that this tactic was effective in stopping violence -- or that it would provide a useful policy today,\" Politifact said in its story debunking the claim.\n\nMoreover, the idea that all Muslims believe that if they are shot with pigs' blood they would be sent to hell, the foundation of the supposed tactic, is incorrect.

The inflammatory tweet came just hours after a van plowed through a crowd of people in a popular tourist area in Spain, leaving at least 12 people killed and more than 80 injured.\n\nTrump suggested in the tweet that people should study the early 20th century general, John Pershing, and his actions during the US war in the Philippines.\n\n\"Study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught,\" Trump tweeted. \"There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\"\n\nThe president seemed to be referring to a widely debunked myth that Pershing used bullets dipped in pig's blood to kill groups of Muslim insurgents. Another part of the tale is that he buried their bodies with pigs as well. In the Islamic faith, pigs are considered ritually unclean.\n\nThe story, which has been making the rounds online for years, has been widely discredited by historians.\n\nAccording to PolitiFact, \"there is no evidence that Pershing himself committed these acts, there is nothing said about the use of 50 bullets dipped in pig's blood, and most important, there is no evidence to support Trump's claim that this tactic was effective in stopping violence -- or that it would provide a useful policy today.\"\n\nTrump's claim has also been given a \"pants on fire\" rating by Politifact -- one that is given to the \"most ridiculous falsehoods.\"\n\nTrump has previously referred to Pershing during the election campaign in 2016 as well. Last year, his former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski revealed that Trump knew the story was a myth, but decided to tell it at rallies.\n\nThe president's controversial tweet comes amid fierce criticism over his response to the deadly violence at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. After failing to directly condemn neo-Nazis, the KKK and white supremacist groups, Trump said on Tuesday that \"both sides\" are to blame for the violence.\n\n\"Before I make a statement, I like to know the facts\", Trump explained.\n\nTwitter immediately erupted with outrage and disbelief at the president's decision to revive and spread the \"pig's blood\" myth and \"praising war crimes\" in the immediate aftermath of the attack. Many also called for his immediate impeachment.\n\n\"What the actual holy f**k Donnie\", one Twitter user wrote. \"That Pershing story is as false as your tan hun.\"\n\nBig Bang Theory star Mayim Bialik tweeted: \"You are completely disgusting.\"\n\n\"@realDonaldTrump, you embody the worst of us: willful ignorance, no heart, no courage.

Okay? Twenty-five years, there wasn't a problem,\" Trump said.\n\nHistorians have expressed skepticism or outright denial that this event took place.\n\nAccording to the fact checking website Politifact, the late military historian Frank Vandiver said in 2003, referring to Pershing: \"I never found any indication that it was true in extensive research on his Moro experiences. This kind of thing would have run completely against his character.\"\n\nPolitifact quoted four historians who denied the account.\n\nTrump endorsed waterboarding -- widely held now to be a torture technique, used during the George W.

There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\"\n\nWhat is behind the tweet and the criticism? The AP explains:\n\nFILE - In this Nov. 11, 1942, file photo, U.S. Gen. John J. Pershing appears in uniform at Armistice Day ceremonies at Arlington Cemetery in Arlington, Va. President Donald Trump is being criticized for lauding the alleged tactics of Gen. John Pershing in dealing with Islamic extremists in the Philippines. (AP Photo)\n\nPERSHING AND THE PHILIPPINES\n\nGen. John \"Black Jack\" Pershing, who would rise to fame in World War I, was a U.S. Army commander and served as governor of the southern Philippines' mainly Muslim Moro province between 1909 and 1913. His tenure came as the U.S. was consolidating its control over the Philippines, which it had won as a result of the Spanish-American War. Pershing was confronted with a Moro insurgency, which he largely broke in June 1913 in a battle that killed some 500 Moro fighters.\n\nTRUMP AND TACTICS AGAINST TERRORISM\n\nIt's unclear. Trump did not cite any specific tactic employed by Pershing in his tweet on Thursday. But during the presidential campaign, he told a widely discredited story that Pershing had halted Muslim attacks in the Philippines by shooting rebels with bullets dipped in pigs' blood. Pork is taboo for Muslims, but that story has been widely debunked by historians as unsubstantiated or exaggerated. Fact-checking organizations such as Politifact rated Trump's claim as false.\n\nHowever, according to Politifact, Pershing wrote in a memoir that another U.S. commander in the Philippines had at least once \"seen to it\" that Muslim insurgents' bodies were buried in the same grave as a dead pig to serve as a warning to others. \"It was not pleasant to have to take such measures, but the prospect of going to hell instead of heaven sometimes deterred the would-be assassins,\" Pershing wrote.

The AP explains:\n\nPERSHING AND THE PHILIPPINES\n\nSponsored Content: Sign up for a free webinar as DoD, Air Force and VA offer insights on cybersecurity strategies.\n\nGen. John \"Black Jack\" Pershing, who would rise to fame in World War I, was a U.S. Army commander and served as governor of the southern Philippines' mainly Muslim Moro province between 1909 and 1913. His tenure came as the U.S. was consolidating its control over the Philippines, which it had won as a result of the Spanish-American War. Pershing was confronted with a Moro insurgency, which he largely broke in June 1913 in a battle that killed some 500 Moro fighters.\n\nTRUMP AND TACTICS AGAINST TERRORISM\n\nIt's unclear. Trump did not cite any specific tactic employed by Pershing in his tweet on Thursday. But during the presidential campaign, he told a widely discredited story that Pershing had halted Muslim attacks in the Philippines by shooting rebels with bullets dipped in pigs' blood. Pork is taboo for Muslims, but that story has been widely debunked by historians as unsubstantiated or exaggerated. Fact-checking organizations such as Politifact rated Trump's claim as false.\n\nHowever, according to Politifact, Pershing wrote in a memoir that another U.S. commander in the Philippines had at least once \"seen to it\" that Muslim insurgents' bodies were buried in the same grave as a dead pig to serve as a warning to others. \"It was not pleasant to have to take such measures, but the prospect of going to hell instead of heaven sometimes deterred the would-be assassins,\" Pershing wrote. According to Politifact, a footnote to the 2013 edition of the memoir cited another general as telling Pershing in a letter that the practice had long been a custom \"to discourage crazy lunatics.\"\n\nTRUMP TWEETS A DEBUNKED STORY\n\nMany critical commentators believe Trump's tweet revived the specific story about Pershing and the bullets dipped in pigs' blood that he told during the campaign.

Trump said Pershing, in the early 1900's, \"caught 50 terrorists that did tremendous damage and killed many people and he took the 50 terrorists and he took 50 men and he dipped 50 bullets in pig's blood.\"\n\nTrump went out to describe a mass execution shooting of 49 of the prisoners, with the last one being sent to tell the others what happened. It was Trump using this \"story\" to demonstrate that America needed to get tough on terrorism, using brutal methods, and that he would be the man to do it.\n\nBut the story is not true. There was no mass execution led by Pershing. That is a rumor created on the Internet.\n\nWhile the story is unprovable at best, Trump is clearly using the legend to send a message to Islamic terrorists.", "id": "9805991", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "In Response to ISIS Terror Attack, Trump Recommends Dipping Bullets in Pig Blood to Kill Terrorists", "image": "https://cdn1.ijr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/GettyImages-831336062.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "177", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 1, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "151106", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charleston"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "196346", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charleston,_South_Carolina", "label": {"eng": "Charleston"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "196726", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Blood"}, "id": "302514", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}, "id": "303057", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Islamic State of Iraq"}, "id": "303094", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq"}, {"label": {"eng": "Islam"}, "id": "303218", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam"}, {"label": {"eng": "Muslim"}, "id": "303629", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "General officer"}, "id": "304309", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"}, {"label": {"eng": "United States Army"}, "id": "306135", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army"}, {"label": {"eng": "Islamic terrorism"}, "id": "308026", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_terrorism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mass murder"}, "id": "312474", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_murder"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pig"}, "id": "314033", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"}, {"label": {"eng": "Spanish people"}, "id": "319789", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_people"}, {"label": {"eng": "Blood as food"}, "id": "367290", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_as_food"}, {"label": {"eng": "Unclean animal"}, "id": "432579", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unclean_animal"}, {"label": {"eng": "Philippines Campaign (1944\u201345)"}, "id": "434589", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines_Campaign_(1944\u201345)"}, {"label": {"eng": "John J.

For some time, there have been rumors that claim Gen. John J. Pershing employed such tactics following the Philippine-American War in order to deter insurgents.\n\nTrump previously referred to this during a February 2016 rally. In the story Trump told at that time, Pershing's forces captured 50 Muslim prisoners. Pershing then, Trump said, \"took 50 bullets, and he dipped them in pigs' blood. And he had his men load his rifles, and he lined up the 50 people, and they shot 49 of those people. And the 50th person, he said, 'You go back to your people, and you tell them what happened.' And for 25 years, there wasn't a problem.\"\n\nThere is no evidence to support this claim. Snopes, a website that fact-checks Internet rumors, declared it to be false. Politifact, another fact-checking website, gave it a \"Pants on Fire\" rating.\n\nIn Pershing's memoir, \"My Life Before the World War, 1860-1917,\" he wrote of another commanding officer in the Philippines who had at least once buried Muslims \"in the same grave as a dead pig.\" But as Politifact noted, this anecdote does not support Trump's claim -- either the specific story he told, or the idea that it was effective at deterring future attacks.\n\n\"There is no evidence that Pershing himself committed these acts, there is nothing said about the use of 50 bullets dipped in pig's blood, and most important, there is no evidence to support Trump's claim that this tactic was effective in stopping violence -- or that it would provide a useful policy today,\" Politifact said in its story debunking the claim.\n\nMoreover, the idea that all Muslims believe that if they are shot with pigs' blood they would be sent to hell, the foundation of the supposed tactic, is incorrect. Islam forbids its followers from consuming pork, but \"there is no penalty for coming into contact with pork given by the Quran,\" Shannon Dunn, an assistant professor of religious studies at Gonzaga University, told HuffPost.\n\nA spokesperson for the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThursday's attack in Barcelona left at least 13 dead and 80 injured. Authorities have arrested two people. ISIS' media wing, Amaq, issued a statement through social media calling the perpetrators of the attack \"soldiers of the Islamic State.\"", "id": "9774182", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Trump responds to Barcelona terror attack by spreading debunked rumor", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170817152622-trump-general-john-pershing-540x304.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 539, "date": "2016-02-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 552}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "177", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Blood"}, "id": "302514", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Internet"}, "id": "302869", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"}, {"label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}, "id": "303057", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Islam"}, "id": "303218", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam"}, {"label": {"eng": "Muslim"}, "id": "303629", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim"}, {"label": {"eng": "Website"}, "id": "303975", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website"}, {"label": {"eng": "Commanding officer"}, "id": "305560", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commanding_officer"}, {"label": {"eng": "Professor"}, "id": "305881", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor"}, {"label": {"eng": "White House Press Secretary"}, "id": "308023", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Press_Secretary"}, {"label": {"eng": "Quran"}, "id": "308054", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quran"}, {"label": {"eng": "The Huffington Post"}, "id": "308691", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Huffington_Post"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pork"}, "id": "309547", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pork"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pig"}, "id": "314033", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"}, {"label": {"eng": "Anecdote"}, "id": "316528", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anecdote"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hell"}, "id": "322353", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell"}, {"label": {"eng": "PolitiFact.com"}, "id": "323532", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PolitiFact.com"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fact checker"}, "id": "323533", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact_checker"}, {"label": {"eng": "Snopes.com"}, "id": "347247", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snopes.com"}, {"label": {"eng": "Gonzaga University"}, "id": "351748", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonzaga_University"}, {"label": {"eng": "Debunker"}, "id": "386163", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debunker"}, {"label": {"eng": "Religious studies"}, "id": "445232", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_studies"}, {"label": {"eng": "John J.

That claim about Pershing appears to be false, according to historians. However, the general did use other tactics to dissuade Muslim insurgents.

And that is precisely why he won't stop calling the news fake: He crumbles when he's called out. Today, not even a week after his failure to condemn neo-Nazi extremism, Trump posted an aggressive tweet citing an act allegedly carried out by an American general, which allegedly stopped Islamic extremist terrorism for 25 years. This tweet not only left many people disgusted, as it seems to encourage violence, but also left a lot of people with one burning question: Who is General Pershing?\n\nTrump's fixation on General John Pershing began during his candidacy, at a rally in South Carolina. He begins talking about Pershing to the crowd -- but not before almost shockingly coaxing them, as if he's the host of a daytime game show. He calls, \"Should I tell you? Or should I not?\" And the crowd responds with cheers.\n\nTrump admits early on in the speech that his story isn't exactly cited. He tells the crowd, \"This is something you can read in the history books. Not a lot of history books, because they don't like teaching it.\" Then he tells the story of General Pershing, who according to Trump, once rounded up 50 terrorists, and shot them all -- except one -- with bullets dipped in pig's blood. Instead of killing the last terrorist, he told him to go back to where he was from and explain what he had just witnessed, and that because of that, there was no terrorism in the country for 25 years.\n\nTrump's story is met with audible applause from the crowd, along with a final warning from Trump. \"So we better start getting tough and we better start getting vigilant and using our heads,\" he said. \"Or we're not going to have a country, folks.\"\n\nSo, Who Is General Pershing?\n\nStudy what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught. There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\n\n-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 17, 2017\n\nTrump brought up General Pershing again today, when he tweeted,\n\nStudy what General Pershing of the United states did to terrorists when caught. There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\n\nGeneral Pershing was, in fact, a real American general who was a senior Army officer, according to Wikipedia. He served as the commander of the American Expeditionary Force on the Western Front during WWI from 1917-1918. And also fought in Spanish-American war, particularly, in the Philippines, where this pig's blood tale is said to have taken place. However, according to Snopes, which did a full fact-check analysis of this story, there is no mention of General Pershing killing large amounts of terrorists with pig's blood with no remorse in order to prove a point about terrorism.\n\nIn fact, there is documentation that proves Pershing felt some remorse at what went down in the Philippines, particularly when he recalled his solders having to kill soldiers of the opposing side when they refused to turn over their weapons. The letter, written by Pershing according to Snopes, revealed the following:\n\nI write you this letter because I am sorry to know that you and your people refuse to do what the government has ordered. You do not give up your arms. Soldiers were sent to Taglibi so that you could come into camp and turn in your guns. When the soldiers went to camp a Taglibi, your Moros fired into camp and tried to kill the soldiers. Then the soldiers had to shoot all Moros who fired upon them.\n\nWhen the soldiers marched through the country, the Moros again shot at them, so the soldiers had to kill several others. I am sorry the soldiers had to kill any Moros. All Moros are the same to me as my children and no father wants to kill his own children ...\n\nThis letter reveals a far different man than the one Trump paints Pershing to be. Of course, a military leader could have many sides of him and many points of strength and weakness throughout his time leading troops in war, but the problem is, multiple news outlets report there being absolutely no evidence of Trump's pig's blood tall tale.\n\nSnopes even goes as far to suggest that Pershing was clear on his intent to avoid \"radical religious fanaticism\" in his enemies in Pershing's own published recounts of what happened.\n\nWhy Is This Tweet Problematic?\n\nThe United States condemns the terror attack in Barcelona, Spain, and will do whatever is necessary to help. Be tough & strong, we love you!\n\n-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 17, 2017\n\nTrump brought up his believed tale of Pershing a few hours after a car plowed into pedestrians on a street in Barcelona, Spain. Like he has done so many times before, Trump used a moment when Americans and European countries around the world are hurting and frightened in the face of terrorism, and suggested a brutal solution (like the one he believed Pershing supplied) to Islamic extremist groups.\n\nA president who cites his own history books, and never waits until he hears all sides of the story -- unless he's looking for a reason to go easy on Nazi hate groups -- is making decisions about how to handle ISIS. It's time to stop making excuses for Donald Trump and start calling out the seriousness of his claims and the potential danger they can have for Americans and people around the world.\n\nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge, for more stories you don't want to miss.", "id": "9830219", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Trump's Tweet About General Pershing Is Not Only Alarming, It Can't Be Proved", "image": "https://i.elitestatic.com/content/uploads/2017/07/31221658/donald-trump-wrote-statement-son.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 2124, "freq": 2, "date": "2017-08-17", "amb": false, "textEnd": 2139}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "177", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "151106", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "196726", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nazism"}, "id": "302813", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "Violence"}, "id": "302966", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence"}, {"label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}, "id": "303057", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Islam"}, "id": "303218", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam"}, {"label": {"eng": "Extremism"}, "id": "303321", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremism"}, {"label": {"eng": "World War II"}, "id": "303819", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II"}, {"label": {"eng": "General officer"}, "id": "304309", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"}, {"label": {"eng": "Military"}, "id": "304332", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military"}, {"label": {"eng": "Officer (armed forces)"}, "id": "304952", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Officer_(armed_forces)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}, "id": "305262", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism"}, {"label": {"eng": "United States Army"}, "id": "306135", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tweet (singer)"}, "id": "306536", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweet_(singer)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Islamic terrorism"}, "id": "308026", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_terrorism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Today (U.S. TV program)"}, "id": "313593", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Today_(U.S._TV_program)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pig"}, "id": "314033", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fact checker"}, "id": "323533", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact_checker"}, {"label": {"eng": "Snopes.com"}, "id": "347247", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snopes.com"}, {"label": {"eng": "Moro people"}, "id": "350264", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moro_people"}, {"label": {"eng": "Game show"}, "id": "362147", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_show"}, {"label": {"eng": "Western Front (World War I)"}, "id": "405177", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Front_(World_War_I)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tall tale"}, "id": "422273", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tall_tale"}, {"label": {"eng": "Religious fanaticism"}, "id": "474310", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_fanaticism"}, {"label": {"eng": "John J.

About an hour later, Trump tweeted: \"Study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught. There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\"\n\nStudy what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught. There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\n\n-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 17, 2017\n\nHe was referring to General John \"Black Jack\" Pershing who was the US governor of largely Muslim Moro province from 1909 to 1913. At the time, the Philippines was a US colony. And Pershing's forces had to fight Muslim counter-insurgencies.\n\nThe debunked account -- which Trump has referred to in the past -- is as follows: Pershing's forces rounded up 50 Muslim insurgents and executed 49 of them with bullets dipped in pig's blood -- considered by Muslims to be unholy.\n\n\"You heard that, right?\" Trump said as a candidate during a rally in February 2016 in South Carolina, alluding to the pig blood part. \"They were having terrorism problems, just like we do,\" Trump said.\n\nFile image of US president Donald Trump. AP\n\nAs the story goes, the 50th prisoner was released to tell his fellow fighters about what the Americans had done. \"And for 25 years, there wasn't a problem. Okay? Twenty-five years, there wasn't a problem,\" Trump said.\n\nHistorians have expressed skepticism or outright denial that this event took place.\n\nAccording to the fact checking website Politifact, the late military historian Frank Vandiver said in 2003, referring to Pershing: \"I never found any indication that it was true in extensive research on his Moro experiences. This kind of thing would have run completely against his character.\" Politifact quoted four historians who denied the account.\n\nTrump endorsed waterboarding -- widely held now to be a torture technique, used during the George W Bush administration in its war on terror and halted by Barack Obama -- during the presidential campaign.\n\nOnce in office, however, after US generals advised him against reverting to waterboarding, with some saying torture simply did not work as a way to extract information, Trump said he would yield to them. And he stopped making public endorsements of the technique.\n\nPublished Date: Aug 18, 2017 07:18 am | Updated Date: Aug 18, 2017 07:18 am\n\nTags :#Barcelona terror attack#Donald trump#General pershing#Islamist extremists#Mass execution#Newstracker#Philippines", "id": "9809619", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "After Barcelona terror attack, Donald Trump hints at support for mass executions of Islamist extremists", "image": "http://s2.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Donald-Trump-fists_AP.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 1005, "date": "2017-08-17", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1020}, {"textStart": 2886, "freq": 2, "date": "2017-08-18", "amb": false, "textEnd": 2898}, {"textStart": 1563, "date": "2016-02-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1576}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "67", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "177", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "151106", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "196726", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}, "id": "302950", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama"}, {"label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}, "id": "303057", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Islam"}, "id": "303218", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam"}, {"label": {"eng": "Muslim"}, "id": "303629", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim"}, {"label": {"eng": "Capital punishment"}, "id": "304224", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "General officer"}, "id": "304309", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"}, {"label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}, "id": "304754", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press"}, {"label": {"eng": "Torture"}, "id": "304940", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture"}, {"label": {"eng": "Prisoner of war"}, "id": "304958", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner_of_war"}, {"label": {"eng": "George W.

And the 50th person, he said, 'You go back to your people and you tell them what happened.'\"\n\nHe added: \"And for 25 years there wasn't a problem\" although he seems to have revised that figure up to 35 years.\n\nAfter the original claims, Time magazine spoke to two historians who found no evidence to support the claim with Snopes, a myth-busting site, coming to the same conclusion.\n\nHowever, the Time investigation references the History News Network which discovered a Chicago Daily Tribune article from 1927 describes Pershing sprinkling prisoners with pig's blood, then setting them free.\n\nAlso, Shannon Dunn, assistant professor of religious studies at Gonzaga University, told HuffPost the idea that Muslims believed they would go to hell if shot with pigs' blood, the reason behind the supposed tactic, was false.\n\nOther leaders however lent their support and solidarity to Spain. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said \"will never defeat a United people who love freedom from barbarism\" and added he was travelling to Barcelona to coordinate security efforts.\n\n\"Maximum coordination to arrest the attackers, reinforce security and attend to all those affected,\" he said.\n\nUK Prime Minister Theresa May said in a statement that she was \"sickened by the senseless loss of life in Barcelona\" and that the Foreign Office was trying to establish if any British nationals were injured in the attack.\n\nFrench president Emmanuel Macron also expressed his condolences with Spain and said both countries were \"united and determined\" after the \"tragic attack\".", "id": "9795521", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Trump responds to Barcelona terror attack by

It's a rumor that multiple media outlets, Fox News included, are pointing out has no evidence supporting it.\n\nTrump definitively referred to that rumor during the presidential campaign, telling the audience at a rally that Pershing's forces lined up 50 Muslim prisoners, shot 49 of them with pig's-blood-dipped bullets, and told the last person, \"'You go back to your people, and you tell them what happened.' And for 25 years, there wasn't a problem.\" But both Snopes and Politifact have deemed this rumor to be false. Pershing did write about another commanding officer in the war who supposedly buried Muslims with pigs, but, per Politifact: \"There is no evidence that Pershing himself committed these acts ... and most important, there is no evidence to support Trump's claim that this tactic was effective in stopping violence.\" Not to mention, as a religious expert told Huffington Post in 2013, there is no penalty in Islam for simply coming into contact with pork products.", "id": "9804921", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Trump Spreads False Pig Blood Rumor After Barcelona Attack", "image": "http://img2-azcdn.newser.com/image/1137897-12-20170817194942.jpeg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "67", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "151106", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Blood"}, "id": "302514", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fox News Channel"}, "id": "302938", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News_Channel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}, "id": "303057", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Islam"}, "id": "303218", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam"}, {"label": {"eng": "Muslim"}, "id": "303629", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cnn.com"}, "id": "304269", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN"}, {"label": {"eng": "News media"}, "id": "304391", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_media"}, {"label": {"eng": "Commanding officer"}, "id": "305560", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commanding_officer"}, {"label": {"eng": "Newser"}, "id": "313410", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newser"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pig"}, "id": "314033", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"}, {"label": {"eng": "PolitiFact.com"}, "id": "323532", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PolitiFact.com"}, {"label": {"eng": "Insurgency"}, "id": "344694", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurgency"}, {"label": {"eng": "Snopes.com"}, "id": "347247", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snopes.com"}, {"label": {"eng": "Debunker"}, "id": "386163", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debunker"}, {"label": {"eng": "John J.

His time there was marked by anti-American insurgencies. (The Philippines were a US colony during the first half of the 20th century.)\n\nThough he did not elaborate Thursday, in February 2016 at a campaign rally in South Carolina Trump made detailed -- but false -- claims about how Pershing dealt with the rebels.\n\n\"They were having terrorism problems, just like we do,\" Trump said, according to the Washington Post. \"And he caught 50 terrorists who did tremendous damage and killed many people. And he took the 50 terrorists, and he took 50 men and he dipped 50 bullets in pigs' blood -- you heard that, right? He took 50 bullets, and he dipped them in pigs' blood. And he had his men load his rifles, and he lined up the 50 people, and they shot 49 of those people. And the 50th person, he said: You go back to your people, and you tell them what happened. And for 25 years, there wasn't a problem. OK? Twenty-five years, there wasn't a problem.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter that rally, fact-checking sites Politifact and Snopes both found no basis to the story.\n\nAs Politifact put it in February 2016, \"After Trump told this story, critics called it apocryphal, misleading or outright false. Our friends at Snopes.com considered the evidence and called it a 'legend.' We decided to check with historians of the period to see what they thought of the story. We heard back from eight scholars. Most expressed skepticism that the specific story ever happened, and many added that Trump's takeaway is wrong-headed.\"\n\nThe Post reported that other versions of the Pershing tale say the executed prisoners were buried with dead pigs. Exposing Muslims to pigs and foods made from pigs is a popular idea with Islamophobes, based on the Islamic teaching that pigs are impure.\n\nBut aside from being false, the actions supposedly taken by Pershing are not even effective.\n\nAs Haroon Moghul put it in the Guardian after Trump's speech last year, \"What is it with bigots and bacon?\"\n\nTrump's false story about Pershing echoes a subset of hate crimes against Muslims in the United States in recent years. Moghul cited a number of incidents commtted by people who \"apparently believe that the sight of porcine products is kryptonite to Muslims.\"\n\nAmong them: \"A pig's head was thrown at a Philadelphia mosque in December. Bacon was found wrapped around the handles of mosque doors in Oklahoma last April and Las Vegas in December and on the doorstep of an Orlando mosque in January.\"\n\nMoghul ridiculed the idea that Muslims are terrified of pigs. \"Just put pork anywhere near us Muslims, some people seem to believe, and we'll soon keel over in psycho-spiritual distress.\"\n\n\"Republicans might like to say that guns don't kill people, people kill people -- but pig's blood doesn't kill Muslims or send us straight to hell, as some bigots reportedly believe,\" Moghul wrote. \"Telling a story about dipping bullets in pig's blood before killing 49 Muslims with impunity is particularly offensive, not least because the summary execution of so many people is a footnote to a story that traffics in crude stereotypes about our dietary restrictions. (It's not hard to imagine the deserved outcry if the victims were adherents of another major religion who eschew pork -- Jews.)\"\n\nBrian J.

Pershing's treatment of Muslims prisoners that historians say probably never happened Colleen Shalby\n\nHours after a van plowed through a crowd in Barcelona and left at least 12 dead, Donald Trump tweeted condemnation of the attack and quickly followed with a statement about U.S. Army Gen. John Joseph Pershing that historians describe as urban legend.\n\n\"Study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught. There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\" he tweeted.\n\nThe full claim, which Trump repeated several times during his 2016 presidential campaign, is that in the aftermath of the Philippine-American War of 1899-1902, Pershing had his men dip 50 bullets in pig's blood and use them to kill 49 Muslim prisoners. The survivor was told to relay the experience to others.\n\nThe story claims that terrorism decreased for decades.\n\nIf true, the story would constitute a war crime under U.S. law, which prohibits execution of prisoners.\n\nThe tale has circulated across the Internet for years. Trump told it in February 2016 during a speech to supporters in North Charleston, S.C., in which he lauded the benefits of heavy-handed interrogation techniques.\n\n\"He took 50 bullets, and he dipped them in pigs' blood. And he had his men load his rifles, and he lined up the 50 people, and they shot 49 of those people. And the 50th person, he said: 'You go back to your people, and you tell them what happened.' And for 25 years, there wasn't a problem. Okay? Twenty-five years, there wasn't a problem,\" Trump told the crowd.\n\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) denounced those remarks shortly after.\n\n\"Donald Trump's inflammatory rhetoric has crossed the line from spreading hatred to inciting violence,\" national executive director of CAIR Nihad Awad said.\n\nTwo months later during a speech that criticized President Obama's acceptance of Middle Eastern war refugees into the U.S., Trump told the same story to supporters in Costa Mesa. This time, he altered the number of problem-free years from 25 to 42.\n\nIn a 2013 edition of Pershing's memoir, a letter from Maj. Gen. J. Franklin Bell to Pershing was added in the footnote. The letter described a long \"custom to bury (insurgents) with pigs when they kill Americans.\" Bell called the tactic \"a good plan.\"\n\nThe letter does indicate that pig blood was at one time used, or at the very least discussed, as an intimidation tactic against Muslim fighters, since Islam considers pigs unclean.\n\nBut there's no evidence that Pershing - who historians describe as less brutal than his predecessors - ever used such a technique.\n\n\"This story is a fabrication and has long been discredited,\" Brian McAllister Linn, a Texas A&M University historian, told Politifact. \"I am amazed it is still making the rounds.\"\n\nEven if the story about Pershing were true, the claim of 25, 35 or 42 years of peace and quiet would be false. Unrest continued long after the war, and the Philippines continues to have an active Muslim-based insurgency.\n\nLatest updates Copyright \u00a9 2017, Los Angeles Times", "id": "9777878", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Trump repeats claim about Gen.

Veracity aside, it remains a favorite of President Trump's, and he referenced it again in a tweet on Thursday, following an apparent terrorist attack in Barcelona:\n\nTrump further fleshed out his take on the unfounded Pershing claims (and, by extension, the example he would like his 36.1 million Twitter followers to act on) in February 2016, when he used the story as a means of justifying his support of waterboarding. Pershing, as Trump told a South Carolina rally, was a \"rough guy, rough guy\" fighting terrorism in the early 1900s. Here's how he described his understanding of the story, according to the Washington Post:\n\n\"They were having terrorism problems, just like we do,\" Trump said. \"And he caught 50 terrorists who did tremendous damage and killed many people.

And he had his men load his rifles, and he lined up the 50 people, and they shot 49 of those people. And the 50th person, he said: You go back to your people, and you tell them what happened. And for 25 years, there wasn't a problem. Okay? Twenty-five years, there wasn't a problem.\"\n\nThe then-candidate's \"suggestion that executing Islamic terrorists using bullets soaked in pigs blood would be sign of toughness\" was met with \"astonishment from members of the American Muslim community\" back in February of last year, according to the New York Times.\n\n\"Donald Trump's inflammatory rhetoric has crossed the line from spreading hatred to inciting violence,\" Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said at the time. \"By directly stating that the only way to stop terrorism is to murder Muslims in graphic and religiously-offensive ways, he places the millions of innocent, law-abiding citizens in the American Muslim community at risk from rogue vigilantes.\"\n\nTrump is no longer just a candidate, and that line between spreading hatred and inciting violence has been crossed many times over. The story in question, however, remains unfounded.\n\n\"This story is a fabrication and has long been discredited,\" Brian McAllister Linn, a Texas A&M University historian and author of Guardians of Empire: The U.S. Army and the Pacific, 1902-1940, told Politifact. \"This kind of thing would have run completely against [Pershing's] character,\" Christopher Einolf, another professor and the literal author of a book called America in the Philippines, 1899-1902: The First Torture Scandal, told Politifact.\n\n\"Even if the tale is true, the pacifying effect that Trump claims is nonsense,\" a third historian told Politifact. The region \"remained in constant unrest during the period of American rule and into the period of independence, right down to the present.\"\n\nPershing Square, which was first dedicated for use under a different name in 1866, was formally renamed in honor of the World War I general in November 1918.", "id": "9792215", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Trump Makes Terrible,

Trump was criticised when he repeated the tale during the campaign in defence of his support for methods of torture, such as waterboarding, on terrorist suspects.\n\nIn numerous reactions to Trump's tweet, many people noted that while the rest of the world mourned the victims of the terrorist attack, the US president referred to a lie that glorified the execution of Muslim prisoners.\n\nSome people also noted that Trump quickly identified the Barcelona incident as terrorism, saying he was much slower to do the same after a car-ramming against counter-demonstrators at a Virginia white supremacist rally on Saturday that killed one woman.", "id": "9814533", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Trump revives 'pigs blood' myth with tweet", "image": "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=www.heraldsun.com.au&#038;blog=87782236&#038;post=2903315&#038;subd=heraldsunatnewscorpau&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "177", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "151106", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Internet"}, "id": "302869", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}, "id": "303057", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Islam"}, "id": "303218", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam"}, {"label": {"eng": "Religion"}, "id": "303332", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion"}, {"label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}, "id": "303517", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces"}, {"label": {"eng": "Muslim"}, "id": "303629", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim"}, {"label": {"eng": "La Rambla, Barcelona"}, "id": "303748", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Rambla,_Barcelona"}, {"label": {"eng": "Capital punishment"}, "id": "304224", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "General officer"}, "id": "304309", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"}, {"label": {"eng": "Afterlife"}, "id": "304366", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afterlife"}, {"label": {"eng": "Torture"}, "id": "304940", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pork"}, "id": "309547", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pork"}, {"label": {"eng": "World War I"}, "id": "309993", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I"}, {"label": {"eng": "United States presidential election, 2000"}, "id": "310089", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2000"}, {"label": {"eng": "War on Terror"}, "id": "310769", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Terror"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pig"}, "id": "314033", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"}, {"label": {"eng": "Waterboarding"}, "id": "342942", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterboarding"}, {"label": {"eng": "Blood as food"}, "id": "367290", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_as_food"}, {"label": {"eng": "John J.

In a follow-up message Trump wrote, \"Study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught. There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\"\n\nAs Politifact noted, this isn't the first time Trump has referenced Pershing, who served as governor of Moro Province, a majority-Muslim area in the Philippines, following the Philippine-American War of 1899-1902.\n\n\"They were having terrorism problems, just like we do,\" Trump said during a rally in South Carolina in 2016, according to the Washington Post. Trump went on to add,\n\nAnd he caught 50 terrorists who did tremendous damage and killed many people. And he took the 50 terrorists, and he took 50 men and he dipped 50 bullets in pigs' blood -- you heard that, right? He took 50 bullets, and he dipped them in pigs' blood. And he had his men load his rifles, and he lined up the 50 people, and they shot 49 of those people. And the 50th person, he said: You go back to your people, and you tell them what happened. And for 25 years, there wasn't a problem. Okay? Twenty-five years, there wasn't a problem.\n\nIn his most recent tweet, that gap changed to 35 years.\n\nHowever, according to the history books, Pershing never dipped bullets in pigs blood or let the fiftieth person go, or really did any of the things Trump claimed.\n\nOff the bat, his biggest blunder in this tweet is equivocating the Muslim faith with terrorists.\n\n\"The Moros were fighting for a lot of reasons, not just because they were Muslims,\" Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University, told Politifact. \"This is another fact that gets lost in many modern discussions of terrorism.\"\n\nAdditionally, several historians noted that the events Trump described flat out never happened.\n\n\"This story is a fabrication and has long been discredited,\" Brian McAllister Linn, a Texas A&M University historian and author of Guardians of Empire: The U.S. Army and the Pacific, 1902-1940, told Politifact. \"I am amazed it is still making the rounds.\"\n\nMoreover, Frank E. Vandiver, professor of history at Texas A&M University and author of Black Jack: The Life and Times of John J. Pershing, told About.com that not only was the story untrue, it would have also \"run completely against his character.\"\n\n\"I never found any indication that it was true in extensive research on his Moro experiences,\" Vandiver said.\n\nInstead, Janda explained to Politifact that Pershing did a lot of \"what we would call 'winning hearts and minds' and embraced reforms which helped end their resistance.\"\n\n\"He fought too, but only when he had to, and only against tribes or bands that just wouldn't negotiate with him,\" Janda added. \"He wasn't solely committed to fighting as people like Trump who tell the pig blood story imply.\"\n\nHistorian after historian and expert after expert warned that not only was Trump completely off base with his versions of events (otherwise known as \"fake news\"), he's also off in believing that his made up version of pacifying insurgents would work.\n\n\"Where Trump's remark becomes ridiculous is in the idea that this actually worked,\" David J. Silbey, a Cornell University historian and author of A War of Frontier and Empire: The Philippine-American War, told Politifact. \"The Moro War did not end until 1913, and even that's a bit of a soft date, with violence continuing for quite a while afterward.

There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\"\n\nThe anecdote he is referring to is understood to be a myth about how General John Pershing executed dozens of Muslim terrorists in the Philippines with tainted ammunition during a guerrilla war in the early 1900s.\n\nThe story is understood to be a hoax spread by emails with no evidence it really occurred, according to rumour tracker Snopes.\n\nIt's not the first time Trump has made reference to the Pershing tale - according to MSNBC he told the story in South Carolina ahead of the state's Republican presidential primary in February 2016.\n\nHe said: \"He took fifty bullets, and he dipped them in pig's blood.\n\n\"And he had his men load his rifles and he lined up the fifty people, and they shot 49 of those people.\n\n\"And the fiftieth person he said 'You go back to your people and you tell them what happened.' And for 25 years there wasn't a problem, okay?\"\n\nTrump, getting to the \"moral\" of the story, concluded: \"We better start getting tough and we better start getting vigilant, and we better start using our heads or we're not gonna have a country, folks.\"\n\nThe tweet came after Trump said he wanted \"the facts\" before commenting on the Charlottesville violence that saw one woman killed while counter-protesting a white supremacist rally.\n\nBut social media users were quick to point out that the president had been promoting a \"lie\".\n\nPaula tweeted Trump directly: \"You are spreading a lie about a horrible, fictional account of history.\"\n\nAnother user said: \"So Trump yet again reveals that he thinks war crimes are acceptable\".\n\nDemocrat Ted Lieu said: \"@realDonaldTrump endorsing mass murder in his Pershing tweet is just to distract from negative stories about him endorsing Nazis.\"\n\nPresenter Jake Tapper tweeted: \"President Trump tells world to study lie about General Pershing\".\n\nAt least 13 people died and more than 100 people were injured in Barcelona on Thursday, making it the deadliest attack in Spain since the 2004 Madrid train bombs in which more than 190 people were killed.\n\nSince Trump's tweets, five terrorists were shot dead by police in the nearby seaside town of Cambrils in a second attack in Spain.\n\nThe men, wearing fake suicide vests, ploughed into pedestrians in an Audi A3, killing one woman and injuring five civilians including a police officer.\n\nIt came eight hours after a van hurtled through crowds in Las Ramblas, sending scores of people scattering, in an attack which was later claimed by ISIS.\n\nThree people have been arrested in connection with the attacks.\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May said she was \"sickened\" by the incident, while the Foreign Office said it was still trying to determine if there were British victims.", "id": "9893898", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Disgust as

Bush administration in its war on terror and halted by Barack Obama - during the presidential campaign.\n\nOnce in office, however, after US generals advised him against reverting to waterboarding, with some saying torture simply did not work as a way to extract information, Trump said he would yield to them.\n\nAnd he stopped making public endorsements of the technique. --AFP", "id": "9805990", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Trump again cites dubious Muslim execution story after Spain attack", "image": "https://assets.nst.com.my/images/articles/189JSTrump_field_image_socialmedia.var_1503010583.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 1366, "date": "2016-02-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1379}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "67", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "177", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "151106", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "196726", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}, "id": "302950", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama"}, {"label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}, "id": "303057", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Islam"}, "id": "303218", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam"}, {"label": {"eng": "Muslim"}, "id": "303629", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim"}, {"label": {"eng": "Capital punishment"}, "id": "304224", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "General officer"}, "id": "304309", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"}, {"label": {"eng": "Torture"}, "id": "304940", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture"}, {"label": {"eng": "Prisoner of war"}, "id": "304958", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner_of_war"}, {"label": {"eng": "Islamic terrorism"}, "id": "308026", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_terrorism"}, {"label": {"eng": "War on Terror"}, "id": "310769", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Terror"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pig"}, "id": "314033", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"}, {"label": {"eng": "PolitiFact.com"}, "id": "323532", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PolitiFact.com"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fact checker"}, "id": "323533", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact_checker"}, {"label": {"eng": "Waterboarding"}, "id": "342942", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterboarding"}, {"label": {"eng": "Military history"}, "id": "377128", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_history"}, {"label": {"eng": "George W.

One suspect is already in custody.\n\nIt's against this backdrop that Donald Trump, who says he always wants to have all the \"facts\" before speaking on any subject, thought it'd be appropriate to highlight one of his favorite stories.\n\n\"Study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught. There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\"\n\nFor those who followed Trump's presidential campaign closely, this is familiar rhetoric. The Republican candidate loved to rile up far-right voters by telling them a myth about General John Pershing. Here, for example, is a Washington Post report from June 2016, following a Trump event in South Carolina.\n\nAs the crowd cheered him on, Trump told them about Pershing - \"rough guy, rough guy\" - who was fighting terrorism in the early 1900s. Trump didn't say where this happened, but variations of this story online usually state that it happened in the Philippines during the Philippine-American War - part of the island nation's protracted battle for independence - early in Pershing's career.\n\n\"They were having terrorism problems, just like we do,\" Trump said. \"And he caught 50 terrorists who did tremendous damage and killed many people. And he took the 50 terrorists, and he took 50 men and he dipped 50 bullets in pigs' blood - you heard that, right? He took 50 bullets, and he dipped them in pigs' blood. And he had his men load his rifles, and he lined up the 50 people, and they shot 49 of those people. And the 50th person, he said: You go back to your people, and you tell them what happened. And for 25 years, there wasn't a problem. Okay? Twenty-five years, there wasn't a problem.\"\n\nThe more Trump told the story, the more he'd change the details of the myth - in several instances, he said Pershing's solution stopped terrorism for 42 years, or 35 years, or sometimes 25 years - but ultimately, it doesn't much matter.\n\nBecause the myth isn't real.\n\nAs MSNBC reported in February 2016, the Pershing story \"appears to be a hoax spread via email forwards.\" There's no evidence to back the apocryphal tale up, and according to experts in the Philippine conflict, the myth doesn't even make sense.\n\nBut Trump continues to repeat and believe the myth, in part because of his anti-Muslim animus, in part because he's fond of easy solutions to difficult problems, and in part because he long ago gave up on caring about the difference between fact and fiction. The president likes the hoax; therefore, the hoax must be real.\n\nEven if we put aside Trump's strained relationship with reality, let's not lose sight of the underlying point the president is eager to emphasize: in his mind, war crimes and mass executions are effective and worthwhile elements of an effective national security strategy.\n\nHe's dangerously wrong.", "id": "9771937", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Trump points to ahistorical nonsense following deadly terrorism", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/gettyimages-534551222.jpg?itok=0DwJR5Uh", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 853, "date": "2016-06-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 862}, {"textStart": 2188, "date": "2016-02-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 2201}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "177", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "151106", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "196726", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Email"}, "id": "302685", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}, "id": "302944", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}, "id": "303057", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Islam"}, "id": "303218", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam"}, {"label": {"eng": "Spanish language"}, "id": "303577", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language"}, {"label": {"eng": "Muslim"}, "id": "303629", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fiction"}, "id": "303827", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiction"}, {"label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}, "id": "303910", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}, "id": "304270", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post"}, {"label": {"eng": "General officer"}, "id": "304309", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rhetoric"}, "id": "304537", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric"}, {"label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}, "id": "306254", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pedestrian zone"}, "id": "311218", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedestrian_zone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mythology"}, "id": "321787", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythology"}, {"label": {"eng": "Island country"}, "id": "323231", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_country"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hoax"}, "id": "343592", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoax"}, {"label": {"eng": "Urban legend"}, "id": "349870", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_legend"}, {"label": {"eng": "John J.

From his presidential campaign trail, to his Twitter page, and everything in between, Trump isn't exactly renowned for his well thought-out insight and words of wisdom. He's been criticized for his response to numerous current events, both in the United States and around the world. And now, following a terror attack in Barcelona, Trump has once again taken to Twitter to express some rather controversial thoughts. So, who is Gen. John Pershing and why does Trump want Americans to study up on his tactics?\n\nWell, if you look further into history, you'll see that the president implied that he wants to fight terrorism using a debunked myth involving -- wait for it -- pig's blood.\n\nAfter sending off one particularly uncharacteristic tweet regarding the terrorist attack in Barcelona, in which the POTUS sounded sincere in his remorse, Trump then decided to crank things up a notch. by recalling a statement he made on his campaign trail: \"Study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught,\" Trump tweeted on Thursday. \"There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\"\n\nNot long after this claim hit people's news feeds, it was quickly fact-checked and found to be untrue by historians. But, that doesn't mean it isn't cause for concern. Why? Well, the method Trump is referring to involves killing Muslim prisoners with pig's blood, and is totally false.\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, Trump first delivered remarks about Pershing during a 2016 campaign rally in Charleston. Here is the tale he told:\n\nHistorically speaking, there is very little about Trump's story that is true. One historian, Brian McAllister Linn, who works at Texas A&M University, even said that \"This story is a fabrication and has long been discredited. I am amazed it is still making the rounds,\" according to PolitiFact.\n\nOn the contrary, historians have said that Pershing wasn't as violent as Trump made him out to be. \"He wasn't solely committed to fighting as people like Trump who tell the pig blood story imply,\" Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University, said, per Politifact. And even if Trump's remarks were true (although, according to The Hill, his own campaign manager knows that they aren't), it wouldn't really matter.\n\nUsing Islamophobia tactics to attack an entire culture is not OK. And considering that Pershing died in 1948, using similar strategies nearly 70 years later probably isn't the best idea either.", "id": "9806022", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Who Is General Pershing?

At least that was what he told reporters after he didn't make a statement on an attack against counter-protesters at a pro-white rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, for two days.\n\nBut he may want to double-check the claim he made about United States Army Gen. John J. Pershing on Twitter on Thursday afternoon, hours after a terrorist attack in Spain.\n\nTrump plugged Pershing's supposed actions against Islamic terrorists during the Philippine-American War.\n\nIt wasn't the first time Trump referenced Pershing. He went into further detail about the general in February 2016, telling a South Carolina rally crowd:\n\n\"He took 50 bullets and dipped them in pig's blood. And he had his men load his rifles, and he lined up the 50 people, and they shot 49 of those people, and the 50th person -- he said, 'You go back to your people and you tell them what happened.'\n\n\"And for 25 years, there wasn't a problem. For 25 years, there wasn't a problem. All right? So we better start getting tough.\"\n\nExperts say the claim about the pig's blood is bunk.\n\nEight historians told Politifact that Trump's claim was false, and Snopes determined the same. Journalist William Lambers found a 1927 Chicago Tribune story suggesting Pershing sprinkled Moros-supporting swordsmen, Juramentados, with pig's blood. He also pointed out that there were no mass executions led by Pershing, like the 49-man killing Trump described:\n\nThe Tribune article says Pershing sprinkled some prisoners with pig's blood, which the Juramentados believed would condemn them for eternity. But then Pershing let the prisoners go. He issued a warning to others about being sprinkled with the pig's blood. The Tribune article said \"those drops of porcine gore proved more powerful than bullets.\"\n\nThere is some evidence to suggest American military officers may have used swine in the burial proceedings for Muslim enemies in the war in the Philippines. As Politifact noted, Pershing's memoir recounted another officer burying a Muslim in the same grave as a pig.\n\nHowever, the specific claim about Pershing's execution of 49 soldiers with bullets dipped in pig's blood remains unsubstantiated.", "id": "9806035", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Trump Re-ups Debunked 'Pig's Blood' Claim in New Tweet Hours After Spain Terrorist Attack", "image": "https://cdn1.ijr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/GettyImages-699485010-e1503003601572.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 667, "date": "2016-02-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 680}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "67", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "196726", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "200134", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Blood"}, "id": "302514", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}, "id": "303057", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Muslim"}, "id": "303629", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim"}, {"label": {"eng": "Capital punishment"}, "id": "304224", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "General officer"}, "id": "304309", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"}, {"label": {"eng": "United States Army"}, "id": "306135", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army"}, {"label": {"eng": "Islamic terrorism"}, "id": "308026", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_terrorism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Domestic pig"}, "id": "311266", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_pig"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pig"}, "id": "314033", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"}, {"label": {"eng": "Burial"}, "id": "320134", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burial"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chicago Tribune"}, "id": "322818", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Tribune"}, {"label": {"eng": "PolitiFact.com"}, "id": "323532", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PolitiFact.com"}, {"label": {"eng": "Suidae"}, "id": "333251", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suidae"}, {"label": {"eng": "Snopes.com"}, "id": "347247", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snopes.com"}, {"label": {"eng": "Swordsmanship"}, "id": "348613", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swordsmanship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Moro people"}, "id": "350264", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moro_people"}, {"label": {"eng": "John J.

There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 Years!\" Trump tweeted, reviving a debunked legend about a United States Army Gen. John Joseph \"Black Jack\" Pershing subduing Moro rebels a century ago in the aftermath of the Philippine-American War.\n\nPershing, according to the historical myth, curbed the rebellion in the Philippines' south by shooting the rebels with bullets dipped in pig blood.\n\nAmericans faced Filipino armed opposition from 1899 to 1902 as they tried to occupy the archipelago following centuries of Spanish rule.\n\nPershing was installed governor of Moro areas in the south, but his four-year tenure starting 1909 was beset by insurgencies as the general tried to disarm the Muslim locals. Around 1,200 American troops led by Pershing faced a fierce resistance of 800 Moros in Jolo in the Second Battle of Bud Dajo.\n\nThis was not the first time that Trump referred to the offensive urban legend about pig's blood used to defeat the Muslim inhabitants of the islands.\n\nIn a speech in North Charleston in 2016, Trump claimed that Pershing and Americans in the south had a \"tremendous problem with terrorism.\"\n\n\"(Pershing) took 50 bullets, and he dipped them in pig's blood. And he had his men load his rifles and he lined up the 50 people, and they shot 49 of those people. And the 50th person, he said, 'You go back to your people and you tell them what happened.' And for 25 years, there wasn't a problem,\" he said.\n\nHistorians have long debunked the story, saying it was uncharacteristic of Pershing to do so and there has been no evidence to confirm it.\n\nTrump's latest historically inaccurate comment about the Philippines was a followup to another tweet condemning violence in Barcelona, where more than a dozen people were killed when a van peered onto a sidewalk and sped down a busy pedestrian zone in what authorities called a terror attack.\n\nThe tweet referring to the rebellion in Mindanao was among the string of comments Trump made defending Confederate figures, bemoaning rising efforts to remove them as an attack on America's \"history and culture.\"\n\nTrump has berated his critics who, with increasingly sharper language, have denounced his initially slow and then ultimately combative comments on the racial violence at a white supremacist rally last weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nTrump's unpredictable, defiant and, critics claim, racially provocative behavior has clearly begun to wear on his Republican allies.\n\nTennessee Sen. Bob Corker, whom Trump considered for a Cabinet post, declared Thursday that \"the president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to\" in dealing with crises. And Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska tweeted, \"Anything less than complete & unambiguous condemnation of white supremacists, neo-Nazis and the KKK by the @POTUS is unacceptable. Period.\"\n\nSen. Tim Scott of South Carolina said Trump's \"moral authority is compromised.\"\n\nTrump, who is known to try to change the focus of news coverage with an attention-grabbing declaration, sought to shift Thursday from the white supremacists to the future of statues.\n\n\"You can't change history, but you can learn from it,\" he tweeted. \"Robert E. Lee. Stonewall Jackson -- who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish. ...\n\n\"Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture

There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\n\n-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 17, 2017\n\n[Trump recycles discredited Islamic pigs' blood tale after terrorist attack in Barcelona]\n\n\"Study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught. There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\" he tweeted.\n\nBrian M. Linn, a history professor at Texas A&M University, did just that nearly two decades ago when he published \"Guardians of Empire,\" a book on the U.S. military presence in Asia from 1902 to 1940.\n\nHis verdict on Trump's claim?\n\n\"There is absolutely no evidence this occurred,\" he told The Washington Post.\n\n\"It's a made-up story. It doesn't seem to matter how many times people say this isn't true. No one can say where or when this occurred.\"\n\nBut Trump's claims, and the wider belief in a routinely debunked story, has far-reaching effects. Not only is the story untrue, but the convenient twist -- of an insurgency defeated only with the use of brutal war tactics -- points to precisely the opposite lessons Pershing and his troops learned in the Philippines campaign from 1899 to 1913, Linn said.\n\n\"The U.S. military learned escalating counterterrorism was not effective, and they took great steps, including Pershing, to de-escalate,\" Linn said.\n\nWho was John J. Pershing?\n\nPershing was a U.S. Military Academy graduate who first earned distinction in the Indian-American Wars, and later his nickname, \"Black Jack,\" after commanding the all-African American Buffalo Soldiers unit.\n\nHe was an astute and battle-experienced captain who first arrived in the Philippines in 1899, where he learned the value of defusing tribal grievances among the Moro, the followers of Islam on the archipelago engaged in tribal violence and insurrection against the United States. The Philippines were acquired after the United States won the Spanish-American War in 1898, and an insurrection arose following attempts to pacify the country as it sought independence from colonial rule.\n\nPershing studied the Koran and drank tea with tribal leaders to emphasize he was there to put down violence, not continue a religious war the Spanish had waged for centuries.\n\n\"He did a lot of what we would call 'winning hearts and minds' and embraced reforms which helped end their resistance,\" Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University, told PolitiFact. \"He fought too, but only when he had to, and only against tribes or bands that just wouldn't negotiate with him.\"\n\nIn one series of campaigns between 1902 and 1903 around Lake Lanao on the southern island, Pershing would focus on more violent religious groups in fortified positions, allowing them room to escape, Linn said.\n\nPershing then bypassed other factions in the area to show he could easily move his forces around but would not deliberately attack, demonstrating to other tribes he understood which groups posed a threat.\n\nBut Pershing was also the commander of aggressive offensives that killed women and children after insurrectionists occupied positions with their families. Still, Pershing was made an honorary Moro chieftain, Linn said.\n\n[Van swerves into crowds in Barcelona's popular Las Ramblas district; 13 reported dead and scores injured]\n\nOther atrocities were committed by U.S. forces during the conflict. After a garrison of Army soldiers was overrun and massacred, a unit of Marines was dispatched in September 1902 to root out insurgents on the island of Samar on the central coast. Major Little Waller, who led the Marine unit, arrived from China and was unfamiliar with the terrain. Fever overtook him, his men panicked and the Filipino porters carrying his equipment mutinied.\n\nEleven porters were executed in a remote area, but news of the act quickly spread. \"Dead men tell no tales, but they leave an awful smell\" became a common American saying afterward, Linn said. Waller was later acquitted in a court-martial.\n\nBut the episode points to an example of what happens when news of deliberate killings spreads, Linn said, and if Pershing had committed a theatrical massacre, a similar result would have been likely.\n\nRise of the Pershing myth\n\nLinn began to encounter the Pershing pig blood bullet story after Sept. 11, 2001, when Internet users searched for religious-themed military operations in the wake of the terror attacks in the United States.\n\n\"It seemed to me to be coming from sources that were strongly anti-Muslim, not military historians or scholars,\" Linn said.\n\nConcerned faculty at the U.S. Military Academy asked him to disprove the story of arguably one of its most storied graduates. Pershing would later head the American Expeditionary Forces in World War I as Commander of the Armies, a rank only held by two generals in U.S. history -- Pershing and George Washington, who was posthumously awarded the rank in 1976.\n\nLinn told the U.S. Military Academy, along with fellow Texas A&M professor Frank Vandiver and author of Pershing's biography, that no evidence existed to back up the story.\n\n[Trump embraces culture war with call to preserve Confederate statues]\n\nStill, the myth persists with another twist of burying insurgents with dead pigs. In Pershing's memoir \"My Life Before the World War, 1860 -- 1917,\" he says fellow officer Col. Frank West told him at least one Muslim fighters was \"publicly buried in the same grave with a dead pig.\"\n\n\"It was not pleasant to have to take such measures, but the prospect of going to hell instead of heaven sometimes deterred the would-be assassins,\" Pershing wrote about juramentados, knife-wielding religious extremists who targeted Christians.\n\nLinn said it probably did happen at one point, but he doubts Pershing was involved or ordered subordinates to commit religiously insulting acts. Other artifacts, like letters and memoirs from soldiers there describing similar events, do not point to credible claims of Pershing's involvement, Linn said. A 1939 movie about the conflict starring Gary Cooper, \"The Real Glory,\" also includes a scene that resemble those moments and likely fuels the myth, the historian said.\n\nThe Philippine-American War ended in 1902, with the death of more than 4,200 American and 20,000 Filipino combatants. As many as 200,000 Filipino civilians died from violence and widespread famine and disease, according to the State Department. The Moro Insurrection continued for years.\n\nPershing served as governor of the mostly Muslim Moro Province from 1909 to 1913, as the rebellion festered. Pershing's decision to disarm the Moro in 1913 triggered more unrest, culminating in the Battle of Bud Bagsak in the south.\n\nPershing annihilated the Moro, but Trump's suggestion of a fabled mass execution leading to peace is incorrect, Linn said.\n\n\"There was still lawlessness, homicide and banditry\" that arguably continued for decades up to now, he said, as the government continues its brutal crackdown over drug traffickers and users.\n\nLost in Trump's falsehood, Linn said, is the distortion of an officer who dedicated his life to a certain code of conduct.\n\n\"It's a terrible defamation of the American soldier,\" Linn said. \"What does it say about Americans that they would take 50 people and shoot them?

There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\"\n\nThe anecdote he is referring to is understood to be a myth about how General John Pershing executed dozens of Muslim terrorists in the Philippines with tainted ammunition during a guerrilla war in the early 1900s.\n\nThe story is understood to be a hoax spread by emails with no evidence it really occurred, according to rumour tracker Snopes.\n\nIt's not the first time Trump has made reference to the Pershing tale - according to MSNBC he told the story in South Carolina ahead of the state's Republican presidential primary in February 2016.\n\nHe said: \"He took fifty bullets, and he dipped them in pig's blood.\n\n\"And he had his men load his rifles and he lined up the fifty people, and they shot 49 of those people.\n\n\"And the fiftieth person he said 'You go back to your people and you tell them what happened.' And for 25 years there wasn't a problem, okay?\"\n\nTrump, getting to the \"moral\" of the story, concluded: \"We better start getting tough and we better start getting vigilant, and we better start using our heads or we're not gonna have a country, folks.\"\n\nHe appeared to take a similar stance yesterday as he told the people of Barcelona: \"Be tough & strong, we love you!\"\n\nBut social media users were quick to point out that the president had been promoting a \"lie\".\n\nPaula tweeted Trump directly: \"You are spreading a lie about a horrible, fictional account of history.\"\n\nAnother user said: \"So Trump yet again reveals that he thinks war crimes are acceptable\".\n\nDemocrat Ted Lieu said: \"@realDonaldTrump endorsing mass murder in his Pershing tweet is just to distract from negative stories about him endorsing Nazis.\"\n\nPresenter Jake Tapper tweeted: \"President Trump tells world to study lie about General Pershing\".\n\nAt least 13 people died and more than 100 people were injured in Barcelona on Thursday, making it the deadliest attack in Spain since the 2004 Madrid train bombs in which more than 190 people were killed.\n\nSince Trump's tweets, five terrorists were shot dead by police in the nearby seaside town of Cambrils in a second attack in Spain.\n\nThe men, wearing fake suicide vests, ploughed into pedestrians in an Audi A3, injuring six civilians including a police officer.\n\nIt came eight hours after a van hurtled through crowds in Las Ramblas, sending scores of people scattering, in an attack which was later claimed by ISIS.\n\nThree people have been arrested in connection with the attacks.\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May said she was \"sickened\" by the incident, while the Foreign Office said it was still trying to determine if there were British victims.", "id": "9872602", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Disgust as Donald Trump quotes FAKE story of a US general who 'executed Muslim terrorists

At least 12 people were killed and dozens injured, many of them seriously.\n\nTrump also says in a statement on Twitter that the U.S. will do \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhatever is necessary to help.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump tells Spain: \u00e2\u0080\u009cBe tough & strong, we love you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe White House has said Trump \u00e2\u0080\" who is on a working vacation at his private golf club in New Jersey \u00e2\u0080\" is being updated on developments by chief of staff John Kelly.\n\nTrump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wife, first lady Melania Trump, tweeted her \u00e2\u0080\u009cthoughts and prayers\u00e2\u0080\u009d to Barcelona before the president.", "id": "9782296", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Trump repeats lie about dipping bullets in pigs&#8217; blood to kill terrorists", "image": "http://www.vancouversun.com/images/icon512x512_WS.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "67", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Iraq"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "106", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Iraq"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "177", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "151106", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 1, "id": "216558", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Golf"}, "id": "302727", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "White House"}, "id": "303051", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House"}, {"label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}, "id": "303057", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Islamic State of Iraq"}, "id": "303094", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq"}, {"label": {"eng": "Islam"}, "id": "303218", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam"}, {"label": {"eng": "Spanish language"}, "id": "303577", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language"}, {"label": {"eng": "Muslim"}, "id": "303629", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim"}, {"label": {"eng": "La Rambla, Barcelona"}, "id": "303748", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Rambla,_Barcelona"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "General officer"}, "id": "304309", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"}, {"label": {"eng": "United States Army"}, "id": "306135", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army"}, {"label": {"eng": "Levant"}, "id": "314553", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levant"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chief of staff"}, "id": "318852", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_staff"}, {"label": {"eng": "John J.

One of those posts on Twitter included this claim against General John Pershing, who for a time commanded American forces in The Phillippines in the years shortly after the United States took control over the island nation after its victory over Spain in the Spanish-American War:\n\nStudy what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught. There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\n\n-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 17, 2017\n\nDuring the time that Trump is referring to, Pershing and the forces he commanded were forced to deal with pro-independence rebels who were resorting to attacks on the civilian population and on American targets in a war that had started when Spain still controlled the territory. This all took place at the turn of the 20th Century, a decade or more prior to the World War One, which is when Pershing would become nationally famous due to his leadership of the American expeditionary force that fought alongside the British and French against Germany and the remaining Central Powers until the war ended in November 1918.\n\nAccording to legends that appear to have started long after Pershing's death, and which started to become widely circulated among conservatives in the year after the September 11th attacks, Pershing dealt with these terror attacks, which were largely committed by groups that arose out of the Muslim population of The Phillippines, by ordering his troops to dip their bullets in pigs blood and to bury the bodies of executed terrorists with pigs, which is supposedly some sign of disrespect that was meant to horrify the terrorists. The legend goes on to claim that the terror attacks largely ceased after the groups committing them got wind of what Pershing was doing.\n\nAs it turns out, there is absolutely no historical evidence to substantiate this apparent myth:\n\nThe idea of subduing militant Muslims by threatening to bury them with pigs has held currency for many years. Just a few weeks before the September 11 terrorist attacks on America in 2001, Deputy Israeli police minister Gideon Esra suggested in the Israeli newspaper Yediot Aharonot that Palestinian suicide bombers be buried in pig skin or blood. In the 1939 film The Real Glory, Gary Cooper portrays Dr. Bill Canavan, an American Army doctor in 1906 Manila who \"tries to protect the native population from ruthless invaders\" (i.e., \"Muslim fanatics\"). At one point in the film, the Dr. Canavan character drapes a captured Muslim in a pigskin and proclaims that henceforth all slain Muslim rebels will be buried in pig skins, thereby discouraging their \"savagery\" by threatening to prevent their entry into paradise. And, of course, the above-cited anecdote about General Pershing's handling of terrorists in the Philippines has circulated widely on the Internet ever since 9/11 and even made the rounds at the top levels of U.S. government\n\n(...)\n\nSuffice it to say that General John J. \"Black Jack\" Pershing was part of the process as Governor of the troublesome Moro Province between 1909 and 1913. We found no references to this alleged incident in Pershing biographies, however, nor does it match the way Pershing is generally recorded as having dealt with the Moros in 1911. When they refused to obey Pershing's order banning firearms by surrendering their weapons, his response was to draft a letter to the Moros expressing sorrow that his soldiers had to resort to killing them to enforce the order:\n\nI write you this letter because I am sorry to know that you and your people refuse to do what the government has ordered. You do not give up your arms. Soldiers were sent to Taglibi so that you could come into camp and turn in your guns. When the soldiers went to camp a Taglibi, your Moros fired into camp and tried to kill the soldiers. Then the soldiers had to shoot all Moros who fired upon them. When the soldiers marched through the country, the Moros again shot at them, so the soldiers had to kill several others. I am sorry the soldiers had to kill any Moros. All Moros are the same to me as my children and no father wants to kill his own children ...\n\nWhen negotiations stalled and matters came to a head, Pershing was still reluctant to be responsible for any more loss of life than was necessary:\n\n[Pershing] went to his offices on [14 December 1911] only to hear a message from the Sulu district governor: hundreds of hostiles gathered on Jolo's Bud Dajo! The message had dread portent. Mount Dajo, awesomely high and capped with the creater of an extinct volcano, meant sacred things to Moros. It was the refuge against fate, the last bastion of the hopeless, the place where their ancestors stood off great waves of enemies. Once on the mountain, esconced in its big cotta, Moros would die gladly, as Leonard Wood had grimly learned. Retreat to Dajo meant a clear declaration of war.\n\nSobered and depressed, Jack wrote of an overriding worry: \"I am sorry these Moros are such fools, but ... I shall lose as few men and kill as few Moros as possible.\" Memories of Wood's massacre of men and families on Dajo rankled in the army and still bothered the chief of staff. Obviously another such slaughter in the winter of 1911 could adversely influence the 1912 elections in the States.\n\nPershing's strategy was to surround the Moros and wait them out while attempting to induce them to surrender, a strategy that worked effectively: the Bud Dajo campaign ended with only twelve Moro casualties. But in his report Pershing seemed keenly aware that the best approach was not to take any action that would encourage religious fanaticism:\n\nThere was never a moment during this investment of Bud Dajo when the Moros, including women, on top of the mountain, would not have fought to the death had they been given the opportunity. They had gone there to make a last stand on this, their sacred mountain, and they were determined to die fighting ... It was only by the greatest effort that their solid determination to fight it out could be broken. The fact is that they were completely surprised at the prompt and decisive action of the troops in cutting off supplies and preventing escape, and they were chagrined and disappointed in that they were not encouraged to die the death of Mohammedan fanatics.\n\nThe Snopes article linked above does go on to note that there were some contemporaneous reports that at least part of the legend may be accurate in that some Moro rebels were buried with pigs and Pershing was apparently aware of this practice via reports from junior officers. However, there is absolutely no evidence that the practice had any impact at all on the attacks by the rebels, or that there was even any correlation between the practice and the eventual reduction in terror attacks that was apparent by the time Pershing left The Phillippines in 1913. Instead, that drop off appears to be related to a combination of efforts to resolve the rebellion by peaceful means and simply the fact that many of the rebels gave up their fight as the reality of American rule over the islands, which was at least far less severe than the way Spain treated the native population, sank in during the decade after the Spanish-American War ended.\n\nThis isn't the first time that Trump has made this claim, of course. He cited the legend several times during the course of his campaign, prompting historian William Lambers to look into the matter and concludes that there was no merit to Trump's claims:\n\nDuring a campaign rally in South Carolina, [Donald] Trump told his audience a story about General John Pershing executing Muslim prisoners in the Philippines. Trump said Pershing, in the early 1900's, \"caught 50 terrorists that did tremendous damage and killed many people and he took the 50 terrorists and he took 50 men and he dipped 50 bullets in pig's blood.\"\n\nTrump went out to describe a mass execution shooting of 49 of the prisoners, with the last one being sent to tell the others what happened. It was Trump using this \"story\" to demonstrate that America needed to get tough on terrorism, using brutal methods, and that he would be the man to do it.\n\nBut the story is not true. There was no mass execution led by Pershing. That is a rumor created on the Internet.\n\nA Chicago Daily Tribune article from 1927 has a story where Pershing had prisoners from the Moro Rebellion in the Philippines. The Moros were Muslims who resisted American or any other occupying force.\n\nThe Moros had swordsmen, called Juramentados, who were killing Christians in this uprising. It had to be stopped. General Pershing was given this difficult task.\n\nThe Tribune article says Pershing sprinkled some prisoners with pig's blood, which the Juramentados believed would condemn them for eternity. But then Pershing let the prisoners go. He issued a warning to others about being sprinkled with the pig's blood. The Tribune article said \"those drops of porcine gore proved more powerful than bullets.\"\n\nThere were no executions as described by Trump.\n\nIn fact, Pershing was more inclined toward peace talks with the Moros rather than violence.\n\n(...)\n\nIf Pershing were around today he would be advocating food for the hungry child refugees, which are at unprecedented levels today because of the war in Syria. They never talk about hunger during the presidential debates, but it's a top foreign policy issue, which Pershing and other great leaders have understood. Pershing was also deeply concerned about high levels of military spending. He often spoke about achieving global arms reductions and disarmament. Nations could work together to achieve this noble goal.\n\nAs a man who understood more about warfare than perhaps anyone in our country's history, Pershing knew well the danger of excessive armament. He might have some questions for Trump or others who talk about pouring on the military spending.\n\nBut instead of trying to learn from Pershing, Trump cites a false story in an attempt to sound tough and get a sound bite on TV. The last thing this world needs is more people talking or advocating violence, especially someone running for President.\n\nJake Tapper also talked about Trump's lie in its report on the terror attacks:\n\nSo, once again, Trump is telling a lie, and he's insulting the memory of one of most decorated Generals and war heroes in the process.

The legend goes on to claim that the terror attacks largely ceased after the groups committing them got wind of what Pershing was doing.\n\nAs it turns out, there is absolutely no historical evidence to substantiate this apparent myth:\n\nThe idea of subduing militant Muslims by threatening to bury them with pigs has held currency for many years. Just a few weeks before the September 11 terrorist attacks on America in 2001, Deputy Israeli police minister Gideon Esra suggested in the Israeli newspaper Yediot Aharonot that Palestinian suicide bombers be buried in pig skin or blood. In the 1939 film The Real Glory, Gary Cooper portrays Dr. Bill Canavan, an American Army doctor in 1906 Manila who \"tries to protect the native population from ruthless invaders\" (i.e., \"Muslim fanatics\"). At one point in the film, the Dr. Canavan character drapes a captured Muslim in a pigskin and proclaims that henceforth all slain Muslim rebels will be buried in pig skins, thereby discouraging their \"savagery\" by threatening to prevent their entry into paradise. And, of course, the above-cited anecdote about General Pershing's handling of terrorists in the Philippines has circulated widely on the Internet ever since 9/11 and even made the rounds at the top levels of U.S. government\n\n(...)\n\nSuffice it to say that General John J. \"Black Jack\" Pershing was part of the process as Governor of the troublesome Moro Province between 1909 and 1913. We found no references to this alleged incident in Pershing biographies, however, nor does it match the way Pershing is generally recorded as having dealt with the Moros in 1911. When they refused to obey Pershing's order banning firearms by surrendering their weapons, his response was to draft a letter to the Moros expressing sorrow that his soldiers had to resort to killing them to enforce the order:\n\nI write you this letter because I am sorry to know that you and your people refuse to do what the government has ordered. You do not give up your arms. Soldiers were sent to Taglibi so that you could come into camp and turn in your guns. When the soldiers went to camp a Taglibi, your Moros fired into camp and tried to kill the soldiers. Then the soldiers had to shoot all Moros who fired upon them. When the soldiers marched through the country, the Moros again shot at them, so the soldiers had to kill several others. I am sorry the soldiers had to kill any Moros. All Moros are the same to me as my children and no father wants to kill his own children ...\n\nWhen negotiations stalled and matters came to a head, Pershing was still reluctant to be responsible for any more loss of life than was necessary:\n\n[Pershing] went to his offices on [14 December 1911] only to hear a message from the Sulu district governor: hundreds of hostiles gathered on Jolo's Bud Dajo! The message had dread portent. Mount Dajo, awesomely high and capped with the creater of an extinct volcano, meant sacred things to Moros. It was the refuge against fate, the last bastion of the hopeless, the place where their ancestors stood off great waves of enemies. Once on the mountain, esconced in its big cotta, Moros would die gladly, as Leonard Wood had grimly learned. Retreat to Dajo meant a clear declaration of war.\n\nSobered and depressed, Jack wrote of an overriding worry: \"I am sorry these Moros are such fools, but ... I shall lose as few men and kill as few Moros as possible.\" Memories of Wood's massacre of men and families on Dajo rankled in the army and still bothered the chief of staff. Obviously another such slaughter in the winter of 1911 could adversely influence the 1912 elections in the States.\n\nPershing's strategy was to surround the Moros and wait them out while attempting to induce them to surrender, a strategy that worked effectively: the Bud Dajo campaign ended with only twelve Moro casualties. But in his report Pershing seemed keenly aware that the best approach was not to take any action that would encourage religious fanaticism:\n\nThere was never a moment during this investment of Bud Dajo when the Moros, including women, on top of the mountain, would not have fought to the death had they been given the opportunity. They had gone there to make a last stand on this, their sacred mountain, and they were determined to die fighting ... It was only by the greatest effort that their solid determination to fight it out could be broken. The fact is that they were completely surprised at the prompt and decisive action of the troops in cutting off supplies and preventing escape, and they were chagrined and disappointed in that they were not encouraged to die the death of Mohammedan fanatics.\n\nThe Snopes article linked above does go on to note that there were some contemporaneous reports that at least part of the legend may be accurate in that some Moro rebels were buried with pigs and Pershing was apparently aware of this practice via reports from junior officers. However, there is absolutely no evidence that the practice had any impact at all on the attacks by the rebels, or that there was even any correlation between the practice and the eventual reduction in terror attacks that was apparent by the time Pershing left The Phillippines in 1913. Instead, that drop off appears to be related to a combination of efforts to resolve the rebellion by peaceful means and simply the fact that many of the rebels gave up their fight as the reality of American rule over the islands, which was at least far less severe than the way Spain treated the native population, sank in during the decade after the Spanish-American War ended.\n\nThis isn't the first time that Trump has made this claim, of course. He cited the legend several times during the course of his campaign, prompting historian William Lambers to look into the matter and concludes that there was no merit to Trump's claims:\n\nDuring a campaign rally in South Carolina, [Donald] Trump told his audience a story about General John Pershing executing Muslim prisoners in the Philippines. Trump said Pershing, in the early 1900's, \"caught 50 terrorists that did tremendous damage and killed many people and he took the 50 terrorists and he took 50 men and he dipped 50 bullets in pig's blood.\"\n\nTrump went out to describe a mass execution shooting of 49 of the prisoners, with the last one being sent to tell the others what happened. It was Trump using this \"story\" to demonstrate that America needed to get tough on terrorism, using brutal methods, and that he would be the man to do it.\n\nBut the story is not true. There was no mass execution led by Pershing. That is a rumor created on the Internet.\n\nA Chicago Daily Tribune article from 1927 has a story where Pershing had prisoners from the Moro Rebellion in the Philippines. The Moros were Muslims who resisted American or any other occupying force.\n\nThe Moros had swordsmen, called Juramentados, who were killing Christians in this uprising. It had to be stopped. General Pershing was given this difficult task.\n\nThe Tribune article says Pershing sprinkled some prisoners with pig's blood, which the Juramentados believed would condemn them for eternity. But then Pershing let the prisoners go. He issued a warning to others about being sprinkled with the pig's blood. The Tribune article said \"those drops of porcine gore proved more powerful than bullets.\"\n\nThere were no executions as described by Trump.\n\nIn fact, Pershing was more inclined toward peace talks with the Moros rather than violence.\n\n(...)\n\nIf Pershing were around today he would be advocating food for the hungry child refugees, which are at unprecedented levels today because of the war in Syria. They never talk about hunger during the presidential debates, but it's a top foreign policy issue, which Pershing and other great leaders have understood. Pershing was also deeply concerned about high levels of military spending. He often spoke about achieving global arms reductions and disarmament. Nations could work together to achieve this noble goal.\n\nAs a man who understood more about warfare than perhaps anyone in our country's history, Pershing knew well the danger of excessive armament. He might have some questions for Trump or others who talk about pouring on the military spending.\n\nBut instead of trying to learn from Pershing, Trump cites a false story in an attempt to sound tough and get a sound bite on TV. The last thing this world needs is more people talking or advocating violence, especially someone running for President.\n\nJake Tapper also talked about Trump's lie in its report on the terror attacks:\n\nSo, once again, Trump is telling a lie, and he's insulting the memory of one of most decorated Generals and war heroes in the process. Not that he cares about the truth, of course.\n\nUpdate: The New York Times fact checked the story, and similarly found it implausible given the available evidence:\n\nVarious versions of this myth began circulating around the time of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, often in email chains and on discussion boards online. In one version, Pershing also buried the rebels with \"hog guts dumped atop the bodies.\" And in another, in a column published in National Review in December 2002, a few months before the invasion of Iraq, the act was attributed to unnamed troops under Pershing's command.\n\n\"This is a repeated myth that has no basis in truth,\" said James R. Arnold, the author of \"Moro War: How America Battled a Muslim Insurgency in the Philippine Jungle, 1902-1913.\"\n\nMr. Arnold's view was echoed by eight other historians who were interviewed by PolitiFact when Mr. Trump made his original claim. (It earned him the website's lowest rating, \"Pants on Fire.\")\n\nFurther dispelling this event and the suggestion that it was highly effective and ushered in an enduring peace is its dubious timeline. Most versions of the tale say the episode occurred around 1911, but the Moro Rebellion officially lasted another two years. After 1913, Americans back home lost interest and United States troops withdrew.\n\nStudying Pershing's historically documented actions during the Moro Rebellion -- generally \"a carrots and stick\" approach, Mr. Arnold said -- confers no silver bullets on how to approach terrorism.\n\nPershing \"understood the imperative of having American forces involved at the grass-roots level,\" wrote Col. Robert M. Cassidy of the Army, a professor of strategy and policy at the U.S. Naval War College. But Pershing could also be brutal, killing women and children in one large battle, for instance.\n\nTo the extent that the Americans \"won\" over the rebels, Mr. Arnold attributes that to an outsize battle: The Moros had no outside support, were insulated on an island and were outgunned.\n\nAnd, as noted above, Politifact also examined the claim when Trump made it on the campaign trail:\n\nhe idea that pig's blood could serve as a weapon against Muslims has been around in popular culture for decades.\n\nFor instance, a 1939 Hollywood movie, The Real Glory, stars Gary Cooper as a doctor on the Philippine island of Mindanao who drapes a captive in pigskin \"to serve as an abject lesson to all would-be attackers,\" Luis H. Francia, a Filipino-born professor of Asian American Studies at Hunter College, wrote recently.\n\nSnopes has been tracking Internet-based rumors of this sort since 2001, and a California National Guard facility removed a poster telling the Pershing story in 2005.\n\nBut the only historical evidence that something like this actually happened appears to come from a letter written by a soldier who served in the Philippines.\n\n\"Mr. C.C. Booth of Dallas, Texas, who served in Mindanao under Pershing, recalls seeing him hang a Moro chieftain by the heels over an open grave, kill a pig, and then drop the Moro into the grave with the bloody animal,\" according to a 1962 article by Donald Smythe in the Pacific Historical Review, an academic journal.\n\nHowever, David J. Silbey, a Cornell University historian and author of A War of Frontier and Empire: The Philippine-American War, 1899-1902, raised red flags about its sourcing. This claim came from one letter -- and one that was written in 1960, more than half a century after the events in question. (And for the sake of this fact-check, the details differ significantly from the story Trump told.)\n\nOther historians agreed that the evidence is thin, to say the least.\n\n\"This story is a fabrication and has long been discredited,\" said Brian McAllister Linn, a Texas A&M University historian and author of Guardians of Empire: The U.S. Army and the Pacific, 1902-1940. \"I am amazed it is still making the rounds.\"\n\nChristopher Einolf, a professor at DePaul University and author of America in the Philippines, 1899-1902: The First Torture Scandal, added that he trusted the conclusion of the late military historian Frank E. Vandiver, who told About.com in 2003 that \"I never found any indication that it was true in extensive research on his Moro experiences. This kind of thing would have run completely against his character.\"\n\nIndeed, other historians noted that Pershing pursued a less brutal approach to \"pacifying\" the rebels in the southern Philippines than Leonard Wood, one of his predecessors.\n\n\"He did a lot of what we would call 'winning hearts and minds' and embraced reforms which helped end their resistance,\" said Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University. \"He fought too, but only when he had to, and only against tribes or bands that just wouldn't negotiate with him. He wasn't solely committed to fighting as people like Trump who tell the pig blood story imply.\"\n\nAnother wrinkle: Historians said the premise that the rebels would have been motivated by a fear of pigs is not as certain as Trump suggests. It's unclear how religiously observant the insurgents were and whether such a policy would have made a difference in their actions.\n\n\"The Moros were fighting for a lot of reasons, not just because they were Muslims,\" Janda said. \"This is another fact that gets lost in many modern discussions of terrorism.\"\n\nThe site also notes that, in the end, it was effectively an edict from the Sultain of the Ottoman Empire that persuaded the Moro rebels to lay down their arms:\n\n\"Even if the tale is true, the pacifying effect that Trump claims is nonsense,\" said Michael H. Hunt, an emeritus historian at the University of North Carolina and author of Arc of Empire: America's Wars in Asia from the Philippines to Vietnam. The region \"remained in constant unrest during the period of American rule and into the period of independence, right down to the present.\"\n\nSilbey of Cornell agreed. \"Where Trump's remark becomes ridiculous is in the idea that this actually worked,\" he said. \"The Moro War did not end until 1913, and even that's a bit of a soft date, with violence continuing for quite a while afterward. Defilement by pig's blood isn't -- and wasn't -- some magical method of ending terrorism.\"\n\nIf anything, a more complete account of the Moro insurgency involves some subplots that run contrary to Trump's narrative.\n\n\"The Ottomans under Sultan Abdul Hamid II sent a letter to the Sulu Moros asking them not to resist the Americans at the start of the Moro Rebellion, and the Moros on Sulu complied,\" Janda said. \"It's a nice example of diplomacy working to our advantage, and a reminder that then and now, not all Muslims or Moros are the same and that many were and are U.S. allies.\"\n\nAs John Adams once put it, facts are stubborn images.", "id": "9808783", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Once Again, Trump Lies And The Truth Dies", "image":

Pershing and what he did to Muslim terrorists when they were caught.\n\nThe Islamic State terror group claimed responsibility for the Barcelona attack.\n\nTrump was referencing the discredited story of how Pershing executed 49 Muslims with bullets that had been dipped in pig's blood during the Philippine-American War of 1899-1902.\n\nPresident Trump has reacted to the Barcelona terror attack by touting a debunked anti-Muslim war crime tale.

PolitiFact tried to verify Trump's account of Pershing's actions with eight historians. All were skeptical that these events ever happened.\n\n\"There is no evidence that Pershing himself committed these acts, there is nothing said about the use of 50 bullets dipped in pig's blood, and most important, there is no evidence to support Trump's claim that this tactic was effective in stopping violence -- or that it would provide a useful policy today,\" PolitiFact correspondent Louis Jacobson noted.\n\nEarlier in the week, Trump fiercely defended his initial decision not to specifically condemn the white supremacist organizers of the violent rally in Charlottesville by insisting that he \"didn't know all of the facts\".\n\nTrump has been apparently less concerned with the details when it comes to Pershing's record, including Thursday shortly after the Barcelona

There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\"\n\nThe tweet echoed a highly controversial claim Trump made at an election rally in South Carolina in February 2016, in which he talked admiringly about a counter-insurgency in the Philippines conducted by Gen John Pershing between 1909 and 1913, when he was governor of Moro province.\n\n\"They were having terrorism problems just like we do. And he caught 50 terrorists who did tremendous damage and killed many people. And he took the 50 terrorists, and he took 50 men, and he dipped 50 bullets in pig's blood,\" Trump said.\n\nHe claimed that Pershing then \"had his men load his rifles and he lined up the 50 people, and they shot 49 of those people. And the 50th person, he said: you go back to your people and you tell them what happened.\"\n\nIn 2016, Trump claimed such mass executions ended the Islamic insurgency for a quarter-century. \"Twenty-five years, there wasn't a problem,\" he said. In his new tweet he revised that estimated upward to 35 years.\n\nThis account of Pershing's actions has circulated on the internet since 2001 but historians say there is very little if any evidence to support it, and Trump was denounced for his support of mass killing aggravated by racist insults. But the outburst solidified his support among the US far right, and did nothing to impede his victory in the Republican primaries and then the election last November. Trump appears to have had domestic politics in mind when he sent out his tweet in response to the Barcelona attack.\n\nHis relationship with that section of his support has come under renewed scrutiny since the attack on a crowd in Charlottesville, Virginia, by a white supremacist on Saturday. It took him two days to assign blame directly on the far right, only to contradict himself the next day with a claim that \"both sides\" were to blame for the incident.\n\nTrump was much faster in pointing the finger of blame in the wake of Barcelona, but his erratic response echoed the controversy over Charlottesville, in which conventional political language, apparently drafted by aides, has alternated with a personal gut reaction that has had an explosive and divisive effect.\n\nThe French president, Emmanuel Macron, appeared to take on Trump in his Twitter reaction to the Barcelona attack. An initial tweet offered solidarity for the victims of and the pledge: \"We remain united and determined.\" But in a follow-up, Macron - who has repeatedly acted as a foil to Trump on the world stage - said: \"We stand beside those who fight racism and xenophobia. It is our common fight, in past and present.\" He added the hashtag: #Charlottesville.\n\nBefore Trump took to Twitter, the US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, said the administration stood ready to help Spanish law enforcement and national authorities and advised Americans in Spain to call home to reassure relatives.\n\n\"Terrorists around the world should know that the United States and our allies are resolved to find you and bring you to justice,\" Tillerson said.\n\nIn the UK, Theresa May, said: \"My thoughts are with the victims of today's terrible attack in Barcelona and the emergency services responding to this ongoing incident.\n\n\"The UK stands with Spain against terror,\" she added.\n\nThe UK foreign secretary, Boris Johnson said he was \"concerned and saddened\" by the attack and said the foreign office was \"doing all we can to identify whether Brits need help\".\n\nSadiq Khan, the London mayor who has had had to handle a string of recent terrorist attacks in Westminster, London Bridge and Finsbury Park, wrote on Twitter: \"\"My thoughts are with the victims of this barbaric terrorist attack in the great city of Barcelona and with their brave emergency services.\n\n\"London stands with Barcelona against the evil of terrorism.\"\n\nThe Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, tweeted about the \"terrible reports from Barcelona\", saying: \"My thoughts are with those killed and injured, and the emergency services working to save lives.\"\n\nAnd the German foreign minister, Sigmar Gabriel, said he was \"deeply shocked\" by the incident. He added: \"Our sympathies are with the victims and their relatives and friends.\"", "id": "9771308", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Trump responds to Barcelona attack by reviving

John J. Pershing, who is said, in stories circulating online, to have dipped bullets in pigs' blood to execute Islamic terrorists in the Philippines whose religion forbid contact with the animals.\n\nThe story has been found to be unsubstantiated by numerous fact-checkers in the media. But Trump first told the story during a campaign rally in February 2016, as he defended his position of supporting methods of torture, such as waterboarding, on terrorist suspects.\n\nTrump's tweet came hours after a man in Barcelona drove a van at high speeds into a crowd at a popular tourist destination, killing 12 and injuring 50 more, according to local police who are calling the attack an act of terrorism. One man is reportedly in custody in the investigation.\n\nTrump also tweeted message of support for the victims, in which he said the United States \"condemns the terror attack.\"\n\nThe message stood in sharp contrast to Trump's reaction Saturday to an attack in Charlottesville, when a man drove a car into a group of people protesting a white nationalist rally, killing a woman and injuring 19 others. An alleged Nazi sympathizer who had attended the rally is charged with second-degree murder in the case.\n\nAfter than incident, Trump blamed the actions of people \"on many sides\" of the violent clashes.\n\nThough he denounced the white supremacist hate groups directly two days later, Trump then reversed course and again blamed \"both sides\" on Tuesday, prompting a widespread political backlash. The president on Tuesday explained that his initial reaction had been muted because he did not have all the \"facts\" in the case and wanted to be cautious.\n\nIn his February recitation of the Pershing story, Trump told a crowd of supporters that the general was having trouble dealing with terrorist attacks and caught 50 suspects.\n\n\"He took the 50 terrorists, and he took 50 men and he dipped 50 bullets in pigs' blood - you heard that, right? He took 50 bullets, and he dipped them in pigs' blood,\" Trump continued. \"And he had his men load his rifles, and he lined up the 50 people, and they shot 49 of those people. And the 50th person, he said: You go back to your people, and you tell them what happened. And for 25 years, there wasn't a problem. Okay? Twenty-five years, there wasn't a problem.\"\n\nAt one point in telling this story, Trump said: \"By the way, this is something you can read in the history books - not a lot of history books because they don't like teaching this.\"\n\nAlthough Trump never used the word \"Muslim\" in this story, he was clearly referring to Muslim terrorists and at one point commented: \"There's a whole thing with swine and animals and pigs, and - you know the story, you know they don't like that.\" Pigs are deemed impure by the Koran.\n\nThere are several versions of the tale circulating, including one in which the prisoners were buried with dead pigs. The pigs' blood on the bullets, according to at least one version, would keep a Muslim from entering heaven.\n\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations denounced Trump's remarks last year in a sharply worded statement that accused the then-candidate of inciting anti-Muslim attacks.", "id": "9798398", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Trump recycles discredited Islamic pigs' blood tale after terrorist attack in Barcelona", "image": "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/-OuCba_KGLo-h50Ye59XdOBK--Y=/1200x0/smart/filters:quality(70)/arc-anglerfish-syd-prod-nzme.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YDAXMA3ONVEJJJQJL2WLBNNKUU.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 684, "date": "2016-02-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 697}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "177", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "151106", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "200134", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Blood"}, "id": "302514", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"}, {"label": {"eng": "Police"}, "id": "302532", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nazism"}, "id": "302813", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Internet"}, "id": "302869", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"}, {"label": {"eng": "Politics"}, "id": "302948", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Murder"}, "id": "302958", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder"}, {"label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}, "id": "303057", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Islam"}, "id": "303218", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam"}, {"label": {"eng": "Religion"}, "id": "303332", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion"}, {"label": {"eng": "Muslim"}, "id": "303629", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tourism"}, "id": "303659", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Capital punishment"}, "id": "304224", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "General officer"}, "id": "304309", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"}, {"label": {"eng": "Islamism"}, "id": "304453", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Torture"}, "id": "304940", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture"}, {"label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "id": "305969", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Islamic terrorism"}, "id": "308026", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_terrorism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Quran"}, "id": "308054", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quran"}, {"label": {"eng": "War on Terror"}, "id": "310769", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Terror"}, {"label": {"eng": "John J.

The American president was on Twitter immediately.\n\nFirst, he instantly called it a terror attack, something he remains unwilling to do regarding the man who drove a car into a crowd of anti-racist protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, killing one woman and injuring some 20 others.\n\nThe United States condemns the terror attack in Barcelona, Spain, and will do whatever is necessary to help.

There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\n\n-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 17, 2017\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with that anecdote, it's fine. Because it's not true. But it ma ers, because it's one of the more heinous things the president has said.\n\nBack in February of 2016, well before Trump had the Republican nomination, he told this tale at a rally in Charleston, South Carolina.\n\n\"They were having terrorism problems, just like we do. And he caught 50 terrorists who did tremendous damage and killed many people. And he took the 50 terrorists, and he took 50 men and he dipped 50 bullets in pigs' blood -- you heard that, right?

Twenty-five years, there wasn't a problem.\"\n\nIn Islam, pigs are considered an unclean animal, and members of the religion are not supposed to even handle the carcass of a pig.\n\nPeople immediately cast doubt on Trump's story. Politifact researched the claim and found that there was no truth to it. Although it was reported that Pershing possibly sprinkled pig's blood on Muslims, and maybe buried insurgents with pig carcasses, there was no veracity to the wholesale slaughter of Muslims.\n\nThe U.S. has had a complicated relationship with treating suspects of terror, deeming them \"enemy combatants\" after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and determining the Geneva Convention -- which the U.S. is a party to -- did not apply to them.\n\nThe Geneva Convention does explicitly outlaw the murder of prisoners of war as well as violating prisoners' religious rights.", "id": "9830197", "details": {},

with pigs.\n\n\"Study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught,\" the President of the United States tweeted on Thursday night, 45 minutes after condemning the attack that killed 13 people in Barcelona.\n\n\"There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\"\n\nThe tweet was reference to the story of US General John Pershing, who supposedly executed Islamist militants in the Philippines using bullets smeared with pig's blood.\n\nThe story has been widely debunked by historians and fact-checkers such as Snopes.\n\nBut the \"fake news\" story has been used by Mr Trump before, most notably on the 2016 campaign trail when he told large crowds at a California rally that the tactic had stopped attacks for 42 years.\n\nAt the time the anecdote provoked disgust, on the grounds of it being both untrue and inciteful to racist violence.\n\nOn Thursday, critics from all sides of the political spectrum expressed horror at Mr Trump's apparent linking of the Pershing myth with the Barcelona attacks.\n\nTed Lieu, a Democratic Representative, said the President was \"endorsing mass murder\" in his tweet, while US Senator Chris Murphy called it \"total fiction\".\n\nCNN's Jake Tapper said Mr Trump had called on the people of the United States to \"study a story that is not true\".\n\nConservative pundit Bill Kristol also slammed the comment, quoting an article that said the President had \"libelled an American hero\" and signalled willingness \"to commit war crimes\".\n\nThe fiasco follows a day of provocation for the increasingly beleaguered President, who earlier in the day had tweeted in defence of Confederate-era statues that many in the USA are calling to be pulled down.\n\nBefore invoking General Pershing, Mr Trump had tweeted that the United States would do \"whatever is necessary to help\" following the Barcelona attacks.", "id": "9801952", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Trump follows Barcelona tweet with fake

John Pershing has the fix that the world needs today.\n\nThis is a reference to a story Trump has told in the past about efforts undertaken by the United States to subdue an insurgency in the Philippines. The United States took control of the islands after a brief war with Spain in 1898, and then fought a three-year war against the locals to secure control over it. But localized unrest continued in some areas, and Pershing served as governor of Moro Province, which is predominantly Muslim, between 1909 and 1913 before going on to his better-known career as the leader of American military forces in World War I.\n\nAt a February 19, 2016, rally in South Carolina, Trump offered this account:\n\nThey were having terrorism problems, just like we do. And he caught 50 terrorists who did tremendous damage and killed many people. And he took the 50 terrorists, and he took 50 men and he dipped 50 bullets in pigs' blood -- you heard that, right? He took 50 bullets, and he dipped them in pigs' blood. And he had his men load his rifles, and he lined up the 50 people, and they shot 49 of those people. And the 50th person, he said: You go back to your people, and you tell them what happened. And for 25 years, there wasn't a problem. Okay? Twenty-five years, there wasn't a problem.\n\nAfter Trump told this story, Louis Jacobson of PolitiFact looked into it with eight historians, all of whom were deeply skeptical that it ever happened. The notion that pig's blood was used as an anti-Muslim weapon appears to derive from a 1939 Gary Cooper movie and a single letter written in 1960.\n\nAnd of course while observant Muslims avoid eating pork products, they're not vampires who can only be killed by special bullets.

The \"Moros\" (ethnic Muslims who lived in the Southern Philippines) fought against foreign rule for hundreds of years and rose up against the United States when the nation claimed rule of the island.\n\n\"The Moros were fighting for a lot of reasons, not just because they were Muslims,\" Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University, told PolitiFact. \"This is another fact that gets lost in many modern discussions of terrorism.\"\n\nAnother issue with the Pershing story is that it runs contrary to his character, according to historians.\n\n\"He did a lot of what we would call 'winning hearts and minds' and embraced reforms which helped end their resistance,\" Janda explained. \"He fought too, but only when he had to, and only against tribes or bands that just wouldn't negotiate with him. He wasn't solely committed to fighting as people like Trump who tell the pig blood story imply.\"\n\nA letter surfaced claiming Pershing, in charge of controlling territories gained during the Spanish-American War, did actually bury a Muslim's body with the dead body of a pig, but that letter was written half a century after the alleged double burial, according to historians.\n\nThat isn't to say that the threat of not going to heaven by exposure to swine hasn't been tried as a deterrent when fighting Muslims, but it's also important to note that the Moro Rebellion was not a religious war. It was a revolt against foreign occupation.\n\nAlso, as we should know today, not all people of one race, religion or creed are the same.\n\n\"The Ottomans under Sultan Abdul Hamid II sent a letter to the Sulu Moros asking them not to resist the Americans at the start of the Moro Rebellion, and the Moros on Sulu complied,\" Janda added in the 2016 PolitiFact article. \"It's a nice example of diplomacy working to our advantage, and a reminder that then and now, not all Muslims or Moros are the same and that many were and are U.S. allies.\"", "id": "9806040", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Trump repeats debunked Pershing pig's blood lie", "image": "http://www.metro.us/sites/default/files/main/articles/pershing_pigs_blood.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 557, "date": "2017-08-17", "amb": false, "textEnd": 572}, {"textStart": 821, "date": "2016-02-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 834}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "196726", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}, "id": "303057", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Islam"}, "id": "303218", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam"}, {"label": {"eng": "Religion"}, "id": "303332", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion"}, {"label": {"eng": "Muslim"}, "id": "303629", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "United States Army"}, "id": "306135", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army"}, {"label": {"eng": "Domestic pig"}, "id": "311266", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_pig"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pig"}, "id": "314033", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"}, {"label": {"eng": "PolitiFact.com"}, "id": "323532", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PolitiFact.com"}, {"label": {"eng": "Texas A&M University"}, "id": "325557", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_A&M_University"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kellyanne Conway"}, "id": "334092", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kellyanne_Conway"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mindanao"}, "id": "340021", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindanao"}, {"label": {"eng": "Religious war"}, "id": "347789", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_war"}, {"label": {"eng": "Moro people"}, "id": "350264", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moro_people"}, {"label": {"eng": "Spanish\u2013American War"}, "id": "438243", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish\u2013American_War"}, {"label": {"eng": "John J.

But the President implicitly endorsing atrocities against Muslims comes close.\n\nThat's what Donald Trump did on Thursday following the van attack, claimed by Islamic State, which killed a dozen people in Barcelona. \"Study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught,\" Trump tweeted. \"There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\"\n\nThe average person probably has no idea what Trump is talking about. But this is a reference to a historical myth that he repeated constantly on the campaign trail in spite of valiant efforts by historians and journalists to correct him. He is referring to efforts by Gen. John Pershing, later commander of U.S. forces in France during World War I, to suppress a Muslim revolt in the Philippines in the early years of the 20th century, at a time when that country was an American colony. This is the story as Trump told it last year:\n\n\"General Pershing was a rough guy, He caught 50 terrorists who did tremendous damage . . . and he took the 50 terrorists and he took 50 men and dipped 50 bullets in pig's blood. You heard about that? He took 50 bullets and dipped them in pig's blood. And he has his men load up their rifles and he lined up the 50 people and they shot 49 of those people. And the 50th person, he said, you go back to your people and you tell them what happened. And for 25 years there wasn't a problem.\"\n\nThere is, in fact, no evidence that Pershing ever committed any such atrocity in his battles against the so-called Moros -- the ancestors of the Muslim fighters who continue to fight against the central government in Manila to this day.\n\n\"This story is a fabrication and has long been discredited,\" says Brian McAllister Linn, a Texas A&M University historian who is one of the foremost scholars of the Philippine War. \"I am amazed it is still making the rounds.\"\n\nWhile some U.S. troops did commit atrocities in the Philippines such as the use of the \"water cure\" (i.e., waterboarding), Pershing was known for being more enlightened and more successful. As I wrote in \"The Savage Wars of Peace: Small Wars and the Rise of American Power,\" \"Captain Pershing preferred to win over the Moros with outstretched hand rather than mailed fist. So successful was his campaign that he was made a datto, or chieftain.\"\n\nIn other words, Pershing pursued precisely the kind of \"hearts and minds\" policy that has become a hallmark of the \"population-centric\" counterinsurgency strategy that U.S. commanders, including Gens. H.R. McMaster, Jim Mattis, and John Kelly, have employed in recent years in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nWhat's deeply troubling here is not only that Trump continues to lie about an issue where he has been corrected time and again. It is that he is advocating that those fighting Islamist terrorists -- including our own troops -- commit atrocities such as executing prisoners and burying them with pig's blood. As it happens I am currently in Iraq, where U.S. troops are having a great deal of success in helping Iraqi forces to battle ISIS while keeping their honor clean.\n\nUp in Erbil, in the Kurdish region not far from Mosul, I actually asked on Thursday a U.S. Air Force colonel who is directing air strikes against ISIS in support of Iraqi army operations whether he has taken to heart Trump's injunction to \"bomb the shit\" out of the enemy. \"No, sir,\" he told me. \"We follow the laws of armed conflict. Proportionality, proportionality, proportionality.\"\n\nWhat he meant is that the use of force has to be proportionate to the threat and designed to minimize the risk of civilian casualties. There are even lawyers sitting in every U.S. operations center, including the one in Erbil, to make sure that air strikes comply with the laws of war.\n\nThis is apparently an alien concept to the commander in chief, but it is part and parcel of how the U.S. military operates -- and it is not an obstacle to defeating the enemy but an essential condition to that end. When U.S. forces have committed war crimes of the kind that Trump advocates -- whether at My Lai or Abu Ghraib -- the news has always gotten out and undermined support for the U.S. war effort. Leaving aside morality -- an alien concept for Trump -- it is simply stupid for our troops to engage in unlawful conduct because doing so will lead to mission failure.\n\nIt is deeply troubling that after more than six months in office Trump still does not understand this. It is further evidence, if any were needed, that he is unfit to be President.\n\nBoot is a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and author of the forthcoming book, \"The Road Not Taken:

Pershing that Trump repeatedly recounted in his speeches on the campaign trail.\n\n\"He took fifty bullets, and he dipped them in pig's blood,\" Trump said at a rally in South Carolina in February 2016. \"And he had his men load his rifles and he lined up the fifty people, and they shot 49 of those people. And the fiftieth person he said 'You go back to your people and you tell them what happened.' And for 25 years there wasn't a problem, okay?\"\n\nHistorians have said this particular story about John J. Pershing, the World War I-era general, is not based on historical evidence and appears to have been spread by chain emails.\n\nTrump said at the time the moral of the story was: \"We better start getting tough and we better start getting vigilant, and we better start using our heads or we're not gonna have a country, folks.\"\n\nIslam, like Judaism, forbids the consumption of pork.\n\nTrump's tweet came hours after a car crashed into a crowd in Barcelona, Spain. Authorities there have labeled the incident a terrorist attack and taken a suspect into custody.\n\nIn addition to celebrating what would be tantamount to a war crime, Trump's claim that such tactics ended terrorism is also inaccurate. The unrest he cited continued long afterwards and was rooted in conflict over colonial rule.\n\nRelated: Donald Trump Tells 'Pig's Blood' Bullets Tale at S.C. Rally\n\nTrump's former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski later told the Washington Post that the story was planned ahead of time as an \"analogy\" and that its accuracy was incidental to its political value.\n\nThe story faded quickly at the time, since Trump first delivered the Pershing anecdote at the peak of the Republican primaries while feuding with Pope Francis, among other high-profile stories. It comes now amid a national debate over the president's moral authority and stance on extremism after a white nationalist attack in Charlottesville, Virginia on Saturday.\n\nA number of Republican leaders have criticized Trump in recent days for defending certain \"very fine people\" who marched with white supremacists and neo-Nazis and chanted \"Jews will not replace us\" and Hitler-era slogans the night before the car-ramming attack, which claimed the life of 32-year old counter-protester Heather Heyer.\n\nRepublican leaders have broken with Trump in the past over previous comments that appeared to endorse war crimes, including Trump's call to target family members of suspected terrorists and use torture to acquire information or simply because they \"deserve it anyway.\" Trump said he has not tried to institute torture as president on the advice of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who opposes its use.", "id": "9775212", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Trump

John J. Pershing allegedly eradicated terrorism in the early 1900s. However, Trump's claim that Pershing shot terrorists with bullets dipped in pigs blood during the Philippine-American war has been largely debunked. So, what is Gen. Pershing actually famous for?\n\nWhile Pershing had a lengthy military career, he is perhaps most famous for commanding the American Expeditionary Force during World War I. A year after the war ended, Congress approved then-President Woodrow Wilson to recognize Pershing for his service by promoting him to \"General of the Armies.\" Pershing is one of only two people (the other having been George Washington) to have ever been promoted to this prestigious rank.\n\nBorn near Laclede, Missouri, in 1860, Pershing did not always have military ambitions. According to Biography.com, Pershing worked as a teacher for more than two years before he decided to sit for the exam required for entry to West Point. With his graduation from West Point in 1886, Pershing began his nearly four-decade long military career.\n\nPrior to his service in World War I, Pershing fought in the Spanish-American War and in the Philippine-American War along with leading the Mexican Expedition to capture Pancho Villa during the Mexican Revolution.\n\nAs America entered World War I in 1917, Pershing was named commander in chief of the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) and although the AEF was initially expected to merely bolster depleted European troops, Pershing argued they would be more effective as an independent army. On Sept. 12, 1918, Pershing led the AEF in its first major offensive as an independent army on European soil in the Battle of Saint-Mihiel. He would go on to lead the AEF into other battles, including the Battle of Cantigny and the Meuse-Argonne offensive, which hastened the end of the war.\n\nFollowing the end of World War I, Pershing served as U.S. Army Chief of Staff from 1921 to 1924 before retiring from active service at the age of 64. In his later years, Pershing published an autobiography entitled My Experiences in the World War, which earned him a Pulitzer Prize in 1932.\n\nOn July 15, 1948, at the age of 87, Pershing died in his sleep while reportedly recovering from a stroke. He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery and continues to be one of American history's most honored and revered soldiers.", "id": "9863249", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "The Reason General Pershing Is Famous Isn't What Trump Thinks It Is", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/uploads/getty/2017/8/17/69fc1ca5-eead-4b0a-adfe-9cf97da7165c-getty-688317052.jpg?w=1200&h=630&auto=format&fm=jpg&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 1627, "date": "2012-09-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1635}, {"textStart": 2212, "date": "2015-07-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 2219}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}, "id": "304059", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "Commander-in-chief"}, "id": "305558", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander-in-chief"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pulitzer Prize"}, "id": "308445", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulitzer_Prize"}, {"label": {"eng": "World War I"}, "id": "309993", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mexican Revolution"}, "id": "328596", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Revolution"}, {"label": {"eng": "Woodrow Wilson"}, "id": "333334", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson"}, {"label": {"eng": "George Washington"}, "id": "337858", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington"}, {"label": {"eng": "United States Military Academy"}, "id": "348000", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Military_Academy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pancho Villa"}, "id": "377955", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancho_Villa"}, {"label": {"eng": "Spanish\u2013American War"}, "id": "438243", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish\u2013American_War"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chief of Staff of the United States Army"}, "id": "465787", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_Staff_of_the_United_States_Army"}, {"label": {"eng": "John J.

According to legend, Pershing told the 50th Muslim to take one of those bullets back to his people as a warning of what would happen should they persist. \"Okay? Twenty-five years, there wasn't a problem\".\n\nEven if we put aside Trump's strained relationship with reality, let's not lose sight of the underlying point the president is eager to emphasize: in his mind, war crimes and mass executions are effective and worthwhile elements of an effective national security strategy.\n\n\"The bodies were publicly buried in the same grave with a dead pig\", Pershing wrote.", "id": "9830205", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Trump recycles discredited Islamic pigs' blood tale after terrorist attack in Barcelona", "image": null, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 468, "date": "2016-02-19", "amb": false, "textEnd": 485}, {"textStart": 920, "date": "2016-02-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 933}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "67", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charleston"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "196346", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charleston,_South_Carolina", "label": {"eng": "Charleston"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "North Charleston"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "196621", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Charleston,_South_Carolina", "label": {"eng": "North Charleston"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Archipelago"}, "id": "302673", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archipelago"}, {"label": {"eng": "Internet"}, "id": "302869", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}, "id": "303057", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}, "id": "303279", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin"}, {"label": {"eng": "Muslim"}, "id": "303629", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim"}, {"label": {"eng": "World War II"}, "id": "303819", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "id": "305969", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Islamophobia"}, "id": "313196", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamophobia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Waterboarding"}, "id": "342942", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterboarding"}, {"label": {"eng": "Snopes.com"}, "id": "347247", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snopes.com"}, {"label": {"eng": "Spanish\u2013American War"}, "id": "438243", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish\u2013American_War"}, {"label": {"eng": "Religious fanaticism"}, "id": "474310", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_fanaticism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Philippine\u2013American War"}, "id": "710714", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine\u2013American_War"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 161, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 286, "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Time Period", "uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Time_Period"}], "time": "19:58:00"}

There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\n\n-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 17, 2017\n\nHe's referring to stories about Pershing's campaign in the Philippines against Muslim rebels at the start of the 20th century. Many a right-wing blog post and email chain since 9/11 has featured tales of Pershing using pigs or pig's blood to terrify the Islamic enemy into submission, sending them into the afterlife with the promise of damnation after they'd been tainted by an unclean animal. The most famous story, told by Trump himself on the campaign trail last year, involves Pershing supposedly having 50 bullets dipped in pig's blood in preparation for executing Muslim fighters. He had 49 shot, then freed the 50th so that he could go warn the rest of his comrades what the U.S. had in store for them if they continued fighting. Allegedly they quaked in horror, were pacified, and the Philippines had no \"Muslim problem\" for decades. It's a parable about the foolishness of political correctness, especially in war. If you want to beat a vicious enemy, you fight as dirty as you need to. If that means turning their religious beliefs against them, go for it.\n\nTthere's no evidence that that specific incident happened. There are reports of intimidation tactics involving pigs being used in that conflict, though. Pershing himself wrote that another American commander had had a dead pig buried with Muslim rebels. (\"It was not pleasant to have to take such measures, but the prospect of going to hell instead of heaven sometimes deterred the would-be assassins.\") Another commander told Pershing in a letter, \"I understand it has long been a custom to bury (insurgents) with pigs when they kill Americans.\" Sean Davis notes a report of Pershing having prisoners sprinkled with pig's blood and bringing a pig's head to a negotiation with a Muslim leader. The \"50 bullets\" story may be apocryphal but using pigs as a religious weapon probably isn't. Maybe Trump got wind of that since last year and made his tweet about Pershing today less specific for that reason. Or maybe he still thinks the \"50 bullets\" story is true but just ran out of characters in his tweet.\n\nAgain, though, all of this is beside the point. The point is that he's all talk. No one seriously believes he'd try to implement a policy like this, of using pigs in Afghanistan to intimidate the Taliban. It wouldn't work, for one thing. Jihadis would get propaganda mileage out of it; the tactic might end up boosting their numbers rather than pacifying them. But even if it did work, Trump wouldn't give the order. Mattis, McMaster, Kelly, Dunford and other officers wouldn't implement it if he did, and they'd almost certainly be able to talk him out of doing it if he ever semi-seriously proposed it. Remember, talking tough about waterboarding was one of Trump's signatures during the primaries as a way of showing voters that he wouldn't be soft on the enemy the way the other politically correct Republican candidates were. Then he got elected and talked to Mattis, and presto change-o -- he wasn't for waterboarding anymore. He isn't for deploying pig's blood either. This is just blowhard-ery he puts out for his fans to signal \"toughness\" with no intention of acting on it. True to his past, it's a show. Imagine spending 15 years after 9/11 talking about taking off the gloves with jihadis, getting elected president of the United States, and your main initiative to actually take off those gloves is tweeting.\n\nJulius Krein is, or was, a hardcore Trump fan who founded the website Journal of American Greatness last year to advocate for Trumpian nationalism and then founded the magazine American Affairs to put some meat on the bone policy-wise. Today he has an op-ed in the Times declaring that he's done:\n\nYet after more than 200 days in office, Mr. Trump's behavior grows only more reprehensible. Meanwhile, his administration has no significant legislative accomplishments -- and no apparent plan to deliver any. Wilbur Ross's Commerce Department has advanced some sensible and appropriately incremental changes to trade policy, but no long-term agenda has been articulated. Senators Tom Cotton and David Perdue's recently proposed legislation offers a sound basis for reforming immigration policy, but seems to have no prospects and has received comparatively little attention. The administration inexplicably downgraded infrastructure and corporate tax reform -- issues with potentially broad-based support -- to pursue a warmed-over version of Paul Ryan's Obamacare repeal, which ended, predictably, in a humiliating failure.\n\nNothing disastrous has occurred on the foreign policy front -- yet -- but the never-ending chaos within the administration hardly inspires confidence. Many senior-level appointees are still not in place, including the assistant secretaries of state, for example. And too many of those who are in office appear to be petty, clueless, and rather repulsive ideologues, like Steve Bannon, who seem to spend most of their time accusing one another of being \"swamp creatures.\" It's pathetic. No wonder an increasing number of officials are simply ignoring the president, an alarming but understandable development.\n\nThe Trumpian bargain on the right last year was that the policy payoffs would more than make up for his personal peccadilloes. He's going to fart out nonsense on Twitter but he's also going to get you ObamaCare repeal, tax reform, a jobs stimulus in the form of a giant new infrastructure bill, and all sorts of other goodies. You'll take the bitter with the sweet. He delivered on Gorsuch but that's basically been it -- it's all bitter Twitter nonsense and West Wing chaos. The Pershing tweet is almost an unintentional parody of his own ineffectiveness.

And for 25 years, there wasn't a problem,\" Trump reportedly said in February 2016.\n\nHowever, historians have determined that the tangible evidence of that actually happening is non-existent, according to Politifact.\n\nIn addition to spreading false accounts of history, Trump's reaction to Barcelona's tragedy completely contradicts how he handled the events that took place in Virginia.\n\nTrump's initial generic response did not even address the white supremacists that incited the violence in Charlottesville. Instead, it took him 48 hours after the ordeal to explicitly denounce neo-Nazis and white nationalists.\n\nIn a press conference, the president stated that he \"wanted to see the facts,\" before responding to Charlottesville, yet he wasted no time stalling for \"facts\" before deeming the Barcelona attack an act of terrorism.\n\nAdditionally, Trump failed to call the crash that killed Heather Heyer an act of terror. In fact, he didn't mention the vehicle attack at all in his press conference during which he placed blame on \"many sides\" for the violent uproar.\n\nWhat is the stark difference between the Charlottesville crash and Barcelona's?

Here it is:\n\nStudy what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught. There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\nTrump is almost certainly referring to a story he told during the campaign. He claimed that General John J. Pershing crushed an Islamic insurgency in the Philippines by committing a heinous war crime. Here's Trump at a South Carolina rally:\n\nThey were having terrorism problems, just like we do,\" Trump said. \"And he caught 50 terrorists who did tremendous damage and killed many people. And he took the 50 terrorists, and he took 50 men and he dipped 50 bullets in pigs' blood -- you heard that, right? He took 50 bullets, and he dipped them in pigs' blood. And he had his men load his rifles, and he lined up the 50 people, and they shot 49 of those people. And the 50th person, he said: You go back to your people, and you tell them what happened. And for 25 years, there wasn't a problem. Okay? Twenty-five years, there wasn't a problem\n\nThere are multiple problems with this story. First, it's false. There's no evidence Pershing did such a thing. In fact, he got the history exactly backwards. Pershing worked hard to avoid inflaming religious fanaticism and worked hard to avoid unnecessary loss of life. For example, read this excerpt from a letter Pershing wrote to the insurgents. The language comes from his own memoir:\n\nI write you this letter because I am sorry to know that you and your people refuse to do what the government has ordered. You do not give up your arms. Soldiers were sent to Taglibi so that you could come into camp and turn in your guns. When the soldiers went to camp a Taglibi, your Moros fired into camp and tried to kill the soldiers. Then the soldiers had to shoot all Moros who fired upon them. When the soldiers marched through the country, the Moros again shot at them, so the soldiers had to kill several others. I am sorry the soldiers had to kill any Moros. All Moros are the same to me as my children and no father wants to kill his own children.\n\nThose are not the words of a man who commits a religious war crime. A comprehensive report over at Snopes contains a number of other, similar reports in Pershing's own words. Simply put, Trump libeled an American hero, the man who led American troops through the crucible of the First World War. The president who relentlessly attacks \"fake news\" keeps advancing \"fake history.\"\n\nTrump isn't just spreading falsehoods, he's doing so in a context that puts a presidential stamp of approval on war crimes. Even worse, he's doing it in direct defiance of the warrior ethos of the American military. There is no possible way that any of Trump's generals would approve of this sentiment. I've never met an American officer who would carry out an order to commit an atrocity like this.\n\nTrump is careening out of control. He says what he wants, when he wants, and neither truth nor consistency nor wisdom nor prudence dictates a single syllable that comes out of his mouth. By many accounts he's taken to directly defying his advisers simply for the sake of declaring that he's in charge. This isn't leadership. It's a collection of temper tantrums. Unfortunately, those tantrums have consequences.\n\nOne final note - if Trump thinks this tweet is the least bit intimidating to actual jihadists, he's fundamentally wrong. In fact, it illustrates that he flat-out doesn't understand our enemy. They respond to actions not words, and words like this serve only to facilitate the radicalization of angry jihadist minds.\n\nIn one tweet Trump spread fake history, libeled an American hero, and signaled a willingness - even eagerness - to commit war crimes. That's conduct unbecoming the lowliest officer in the military.

There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\nThe tweet echoed a highly controversial claim Trump made at an election rally in South Carolina in February 2016, in which he talked admiringly about a counter-insurgency in the Philippines conducted by Gen John Pershing between 1909 and 1913, when he was governor of Moro province.\n\n\"They were having terrorism problems just like we do,\" Trump said. \"And he caught 50 terrorists who did tremendous damage and killed many people. And he took the 50 terrorists, and he took 50 men, and he dipped 50 bullets in pig's blood.\"\n\nHe claimed that Pershing then \"had his men load his rifles and he lined up the 50 people, and they shot 49 of those people. And the 50th person, he said, 'You go back to your people and you tell them what happened.'\"\n\nIn 2016, Trump claimed such mass executions ended the Islamic insurgency for a quarter-century. \"Twenty-five years, there wasn't a problem,\" he said. In his new tweet he revised that estimated upward to 35 years.\n\nThis account of Pershing's actions has circulated on the internet since 2001 but historians say there is very little if any evidence to support it, and Trump was denounced for his support of mass killing aggravated by racist insults. But the outburst solidified his support among the US far right, and did nothing to impede his victory in the Republican primaries and then the election last November. Trump appears to have had domestic politics in mind when he sent out his tweet in response to the Barcelona attack.\n\nHis relationship with that section of his support has come under renewed scrutiny since the attack on a crowd in Charlottesville, Virginia, by a white supremacist on Saturday. It took him two days to assign blame directly on the far right, only to contradict himself the next day with a claim that \"both sides\" were to blame for the incident.\n\nTrump was much faster in pointing the finger of blame in the wake of Barcelona, but his erratic response echoed the controversy over Charlottesville, in which conventional political language, apparently drafted by aides, has alternated with a personal gut reaction that has had an explosive and divisive effect.\n\nThe French president, Emmanuel Macron, appeared to take on Trump in his Twitter reaction to the Barcelona attack. An initial tweet offered solidarity for the victims of and the pledge: \"We remain united and determined.\"\n\nBefore Trump took to Twitter, the US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, said the administration stood ready to help Spanish law enforcement and national authorities and advised Americans in Spain to call home to reassure relatives.\n\n\"Terrorists around the world should know that the United States and our allies are resolved to find you and bring you to justice,\" Tillerson said.\n\nIn the UK, Theresa May, said: \"My thoughts are with the victims of today's terrible attack in Barcelonaand the emergency services responding to this ongoing incident.\n\n\"The UK stands with Spain against terror,\" she added.\n\nThe UK foreign secretary, Boris Johnson said he was \"concerned and saddened\" by the attack and said the foreign office was \"doing all we can to identify whether Brits need help\".\n\nSadiq Khan, the London mayor who has had to handle a string of recent terrorist attacks in Westminster, London Bridge and Finsbury Park, wrote on Twitter: \"\"My thoughts are with the victims of this barbaric terrorist attack in the great city of Barcelona and with their brave emergency services.\n\n\"London stands with Barcelonaagainst the evil of terrorism.\"\n\nThe Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, tweeted about the \"terrible reports from Barcelona\", saying: \"My thoughts are with those killed and injured, and the emergency services working to save lives.\"\n\nAnd the German foreign minister, Sigmar Gabriel, said he was \"deeply shocked\" by the incident. He added: \"Our sympathies are with the victims and their relatives and friends.\"", "id": "9813856", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Trump responds to Barcelona attack by reviving

In Barcelona, a speeding rented van plowed through people in a popular pedestrian plaza, killing 13 and injuring more than 100. Two terror suspects were arrested, but the driver of the van escaped.\n\nLater, an attack was thwarted in the coastal town of Cambrils, about 75 miles south of Barcelona. Five attackers were killed and six people were injured. Suicide belts worn by the attackers were detonated by police. The two incidents are believed to be linked.\n\nISIS has claimed responsibility for the Barcelona attack. It marks the deadliest terror attack in Spain since 2004, when bombs were placed in Madrid commuter trains, killing nearly 200 people.\n\nAccording to NBC News, the Barcelona plaza incident was the sixth vehicle-based terror attack in Europe in the past 13 months. It could have been even worse. The terror suspect who rented the van, reportedly wanted to rent a truck instead.\n\nVehicles have become terrorists new favorite weapon of mass destruction. Instead of expensive, sophisticated, long-planned operations like the 9/11 attack, ISIS has urged its terror cells and ISIS inspired lone wolfs to use easily attainable weapons to carry out smaller scale, but still deadly, terror attacks. Ever since then, their have been multiple attacks using vehicles to drive into crowds.\n\nAt the white supremacist rally in Charlottesvile, Virgina, an alleged Nazi-sympathizer used the ISIS tactic to plow his car into counter-protesters, killing Heather Heyer and injuring over 30 people. In 2016, a car plowed into pedestrians on The Ohio State University campus.\n\nPresident Trump responded to the Barcelona attack far quicker than he did the deadly violence in Charlottesville. But as with Charlottesville, his response was haphazard. Trump followed a tweet that gave the a standard presidential response with a tweet that spread a debunked, racially-tinged fake story about General Pershing fighting Muslim insurgents in the Philippines in the early 1900's\n\nFirst Trump tweeted:\n\n\"The United States condemns the terror attack in Barcelona, Spain, and will do whatever is necessary to help. Be tough & strong, we love you!\"\n\nThen Trump tweeted:\n\n\"Study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught. There was o more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years.!\"\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump told a rally crowd about Pershing having Muslim insurgents in the Philippines executed with bullets dipped in pigs blood. Pointing out to the crowd that Muslims have religion-based diet restrictions against pork. \"He lined up the 50 people and they shot 49 of those people. And the 50th person, he said, you go back to your people and you tell them what happened . And for 25 years there wasn't a problem,\" Trump told the crowd.\n\nThe Pershing story is a debunked, email chain myth, but it fits with Trump's Islamophobic narrative and rhetoric. Trump's daughter, son-in-law, and grand children also have religion-based diet restrictions as observant Jews.\n\nTrump endangered Americans when he emboldened the white supremacists and Nazi wannabes marching in Charlottesville. He further endangered Americans by damaging the credibility of the presidency by propagating a fake Islamophobic story that will just further provoke and embolden terrorists, and helps ISIS efforts to spread anti-U.S. sentiment.\n\nThe darkness of the solar eclipse will only be temporary. Unfortunately that's not the case with the Terrorism eclipse and the Trump eclipse.", "id": "9873397", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Barcelona terror attack and Trump's response:

(The degree to which the group communicated with attackers beforehand, if at all, remains to be seen.) It was the deadliest such incident in Spain since the 2004 Madrid train bombings that killed nearly 200 people, and world leaders responded with a wave of solidarity and sympathy. Initially, U.S. President Donald Trump seemed to join in.\n\n\"The United States condemns the terror attack in Barcelona, Spain, and will do whatever is necessary to help,\" he tweeted, shortly after. Later, he added \"Be tough & strong, we love you!\"\n\nWithin 45 minutes, the president had changed his tone, directing followers to Google the work of early 20th Century U.S. General John Pershing.\n\nPresumably, Trump meant to direct readers to the claim that in 1911, during the Spanish-American War, Pershing had put down a Muslim insurgency in the Philippines by forcing a group six rebels to watch them kill six of their comrades, using bullets dipped in pig fat, then wrapped their corpses in pigskin and entrails -- a desecration, given that pork products are forbidden in Islam. Trump's own version of the tale, which he told often on the campaign trail, inflated the number to 49 Muslims being killed with \"bullets dipped in pigs' blood,\" and one lone survivor left to warn his people.\n\nAccording to Snopes, the urban legend fact-checking service, any version of the story is false. Snopes found no reference to the incident in any of Pershing's biographies. Furthermore, it could not find evidence that he executed any Muslims or Moros during this rebellion. Instead, Pershing made a specific effort to prevent them from taking radical action: rather than storming the sacred mountain where they had hoped to make a last stand, he simply surrounded the hill and cut off their supplies. \"The fact is that they were completely surprised at the prompt and decisive action of the troops in cutting off supplies and preventing escape,\" he wrote in his official report of the battle, per Snopes, \"and they were chagrined and disappointed in that they were not encouraged to die the death of Mohammedan fanatics.\"\n\nAs Americans have learned in recent months, though, facts do not particularly matter to Donald Trump.

As the Washington Post explained at the time, it was an apocryphal tale of a tactic Pershing was supposed to have used against Muslim insurgents when the United States controlled the Philippines:\n\n\"They were having terrorism problems, just like we do,\" Trump said. \"And he caught 50 terrorists who did tremendous damage and killed many people. And he took the 50 terrorists, and he took 50 men and he dipped 50 bullets in pigs' blood -- you heard that, right? He took 50 bullets, and he dipped them in pigs' blood. And he had his men load his rifles, and he lined up the 50 people, and they shot 49 of those people. And the 50th person, he said: You go back to your people, and you tell them what happened. And for 25 years, there wasn't a problem. Okay? Twenty-five years, there wasn't a problem.\"\n\nThis was part of Trump's \"torture works\" argument for engaging in despicable and illegal torture of terrorism suspects.\n\nAt the time, fact checkers consulted historians and found little credence in the tale:\n\n\"This story is a fabrication and has long been discredited,\" said Brian McAllister Linn, a Texas A&M University historian and author of Guardians of Empire: The U.S. Army and the Pacific, 1902-1940. \"I am amazed it is still making the rounds.\"\n\nThat hasn't kept Trump from repeating it once again.\n\nI don't know what's worse: the president of the United States for a second time repeating this b.s. legend in the disreputable cause of endorsing torture; or the president of the United States encouraging antiterrorism tactics based on religious insults.\n\nThe common thread connecting Trump's explosions this week is that he's pretty clearly broken whatever restraints his staff and his advisers had earlier imposed, and is enjoying himself as the exponent of the brutal, bigoted views that made him such a scandalous figure on the campaign trail last year.

He waited just over two hours to decry the bloodshed as a \"terror attack.\"\n\nThe swift finger pointing as the tragedy was still unfolding stood in stark contrast to his controversial and slow public reaction to violence in Charlottesville, Va., over the weekend.\n\nAt least 13 dead in Barcelona van attack claimed by ISIS\n\n39 photos view gallery New Yorkers protest Trump's response to Charlottesville\n\nBy comparison, hours passed on Saturday as white nationalists clashed with counter-protesters before Trump tweeted: \"Charlottesville sad!\"\n\nHe later blamed \"many sides\" for the violence at the rally where 32-year-old paralegal Heather Heyer was killed by a suspected neo-Nazi who drove through a crowd of counter-protesters, and would not refer to what happened as terrorism.\n\nAmid intense criticism, Trump relented and issued a stronger statement condemning the Klansmen, neo-Nazis and white supremacists at the rally two days later.\n\nOn Tuesday, he defiantly defended his decision to wait to condemn the hate groups by saying that \"before I make a statement, I like to know the facts.\"\n\n3 dead, 34 injured in violent rally, crashes in Charlottesville\n\nBut Trump's turning to Twitter to issue responses before all the facts are known is a far more common occurrence than a metered acknowledgment of a tragedy -- especially if speculation about ISIS is involved.\n\nIn another tweet an hour after his first on the Barcelona attack, the President encouraged people to \"study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught. There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\"\n\n31 photos view gallery Van plows into crowds in Barcelona\n\nThe line was a reference to a debunked legend about World War I-era General John Pershing that Trump repeatedly recounted in his speeches on the campaign trail.\n\nIt also echoed his quick, shoot-from-the-hip reactions to a number of recent deadly incidents across the globe.\n\nMom of Charlottesville victim says daughter's cause won't stop\n\nSeveral times, Trump has characterized events as \"terrorist attacks\" long before authorities have issued officials statements, and not always accurately.\n\nIn June, Trump condemned an unfolding incident at a casino in the Philippines as a \"terrorist attack.\"\n\nAuthorities in Manila later said it wasn't -- it was a robbery gone bad involving a 42-year-old with a gambling problem who was deep in debt. Thirty-seven people died in the botched robbery from fires set by the crook.\n\nThat same month, Trump's knee-jerk reaction to a horrific attack on London Bridge that left seven dead and 48 injured earned him widespread criticism as he shared unconfirmed information, used the tragedy to champion his travel ban and then berated London mayor Sadiq Khan.\n\nNew York has no place for Charlottesville-style hate\n\nTrump retweeted a report labeling the carnage as terror-related before authorities in London characterized the nature of the attack.\n\nHe also chose to politicize the carnage, cheerleading his effort to bar people from several Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S.\n\n\"We need the courts to give us back our rights,\" he wrote. \"We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!\"\n\nFollowing the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando last June, Trump issued a tone deaf tweet saying, \"Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don't want congrats, I want toughness & vigilance.

There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\n\n-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 17, 2017\n\n* Trump used this story during the campaign.\n\nAs the crowd cheered him on, Trump told them about Pershing -- \"rough guy, rough guy\" -- who was fighting terrorism in the early 1900s. Trump didn't say where this happened, but variations of this story online usually state that it happened in the Philippines during the Philippine-American War -- part of the island nation's protracted battle for independence -- early in Pershing's career.\n\n\"They were having terrorism problems, just like we do,\" Trump said. \"And he caught 50 terrorists who did tremendous damage and killed many people. And he took the 50 terrorists, and he took 50 men and he dipped 50 bullets in pigs' blood -- you heard that, right? He took 50 bullets, and he dipped them in pigs' blood. And he had his men load his rifles, and he lined up the 50 people, and they shot 49 of those people. And the 50th person, he said: You go back to your people, and you tell them what happened. And for 25 years, there wasn't a problem. Okay? Twenty-five years, there wasn't a problem.\"\n\nThere is no truth to this story and since it's not the first time Trump has used it, we have every reason to believe that he's been fact-checked about it. He just doesn't give a damn.\n\n* Fairly early on in Trump's presidency, it became clear that he gets his news from right wing media. So Philip Bump came up with an interesting idea.\n\nMuch of what Trump learns about the world is filtered through two lenses: what he watches on cable news (particularly Fox) and what he sees on Twitter...\n\nUsers of Twitter will understand, however, that it can be tricky to know what someone else sees when he or she fires up the application. Everyone follows a different group of people, and that colors the information they receive.\n\nTo that end, we've created @trumps_feed, an account that checks whom Trump follows every five minutes and then retweets any new tweets from them over that period.\n\n* Remember when Trump talked about how the so-called \"alt-left\" was equally as violent in Charlottesville over the weekend as the Nazis and white supremacists? Well...last night there was another protest in Charlottesville. Only there was a big difference this time. The Nazis and white supremacists didn't attend. You'll never guess what happened.\n\nIn Charlottesville, a candlelight vigil was a striking peaceful contrast to torches wielded by white supremacists https://t.co/0Pk4MET66U pic.twitter.com/M9VnHLgHLq\n\n-- The New York Times (@nytimes) August 17, 2017\n\n* Another one bites the dust.\n\nPresident Donald Trump will not move forward with a planned Advisory Council on Infrastructure, a person familiar with the matter said Thursday.\n\nThe infrastructure council, which was still being formed, would have advised Trump on his plan to spend as much as $1 trillion upgrading roads, bridges and other public works. Its cancellation follows Trump's announcement Wednesday that he was disbanding two other business advisory panels.\n\nCorporate chief executive officers this week had started to quit both the American Manufacturing Council and the Strategic and Policy Forum in protest over Trump's remarks that appeared to confer legitimacy on white supremacists following a violent rally Aug. 12 in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\n* I find myself agreeing with Josh Marshall a lot when he shares his observations about the current occupant of the White House.\n\nEverything we are seeing stems almost inevitably from the decisions the country made, collectively, last November. We elected a President driven by white racial grievance. That is the fulcrum and driving force of his politics. It's no surprise that a big outbreak of white supremacist violence would lead us to a moment like this. We also elected a President who is an abuser and a predator. I've analogized him before to an abusive man in an abused household - only his house is now the country, now with all the cumulative exhaustion, warped perceptions and damage that are the common lot of people living with and trapped with violent predators, addicts or people with certain profound mental illnesses.\n\nAs things get worse, as more people turn against him, Trump gets more wild and unbridled. He lashes out more aggressively. There's no kill switch on this escalating aggression. It only builds...\n\nTrump will clearly, happily destroy the GOP if he feels the party has proven disloyal to him...He would happily destroy the country too to sate his own anguished feelings of betrayal.\n\n* Finally, study the images in these three tweets very carefully and I bet you'll detect a pattern.\n\nBrutal cartoon from @guardian. pic.twitter.com/dydsPSzRqO\n\n-- Jason Febery

There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\"\n\nCampaign redux\n\nTrump thus stirred recollections of an unfounded internet tale he used on the campaign trail last year: that Gen. John Pershing, governor of the Moro province of the Philippines between 1909 and 1913, executed Muslim insurgents with bullets dipped in pigs' blood.\n\nAs told in 2016, the quiet epilogue lasted only 25 years, not 35. Now Trump can say truthfully that he only told others on Twitter to \"study\" what Pershing did -- the general did face insurgencies. But Trump never retracted or revised the pig's-blood myth.\n\nadvertisement | advertise on newsday\n\nWaiting for facts\n\nThe Pershing canard chafes against the president's credibility in two ways. One is his claim on Tuesday that he delayed a targeted denunciation of violent white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia, for two days because, unlike other pols, he wanted the facts first. His grasp of facts is again at issue.\n\nThe other problem is Trump's emphasis on actual history in opposing the removal of Confederate statues. \"You can't change history, but you can learn from it,\" he tweeted, echoing a familiar point in a very long-running debate over the icons.\n\n\"Robert E. Lee. Stonewall Jackson -- who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish.\" He decried \"the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart.\"\n\nBannon fodder\n\nTrump aide Steve Bannon owns the profile of a curious, well-read intellectual versatile enough to have made millions at Goldman Sachs and then craft a populist campaign for his boss.\n\nSo it's no shock that he contacted Robert Kuttner at the left-wing American Prospect to talk about their common views on one topic -- trade rivalry with China. Way more surprising was what he reportedly told Kuttner: \"There's no military solution [to North Korea's nuclear threats], forget it... There's no military solution here, they got us.\"\n\nRep. King: Fire away!The words might well serve Trump-loyal Bannon detractors. Rep. Peter King (R-Seaford) tweeted Thursday: \"How long can Trump Administration survive Bannon using race as political issue and undermining @POTUS and Cabinet on N Korea?\" Bannon also trash-talked White House rivals as \"wetting themselves\" and called white supremacists \"clowns\" and losers.\"Upping veterans' entitlements\n\nTrump at his Bedminister, New Jersey golf club privately signed into law a bill that gives military veterans unlimited access to college. The Forever GI Act removed a 15-year limit on using the benefits, effective immediately, as the Associated Press reports. Aid will be boosted by $3 billion over 10 years, officials said.\n\nWhat else is happening:Four were arrested in the toppling of a Confederate soldier statue in Durham, North Carolina.University of Arkansas professor Kyle Quinn was interviewed by NPR about hiding at a friend's house after internet vigilantes falsely branded him a neo-Nazi demonstrator.Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who was considered for a Cabinet post, said Trump \"has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence he needs to.\"Two other Senate critics, both

The bodies were publicly buried in the same grave with a dead pig. It was not pleasant to have to take such measures, but the prospect of going to hell instead of heaven sometimes deterred the would-be assassins.\"\n\nThese were the words of General Pershing in his autobiography. According to the New York Times (despite having reported on it at the time) it's a myth. The Washington Post agrees. They both cite fact checks by Politifact and Snopes. The problem with all the fact checks is... the facts.\n\nThe media has avoided the problem by consulting \"experts\" who tell them exactly what they want to hear. And what they want to hear is that it never happened. But not only was it written up in the New York Times, the Scientific American, a number of other publications, and mentioned by a number of other military officers, General Pershing had written about it.\n\nGeneral Pershing fell ill and died while working on his unpublished autobiography. The materials remained at the Library of Congress Manuscripts Division. Some contain his handwritten notes. They can be examined by the public.\n\nJohn T. Greenwood, who assembled, edited and published the manuscript, was the former chief of the Office of Medical History, Office of the Surgeon General, US Army. He is also the author of a number of other military history books.\n\nThe book was positively reviewed as a military studies text. It was published by the University of Kentucky Press. At no point in time, until this issue came up, did anyone question its legitimacy.\n\n\"So many who achieve great things become fixed in stone as monuments. My Life before the War is a reminder that John J. Pershing was a real, living, breathing man who lived through and shaped extraordinary times. For any with an interest in either the man or the times, this book is highly recommended.\" -- The Journal of Military History\n\n\"What distinguishes My Life Before the World War is the author's sense of service. It is not about Pershing the man but Pershing the public servant.\" -- The Historian\n\nA fascinating read. Pershing comes across as diplomatically and politically astute -- a far more nuanced officer than one gets from his standard biographers. -- Timothy K. Nenninger, editor of The Way of Duty, Honor, Country: The Memoir of General Charles Pelot Summerall\n\nA significant contribution to American military history. Pershing had a remarkable memory, and this memoir details his life from his childhood in a small Missouri town to his arrival at West Point and his military assignments across the globe. Greenwood's scholarship is excellent. -- Edward M. Coffman, author of The War to End All Wars: The American Military Experience in World War I\n\n\"To the resulting 366-page memoir, Greenwood has added a comprehensive, immaculately researched 143-page biographical appendix on officers and individuals, both American and international, whom Pershing interacted with over his lifetime. It is an invaluable contribution to the study of the US Army officer corps from 1886 to 1917. Greenwood includes no less than ten additional appendices: a lecture Pershing gave on his service in Cuba during the Spanish-American War, eight reports he made during operations against the Moros in the Philippine War, and one official investigation he conducted regarding a reverse sustained during operations in Mexico. Although these various supplements swell the volume to over seven hundred pages, they constitute a significant contribution to history in their own right. Exhaustive endnotes with Greenwood's extremely informative annotations comprise another sixty-eight pages. The book also features a comprehensive index and very fine maps. The University Press of Kentucky and the AUSA are to be congratulated for cartography far surpassing that found in most military histories published today.\" - Michigan War Studies Review\n\nAnd yet, those few history deniers who have bothered to address the autobiography have begun acting as if Greenwood were a shady character passing off some dubious papers as Pershing's own.", "id": "9857652",

Mit dem Blut der f\u00fcr gl\u00e4ubige Muslime unreinen Tiere sei ihnen der Weg ins Paradies versperrt gewesen. Trump: \"Danach gab es 35 Jahre keinen islamistischen Terror mehr!\"\n\nTrump hatte diese Legende bereits mehrfach im Wahlkampf 2016 zitiert. Laut Historikern gibt es keinerlei Anlass, die Geschichte um Pershing f\u00fcr wahr zu halten, die sich angeblich in den Jahren der Moro-Rebellion (1899-1913) zugetragen haben soll.\n\nTrump, der Medien die Verbreitung von gef\u00e4lschten Nachrichten (Fake News) vorwirft, interessierte sich schon im Wahlkampf nicht daf\u00fcr, dass seine Behauptung nicht wahr ist.

Trump legte der Welt nahe, im Kampf gegen Terrorismus die Methoden des US-Generals John Pershing zu studieren.\n\nEiner mehrfach widerlegten Legende nach soll Pershing vor mehr als 100 Jahren auf den Philippinen 50 muslimische Gefangene mit Projektilen exekutiert haben, die er zuvor in Schweineblut getaucht hatte. Mit dem Blut der f\u00fcr gl\u00e4ubige Muslime unreinen Tiere sei ihnen der Weg ins Paradies versperrt gewesen. Trump: \"Danach gab es 35 Jahre keinen islamistischen Terror mehr!\"\n\nTrump hatte diese Legende bereits mehrfach im Wahlkampf 2016 zitiert. Laut Historikern gibt es keinerlei Anlass, die Geschichte um Pershing f\u00fcr wahr zu halten, die sich angeblich in den Jahren der Moro-Rebellion (1899-1913) zugetragen haben soll.\n\nAnzeige\n\nTrump, der Medien die Verbreitung von gef\u00e4lschten Nachrichten (Fake News) vorwirft, interessierte sich schon im Wahlkampf nicht daf\u00fcr, dass seine Behauptung nicht wahr ist. Auch die moralisch fragw\u00fcrdige Ebene seiner Einlassungen und ein klarer Versto\u00df gegen das V\u00f6lkerrecht, h\u00e4tte Pershing denn tats\u00e4chlich so gehandelt wie behauptet, waren ihm gleichg\u00fcltig.\n\nIn zahlreichen Reaktionen auf Trumps Tweet hie\u00df es in sozialen Netzwerken und anderen Medien, w\u00e4hrend die Welt noch um die Toten von Barcelona trauere, verweise der Pr\u00e4sident der Vereinigten Staaten auf eine L\u00fcge, in der die Exekution Gefangener glorifiziert werde.\n\nDie \"New York Times\" schrieb, der US-Pr\u00e4sident lasse in offensichtlich gro\u00dfer Bedr\u00e4ngnis wieder ganz den ungez\u00fcgelten Wahlk\u00e4mpfer heraus. Andere US-Medien wiesen darauf hin, dass Trump nur Stunden gebraucht habe, um sich zu Barcelona in eindeutigster Weise zu positionieren. Dagegen wolle er die t\u00f6dliche Gewalt bei einer Rassistenkundgebung in Charlottesville auch nach mehr als f\u00fcnf Tagen nicht als Terrorismus brandmarken.\n\nAnzeige\n\nAbgesehen vom fehlenden Wahrheitsgehalt des Trump-Tweets wiesen Historiker auf die m\u00f6glicherweise weitreichenden Folgen hin, wenn ein Pr\u00e4sident der Vereinigten Staaten nahelege, man k\u00f6nne Terroristen nur mit brutalsten Kriegstechniken beikommen.\n\nIn einer ersten Reaktion auf Barcelona hatte Trump getwittert, die Vereinigten Staaten verurteilten die Terrorattacke. \"Bleibt stark und hart, wir lieben Euch!\"\n\nF\u00fcr Trump geht eine bemerkenswert schlechte Woche zu Ende. Ihm schl\u00e4gt besonders scharfe Kritik entgegen, weil er nach gewaltt\u00e4tigen Zusammenst\u00f6\u00dfen in Charlottesville Rassisten und Gegendemonstranten auf eine Stufe gestellt hatte. Kommentatoren sahen dies als Wendepunkt und potenziellen Bruch seiner Pr\u00e4sidentschaft. Andere verweisen darauf, dass Trump bisher alles politisch \u00fcberlebt hat.\n\nTrump beendete zwei Wirtschafts-Beratungsgremien im Wei\u00dfen Haus, bevor diese sich - als Reaktion auf seine Haltung zu Charlottesville - selber aufl\u00f6sen konnten. Ein drittes Gremium will Trump gar nicht mehr weiterplanen. Das belegt seine Entfremdung von der Wirtschaft.\n\nVonseiten der Republikaner kam die sch\u00e4rfste und direkteste Kritik vom prominenten US-Republikaner Bob Corker: \"Der Pr\u00e4sident war bisher nicht f\u00e4hig, die Stabilit\u00e4t oder etwas von der Kompetenz an den Tag zu legen, die er braucht, um erfolgreich zu sein\", sagte er.\n\nDer Senator sprach Trump das Verst\u00e4ndnis f\u00fcr das Wesen der USA ab. \"Er hat zuletzt nicht zu erkennen gegeben, dass er verstanden h\u00e4tte, was dieses Land gestern und heute gro\u00df gemacht hat\", sagte Corker.\n\nCorker (64) ist Senator von Tennessee. Der au\u00dfenpolitische Experte wurde 2016 als Kandidat f\u00fcr das Amt des Vizepr\u00e4sidenten unter Trump gehandelt. Er gilt als vergleichsweise besonnen und differenziert in seinen Wortmeldungen.\n\nIn Trumps Pr\u00e4sidentschaft seien radikale politische \u00c4nderungen n\u00f6tig, sagte Corker. Trump m\u00fcsse aufh\u00f6ren, sich selbst so wichtig zu nehmen, sagte Corker. Der Pr\u00e4sident d\u00fcrfe nicht jeden Morgen aufwachen und erstmal dar\u00fcber nachdenken, was f\u00fcr ihn selbst gut sei.\n\nAuch andere Senatoren r\u00fcckten von Trump ab.\n\nVideo des Corker-Interviews bei Facebook", "id": "9900078", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Schweineblut-Legende: Entsetzte Reaktionen auf Trump-Tweet -

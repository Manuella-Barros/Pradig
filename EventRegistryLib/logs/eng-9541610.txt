Kim K donned a black dress and some champagne as she made her way to the stage to roast the Hall of Fame quarterback. The reality star then proceeded to get relentlessly booed by the crowd.\n\nThe audience at the Kia Forum in Los Angeles booed her very loudly when she started to address fellow presenter Kevin Hart. Kardashian appeared embarrassed and furious at the backlash over her attendance at the event. The boos were obviously not expected by Kim K, but she had to compose herself and deliver her roasts to Brady. The jeering eventually went away, and she was able to get into her set. Despite the boos, she uncomfortably hung in there and addressed the rumors she and Tom Brady dated, among other things.\n\nRead More: Kim Kardashian & Bianca Censori Hang Out Together At Kanye West's Latest Show\n\nKim Kardashian brought up the rumors that she and Brady were formerly romantically involved. \"Speaking of Tom and I dating, I know there were some rumors that we were, and I'd never say if we did or not, I'd just release the tape,\" she joked of the dating rumors.

However, the crowd wasn't very receptive to Kardashian's appearance and participation in the roast.

Kevin Hart had to legit tell people to stop. I f****ng love it.

Both refuted the claims of a possible relationship, which Kardashian brought up during her time on stage. However, not everyone in attendance at the Netflix event was a big fan of the reality star.\n\nWhat did Kim Kardashian say during the Tom Brady roast?\n\nComedian Kevin Hart hosted the \"G.R.O.A.T.\", better known as the \"Greatest Roast of All Time.\" He settled the crowd down after Kim Kardashian was relentlessly booed upon walking up to the stage.\n\nWhen she finally began her monologue, Kardashian made a joke about the rumors of her and Brady dating:\n\n\"I'm really here tonight for Tom. I wasn't going to come tonight, but since I'm not here as Tom's date, there's still a good chance I might.\"\n\nShe then went on to compare the seven-time Super Bowl-winning quarterback to her former stepparent, Caitlyn Jenner and how much Tom Brady reminds her of them:\n\n\"An ex-athlete, high cheekbones, silky hair... You remind me too much of my stepdad now.\"\n\nKim Kardashian continued with that sentiment by saying:\n\n\"I know the transition from the NFL must've been really hard, but I think my stepdad is a great example for you. She's one of the best athletes in the world, who proved you could do anything in this next chapter in your life. You can become a commentator, a far-right Republican, or even a strong, confident woman.\"\n\nTom Brady got his own jab at Kim Kardashian when he made a joke that she was nervous about leaving her kids at home with Kanye West.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bethany_cohen@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Bethany Cohen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Portnoy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "David Portnoy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Goodell", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roger Goodell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roast_(comedy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roast (comedy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kim Kardashian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barstool_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barstool Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-list", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "A-list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reality television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlyn_Jenner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caitlyn Jenner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kanye West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Jokes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Jokes", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/ac9dd-17150236861667-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541610", "eventUri": "eng-9541610", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

However, the audience's response to Kim Kardashian felt like an entirely separate roast in its own right.\n\nAs the reality star and SKIMS founder took the stage at the Greatest Roast of All Time: Tom Brady special -- a live roast that aired unedited on Netflix as part of their Netflix Is a Joke comedy festival -- she was greeted with loud, jeering and boos.\n\nKardashian weathered the storm of booing and yelling -- which was met by a round of cheering, to try and drown out the haters -- and eventually the boos subsided, allowing Kardashian to continue.\n\nDuring her roast set, she poked fun at several people -- including fellow roaster Kevin Hart -- before she finally addressed her rumored romance with Brady for the first time.\n\n\"I'm really here tonight for Tom,\" shared Kardashian, holding a glass of wine. \"I wasn't going to come tonight, but since I'm not here as Tom's date, there's still a good chance I might.\"\n\n\"Speaking of Tom and I dating, I know there were some rumors that we were, and I'd never say if we did or not. I'd just release the tape,\" Kardashian continued.\n\nShe also quipped that she and Brady wouldn't have worked as a couple, because he reminds her too much of Caitlyn Jenner.\n\n\"I do know it would never work out. An ex-athlete, high cheekbones, silky hair -- you remind me too much of my stepdad now,\" Kardashian said. \"Part of me thinks you would try to undress me, just to try on my clothes.\"\n\nBrady and Kardashian were briefly romantically linked in June 2023, shortly after Brady's divorce from Gisele B\u00fcndchen in October 2022 -- which was also the subject of considerable trolling during Sunday's special.\n\nKardashian got one final, sizable laugh as she wrapped up by evoking her late father, Robert Kardashian Sr., and his role on O.J. Simpson's legal team.\n\n\"Honestly, it's hard for me to watch people roast you,\" Kardashian said, \"but I think enough of my family members have defended former football players.\"\n\nAfter three hours of getting brutally roasted, Brady himself took the stage at the end of the night, and jokingly fired back at Kardashian with a savage burn that surprised the crowd.\n\n\"I know Kim was terrified to be here tonight,\" Brady began. \"Not because of this, but because her kids are at home with their dad.\"\n\nET spoke with Brady on the carpet ahead of Sunday's live roast, and the seven-time Super Bowl champion admitted that he was \"not prepared\" for the relentless barrage of mockery coming his way, but was excited to see how it all played out.", "source": {"uri": "etonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Entertainment Tonight"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roast_(comedy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roast (comedy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kia Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kim Kardashian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlyn_Jenner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caitlyn Jenner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._J._Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "O.

The reality star, 43, appeared caught off-guard by the chilly reception at the event, which was broadcast on Netflix as part of the streaming service's Netflix Is a Joke Fest.\n\nThe Los Angeles native was immediately jeered as she made her way onstage, pausing for a moment after thanking host Kevin Hart, 44. She appeared to be launching into a joke, telling Hart, 'I know a lot of people make fun of your height,' before appearing to do a double take at the outburst from her less than-adoring public.\n\nThe Greatest Roast of All Time: Tom Brady, which was part of the Netflix Is a Joke Fest, was streamed live, which Netflix touted as the first-ever roast to be telecast live, unedited. The festivities were held at L.A.'s Kia Forum in Inglewood. Kardashian, who sported blonde locks as she held a Champagne glass at the event in Southern California , sought to get the show back on track, saying, 'Alright, alright, alright.' Hart himself appeared to jump in to do damage control as he said, 'Whoa, whoa.'\n\nIn her set, Kardashian alluded to past rumors of a romance with Brady after they crossed paths last summer at a July 4 party in the Hamptons . 'I'm really here tonight for Tom,' said Kardashian, who past dated NFL players including Reggie Bush and Miles Austin. 'I wasn't going to come tonight, but since I'm not here as Tom's date, there's still a good chance I might.' She joked in reference to her 2007 sexual intercourse tape with Ray-J, 'I know there were some rumors that we were, and I'd never say if we did or not - I'd just release a tape.'\n\nKardashian's set also included a reference to Caitlyn Jenner, who was formerly married to her mother Kris Jenner. 'I do know it would've never worked out,' Kardashian said. 'An ex-athlete, high cheekbones, silky hair ... you remind me too much of my stepdad now.' She added: 'Part of me thinks you would want to entrust me just to try on my clothes. I know the transition from the NFL must've been really hard, but I think my stepdad is a great example for you. She's one of the best athletes in the world, who proved you could do anything in this next chapter in your life. You can become a commentator, a far-right Republican or even a strong, confident woman.'\n\nKardashian made a reference to her late father Robert Kardashian's work on the late O.J. Simpson's 'Dream Team' of attorneys, to wrap up her set. 'Honestly, it's hard for me to watch people roast you,' Kim said. 'But I think enough of my family members have helped defend former football players.' She concluded in saying, 'So I'm just here tonight to support you and celebrate you - I'll give you the same advice I give all of my exes, good luck knowing the best is behind you ... cheers, everyone, to Tom Brady!' Kim was involved in another awkward moment at the show when comedian Tony Hinchcliffe peppered her with a few barbs.\n\nHinchcliffe made reference to Will Ferrell's cameo at the comedy show in character as his Anchorman persona Ron Burgundy, who in the 2004 film said, 'Discovered by the Germans in 1904, they named it San Diego, which of course in German means \"a whale's [expletive].\" 'A whale's [expletive], which reminds me, Kim Kardashian's here - she's had a lot of Black Men celebrate in her end zone,' Hinchcliffe said. 'Kim, word of advice, close your legs, you have more public beef than Kendrick and Drake.' A number of people on Sunday took to social media with real-time reactions to the chilly reception Kardashian received at the comedy event. 'Kim Kardashian getting booed at the Tom Brady Roast is incredible,' one user wrote, while another said, THEY JUST BOOED KIM KARDASHIAN BEFORE SHE EVEN SAID A WORD LMFAO.' Said one user: 'Bill Belichick gets a standing ovation and Kim Kardashian gets booed. The Tom Brady roast is the best thing Netflix has ever produced.'\n\nSome users said that the booing was reflective of the public's general exhaustion with the Kardashians and their broadcasting/marketing empire. 'Guess you should only appear live when you can control the narrative. Otherwise you'll get booed right off the stage every time,' the user said, adding 'Team Yeezy' to the end of their post. Said one user: 'We keep trying to tell \"the powers that be\" that we don't want that family in our spaces! Yet, they INSIST on pushing them in our faces, anyway!' Some users commented on the uncomfortable dynamic the jeering of the reality star led to on the live broadcast. 'Holy [expletive] like half the audience at the Tom Brady roast just mercilessly booed Kim Kardashian to the point where she had to stop and acknowledge it,' one user said. Another added, 'OMG, they booed Kim Kardashian so bad. That was embarrassing. Audience only stopped because Kevin asked them to stop.' The Public Enemies Podcast compared the booing to that garnered by the villain pro wrestling faction, The Judgment Day: 'The crowd when Kim Kardashian came to the mic to start roasting Tom Brady.'\n\nBrady zinged Kim's ex-husband Kanye West on Sunday at his celebrity roast, garnering an awkward response from Kim. Brady referenced West, 46, when delivering his response at the Kia Forum in Los Angeles to the many celebs who roasted him at the event Sunday, with Kim being one of them. 'Thank you so much for being here ... I know Kim was terrified to be here tonight...not because of this but because her kids are at home with their dad,' the NFL legend said, leaving the crowd roaring. The reality star - who shares daughters North, 10, and Chicago, six, and sons Saint, eight, and Psalm, four, with West - shook her head at the comment and held a restrained smile as she looked at the former New England Patriots quarterback, who she was romantically linked to about a year ago . A number of social media users predicted that West wouldn't have a sense of humor in regards to Brady's joke, and that it was only a matter of time before the outspoken artist responded to the pointed punchline aimed at his parenting. 'Kanye about to drop a Tom Brady diss and make y'all forget about Kendrick and Drake,' one social media user said, referencing the ongoing rivalry between Kendrick Lamar and Drake. Said another person: 'Do yall think we'll get a tom brady and kanye feud after this bc one thing about kanye is hes gonna type up a letter on a black screen real quick once it gets back to him.'\n\nAnother user said, 'Tom Brady made a joke about Kim being scared to be at the roast cause her kids were left with Kayne ahh man his next song or IG rant is gonna be insane.' One user said, 'Gonna be hilarious when Kanye gets offended by Tom Brady's joke after Tom just sat up there and listened to a whole room of people make jokes about his ex wife and children all night. You really can't say [expletive] to Tom.' Said one user: 'WHY DID TOM BRADY JUST FRY KIM K AND KANYE LMFAOOOOOO.' Another user praised Brady for his no holds barred approach to the roast \"Tom Brady gives no [expletive],' said the user. 'Like full scorched earth. OJ Simpson. 9/11. Aaron Hernandez. And he just destroyed Kim and Kanye. Nobody is safe.'\n\nSunday was not the first time Kardashian has received a chilly reception from the public in her own backyard at an event linked to pro football. She was booed by the crowd at a Los Angeles Rams home game at SoFi Stadium against the Dallas Cowboys on October 9, 2022. The crowd at the game began heavily booing when the Jumbotron camera panned from singer John Legend to the reality star, who smiled and waved prior to blowing a kiss. Among the comics set to take the stage at the roast for the former NFL quarterback included Jeffrey Ross, Bert Kreischer, Tom Segura, Nikki Glaser, Andrew Schulz and Sam Jay. Brady's former New England Patriots teammates Rob Gronkowski, Randy Moss and Julian Edelman were slated to appear, as well as rival standout quarterback Drew Bledsoe.

However, the spotlight unexpectedly shifted to Kim Kardashian. Initially met with boos from the audience during The Roast of Tom Brady, Kardashian turned the tables with jokes about her rumored romantic history, her stepfather Caitlyn Jenner, and even O.J. Simpson. According to US Weekly, Kevin Hart invited Kardashian to the stage, where she delivered a special toast on Sunday, 5 May.\n\nUndeterred by the boos that welcomed her, Kardashian managed to drown the audience's noise, diving straight into a joke about Hart. This led to her addressing the persistent rumors of her romantic interest in the quarterback. Kardashian said, \"I wasn't going to come tonight, but since I'm not here as Tom's date, there's still a good chance I might.\" She kept the momentum going by referring to her well-known 2007 sex tape. She said, \"Speaking of Tom and I dating, I know there were some rumors that we were and I'd never say if we did or not, I'd just release the tape.\"\n\nKardashian joked that a relationship with Brady wouldn't have lasted because he reminds her too much of Jenner, according to Entertainment Tonight. She said, \"I do know it would never work out. An ex-athlete, high cheekbones, silky hair -- you remind me too much of my stepdad now. Part of me thinks you would try to undress me, just to try on my clothes. I know the transition from the NFL must have been really hard, but I think my stepdad is a great example for you. She's one of the greatest athletes in the world who's proved you can do anything in this next chapter. You can become a commentator, a far-right Republican, or even a strong, confident woman.\"\n\nBrady and Kardashian were rumored to have a fling in June 2023, right after Brady's split from Gisele B\u00fcndchen in October 2022, a topic that became fodder for teasing during the special. Kardashian's brief appearance wouldn't have been complete without a nod to O.J. Simpson. She said, \"Honestly, it's hard for me to watch people roast you, but I think enough of my family members have defended former football players.\" Kardashian's reference was to her late father, Robert Sr., who famously served as part of Simpson's defense team during his highly publicized trial for the murder of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown, and her friend.\n\nBy the time Kardashian made the Simpson joke, the audience had warmed up to her, showing support. Kardashian went on to add, \"So I'm just here tonight to support you and celebrate you. I'll give you the same advice I give all of my exes, good luck knowing the best is behind you.\" Meanwhile, after three hours of relentless roasting, Brady finally had his turn on stage. With a playful spirit, he fired back at Kardashian with a witty remark. Taking a jab at Kanye West, he said, \"I know Kim was terrified to be here tonight. Not because of this, but because her kids are at home with their dad.\"", "source": {"uri": "inquisitr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Inquisitr"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kim Kardashian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kia Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlyn_Jenner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caitlyn Jenner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._J._Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "O.

An ex-athlete, high cheekbones, slinky hair -- you remind me too much of my stepdad now.\" Kardashian stated. \"Part of me thinks you would try to undress me, just to try on my clothes. I know the transition from the NFL must have been really hard, but I think my stepdad is a great example from you. She's one of the greatest athletes in the world who's proved you can do anything in this next chapter. You can become a commentator, a far-right Republican, or even a strong, confident woman.\"\n\nBrady was able to get his revenge, though. When it was his turn to speak, he talked about how Kardashian was terrified to be here right now -- not because of the jokes. Brady continued to say it was because she left the kids at home with their dad.\n\nKardashian took the joke in stride as the camera panned to her after the joke and she was laughing. Tom Brady has some more words for the other celebs there.

The reality star appeared during the three-hour Netflix roast ready to join in the laughs had at Brady's expense. Instead, she wound up being booed by the audience the moment she walked on stage with champagne glass in hand.\n\nMORE: Highlights from Tom Brady roast\n\nWhat led to Kardashian being booed? Here's what you need to know.\n\nThe audience at the Kia Forum in Inglewood, Calif., did not wait for Kardashian to get fully settled on stage before responding with a chorus of boos. She had just barely started with her roast before the crowd started to rain it down on her.\n\nKardashian tried her best to quiet the crowd, saying, \"All right, all right, all right,\" as the boos kept coming. Hart could be heard from the stage saying, \"Whoa, whoa,\" as he, too, tried to get the crowd to quiet down.\n\nBefore long, the boos quieted and she was able to get on with her speech at the event.\n\nMORE: Brady, Belichick, Bledsoe deliver perfect opening for roast\n\nThere were plenty of rumors after Brady's divorce with Gisele Bundchen that he and Kardashian had started dating. They were both at a Fourth of July party hosted by Michael Rubin, though they \"only talked briefly,\" according to Page Six.\n\nKardashian addressed the rumors she and Brady dated during the roast and compared him to her former step-parent Caitlyn Jenner, and brought up Kardashian's sex tape.\n\n\"Speaking of Tom and I dating, I know there were some rumors that we were and I'd never say if we did or not, I'd just release the tape,\" Kardashian said. \"But I do know it would never work out. An ex-athlete, high cheek bones, slinky hair -- you remind me too much of my stepdad now. Part of me thinks you would want to undress me just to try on my clothes.\"\n\nShe then compared the transition of Jenner, who announced her transition as transgender in 2015, to Brady's retirement in going from star athlete to finding what's next after retirement.\n\n\"I know the transition from the NFL must have been really hard, but I think my stepdad is a great example from you,\" Kardashian said. \"She's one of the greatest athletes in the world who's proved you can do anything in this next chapter. You can become a commentator, a far-right Republican, or even a strong, confident woman.\"\n\nKardashian also joked that while it was hard to hear the roasts of Brady, she thought enough people in her family have defended former football players, a reference to her father, Robert Kardashian, who represented O.J. Simpson in his murder trial.\n\nBrady had his own dig back at Kardashian, calling out her ex-husband Kanye West.\n\n\"I know Kim was terrified to be here tonight. Not because of this, but because her kids are at home with their dad,\" Brady said.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roast_(comedy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roast (comedy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Bledsoe", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drew Bledsoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Moss", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Randy Moss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kraft", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert Kraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Gronkowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rob Gronkowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walk-on_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Walk-on (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Ferrell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Will Ferrell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Edelman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julian Edelman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peyton_Manning", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peyton Manning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Affleck", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ben Affleck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kia Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gisele_B\u00fcndchen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gisele B\u00fcndchen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kim Kardashian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inglewood,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inglewood, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Inglewood, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlyn_Jenner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caitlyn Jenner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._J._Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "O.

Barstool Sports owner Dave Portnoy, for one, couldn't contain his delight at the turn of events.\n\nDave Portnoy took to Twitter to share a clip of Kim Kardashian facing boos from the live audience, drawing a comparison to former NFL commissioner Roger Goodell being trolled and booed by Patriots fans at Super Bowl LI.\n\nIn his tweet, Portnoy trolled, \"Kevin Hart had to legit tell people to stop. I f**king love it. She also sucked and read the teleprompter like a robot.\"\n\nKim did try to maintain her composure amidst the escalating boos. \"Alright, Alright, Alright,\" she went holding a glass of champagne. Kevin Hart had to intervene, exclaiming, \"Whoa! Whoa! Whoa Whoa!\"\n\nOnce the boos subsided, Kim Kardashian went ahead with her roast, shifting her focus to Kevin Hart's height.\n\nThe 43-year-old reality TV mogul kicked off her roast by addressing the rumors related to her alleged relationship with Tom Brady. Kim Kardashian made a tongue-in-cheek reference to the speculation, adding, \"Speaking of Tom and I dating, I know there were some rumors that we were, and I'd never say if we did or not, I'd just release the tape,\" referencing her infamous 2007 s*x tape.\n\nKim K further kept the laughter rolling as she playfully speculated on why a romance with Tom Brady wouldn't have been in the cards, joking, \"I do know it would have never worked out.

Brady later returned the jest, poking fun at Kardashian's situation with her ex-husband Kanye West, eliciting laughter from the crowd.\n\nDuring a recent appearance at Netflix's live \"The Roast of Tom Brady\" special, Kardashian was met with an icy reception as she walked onto the stage in a sleek black dress, a glass of champagne in hand, and ready to join in the comedic banter directed at Brady.\n\nAs she began to address fellow presenter Kevin Hart, the \"The Kardashian\" star was met with audible boos from the audience at the Kia Forum in Los Angeles, leaving her visibly flustered and annoyed.\n\nWhile attempting to navigate the awkward moment, she addressed the crowd with a hesitant, \"All right, all right, all right,\" while Hart's surprised reaction of \"whoa\" echoed off-camera.\n\nAfter cheers from the audience gradually replaced the initial boos, the \"American Horror Story\" star quipped: \"I wasn't going to come tonight, but since I'm not here as Tom's date, there's still a good chance I might.\"\n\nAt the comedy event, Kardashian playfully addressed romance rumors with Brady, teasing: \"Speaking of Tom and I dating, I know there were some rumors that we were, and I'd never say if we did or not; I'd just release the tape.\"\n\nShe then joked that a romantic relationship with Brady would \"never work out\" because his \"ex-athlete [with] high cheekbones [and] slinky hair\" resemblance to Caitlyn Jenner was too uncanny.\n\n\"Honestly, it's hard for me to watch people roast you, but I think enough of my family members have defended former football players,\" she added.\n\nKardashian and Brady's alleged romance surfaced after they both attended Michael Rubin's Fourth of July party in the Hamptons in July 2023.\n\nHowever, at the time, sources who spoke to Page Six indicated that the duo \"only talked briefly\" and were just \"friends.\" Party Insiders also confirmed that the NFL star \"was talking to different women\" at the party and that he and Kardashian weren't flirting or dancing together.\n\nDuring the roast, Kardashian took another jab at Brady's transition from the NFL, likening his transition to her former stepdad, Olympic champion Caitlyn Jenner.\n\nShe jokingly acknowledged the challenges of transitioning careers, stating, \"I know the transition from the NFL must have been really hard, but I think my stepdad is a great example from you.\"\n\nKardashian added: \"She's one of the greatest athletes in the world who's proved you can do anything in this next chapter. You can become a commentator, a far-right Republican, or even a strong, confident woman.\"\n\nWrapping up her speech, the SKIMS founder offered Brady light-hearted advice, wishing him luck in his post-NFL endeavors and teasingly remarking: \"I'm just here tonight to support you and celebrate you. I'll give you the same advice I give all of my exes: good luck knowing the best is behind you.\"\n\nAs the roast progressed, Brady took to the stage and didn't hold back in his return of jokes, including a savage burn aimed at Kardashian.\n\nHe humorously referenced her ex-husband, Kanye West, suggesting: \"I know Kim was terrified to be here tonight.

'I wasn't going to come tonight, but since I'm not here as Tom's date, there's still a good chance I might.'\n\nShe also poked fun of her infamous 2007 sex tape with Ray-J, continuing 'I know there were some rumours that we were, and I'd never say if we did or not - I'd just release a tape.'\n\nKim even pulled her mother Kris Jenner into the mix and her former spouse Caitlyn Jenner, saying: 'I do know it would've never worked out. An ex-athlete, high cheekbones, silky hair. You remind me too much of my stepdad now.\n\n'Part of me thinks you would want to entrust me just to try on my clothes. I know the transition from the NFL must've been really hard, but I think my stepdad is a great example for you.\n\n'She's one of the best athletes in the world, who proved you could do anything in this next chapter in your life. You can become a commentator, a far-right Republican or even a strong, confident woman.'\n\nEnding her set, she mentioned the work of her late father Robert Kardashian, who was famously part of OJ Simpson's legal team for his 1995 murder trial.\n\n'Honestly, it's hard for me to watch people roast you. But I think enough of my family members have helped defend former football players,' she continued.\n\n'So I'm just here tonight to support you and celebrate you - I'll give you the same advice I give all of my exes, good luck knowing the best is behind you ... cheers, everyone, to Tom Brady.'\n\nKim also found herself at the receiving end of some pretty vicious jokes on the night, with Brady himself firing shots at Kim's ex-husband and controversial rapper Kanye West, with whom she shares children North, 10, Saint, eight, Chicago, six, and Psalm, four.\n\nBrady quipped: 'I know Kim was terrified to be here tonight...not because of this but because her kids are at home with their dad.'\n\nComedian Tom Hinchcliffe also had some savage barbs up his sleeve for the Skims owner in a bizarre reference to Will Ferrell's much-loved comedy flick Anchorman and one of its most famous quotes.\n\n'Discovered by the Germans in 1904, they named it San Diego, which of course in German means \"a whale's vagina.\"' he began.\n\n'A whale's vagina, which reminds me, Kim Kardashian's here - she's had a lot of Black Men celebrate in her end zone. Kim, word of advice, close your legs, you have more public beef than Kendrick and Drake.'\n\nViewers of The Greatest Roast of All Time: Tom Brady were quick to share their opinions over the brutal takedown of Kim, with many branding it the 'highlight' of the roast.\n\n'Kim Kardashian being boo'd restores my faith in America,' Littleman1229 wrote on X.\n\nMissSassbox added: 'OMG, they booed Kim Kardashian so bad. That was embarrassing. Audience only stopped because Kevin asked them to stop.'\n\nTheWakeninq joked: 'Kim Kardashian just got reality checked at the roast of Tom Brady lmao \ud83e\udd23.'\n\nNetflix Is a Joke Fest, which will take place from May 2 to 12, features live performances from the likes of Ali Wong, Gabriel Iglesias, Sarah Silverman, Fortune Feimster, Kevin Hart, and many more.\n\nThe Greatest Roast of All Time: Tom Brady is available to stream on Netflix now.\n\nIf you've got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page - we'd love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : Bridgerton star Nicola Coughlan crushes popular myth about season 3 sex scenes\n\nMORE : Met Gala: 8 celebrities who didn't understand the assignment", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Metro"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rebecca_sayce@metro.co.uk", "name": "Rebecca Sayce", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roast_(comedy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roast (comedy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kim Kardashian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kia Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialite", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Socialite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrity_sex_tape", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Celebrity sex tape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_J", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ray J"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reality television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlyn_Jenner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caitlyn Jenner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._J._Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "O.

In 2019 he was arrested for soliciting prostitution at the establishment.\n\nAlso in the audience, and the spotlight, was Kim Kardashian.\n\nWhen the star made her way on to the stage, champagne in hand, she was met with boos from the audience, and seemed surprised.\n\nSo was Hart. \"Whoa, whoa,\" he said.\n\nThe unphased Kardashian (this isn't the first time she's been booed) proceeded to joke about Brady.\n\n\"I wasn't going to come tonight, but since I'm not here as Tom's date, there's still a good chance I might,\" she told the crowd. \"Speaking of Tom and I dating, I know there were some rumours that we were, and I'd never say if we did or not - I'd just release the tape.\"\n\nShe also compared Brady to another famous athlete, Caitlyn Jenner, reports US Weekly.\n\n\"An ex-athlete, high cheekbones, slinky hair - you remind me too much of my stepdad now,\" said Kardashian. \"Part of me thinks you would try to undress me just to try on my clothes.

She's one of the greatest athletes in the world who's proved you can do anything in this next chapter.

Stop kissing his ass. 'Are you okay?' It was just jokes!'\"\n\nHe also made a barb about Ross's career. \"Make sure to check out Jeff's one-man show. It's playing at the Hollywood Cemetery.

After Kardashian made fun of Brady for his \"high cheekbones and silky hair,\" which she joked reminded her of her stepfather, Caitlyn Jenner, the seven-time Super Bowl winner scorched her back for her ex-husband - Kanye West.\n\n\"I know Kim was terrified to be here tonight...not because of this but because her kids are at home with their dad,\" Brady said.\n\nThe joke earned Brady a smile and a shake of the head from his once-rumored flame who has four children with Kanye West. In July of last year, it was rumored that Kardashian and the former Patriots quarterback were dating after being \"flirty\" at a Fanatics party hosted by Michael Rubin. The two began a friendship earlier in the year over Kardashian's quest for a new vacation home, but Entertainment Tonight said she and Brady are not dating.\n\n\"Tom and Kim have been in touch because Kim is looking to buy property where Tom has a vacation home,\" a source told Entertainment Tonight at the time.\n\nWhile Kardashian may have never been with Brady, the 43-year-old media personality did have a romance with another notable NFL player. Odell Beckham Jr. and Kardashian recently called it quits after dating for less than a year. The relationship was never confirmed, and they never appeared on the red carpet together.\n\n\"Kim and Odell are friends and have a lot of mutual friends in common,\" a source told E! News. \"She's not seriously dating anyone at the moment but open to finding love again if she meets the right person. Right now her main focus is on her kids and her businesses.\"\n\nBillionaire Kim Kardashian dealt with a very rough crowd during her portion of Brady's roast. While Kardashian was on stage she was incessantly booed by the audience as she was trying to tell her joke. Things got so bad that fellow roaster Kevin Hart told people to stop.\n\nKardashian was one of the many celebrities who took part in the roast, which streamed live on Netflix Sunday night. Hart hosted the event which took place at the Kia Forum in Los Angeles.

While Kardashian was on stage she was booed by the audience as she was trying to tell her joke. Things got so bad that Kevin Hart told people to stop.\n\nKardashian was one of the many celebrities who took part in the roast of Tom Brady, which streamed live on Netflix Sunday night. Hart hosted the event which took place at the Kia Forum in Los Angeles. Some of the roasters were eff Ross, Bert Kreischer, Tom Segura, Nikki Glaser, Andrew Schulz, Tony Hinchcliffe, and Sam Jay, as well as former wide receivers Randy Moss and Julian Edelman, quarterbacks Drew Bledsoe, and tight end Rob Gronkowski.\n\nThe roast was orginally announced in 2022. \"We can't wait to burn three-time Super Bowl-losing quarterback Tom Brady, who only went back to the NFL in order to delay this roast,\" Robbie Praw, Netflix's vice president of stand-up and comedy formats, said in a statement at the time. \"In all seriousness, it's a huge thrill to work with the greatest football player of all time on this project. No one's better at taking hits and still coming out on top, so we know the roast will be a breeze for Brady.\"\n\nIt's not very clear why Kardashian was booed during the roast, but she and Brady do have some history together. In July of last year, it was rumored that Kardashian and the seven-time Super Bowl champion quarterback were dating after being \"flirty\" at a Fanatics party. The two began a friendship earlier in the year over Kardshian's quest for a new vacation home, but Entertainment Tonight said she and Brady are not dating.\n\n\"Tom and Kim have been in touch because Kim is looking to buy property where Tom has a vacation home,\" a source told Entertainment Tonight at the time.\n\nWhile Kardashian may have never been with Brady, the 43-year-old media personality did have a romance with another notable NFL player. Odell Beckham Jr. and Kardashian recently called it quits after dating for less than a year. The realtionship was never confirmed, and they never apepared on the red carpet together.\n\n\"Kim and Odell are friends and have a lot of mutual friends in common,\" a source told E! News. \"She's not seriously dating anyone at the moment but open to finding love again if she meets the right person. Right now her main focus is on her kids and her businesses.\"", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brian_jones@on3.com", "name": "Brian Jones", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roast_(comedy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roast (comedy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kim Kardashian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hinchcliffe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tony Hinchcliffe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Schulz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Schulz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Jay", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Jay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bert_Kreischer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bert Kreischer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Segura", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tom Segura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Glaser", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Glaser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Moss", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Randy Moss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Bledsoe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drew Bledsoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Gronkowski", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rob Gronkowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Tonight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Edelman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Julian Edelman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stand-up comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odell_Beckham_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Odell Beckham Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E!_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "E!

Not to mention the Tom Brady dating rumors that ultimately amounted to nothing.\n\nFurthermore, her segment in the roast shows a seeming lack of authenticity. Right from the start, as the crowd boos, she shows no effort to fight through the reaction, instead needs someone else to handle it. And when she does speak, she sounds robotic, not conveying genuine humor.\n\nBarstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy compared it to NFL commissioner Roger Goodell when the Patriots won the Super Bowl.\n\nWhat did Kim Kardashian say during Tom Brady's roast?\n\nFirst, she Kim Kardashian the dating rumors:\n\n\"I'm really here tonight for Tom.

Brady was mostly down to clown, save for a tense moment when Jeff Ross made a crack about Patriots owner Robert Kraft's affinity for massages (Kraft was among several charged with solicitation in Florida during an anti-sex-trafficking bust in 2019; the charges were later dropped when the court excluded surreptitious video evidence) -- rich considering Ross' own history of sexual misconduct.\n\nThe other awkward moment occurred about an hour into the roast, when Hart introduced Kim Kardashian. As the reality TV star and entrepreneur made her way onstage, the crowd went from cheering to booing Kardashian, who was slightly rattled by the turn. It's unclear exactly why the audience booed Kardashian, but there are several possible reasons, including her brief relationship with Brady several years ago and her status as Taylor Swift enemy number 4. Kardashian often finds herself in the crosshairs of controversy, whether by design or through proximity, but the haters in the crowd really should've held the boos for Kardashian's jokes.\n\n\"I wasn't going to come tonight,\" Kardashian said, reading from a teleprompter, \"but since I'm not here as Tom's date, there's still a good chance I might.\" Referencing their dating history, Kardashian added, \"It would never work out. An ex-athlete with high cheekbones, silky hair ... you remind me too much of my stepdad now.\" As she said this, the screen cut to a meme featuring photos of Brady over the years, culminating in a photo of Caitlyn Jenner, with the caption \"The evolution of Tom Brady.\" Back on stage, Kardashian continued, \"Part of me thinks you'd want to undress me just to try on my clothes.\" She concluded by comparing Brady's career to that of Jenner: \"I know the transition from the NFL must have been really hard, but I think my stepdad is a great example for you. She's one of the best athletes in the world who proved you can do anything in this next chapter of your life -- you can become a commentator, a far-right Republican, or even a strong, confident woman.\"\n\nBy this point, Kardashian seems to have won over the haters, unfortunately validating stereotypes about fans of both football and comedy roasts. As a cisgender woman, I can't speak to how offended the trans community is or should be by Kardashian's jokes; to me, they're just lame, low-effort jokes that could've been pulled from the late '90s and early '00s, when men who use hair conditioner were called \"metrosexual.\" At least you can tell Kardashian didn't write the jokes herself, as evidenced by her clunky delivery while staring at the teleprompter.\n\nIf you have a billion dollars to throw around, surely you can afford to hire a better comedy writer to help you roast one of the easiest targets on the planet. As for the crowd booing Kardashian's entrance: there are plenty of reasons to jeer this woman. Try choosing one that doesn't tell the world you hate women.\n\n(featured image: Matt Winkelmeyer, Getty Images for Netflix)", "source": {"uri": "themarysue.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Hart quickly intervened saying \"Whoa! Whoa!\" all to ensure the audience changed their reaction.\n\nThe moment booing stopped, Kardashian, she directed her humor at Tom Brady. \"I'm really here tonight for Tom. I wasn't going to come tonight, but since I'm not here as Tom's date, there's still a good chance I might,\" she laughed.\n\nKardashian's humor didn't stop there. She drew an unexpected parallel between Brady and her stepdad, Caitlyn Jenner, with a joke that highlighted their physical similarities. \"An ex-athlete, high cheekbones, silky hair... You remind me too much of my stepdad now,\" she remarked, setting the stage for a meme displayed onscreen that showed \"the evolution of Tom Brady\" morphing into Jenner.\n\nKardashian also mentioned OJ Simpson, a nod to her family's complicated history with the former football star. \"Honestly, it's hard for me to watch people roast you. But I think enough of my family members have helped defend former football players,\" she said.\n\nDespite the tumultuous start, Kardashian's appearance at the roast put forth her adeptness at navigating the limelight, controversy notwithstanding.", "source": {"uri": "screenbox.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ScreenBox"}, "authors": [{"uri": "divya_pal@screenbox.in", "name": "Divya Pal", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kim Kardashian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kia Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roast_(comedy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roast (comedy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alright_(Kendrick_Lamar_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alright (Kendrick Lamar song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlyn_Jenner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caitlyn Jenner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._J._Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "O.

It got off without a hitch and was chock full of raunchy, uncensored humor that even had Tom Brady intervene early on, as Jeff Ross made a joke directed at Patriots owner Robert Kraft about massages. Kraft was sitting in the front row, stage left.\n\nBy the midway point in the show, Kim Kardashian had a turn at roasting Brady. The television personality and entrepreneur walked up the stage with a champagne glass in hand and received some boos from the audience in the stands. She scoffed at the jeers before she began her portion of the roast. Some of the talent on stage fired back at the crowd. \"Really, y'all?\" Jeff Ross yelled off stage to the audience.\n\nThe boos sounded like they were coming from your general audience members who just wanted to take aim at Kardashian, whose monologue was actually quite funny. She touched on the dating rumors that circled around her and Tom Brady and nodded to her sex tape from years ago. She joked about her stepparent, Caitlyn Jenner, and broke down all the comparisons between how Brady and Jenner actually have a lot in common.\n\nThere's a chance die hard Tom Brady fans were aiming the boos at Kim K. due to those dating rumors about her and Brady. The pair reportedly flirted at a party last summer, but nothing else was mentioned publicly past that. The last thing Brady fans want is a woman like Kim Kardashian in his life, post-Giselle Bundchen. Brady fans want their G.O.A.T. focused and unbothered by the opposite sex.\n\nKim Kardashian can handle what you throw at her, though. She's been under public scrutiny for nearly two decades now, and she was also married to Kanye West. A third of an arena booing her is just another Sunday evening for her. Boos from fans who took the cheapest cross-country flight possible from Boston to L.A. will just trickle down her back.\n\nAll this being said, Kardashian was one of the highlights of the night, full of humor, surprising appearances, and Tom Brady having to sit there for three hours and get a worse lashing than what the New York Giants defense did to him back in Super Bowl 42.", "source": {"uri": "wegotthiscovered.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "We Got This Covered"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tyler_geis@wegotthiscovered.com", "name": "Tyler Geis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roast_(comedy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roast (comedy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kim Kardashian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kia Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kraft", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert Kraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Ross", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Ross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monologue", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monologue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrity_sex_tape", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Celebrity sex tape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraft_Foods", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kraft Foods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Entrepreneurship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlyn_Jenner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caitlyn Jenner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_country_running", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cross country running"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kanye West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Kim-Kardashian.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541610", "eventUri": "eng-9541610", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

The reality TV star was surprisingly and savagely booed when she arrived on stage, much to her chagrin. Roastmaster Kevin Hart even had to ask the audience to simmer down after the boos droned on for a good ten seconds and threatened to drown out her first joke.\n\nNetflix had to know there would be some unexpected hiccups when it decided to broadcast a live roast of a controversial superstar like Tom Brady, though chances are the streamer wasn't expecting the mishaps to be Kim Kardashian-related. Dubbed The Greatest Roast Of All Time: Tom Brady, the event went off fairly successfully, with only a few hitches. But the biggest stunner of the night (other than Bill Belichick's shockingly funny set and delivery) had to be the Kardashian moment.\n\nKim certainly wasn't expecting it. Sitting in the audience and getting called up to the microphone as a \"surprise\" roaster (unlike the numerous roasters seated on stage and announced beforehand), Kardashian was ushered up to the stage by the Roastmaster General himself, Jeff Ross. She clutched her champagne glass, donning fancy jewelry, dyed blonde hair and a strapless dress -- and seemed ill-prepared for what happened next.\n\nAfter first saying \"Thank you\" in response to a smattering of applause she received, the audience reaction quickly and loudly shifted to a much stronger chorus of boos. So much so that the commotion interrupted Kardashian's first joke about Kevin Hart's height. \"All right, all right, all right...\"\n\n\"I know a lot of people make fun of your height...\" Kardashian began, before the boos were too overwhelming to ignore and she shot the audience a \"How dare you\" glare. When that didn't work, she tried to cut them off with \"All right, all right, all right...\"\n\nWhen that didn't suffice either, Kevin Hart had to chime in with his own reprimanding \"Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa -\" to the crowd, which eventually came to order, but the damage had been done.\n\nThe moment was particularly stunning on a night when reviled longtime Patriots coach Bill Belichick was in the house and even he didn't garner this kind of vilified reaction.\n\nThere were many uncomfortable moments throughout the evening, but that's usually half the fun of a roast. Kevin Hart urged the audience a few times over the evening to \"get comfortable being uncomfortable.\" But hurled personal insults and tasteless innuendo generally got laughs time and again, while the only moment to really cause mass outrage was the simple moment of Kim Kardashian approaching the podium.\n\nWhy was Kim Kardashian so savagely booed?\n\nThe question then becomes... why? Why was Kim Kardashian singled out and so mercilessly booed? Was the audience filled with Swifties? Her famous exes? Netflix executives jealous that The Kardashians is on Hulu instead of their own streamer? Calabasas residents upset that she has become the face of their fair city?\n\nOr has she possibly just become so overexposed and famous despite a perceived dearth of accomplishments that the audience couldn't help but give voice to the collective frustration of the nation?\n\nWhatever the cause, Kardashian then gamely went on to deliver her set -- which included jokes about Kevin Hart's height, her transgender stepparent Caitlyn Jenner, her father defending O.J. Simpson, and the dating rumors between her and Brady. Almost certainly the barbs were written by someone else, but Kardashian did deliver the jokes cleanly enough to turn some of those early jeers into genuine laughs.\n\nThere were numerous people on stage Sunday night at the KIA Forum in Los Angeles who could have been seen as the villain of the evening, though betters probably never would have guess at the top of the list would be Kim Kardashian. Nevertheless, she no doubt made Bill Belichick proud by \"doing her job\" on stage -- she powered through the negativity and made sure the unflattering attention and feelings stayed centered on roastee Tom Brady the rest of the night.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "josh_silverstein@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Josh Silverstein", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roast_(comedy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roast (comedy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kim Kardashian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reality television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refrain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Refrain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Ross", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Ross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kardashians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Kardashians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlyn_Jenner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caitlyn Jenner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._J._Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "O.

But because her kids are at home with their dad.\" The cameras panned to Kim, 43, in the audience, and while she wasn't audibly laughing, she seemed to take the joke in stride.\n\nKim and Ye, 46, share four children. She filed for divorce from the rapper in February 2021 after less than seven years of marriage. The split was finalized in November 2022. Meanwhile, the Skims founder was briefly romantically linked to Tom in May 2023, which she addressed while roasting him during the Netflix special.\n\n\"I wasn't going to come tonight, but since I'm not here as Tom's date, there's still a good chance I might,\" Kim began. \"Speaking of Tom and I dating, I know there were some rumors that we were.

High cheekbones. Silky hair. You remind me too much of my stepdad now. Part of me thinks you would want to undress me just to try on my clothes.\"\n\nShe also referenced her dad, Robert Kardashian, being an attorney for O.J. Simpson during the latter's 1994 murder trial. \"Honestly, it's hard for me to watch people roast [Tom], but I think enough of my family members have helped defend former football players,\" the Hulu star joked.\n\nKim and Tom were linked when she was rumored to be looking for a vacation home in the same Bahamian community where the former NFL star has a residence.

The tension between the two pop moguls began over a decade ago. And it continues into 2024 with Swift's new album, The Tortured Poets Department. Recently, Kardashian attended The Roast of Tom Brady to add a few jokes, and the crowd booed her. Here's why some fans think the booing came from Swift fans.\n\nThe Roast of Tom Brady allowed famous folks to joke at former NFL quarterback Tom Brady's expense. Kim Kardashian was welcomed to the stage by Kevin Hart to make a special toast. And she had more than a few zingers to throw against Brady. Unfortunately, the crowd wasn't receptive when Kardashian walked to the microphone.\n\nThe media sensation was met with intense booing from the crowd. While Kardashian attempted to start her roast, she told the audience, \"All right, all right,\" and, \"Woah, woah,\" in an attempt to get them to settle their audible displeasure.\n\nEventually, the crowd quieted. Kardashian cracked jokes at Brady regarding past dating rumors that circulated between them. \"I wasn't going to come tonight, but since I'm not here as Tom's date, there's still a good chance I might,\" she joked. \"Speaking of Tom and I dating, I know there were some rumors that we were. And I'd never say if we did or not; I'd just release the tape.\"\n\nKardashian went on to joke about Caitlyn Jenner and Robert Kardashian in relation to Brady. \"I'm just here tonight to support you and celebrate you,\" she added. \"I'll give you the same advice I give all of my exes: Good luck knowing the best is behind you.\"\n\nBrady also joked about Kardashian and her famous ex, Kanye West. \"I know Kim was terrified to be here tonight,\" Brady said. \"Not because of this, but because her kids are at home with their dad.\"\n\nSo, why did the crowd boo Kardashian before she spoke? Some fans think the NFL crowd has grown to love Taylor Swift due to Swift's relationship with Travis Kelce. If the crowd was full of NFL fans who also love Brady, many may dislike Kardashian due to Kardashian and Swift's feud.\n\n\"Some are saying that the NFL crowd are Swifties now,\" a fan on Reddit wrote.\n\n\"Taylor Swift is dating Travis Kelce, who was on the team that won the Super Bowl,\" another fan explained. \"Taylor had a Kim diss track on her latest album where she said she wished Kim were dead and also [dragged] Kim's kids into the mess (haven't heard the song myself, but saw an article that explained the drama elsewhere). Football fans are now taking Taylor's side in this decade-long beef because of these dynamics.\"\n\nTaylor Swift and Kim Kardashian's feud can be traced back to 2009. That year, Kardashian's then-husband, Kanye West, grabbed Swift's microphone at the MTV Video Music Awards to state that Beyonc\u00e9 should've won Video of the Year. In 2016, West then released these lyrics in this sound, \"Famous\": \"I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex, why? I made that b***h famous.\"\n\nWest and Kardashian claimed that Swift agreed to the mention in \"Famous.\" Kardashian then released an edited version of the phone call between Swift and West that made it sound like Swift agreed to the line in the song. However, the truth came out later.\n\nSwift wrote a song dissing Kardashian on her 2024 album, The Tortured Poets Department. Her song, \"thanK you aIMee,\" capitalizes the letters in the song title to spell out \"Kim.\" The lyrics also align with the past drama, as Swift sings:\n\n\"I don't think you've changed much / And so I changed your name and any real defining clues / And one day, your kid comes home singin' / A song that only us two is gonna know is about you.\"", "source": {"uri": "cheatsheet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Showbiz Cheat Sheet"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lauren_weiler@cheatsheet.com", "name": "Lauren Weiler", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kim Kardashian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roast_(comedy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roast (comedy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kanye West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlyn_Jenner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caitlyn Jenner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert Kardashian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV_Video_Music_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MTV Video Music Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diss_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diss (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV_Video_Music_Award_for_Video_of_the_Year", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyonc\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beyonc\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reddit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Kim-Kardashian-.jpg?w=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541610", "eventUri": "eng-9541610", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

On Sunday, May 4, Netflix aired the first-ever live roast event featuring Former NFL star Tom Brady in the hot seat.\n\nDuring the event, The Hall of Famer was roasted by some of the top comedians in the game, including Kevin Hart, who pulled no punches roasting Brady going after his much-publicized divorce from ex-wife Gisele B\u00fcndchen and his decision to choose his career over his marriage to the stunning former model.\n\nWhile the audience could hold back laughter during Kevin Hart's monologue, the mood suddenly shifted as Kim Kardashian was presented to give a toast during the comedy special.\n\nAs soon as The entrepreneur and reality TV star took the stage, she was booed by the audience at the Kia Forum. As the clip of the brutal audience reception was shared online, several social media users reacted to the footage by siding with the crowd, with one netizen writing, \"Read the room. Thank You Aimee:\"\n\nThe reaction was a reference to Taylor Swift's recent diss track Thank You Aimee where the singer rekindled her feud with the reality star for posting an edited video to Snapchat supposedly depicting Swift approving West's controversial \"Famous\" lyrics.\n\nIt appears that fans sided with Taylor Swift as social media users derided Kim Kardashian after she was booed at the Tom Brady Roast. Reacting to the clip shared by CIcero, a netizen wrote, \"What normal people actually think about her.\"\n\nAnother added, \"Kim K trying so hard to manifest being Tom Brady's next is extra cringe.\"\n\nKim and Tom Brady were rumored to be dating last year. However, the reality star denied the claim and maintained that they were friends. During the roast, Kim Kardashian mocked the dating rumours, saying, \"Speaking of Tom and I dating, I know there were some rumours that we were, and I'd never say if we did. I'd just release the tape.\"\n\nWhile Kim Kardashian was initially greeted with boos, she rallied through the brutal reception.

Simpson jersey and an uncomfortable moment involving Kim Kardashian, who was met with \"an onslaught of audible boos,\" as described by Variety, when she took the stage to perform a toast to Brady.\n\nAccording to Variety, the moment was so bad that host Keven Hart had to come to Kardashian's rescue.\n\nOnce the crowd settled down, Kardashian poked fun at Brady while addressing rumors about the two of them dating.\n\n\"I do know it would've never worked out, an ex-athlete, high cheekbones, silky hair... You remind me too much of my stepdad now,\" she said in a reference to Bruce Jenner, who now fancies himself as Caitlyn Jenner.\n\nSpeaking of bad taste, at one point the 43-year-old reality TV star referenced her famous father, Robert Kardashian, who was one of O.J. Simpson's defense lawyers.\n\n\"Honestly, it's hard for me to watch other people roast you, but I think enough of my family members have helped defend former football players,\" she said to Brady.\n\nBrady seemed to set the stage when he introduced Kardashian, taking a shot at her broken marriage with Kanye West -- the GOAT ribbed her for being \"terrified\" to leave her children alone with their father while she attended the roast.\n\n\"I know Kim was terrified to be here tonight. Not because of this, but because her kids are at home with their dad,\" Brady jabbed.\n\nBut that was tame compared to comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who didn't just step over the line while taking a shot at Kim K. but obliterated it.\n\nThe comedian called attention to Will Ferrell's cameo appearance in character as his Anchorman persona Ron Burgundy -- in the 2004 hit film, Burgundy said San Diego means \"a whales vagina\" in German.\n\n\"A whale's vagina, which reminds me, Kim Kardashian's here,\" Hinchcliffe said. \"She's had a lot of black men celebrate in her end zone.

But before she could get any words in, the audience savagely booed her! OMG!\n\nRelated: Are Kim Kardashian & Odell Beckham Jr. Better As Friends Because...\n\nJust like her rival Taylor Swift was once confused by an unexpected on-stage interruption back when her feud with Kanye West started, Kim initially laughed off all the yelling -- until the boos were undeniable and she looked PISSED. The 43-year-old then tried to calm everyone down by telling the audience, \"Alright, alright.\" Even Kevin had to shout, \"whoa, whoa,\" when the hate got too out of control! Not off to a great start, Kimmy Kakes! Look (below):\n\nThankfully for her, the SKIMS founder managed to carry on with her toast, telling her former rumored beau:\n\n\"I'm really here tonight for Tom. I wasn't going to come tonight, but since I'm not here as Tom's date, there's still a good chance I might.\"\n\nHah! Referencing her sex tape history, she teased:\n\n\"Speaking of Tom and I dating, I know there were some rumors that we were and I'd never say if we did or not, I'd just release the tape.\"\n\nLOLz!\n\nShe also compared the father of three to her own stepparent Caitlyn Jenner, who transitioned in 2015, saying:\n\n\"I do know it would never work out. An ex-athlete, high cheekbones, silky hair -- you remind me too much of my stepdad now. Part of me thinks you would try to undress me, just to try on my clothes. I know the transition from the NFL must have been really hard, but I think my stepdad is a great example for you. She's one of the greatest athletes in the world who's proved you can do anything in this next chapter. You can become a commentator, a far right Republican, or even a strong, confident woman.\"\n\nReferring to her own father, Robert Kardashian Sr., and his role on O.J. Simpson's legal team, the beauty mogul went on:\n\n\"Honestly, it's hard for me to watch people roast you but I think enough of my family members have defended former football players.\"\n\nThat joke earned her the biggest applause from the crowd before she concluded with:\n\n\"So I'm just here tonight to support you and celebrate you... I'll give you the same advice I give all of my exes, good luck knowing the best is behind you.\"\n\nLater, when Tom finally took the stage to clap back at all the jokesters, Kim -- or rather, her ex-husband -- took a beating! He joked:\n\n\"I know Kim was terrified to be here tonight. Not because of this, but because her kids are at home with their dad.\"\n\nLMFAO!\n\nThe camera then cut to Kim shaking her head while maintaining an awkward smile.

Picture Credits: Instagram @tombrady & @kimkardashian\n\nNetflix's \"The Roast of Tom Brady\" turned up the heat as Kim Kardashian faced a chorus of loud boos upon taking the stage. But that didn't stop the socialite from throwing a few punches at the guest of honor, including bold jokes about the dating rumors swirling around her and Tom from last year. But did she put the rumors to rest, or did she add fuel to the fire?\n\nTo everyone's surprise, Kim K. managed to win over the crowd with her witty and sarcastic jokes aimed at the panel and host Kevin Hart. But it was when she turned her attention to Tom Brady that things got really interesting. She fearlessly tackled her explicit past, joking about the infamous s*x tape scandal from 2007 involving her and then-boyfriend Ray J.\n\n\"Speaking of Tom and I dating, I know there were some rumors that we were, and I'd never say if we did or not. I'd just release the tape,\" Kim quipped, leaving everyone speechless.\n\nReferencing past headlines by the Daily Mail linking her romantically with the former Patriots superstar, she teased about releasing a \"tape\" before setting the record straight. We all know how that went in 2007, and a handful of fans are already speculating if something similar is about to go down once again. See for yourselves:\n\nOne fan quipped, \"Is there a Tom Brady x Kim Kardashian s*x tape?\" while another added, \"Tom Brady, Kim Kardashian tape coming soon\" with a laughing emoji.

You have more public beef than Kendrick and Drake.\"\n\nWhat Hinchcliffe is doing here can be picked apart on multiple levels, the most notable part being the overt racism and misogyny he invoked to try and get laughs.\n\nRELATED: 8 Odd Details About Gisele B\u00fcndchen & Tom Brady's Marriage\n\nThe jokes made at Kardashian's expense are a prime example of punching down, not up.\n\nPunching down can be defined as making fun of someone whose social capital carries less weight than the person telling the joke. A man taking the stage and teasing a woman for a sex tape she didn't actively consent to have released is punching down in a big way.\n\nBrady himself displayed his own version of punching down by teasing Kardashian about Kanye West and how unstable her ex-husband's mental health is.\n\nOne fan noted how Kardashian seemed to take control of the narrative during her time onstage, saying that most people weren't acknowledging how \"She bounced back and had the crowd laughing.\"\n\nKardashian joked that her brief fling with Brady \"Would never work out -- an ex-athlete, high cheekbones, silky hair. You remind me too much of my stepdad now.\"\n\nKardashian's joke could also be seen as an example of punching down while holding a transphobic mentality, as well.\n\nPart of what makes comedy is crossing lines. Yet crossing those lines is better served when it points out the inequalities that make up our social fabric, not relying on those exact inequalities for cheap, lazy laughs.\n\nRELATED: Homeless Man With 'Kim Kardashian Ruined My Life' Sign Claims The Billionaire Met With Him, Stole His Business Idea & Profited Off Him", "source": {"uri": "yourtango.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "YourTango"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kim Kardashian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Misogyny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roast_(comedy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roast (comedy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kanye West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Capitalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vagina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrity_sex_tape", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Celebrity sex tape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gisele_B\u00fcndchen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gisele B\u00fcndchen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transphobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transphobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2024-05/kim-kardashian-tom-brady-roast.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541610", "eventUri": "eng-9541610", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

He was certainly the butt of some jokes -- as the twice-retired quarterback should have been. (That's kind of the whole point of the roast, ya know?)\n\nBut it was Kim Kardashian who ended up being destroyed. The SKIMS founder was invited to come roast the NFL legend following rumors that the two had [at least] a fling. But when Kardashian walked on stage, she was met with a crowd of boos so loud and so long that she and fellow roaster Kevin Hart had to tell the audience to calm down before she could continue.\n\nShe took some solid jabs at Brady, but he definitely won their verbal sparring match when he took to the stage later that evening.\n\n\"I know Kim was terrified to be here tonight,\" he said. And yeah, things haven't been great for the media personality after Taylor Swift dropped \"thanK you aIMee,\" a damning song that's widely believed to be about Kardashian.\n\n\"Not because of this, but because her kids are at home with their dad,\" Brady continued.\n\nOOF. Kardashian shares kids North, Saint, Chicago, and Psalm with ex-husband Kanye \"Ye\" West, who has become more known for his bigoted tirades and odd behavior than his music.\n\nThe camera panned to Kardashian, and she graciously smiled and shook her head, taking the joke in stride.\n\nThe internet is freaking out over the burn, with Barstool Sports saying Kardashian got roasted more than Brady at the event.\n\n\"One of the best jokes of the night,\" one follower replied to the outlet's tweet.\n\n\"That - was - perfect,\" another said with three laughing emojis.\n\n\"Yeezy catching strays from the goat. You love to see it folks,\" someone else said on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nOthers disagreed, calling Ye a \"fantastic\" dad and saying Brady \"crossed the line.\" It's possible the kids loved spending the night with them (if that's even what happened). Kardashian revealed in an episode of The Kardashians last fall that North, 10 loves spending time at her dad's apartment where there reportedly isn't a nanny, chef, or security. \"She'll go to her dad's. She'll be like, 'Dad's the best! He has it all figured out,'\" Kardashian said. Plus, he's probably helping her with her first album, Elementary School Drop Out.\n\nAll that said, Kardashian revealed last year that she's trying to \"protect\" her kids from their father who has bipolar disorder.\n\n\"The whole situation is sad and I don't know how to handle it,\" she said. \"I'm conflicted because I don't ever want to jump in and be a part of a downfall for the father of my kids.\"\n\n\"...

She filed for divorce from the rapper in February 2021 after less than seven years of marriage. The split was finalized in November 2022.

Simpson during the latter's 1994 murder trial. \"Honestly, it's hard for me to watch people roast [Tom], but I think enough of my family members have helped defend former football players,\" the Hulu star joked.\n\nKim and Tom were linked when she was rumored to be looking for a vacation home in the same Bahamian community where the former NFL star has a residence.

Enough that she would actually, GASP, miss the Met Gala?!\n\nLet's take a step back for a second. First, you should know why Kim's waking up the morning of the Met Gala with egg on her face.\n\nTurns out, Kim was one of the many surprise guests to turn out for Tom Brady during his Netflix Roast on Sunday night. Based in LA, many of Tom's former teammates and comedians took turns taking shots at his career and love life.\n\nKim was the only former lover (allegedly) to appear at the roast. She probably thought it would be fun. She was wrong.\n\nKardashian both bombed and got booed... as she took major heat from those in attendance. She also had to endure Tom making jokes about Kanye West, which we're sure did not go over so well when she got home.\n\nTo Kim's credit, her actual roast material (which we're guessing she did NOT write herself) was pretty funny.\n\n\"I wasn't going to come tonight, but since I'm not here as Tom's date, there's still a good chance I might,\" Kardashian said, making her first reference to the rumors that she and the quarterback dated.\n\nElsewhere, Kardashian made a very strange joke that things would \"never work out\" between her and Brady ... randomly comparing Brady to her stepdad, Jenner, who transitioned in 2015.\n\n\"But I do know it would never work out. An ex-athlete, high cheek bones, slinky hair -- you remind me too much of my stepdad now.\" she quipped.\n\n\"Part of me thinks you would try to undress me, just to try on my clothes. I know the transition from the NFL must have been really hard, but I think my stepdad is a great example from you.\n\n\"She's one of the greatest athletes in the world who's proved you can do anything in this next chapter. You can become a commentator, a far right Republican, or even a strong, confident woman.\"\n\nBut none of it stuck the landing. Maybe there were too many Taylor Swift fans in the audience?!\n\nNow, just a day after this humiliating appearance, the most-hyped fashion-related event of the year will take place in New York City.\n\nWe're talking about the MET Gala, a gathering Kim has attended many times in the past; using it as an opportunity to walk the red carpet in an eye-popping outfit. Last year, Kardashian even brought daughter North to the MET Gala. The year before that, she famously wore Marilyn Monroe's iconic dress.\n\nThe theme will focus on The Costume Institute's spring exhibition, titled \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\" and big names like Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez, and Kim's sister, Kendall Jenner, are all slated to appear.\n\nBut what about Kim?! The truth is, it looks unlikely she will attend this year. For one thing, but this time, Kim has usually done nothing by hype up her planned outfit to anyone who would listen. For another, if she was at Tom's Roast last night, she would've had to really book it to NYC right after if she was going to attend.\n\nHowever, none of that gives us a definitive answer. She still could show up. And besides, she's fought very hard over the years to get Anna Wintour's approval to attend. She's not going to give that up so easily.", "source": {"uri": "thehollywoodgossip.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hollywood Gossip"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kay_d_rhodes@thehollywoodgossip.com", "name": "Kay D.

I f-king love it. She also sucked and read the teleprompter like a robot.\"\n\nKardashian had fun with the rumors that she and Brady had been seeing each other after his divorce from Gisele B\u00fcndchen.\n\n\"Speaking of Tom and I dating, I know there were some rumors that we were -- and I would never say if we did or not, I'd just release the tape,\" Kardashian said.\n\nMuch like all of the roasters, Kardashian was subject to ridicule throughout the evening.\n\nComedian Tony Hinchcliffe viciously mocked her over her past relationships and Brady got his revenge at the end with a Kanye West dig.\n\n\"I know Kim was terrified to be here tonight,\" Brady said. \"Not because of this but because her kids are home with their dad.\"\n\nPortnoy, who wrote on X that he was not invited to the roast, has long despised Kardashian and that has escalated of late given the reality star's past feud with Taylor Swift, whom the Barstool founder frequently supports.\n\n\"Oh yeah, I had her back in the whole Kanye [West] thing,\" Portnoy said in a TikTok video in December that featured various clips of him slamming Kardashian through the years. \"That f-king rat, Kim Kardashian... edited the phone call to make it seem like Taylor Swift's a liar... you f-king lying snake.\n\n\"This is f-king jail time... you big booty woman... Kim Kardashian should be thrown in prison. I just hate f-king injustice and scumbags and f-king dishonest treacherous leaches. Just shut up or own up to it.\"\n\nThe beef between Kardashian and Swift dates back to 2016, when West, the mogul's then-husband, dropped the track \"Famous\" that features the lyrics: \"I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex, Why?

Will she even show her face, considering how she must be feeling in the wake of the Tom Brady roast?\n\nTo Kim's credit, her actual roast material (which we're guessing she did NOT write herself) was pretty funny.\n\n\"I wasn't going to come tonight, but since I'm not here as Tom's date, there's still a good chance I might,\" Kardashian said, making her first reference to the rumors that she and the quarterback dated.\n\nElsewhere, Kardashian made a very strange joke that things would \"never work out\" between her and Brady ... randomly comparing Brady to her stepdad, Jenner, who transitioned in 2015.\n\n\"But I do know it would never work out. An ex-athlete, high cheek bones, slinky hair -- you remind me too much of my stepdad now.\" she quipped.\n\n\"Part of me thinks you would try to undress me, just to try on my clothes.

The 43-year-old reality star had presumably been invited due to rumors that she was dating the former quarterback last year. However, Kardashian was not exactly a sight for sore eyes at the event, and nobody was happier to see her get booed than Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy.\n\nAlthough the audience initially seemed to cheer Kardashian when she got behind the podium, the cheers quickly turned to boos when she attempted to crack a joke about host Kevin Hart's height.\n\n\"I'm really here tonight for Tom,\" The SKIMS founder said, after the crowd finally settled down. \"I wasn't going to come tonight, but since I'm not here as Tom's date, there's still a good chance I might.\"\n\nPortnoy, a lifelong New England Patriots fan whose distaste of Kardashian has been well documented over the years, weighed in from home. \"Kim Kardashian getting flat booed at the Brady roast is the highlight of this roast,\" he posted to X, followed by a clip of the moment.\n\n\"Kardashian got booed like Goodell after the Pats won the Super Bowl,\" he posted. \"Kevin Hart had to legit tell people to stop. I f--king love it. She also sucked and read the teleprompter like a robot.\"\n\nIn the clip, Portnoy could be heard yelling over his TV. \"First of all, she looks awful. Awful,\" he said. \"Nobody got booed the whole night, listen to this crowd. Boo! Boo! Boooo! Kevin Hart had to tell people to get quiet! Sit down, everyone hates you Amy! Everyone hates you!\"\n\nPornoy, also an avid Taylor Swift fan, was referring to the apparent diss track from the singer's new album, The Tortured Poets Department. The song, called \"thanK you aIMee,\" not-so-subtly references Swift's years-long feud with Kardashian by employing some clever use of capitalization.\n\nDespite Kardashian's involvement, Portnoy went on to rate the special an A+ on Monday morning, while making a dig at Netflix for not having invited him.\n\n\"The Tom Brady Roast was an A+.

The event, hosted by comedian Kevin Hart, was streamed live, with multiple comedians and Brady's former National Football League (NFL) teammates cracking jokes at the former quarterback's expense.\n\nHinchcliffe was one of the comedians in attendance and many believe he took things a step too far when he made a joke about Kardashian.\n\nAfter actor Will Ferrell made an appearance dressed as his iconic Ron Burgundy character from Anchorman, Hinchcliffe referenced the famous \"Whale's vagina\" line from the film when he directed a joke at Kardashian.\n\n\"And how about the appearance from the great Ron Burgundy, huh? A whale's vagina. Which reminds me, Kim Kardashian's here. She's had a lot of Black men celebrating her end zone,\" Hinchcliffe said. \"Kim, word of advice, close your legs. You have more public beef than Kendrick [Lamar] and Drake.\"\n\nThis last comment was in reference to the feud that is currently playing out between the two rappers.\n\nThe camera then panned to Kardashian who smiled and nodded, as the surrounding audience members laughed. While people at the event seemed amused, others took to X, formerly Twitter, to slam Hinchcliffe.\n\nNewsweek emailed spokespeople for Kardashian and Hinchcliffe for comment Monday.\n\n\"you can genuinely drag the kardashians for anything under the sun, but of course you choose to slut-shame because being confident in your sexuality is the worst crime to men,\" X user @sistertonin wrote.\n\n\"how many jokes about abusing women and revenge porn and general misogyny did they manage to squeeze into this, a roast of a man?\" user @thenoasletter asked.\n\n\"How is it acceptable to make jokes like this again? Omg we've actually gone backwards,\" posted @JayElHarris alongside multiple skull emojis.\n\nUser @SimplyAYT_ added: \"Both racist and misogynistic but because Kim is an acceptable target he'll get away with it unscathed.\"\n\nMeanwhile, others wrote that while they may dislike Kardashian, Hinchcliffe's joke was still inexcusable.\n\n\"Oh the misogyny is crazy here. I don't even like that Kardashian family, but this is distasteful and crass. Wow,\" user @iamntyrelldifferent wrote.\n\n\"I may wish hell upon her but misogyny is still inexcusable,\" posted @alaiasmuse, while @LexxMoves added: \"I really hate it when ppl do things that make me defend ppl I don't like.\"\n\nHowever, not everyone was unimpressed with the joke, as @andysignore posted to X: \"My god... Tony Hinchcliffe KILLED IT on the Roast of Tom Brady loved this burn on Kim Kardashian.\"\n\nDuring his roast on Sunday, Brady also made a jab at Kardashian, referencing her ex-husband, rapper Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, and their four children together, North, Saint, Chicago, and Psalm.\n\n\"I know Kim was terrified to be here tonight. Not because of this, but because her kids are at home with their dad,\" he said.\n\nWhen it was Kardashian's time to take the mic and roast Brady herself, she faced boos from the crowd. It wasn't until Hart asked the crowd to give her a chance to speak that the jeers subsided.\n\nActor Ben Affleck and comedian Chelsea Handler as well as former head coach of the New England Patriots Bill Belichick and former quarterback Peyton Manning were also in attendance on Sunday.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri":

However, some of the jokes didn't quite hit the mark and fell flat, much like a dropped interception on the field. Targeted zingers towards tight end Travis Kelce didn't seem to appeal audience much, and a comment about Kim Kardashian allegedly went too far, sparking outrage online. The special, which featured stars like Robert Kraft, Julian Edelman, and Rob Gronkowski, has taken a turn for the worse (at least among the fans of Swift and Kardashian.)\n\nAfter roasting Peyton Manning and Brett Favre, the 46-year-old went straight after the most hyped team in the NFL right now - the Kansas City Chiefs. The legendary quarterback didn't mince his words when referring to Chiefs Tight End Kelce and his relationship with Taylor Swift, calling the new fanbase of the NFL '14-year-old girls'. \"Kansas City, you say your stadium is the loudest... it helps when all your fans are 14-year-old girls,\" he remarked. Earlier reports suggested that Super Bowl 2024 saw a significant boost in viewership due to Taylor Swift's fandom.\n\nAlso read: Drake and Kendrick Lamar feud complete timeline: Big 3 to 'certified paedophile'\n\nFans didn't look very happy with the comment made and slammed the host as clout chaser. \"It's disappointing to see Tom Brady resorting to using Taylor Swift for clout with such terrible material. Not funny, just tasteless.\" A fan wrote on X, sharing the clip. \"Not the high school a*s drags - all just because you are mad at someone for passing your stats,\" wrote another calling the remark as \"jealousy.\" \"A football player having to talk about the biggest popstar in the world for some cheap laughs. How sad.\" Wrote one more.\n\nIf the Swift saga wasn't enough, Brady's remarks about Skims founder Kim Kardashian made things even worse. But first, Kim herself took the stage and addressed the relationship rumours with Brady for the first time. \"Speaking of Tom and I dating, I know there were some rumours that we were, and I'd never say if we did or not. I'd just release the tape,\" Kim delivered sarcastically.\n\nAlso read: Mark Zuckerberg's $300 Million Superyacht visuals slammed as 'climate hypocrite's hideaway'\n\nAfter around 2 hours of brutal roasting, Brady himself took the stage and fired back at everyone one by one. Addressing Kim he said, \"I know Kim was terrified to be here tonight,\" the host remarked. \"Not because of this, but because her kids are at home with their dad.\" He added seemingly referring to West.\n\nHowever, what drew the most flak was not actually from Brady, but Tony Hinchcliffe taking a shot at Kim Kardashian during the Tom Brady Netflix roast special where he delivered, \"She's had a lot of Black men celebrating her end-zone. Kim, word of advice, close your legs. You have more public beef than Kendrick and Drake.\"\n\n\"That's not even funny... men are so dumb.\" Wrote a netizen. \"This is just blatant misogyny. But what can you expect from a disgusting white man,\" chimed in another. \"I don't support her but this guy has no right to hate on her like that, she doesn't deserve all that.\" One more added. \"sl*t shaming women infront of a crowd of people and making women the butt of a joke for absolutely no reason is so disrespectful. He should lose his job. So unprofessional.\"", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roast_(comedy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roast (comedy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kim Kardashian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kraft", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert Kraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Gronkowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rob Gronkowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Favre", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brett Favre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Edelman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julian Edelman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peyton_Manning", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peyton Manning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "High school football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Misogyny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/05/06/1600x900/Taylorkim_1714983846712_1714983856121.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541610", "eventUri": "eng-9541610", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

When Tom, 46, finally took the stage, he got a chance to respond to every comic, celebrity, and athlete who roasted him, and he had a hilarious joke about Ye,46, to roast Kim, 43.\n\nWhen Tom took the stage to respond to all the roasts against him, he got a jab against Ye when he roasted the SKIMS founder. \"Kim Kardashian, thank you so much for being here. I know Kim was terrified to be here tonight,\" he quipped. \"Not because of this, but because her kids are home with their dad.\"\n\nWhen the camera cut to Kim, she put on a smile. She seemed to let out a chuckle, and she gave Tom a small look that looked playfully unamused. A few fans weighed in on X (formerly Twitter) speculating that the reality star wasn't into the joke. One person wrote that Kim was \"visibly unimpressed\" with the jab, but it's not totally clear what her reaction was.\n\nDespite some fan speculation on Kim's reaction to the roast joke, The Kardashians star has made jokes about her ex-husband in the past, including when she hosted Saturday Night Live in October 2021. \"I married the best rapper of all time. Not only that, he's the richest Black man in America,\" she said during her monologue. \"A talented, legit genius who gave me four incredible kids. So, when I divorced him, you have to know it came down to just one thing: his personality.\"\n\nAfter making the joke, Kim revealed that Ye \"walked out on SNL, like, mid-monologue,\" during a May 2022 episode of The Kardashians.

But a point did come where Kim was allowed to speak and continue her roast so that was certainly one moment that Kim wished she never took part in.", "source": {"uri": "smalljoys.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "Small Joys"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kim Kardashian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roast_(comedy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roast (comedy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://static.smalljoys.me/2024/05/copy-of-articles-thumbnail-1200-x-630-4-8.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541610", "eventUri": "eng-9541610", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

One of the most surprising attractions, however, was Kim Kardashian, who got the invite to show her roasting skills, and as many expected, she didn't live up to the energy, even getting booed before she could throw some punches.\n\nAs soon as Kim K. walked to the podium, a loud cheer filled the arena, which soon turned into boos. So much so that Kevin Hart had to step in and ask people to stop the booing, and as it turns out, this reaction brought a smile to Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy's face. He even shared a snippet of the moment, roasting Kim for her unlikable personality and robotic delivery.\n\nHe even compared the whole thing to scenes when the Patriots fans booed Boston's enemy numero uno, Roger Goodell, following the Deflate Gate controversy that put the team through trials and tribulations.\n\n\"Kardashian got booed like Goodell after the Pats won the Super Bowl,\" Portnoy wrote in the caption. \"Kevin Hart had to legit tell people to stop. I fucking love it. She also sucked and read the teleprompter like a robot.\"\n\nLater on, Portnoy put up another tweet, praising the success of the roast and sarcastically thanking Netflix for not inviting him to the event. He then asserted that not getting invited to such a mega event was an eye-opener for him, which will keep him motivated for more success, and he was blessed for that.\n\n\"The Tom Brady Roast was an A+. And I'm very thankful for Netflix and everybody involved not inviting me,\" Portnoy quipped with a pinch of sarcasm. \"I'm glad Brianna and Feitleberg got to go. Keeps me humble and hungry. Knocked me down a few pegs which is exactly what I needed. Truly blessed to not be invited.\"\n\nPortnoy's beef with Kim K. stems from the Barstool founder being a Swiftie, as per Newsweek. Taylor Swift has had a long-standing feud with Kim since 2016 and recently released a song called \"thanK you aIMee\", which many argue is about Kanye West's ex-wife. Portnoy reveled with joy when he heard the song, and even took to social media, calling Kardashian various colorful names, like dirtbag, rat, and snake.\n\nFans were quick to see another one of Portnoy's contempt posts for Kim, and while many agreed with the sentiment, others were a tad bit sympathetic to Kardashian's plight.\n\nFans had a mixed reaction to Dave's tweet. Several have quipped that Kim K is a lot wealthier than Portnoy and that he should just shut up. Others pointed out that while her performance was bad, they still felt bad for her, and the crowd should not have berated her like that.\n\nHowever, there were several who sided with the Barstool founder, stressing that Kim has no talent, even speculating that she might have hired a ghostwriter to write her jokes. See for yourselves:\n\nThis fan chimed in and added, \"Oh man. I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I low key feel bad for her.\"\n\nA fan quipped, \"We could have done without your booing. It's completely unnecessary.\"\n\nAnother remarked, \"Kardashian getting booed like Goodell after the Pats won the Super Bowl? Kevin Hart had to step in? Hilarious!\"\n\nLooks like Kim K. will continue to get hate from Swifties like Dave as long as the feud between TayTay and her exists. Nonetheless, the event proved to be a roaring success, and we might see another one of these roasts in the future. For those who didn't get to watch the roast live, you can enjoy it now on Netflix.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ayush_juneja@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Ayush Juneja", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Portnoy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "David Portnoy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roast_(comedy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roast (comedy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kim Kardashian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Robot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barstool_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barstool Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Goodell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roger Goodell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcasm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sarcasm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleprompter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Teleprompter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostwriter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ghostwriter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kanye West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/05/511d7ac5-untitled-design-14.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541610", "eventUri": "eng-9541610", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 117, "relevance": 1}

So this was nothing new and nothing Kim couldn't take,\" the insider says. \"Kim thought she handled the whole situation really well and doesn't have any regrets about participating whatsoever. She would definitely do it all over again. Kim felt like even though some of the jokes about her were brutal, it was still all in good fun.\"\n\nKardashian was loudly booed by the crowd at Los Angeles' Kia Forum on Sunday, May 5, when she took the stage to roast the NFL quarterback, 46. While viewers of the original livestream heard the reaction, it was cut from the edited version now streaming. Kardashian was even delayed in telling her first joke because of the crowd's heckling. At one point, host Kevin Hart tried hushing the audience by jokingly saying, \"Whoa, whoa, whoa.\"\n\n\"I know Kim was terrified to be here tonight,\" Brady said. \"Not because of this but because her kids are at home with their dad.\" (Kardashian and West share kids North, 10, Saint, 8, Chicago, 6, and Pslam, 5.)\n\nComedian Nikki Glaser, who performed at the roast, admitted even she was surprised about the digs at Kardashian.\n\n\"One of the moments that I go, 'Oh, we can go there?'... [Brady] did a joke about Kim Kardashian,\" Glaser said during an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on Tuesday, May 7. \"[I thought] she was off-limits because she's here, she's not on the stage, she takes enough of a beating.\"\n\nHowever, Kardashian had the opportunity to clap back with her own jokes. She first took aim at Hart, 44, saying, \"I know a lot of people make fun of your height,\" she said. \"But what people don't know is you're also pretty mean, which makes you the smallest Black dick I've ever seen.\"\n\nKardashian later made a quip about the romance rumors between her and Brady in 2023 after his split from Gisele B\u00fcndchen.\n\n\"I wasn't going to come tonight, but since I'm not here as Tom's date, there's still a good chance I might,\" Kardashian said before comparing Brady to her former stepfather, Caitlyn Jenner.\n\n\"I do know it would never work out,\" she continued about the potential of a relationship with Brady. \"An ex-athlete, high cheekbones, slinky hair -- you remind me too much of my stepdad now. Part of me thinks you would try to undress me, just to try on my clothes.\"", "source": {"uri": "usmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Us Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "laura_rizzo@usmagazine.com", "name": "Laura Rizzo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roast_(comedy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roast (comedy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kim Kardashian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Us_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Us Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kia Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestreaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Livestreaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Glaser", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Glaser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlyn_Jenner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caitlyn Jenner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gisele_B\u00fcndchen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gisele B\u00fcndchen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Kimmel_Live!", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Kimmel Live!"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Kim-Kardashian-Was-Unfazed-by-Getting-Booed-at-Tom-Brady-949.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541610", "eventUri": "eng-9541610", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-05", "textStart": 688, "textEnd": 693}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 1540, "textEnd": 1545}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 452992069, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 192, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 192}}}

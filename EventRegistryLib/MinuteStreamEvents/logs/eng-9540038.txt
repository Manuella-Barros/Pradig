It gained 3.5% in the week.\n\nOn Monday, the yen was lower, slipping 0.5% to 153.69 per dollar.\n\nJapanese and British markets are both closed for a holiday on Monday, likely resulting in lower volumes, but with Japanese authorities choosing last week's quiet periods to intervene in the currency market, traders will be on high alert through the day.\n\nThe more than 9 trillion yen that the Bank of Japan is estimated to have spent to prop up the frail yen last week has only bought it some time, analysts say, as the market still views the currency as a sell.\n\nWhile Japan clearly has capacity to intervene more, the broader macro environment remains quite negative for the yen, according to Goldman Sachs strategists, noting intervention \"success\" can only go so far.\n\n\"But, buying time is still valuable, as it reduces the potential for economic disruptions from the exchange rate adjustment and could stabilise the currency until the economic backdrop becomes more supportive for JPY,\" they said in a note.\n\nThe yen has been under pressure as U.S. interest rates have climbed and Japan's have stayed near zero, driving cash out of yen and into higher-yielding assets.\n\nThe latest weekly report from U.S. regulators showed that non-commercial traders, a category that includes speculative trades and hedge funds, reduced their yen short positions to 168,388 futures contracts in the week ended April 30, still close to their largest bearish positions since 2007.\n\n\"In a week that's light on U.S. data and heavy on Fed speeches, the Fed's rhetoric post-payrolls will determine whether dollar-yen retests the 160-level anytime soon,\" said Nicholas Chia, Asia macro strategist at Standard Chartered.\n\nData on Friday showed U.S. job growth slowed more than expected in April and the increase in annual wages fell below 4.0% for the first time in nearly three years, as signs of labour market cooling raised optimism that the U.S. central bank could engineer a \"soft landing\" for the economy.\n\nMarkets are now pricing in almost 50 basis points of cuts this year, with a rate cut in November fully priced in.\n\n\"It's definitely what the Fed wants to see more of and the first report in quite a while that has surprised to the downside,\" said Dane Cekov, senior FX strategist at Nordea.\n\nThe Fed held interest rates steady at the conclusion of its two-day monetary policy meeting last week, as expected, but signalled it was still leaning towards eventual rate cuts, even if they may take longer to come than initially expected.\n\n\"The weaker dollar trend started with the Fed and Powell when he essentially shut the door on further rate hikes,\" Nordea's Cekov said.\n\nThe dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against six others, was at 105.10, having touched a more than three-week low of 104.52 on Friday. The index is up nearly 4% this year but fell almost 1% last week.\n\nThe euro last fetched $1.0764, while sterling was up 0.2% at $1.25715 before a Bank of England policy announcement on Thursday, where interest rates are expected to be held at 5.25%.\n\nMainland China's markets opened after being closed for three days last week. In that time, the offshore yuan had risen on the back of the dollar's broad retreat.\n\nThe offshore yuan eased to 7.2194 per dollar, having gained more than 1% last week. In the spot market, the onshore yuan opened at 7.2009 per dollar, its strongest since March 25.

It was last down 0.2%.\n\nThe Nasdaq-listed Golden Dragon China Index jumped 5.5% last week.\n\nSimilarly, in currency markets, the offshore yuan was last roughly 0.1% lower at 7.2013 per dollar, after strengthening more than 1% last week, in part due to a broadly weaker dollar.\n\nThe People's Bank of China on Monday also lifted its official yuan midpoint to the highest in three weeks, catching up with movements offshore. That sent the onshore yuan to its highest in over a month at 7.2009 per dollar.\n\nThe rebound in Chinese markets has come on the back of the country's Politburo meeting, where policymakers said they will step up support for the economy with prudent monetary and proactive fiscal policies.\n\n\"While the overall policy stance is in-line with those set at the National People's Congress in March, there is a more supportive policy tone on fiscal policy,\" said Louisa Fok, China equity strategist at Bank of Singapore.\n\n\"Looking ahead, policy implementation would be a key catalyst to watch in the coming months. In addition, earnings growth estimates revision momentum would be another key indicator to watch from a corporate fundamental perspective.\"\n\nThe broader market rally across Asia meanwhile got an additional boost from Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report, which came in cooler than expected.\n\nThat reinforced bets that Fed rate cuts would likely come later this year, after Chair Jerome Powell also maintained the central bank's easing bias last week.\n\n\"(The) data point to a jobs market that is still tight, but not nearly as hot as it was a year or two ago,\" said economists at Wells Fargo. \"This should support a further slowdown in inflation as the year progresses, even if improvement proceeds only gradually.\"\n\nThe dollar held broadly steady on Monday, leaving the euro away from a one-month high to last trade at $1.0766, while sterling similarly last bought $1.2551. [FRX/]\n\nTrading of cash U.S. Treasuries was closed with the Japan holiday, though futures were little changed. [US/]\n\nINTERVENTION WATCH\n\nElsewhere, traders also remained on alert for any further volatility in the yen, after last week's bouts of suspected intervention from Japanese authorities to stop a sharp slide in the currency.\n\nTokyo is suspected to have spent more than 9 trillion yen($59 billion) to support its currency last week, as suggested by data from Bank of Japan, taking the yen from a 34-year low of 160.245 per dollar to a roughly one-month high of 151.86 over the span of a week.\n\nThe yen gave back some of those gains on Monday and was last 0.4% lower at 153.62 per dollar.\n\nEconomic leaders of South Korea, Japan and China had on Friday said heightened foreign exchange market volatility was one of the risk factors that could affect regional growth prospects in the near term.\n\nWith little major U.S. economic data due this week, Saxo's head of FX strategy Charu Chanana said \"any resulting yen strength could be more sustainable\".\n\nIn commodities, Brent futures rose 0.3% to $83.21 a barrel, while U.S. crude futures similarly edged 0.35% higher to $78.39 per barrel. [O/R]\n\nGold tacked on 0.2% to $2,307.15 an ounce.

It gained 3.5% in the week.\n\nOn Monday, the yen was broadly lower, slipping 0.63% to 153.95 per U.S. dollar, down 0.60% to 192.62 per pound and 0.64% lower at 165.715 per euro.\n\nJapan is closed for a holiday on Monday as is Britain, likely resulting in lower volumes. But with Japanese authorities choosing last week's quiet periods to intervene in the currency market, traders will be on high alert through the day.\n\nThe more than 9 trillion yen that the Bank of Japan is estimated to have spent to prop up the frail yen last week has only bought it some time, analysts say, as the market still views the currency as a sell.\n\nWhile Japan clearly has capacity to intervene more, the broader macro environment remains quite negative for the yen, according to Goldman Sachs strategists, noting intervention \"success\" can only go so far.\n\n\"But, buying time is still valuable, as it reduces the potential for economic disruptions from the exchange rate adjustment and could stabilise the currency until the economic backdrop becomes more supportive for JPY,\" they said in a note.\n\nThe yen has been under pressure as U.S. interest rates have climbed and Japan's have stayed near zero, driving cash out of yen and into higher-yielding assets.\n\nThe latest weekly report from U.S. regulators showed that non-commercial traders, a category that includes speculative trades and hedge funds, reduced their yen short positions to 168,388 futures contracts in the week ended April 30, still close to their largest bearish positions since 2007.\n\n\"In a week that light on U.S. data and heavy on Fed speeches, the Fed's rhetoric post-payrolls will determine whether dollar-yen retests the 160-level anytime soon,\" said Nicholas Chia, Asia macro strategist at Standard Chartered.\n\nMainland China's markets opened after being closed for three days last week. In that time, the offshore yuan had risen on the back of the dollar's broad retreat and as Fed Chair Jerome Powell confirmed the central bank's easing bias and Japan intervened to push the yen higher.\n\nThe offshore yuan eased to 7.2160 per dollar, having gained more than 1% last week. In the spot market, the onshore yuan opened at 7.2009 per dollar, its strongest since March 25. It was last at 7.2144. [CNY/]\n\nFED PATH\n\nData on Friday showed U.S. job growth slowed more than expected in April and the increase in annual wages fell below 4.0% for the first time in nearly three years, as signs of labour market cooling raised optimism that the U.S. central bank could engineer a \"soft landing\" for the economy.\n\nMarkets are now pricing in 45 basis points of cuts this year, with a rate cut in November fully priced in.\n\n\"The softer data will be welcomed by the Fed as the loosening labour market and slower wage growth will help ease inflation,\" said Mansoor Mohi-Uddin, chief economist at Bank Of Singapore.\n\nThe Fed held interest rates steady at the conclusion of its two-day monetary policy meeting, as expected, last week but signalled it was still leaning towards eventual rate cuts, even if they may take longer to come than initially expected.\n\nThe dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against six rivals, was at 105.16, having touched a more than three-week low of 104.52 on Friday. The index is up nearly 4% this year.\n\nThe euro last fetched $1.0764, while sterling was little changed at $1.2545. The New Zealand dollar was 0.17% lower at $0.600.\n\nThe Australian dollar was flat at $0.6612 ahead the Reserve Bank of Australia's policy decision on Tuesday where the central bank is generally expected to keep rates at 4.35% having been on hold since last November.

It was last down 0.1%.\n\nThe Nasdaq-listed Golden Dragon China Index jumped 5.5% last week.\n\nSimilarly, in currency markets, the onshore yuan had a catch-up rally and surged to a six-week high of 7.2009 per dollar, while its offshore counterpart last stood at 7.2162 per dollar, having strengthened more than 1% last week.\n\nThe rebound in Chinese markets has come on the back of the country's Politburo meeting, where policymakers said they will step up support for the economy with prudent monetary and proactive fiscal policies.\n\n\"While the overall policy stance is in line with those set at the National People's Congress in March, there is a more supportive policy tone on fiscal policy,\" said Louisa Fok, China equity strategist at Bank of Singapore. \"Looking ahead, policy implementation would be a key catalyst to watch in the coming months. In addition, earnings growth estimates revision momentum would be another key indicator to watch from a corporate fundamental perspective.\"\n\nA long-awaited recovery in the Chinese economy is also gaining momentum, with data on Monday showing the country's services activity expansion slowed a touch amid rising costs, but growth in new orders accelerated and business sentiment rose solidly.\n\nThe broader market rally across Asia meanwhile got an additional boost from Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report, which came in cooler than expected.\n\nThat reinforced bets that Fed rate cuts would most likely come this year, after Chair Jerome Powell also maintained the central bank's easing bias last week.\n\n\"(The) data point to a jobs market that is still tight, but not nearly as hot as it was a year or two ago,\" said economists at Wells Fargo. \"This should support a further slowdown in inflation as the year progresses, even if improvement proceeds only gradually.\"\n\nEUROSTOXX 50 futures gained 0.35%, while Nasdaq futures were little changed. S&P 500 futures added 0.07%.\n\nThe dollar held broadly steady on Monday, leaving the euro away from a one-month high to last trade at $1.07635, while sterling similarly edged lower and last bought $1.2545. [FRX/]\n\nINTERVENTION WATCH\n\nElsewhere, traders also remained on alert for any further volatility in the yen, after last week's bouts of suspected intervention from Japanese authorities to stop a sharp slide in the currency.\n\nTokyo is suspected to have spent more than 9 trillion yen($59 billion) to support its currency last week, as suggested by data from Bank of Japan, taking the yen from a 34-year low of 160.245 per dollar to a roughly one-month high of 151.86 over the span of a week.\n\nThe yen gave back some of those gains on Monday and was last 0.6% lower at 153.935 per dollar, after briefly weakening past the 154 level earlier in the session.\n\nEconomic leaders of South Korea, Japan and China had on Friday said heightened foreign exchange market volatility was one of the risk factors that could affect regional growth prospects in the near term.\n\nIn commodities, Brent futures rose 0.33% to $83.23 a barrel, while U.S. crude futures similarly edged 0.36% higher to $78.39 per barrel.

The yen had clocked last week its strongest weekly gain since early December 2022 following two bouts of suspected interventions from Tokyo to pull the currency away from a 34-year low of 160.245 per dollar. It gained 3.5% in the week.\n\nOn Monday, the yen was broadly lower, slipping 0.63% to 153.95 per U.S. dollar, down 0.60% to 192.62 per pound and 0.64% lower at 165.715 per euro. Japan is closed for a holiday on Monday as is Britain, likely resulting in lower volumes. But with Japanese authorities choosing last week's quiet periods to intervene in the currency market, traders will be on high alert through the day.\n\nThe more than 9 trillion yen that the Bank of Japan is estimated to have spent to prop up the frail yen last week has only bought it some time, analysts say, as the market still views the currency as a sell. While Japan clearly has capacity to intervene more, the broader macro environment remains quite negative for the yen, according to Goldman Sachs strategists, noting intervention \"success\" can only go so far.\n\n\"But, buying time is still valuable, as it reduces the potential for economic disruptions from the exchange rate adjustment and could stabilise the currency until the economic backdrop becomes more supportive for JPY,\" they said in a note. The yen has been under pressure as U.S. interest rates have climbed and Japan's have stayed near zero, driving cash out of yen and into higher-yielding assets.\n\nThe latest weekly report from U.S. regulators showed that non-commercial traders, a category that includes speculative trades and hedge funds, reduced their yen short positions to 168,388 futures contracts in the week ended April 30, still close to their largest bearish positions since 2007. \"In a week that light on U.S. data and heavy on Fed speeches, the Fed's rhetoric post-payrolls will determine whether dollar-yen retests the 160-level anytime soon,\" said Nicholas Chia, Asia macro strategist at Standard Chartered.\n\nMainland China's markets opened after being closed for three days last week. In that time, the offshore yuan had risen on the back of the dollar's broad retreat and as Fed Chair Jerome Powell confirmed the central bank's easing bias and Japan intervened to push the yen higher. The offshore yuan eased to 7.2160 per dollar, having gained more than 1% last week. In the spot market, the onshore yuan opened at 7.2009 per dollar, its strongest since March 25. It was last at 7.2144.\n\nFED PATH Data on Friday showed U.S. job growth slowed more than expected in April and the increase in annual wages fell below 4.0% for the first time in nearly three years, as signs of labour market cooling raised optimism that the U.S. central bank could engineer a \"soft landing\" for the economy.\n\nMarkets are now pricing in 45 basis points of cuts this year, with a rate cut in November fully priced in. \"The softer data will be welcomed by the Fed as the loosening labour market and slower wage growth will help ease inflation,\" said Mansoor Mohi-Uddin, chief economist at Bank Of Singapore.\n\nThe Fed held interest rates steady at the conclusion of its two-day monetary policy meeting, as expected, last week but signalled it was still leaning towards eventual rate cuts, even if they may take longer to come than initially expected. The dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against six rivals, was at 105.16, having touched a more than three-week low of 104.52 on Friday. The index is up nearly 4% this year.\n\nThe euro last fetched $1.0764, while sterling was little changed at $1.2545. The New Zealand dollar was 0.17% lower at $0.600. The Australian dollar was flat at $0.6612 ahead the Reserve Bank of Australia's policy decision on Tuesday where the central bank is generally expected to keep rates at 4.35% having been on hold since last November.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

It was last down 0.2%.\n\nThe Nasdaq-listed Golden Dragon China Index jumped 5.5% last week.\n\nSimilarly, in currency markets, the offshore yuan was last roughly 0.1% lower at 7.2013 per dollar, after strengthening more than 1% last week, in part due to a broadly weaker dollar.\n\nThe People's Bank of China on Monday also lifted its official yuan midpoint to the highest in three weeks, catching up with movements offshore. That sent the onshore yuan to its highest in over a month at 7.2009 per dollar.\n\nThe rebound in Chinese markets has come on the back of the country's Politburo meeting, where policymakers said they will step up support for the economy with prudent monetary and proactive fiscal policies.\n\n\"While the overall policy stance is in line with those set at the National People's Congress in March, there is a more supportive policy tone on fiscal policy,\" said Louisa Fok, China equity strategist at Bank of Singapore.\n\n\"Looking ahead, policy implementation would be a key catalyst to watch in the coming months. In addition, earnings growth estimates revision momentum would be another key indicator to watch from a corporate fundamental perspective.\"\n\nThe broader market rally across Asia meanwhile got an additional boost from Friday's US nonfarm payrolls report, which came in cooler than expected.\n\nThat reinforced bets that Fed rate cuts would likely come later this year, after Chair Jerome Powell also maintained the central bank's easing bias last week.\n\n\"(The) data point to a jobs market that is still tight, but not nearly as hot as it was a year or two ago,\" said economists at Wells Fargo. \"This should support a further slowdown in inflation as the year progresses, even if improvement proceeds only gradually.\"\n\nThe dollar held broadly steady on Monday, leaving the euro away from a one-month high to last trade at US$1.0766, while sterling similarly last bought US$1.2551.\n\nTrading of cash US Treasuries was closed with the Japan holiday, though futures were little changed.\n\nElsewhere, traders also remained on alert for any further volatility in the yen, after last week's bouts of suspected intervention from Japanese authorities to stop a sharp slide in the currency.\n\nTokyo is suspected to have spent more than \u00a59 trillion (RM277.55 billion) to support its currency last week, as suggested by data from Bank of Japan, taking the yen from a 34-year low of 160.245 per dollar to a roughly one-month high of 151.86 over the span of a week.\n\nThe yen gave back some of those gains on Monday and was last 0.4% lower at 153.62 per dollar.\n\nEconomic leaders of South Korea, Japan and China had on Friday said heightened foreign exchange market volatility was one of the risk factors that could affect regional growth prospects in the near term.\n\nWith little major US economic data due this week, Saxo's head of FX strategy Charu Chanana said \"any resulting yen strength could be more sustainable\".\n\nIn commodities, Brent futures rose 0.3% to US$83.21 a barrel, while US crude futures similarly edged 0.35% higher to US$78.39 per barrel.", "source": {"uri": "theedgemalaysia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Edge Malaysia"},

The dollar held broadly steady on Monday, leaving the euro away from a one-month high to last trade at $1.0771, while sterling rose 0.2% and last bought $1.2575.\n\nIn Europe, Goldman Sachs raised its 2024 EPS growth forecast for STOXX 600 companies to 6% from 3% earlier, the bank said in a note on Friday.\n\nAccording to Goldman, a 10% annual rise in Brent prices adds about 2.5 pp (percentage points) to annual EPS growth, and a 10% weaker euro/dollar exchange rate adds about the same.\n\nWith public holidays in the UK and Japan, markets in mainland China and Europe got off to an upbeat start also enjoying the glow from renewed U.S. optimism.\n\nEurope's broadest stock index rose 0.7% by 1245 BST.\n\nOil prices were also in focus on the prospects of Saudi Arabian price hikes and rising tensions in the Middle East, with Brent futures up 73 cents to $83.69 a barrel and U.S. crude futures 81 cents higher to $78.92 per barrel.\n\nOn Monday, Israel's military called on Palestinian civilians to evacuate Rafah as part of a \"limited scope\" operation, but did not immediately confirm media reports this was part of preparation for a ground assault.\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan peaked at its highest level since February 2023 and last gained 0.7%, while China's blue-chip index closed 1.5% higher.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 4.7% last week and on Friday clocked its longest daily winning streak since 2018, closing on Monday 0.55% higher.\n\nThe rebound in Chinese markets followed the country's Politburo meeting, where policymakers said they will step up support for the economy with prudent monetary and proactive fiscal policies.\n\nA long-awaited recovery in the Chinese economy is also gaining momentum. Data on Monday showed the country's services activity expansion slowed a touch amid rising costs, but growth in new orders accelerated and business sentiment rose.\n\nINTERVENTION WATCH\n\nElsewhere, traders remained on alert for further volatility in the yen, after last week's bouts of suspected intervention from Japanese authorities to stop a sharp slide in the currency.\n\nTokyo is suspected of having spent more than 9 trillion yen ($59 billion) to support its currency last week, as suggested by data from Bank of Japan, taking the yen from a 34-year low of 160.245 per dollar to a roughly one-month high of 151.86 over the span of a week.\n\nThe yen gave back some of those gains on Monday and was last 0.5% lower at 153.765 per dollar, after briefly weakening past the 154 level earlier in the session.\n\nGold tacked on 0.6% to $2,316 an ounce.\n\n($1 = 153.5700 yen)\n\n(Reporting by Nell Mackenzie and Rae Wee; Additional reporting by Roshan Abraham; Editing by Gerry Doyle, Ed Osmond

But the offshore yuan had risen on the back on the dollar's broad retreat after data showed a cooling U.S. jobs market, Fed Chair Jerome Powell confirmed the central bank's easing bias and Japan intervened to push the yen higher.\n\nThe offshore yuan was last at 7.1959 per dollar, and gained more than 1% last week.\n\nJapan is closed for a holiday on Monday as is Britain, likely resulting in lower volumes. But with Japanese authorities choosing last week's quiet periods to intervene in the yen market, traders will be on high alert through the day.\n\nThe more than 9 trillion yen that the Bank of Japan is estimated to have spent to prop up the frail yen last week has only bought it some time, analysts say, as the market still views the currency as a sell.\n\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission's weekly commitments of traders report showed that non-commercial traders, a category that includes speculative trades and hedge funds, reduced their yen short positions to 168,388 futures contracts in the week ended April 30, still close to their largest bearish positions since 2007.\n\nWhile Japan clearly has capacity to intervene more, the broader macro environment remains quite negative for the yen, according to Goldman Sachs strategists, noting intervention \"success\" can only go so far.\n\n\"But, buying time is still valuable, as it reduces the potential for economic disruptions from the exchange rate adjustment and could stabilize the currency until the economic backdrop becomes more supportive for JPY,\" they said in a note.\n\nData on Friday showed U.S. job growth slowed more than expected in April and the increase in annual wages fell below 4.0% for the first time in nearly three years, as signs of labour market cooling raised optimism that the U.S. central bank could engineer a \"soft landing\" for the economy.\n\nMarkets are now pricing in 45 basis points of cuts this year, with a rate cut in November fully priced in.\n\nThe Fed held interest rates steady at the conclusion of its two-day monetary policy meeting, as expected, but signalled it was still leaning towards eventual rate cuts, even if they may take longer to come than initially expected.\n\n\"While inflation is likely to remain closer to 3% than 2% this year, we project just enough cooling in inflation to meet the Fed's bar for a summer rate cut,\" Citi strategists said in a note.\n\n\"The case for cuts will be much stronger if we are correct that softer April jobs are a sign of further weakening to come.\"\n\nThe dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against six rivals, was at 105.12, having touched a three week low of 104.52 on Friday.\n\nThe euro was up 0.07% at $1.0765, while the sterling was last at $1.2547, up 0.02% on the day.", "source": {"uri":

The New Zealand dollar was 0.17% lower at $0.600.\n\nThe Australian dollar was flat at $0.6612 ahead the Reserve Bank of Australia's policy decision on Tuesday where the central bank is generally expected to keep rates at 4.35% having been on hold since last November.

Those were his words, 'unlikely,' and therefore they took that to mean that he wants to cut,\" said Brad Conger, chief investment officer at Hirtle Callaghan & Co. in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania.\n\nHowever, the rate outlook is still uncertain as the market hopes rates are restrictive enough to slow the economy and reduce the pace of inflation, Conger said.\n\nNew York Fed President John Williams on Monday said that at some undefined point the U.S. central bank will lower its rate target, but for now monetary policy is in a \"very good place,\" while Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said the battle against inflation will likely require a hit to demand.\n\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.32%, the S&P 500 gained 0.82% and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.95%.\n\nIn Europe, the pan-regional STOXX 600 closed up 0.53% on signs the European Central Bank is more confident about cutting rates as euro zone inflation continues to decelerate, three ECB policymakers said.\n\nPhilip Lane, Gediminas Simkus and Boris Vujcic said separately that the inflation and growth data cemented their belief that euro zone inflation, which was 2.4% in April, will slow to the central bank's 2% target by the middle of next year.\n\nMSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe rose 0.70%.

The dollar held broadly steady on Monday, leaving the euro away from a one-month high to last trade at $1.0771, while sterling rose 0.2% and last bought $1.2575.\n\nIn Europe, Goldman Sachs raised its 2024 EPS growth forecast for STOXX 600 companies to 6% from 3% earlier, the bank said in a note on Friday.\n\nAccording to Goldman, a 10% annual rise in Brent prices adds about 2.5 pp (percentage points) to annual EPS growth, and a 10% weaker euro/dollar exchange rate adds about the same.\n\nWith public holidays in the UK and Japan, markets in mainland China and Europe got off to an upbeat start also enjoying the glow from renewed U.S. optimism.\n\nEurope's broadest stock index rose 0.7% by 1245 BST.\n\nOil prices were also in focus on the prospects of Saudi Arabian price hikes and rising tensions in the Middle East, with Brent futures up 73 cents to $83.69 a barrel and U.S. crude futures 81 cents higher to $78.92 per barrel.\n\nOn Monday, Israel's military called on Palestinian civilians to evacuate Rafah as part of a \"limited scope\" operation, but did not immediately confirm media reports this was part of preparation for a ground assault.\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan peaked at its highest level since February 2023 and last gained 0.7%, while China's blue-chip index closed 1.5% higher.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 4.7% last week and on Friday clocked its longest daily winning streak since 2018, closing on Monday 0.55% higher.\n\nThe rebound in Chinese markets followed the country's Politburo meeting, where policymakers said they will step up support for the economy with prudent monetary and proactive fiscal policies.\n\nA long-awaited recovery in the Chinese economy is also gaining momentum. Data on Monday showed the country's services activity expansion slowed a touch amid rising costs, but growth in new orders accelerated and business sentiment rose.\n\nINTERVENTION WATCH\n\nElsewhere, traders remained on alert for further volatility in the yen, after last week's bouts of suspected intervention from Japanese authorities to stop a sharp slide in the currency.\n\nTokyo is suspected of having spent more than 9 trillion yen ($59 billion) to support its currency last week, as suggested by data from Bank of Japan, taking the yen from a 34-year low of 160.245 per dollar to a roughly one-month high of 151.86 over the span of a week.\n\nThe yen gave back some of those gains on Monday and was last 0.5% lower at 153.765 per dollar, after briefly weakening past the 154 level earlier in the session.\n\n(Reporting by Nell Mackenzie and Rae Wee; Additional reporting by Roshan Abraham; Editing by Gerry Doyle, Ed Osmond and Toby Chopra)", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Those were his words, 'unlikely,' and therefore they took that to mean that he wants to cut,\" said Brad Conger, chief investment officer at Hirtle Callaghan & Co. in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania.\n\nHowever, the rate outlook is still uncertain as the market hopes rates are restrictive enough to slow the economy and reduce the pace of inflation, Conger said.\n\nNew York Fed President John Williams on Monday said that at some undefined point the U.S. central bank will lower its rate target, but for now monetary policy is in a \"very good place,\" while Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said the battle against inflation will likely require a hit to demand.\n\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.32%, the S&P 500 gained 0.82% and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.95%.\n\nIn Europe, the pan-regional STOXX 600 closed up 0.53% on signs the European Central Bank is more confident about cutting rates as euro zone inflation continues to decelerate, three ECB policymakers said.\n\nPhilip Lane, Gediminas Simkus and Boris Vujcic said separately that the inflation and growth data cemented their belief that euro zone inflation, which was 2.4% in April, will slow to the central bank's 2% target by the middle of next year.\n\nMSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe rose 0.70%.

With the UK and Japan on public holidays, markets in mainland China and Europe got off to an upbeat start, with Friday's softer-than-anticipated U.S. jobs report underpinning sentiment by renewing market rate-cut bets.\n\nEurope's broadest stock index rose 0.4% while S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures added 0.2% each in a positive sign for the Wall Street open later on. Oil prices were also in focus on the prospects of Saudi Arabian price hikes and rising tensions in the Middle East, with Brent futures up 80 cents to $83.76 a barrel and U.S. crude futures 91 cents higher to $79.02 per barrel.\n\nOn Monday, Israel's military called on Palestinian civilians to evacuate Rafah as part of a \"limited scope\" operation, but did not immediately confirm media reports this was part of preparation for a ground assault. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan peaked at its highest level since February 2023 and last gained 0.57%, while China's blue-chip index closed 1.5% higher.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 4.7% last week and on Friday clocked its longest daily winning streak since 2018, closing on Monday 0.55% higher. The rebound in Chinese markets followed the country's Politburo meeting, where policymakers said they will step up support for the economy with prudent monetary and proactive fiscal policies.\n\nA long-awaited recovery in the Chinese economy is also gaining momentum. Data on Monday showed the country's services activity expansion slowed a touch amid rising costs, but growth in new orders accelerated and business sentiment rose. Markets globally have also enjoyed a boost from Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report.\n\nThat reinforced bets Fed rate cuts would most likely come this year, after Chair Jerome Powell also maintained the central bank's easing bias last week. \"(The) data point to a jobs market that is still tight, but not nearly as hot as it was a year or two ago,\" said economists at Wells Fargo. \"This should support a further slowdown in inflation as the year progresses, even if improvement proceeds only gradually.\"\n\nTraders would be closely watching whether the S&P rises beyond the 50 day moving average of 5130 on Monday, an important price point in the S&P, said Florian Ielpo, head of macro at Lombard Odier Investment Managers. \"If we breach this level we'll continue to see an uptrend of new highs but if it is missed, it could take a couple of days or even weeks to return to these levels,\" said Ielpo.\n\nIn Europe, Goldman Sachs raised its 2024 EPS growth forecast for STOXX 600 companies to 6% from 3% earlier, the bank said in a note on Friday. According to Goldman, a 10% annual rise in Brent prices adds about 2.5 pp (percentage points) to annual EPS growth, and a 10% weaker euro/dollar exchange rate adds about the same.\n\nThe dollar held broadly steady on Monday, leaving the euro away from a one-month high to last trade at $1.0769, while sterling similarly edged lower and last bought $1.2545. INTERVENTION WATCH\n\nElsewhere, traders remained on alert for further volatility in the yen, after last week's bouts of suspected intervention from Japanese authorities to stop a sharp slide in the currency. Tokyo is suspected of having spent more than 9 trillion yen ($59 billion) to support its currency last week, as suggested by data from Bank of Japan, taking the yen from a 34-year low of 160.245 per dollar to a roughly one-month high of 151.86 over the span of a week.\n\nThe yen gave back some of those gains on Monday and was last 0.5% lower at 153.750 per dollar, after briefly weakening past the 154 level earlier in the session. Gold tacked on 0.7% to $2,317 an ounce.\n\n($1 = 153.5700 yen)\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri":

Those were his words, 'unlikely,' and therefore they took that to mean that he wants to cut,\" said Brad Conger, chief investment officer at Hirtle Callaghan & Co. in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania.\n\nBut the outlook on rates is still uncertain as the market hopes rates are restrictive enough to slow the economy and the pace of inflation, Conger said.\n\n\"That's a tenuous linkage, IE, meaning it's a leap of faith to believe that inflation goes away because activity slows down,\" he said. \"That's the orthodox view.\"\n\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.17%, the S&P 500 gained 0.55% and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.60%.\n\nIn Europe, the pan-regional STOXX 600 also was positive, up 0.52%, on signs the European Central Bank is more confident about cutting rates as euro zone inflation continues to ease, three ECB policymakers said.\n\nPhilip Lane, Gediminas Simkus and Boris Vujcic said separately that the inflation and growth data cemented their belief that euro zone inflation, which was 2.4% in April, will slow to the central bank's 2% target by the middle of next year.\n\nMSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe rose 0.54%.\n\nThe dollar held broadly steady, leaving the euro up 0.15% at $1.0774, while sterling strengthened 0.22% to $1.2571.\n\nIn Europe, Goldman Sachs raised its 2024 EPS growth forecast for STOXX 600 companies to 6% from 3% earlier, the bank said in a note on Friday.\n\nAccording to Goldman, a 10% annual rise in Brent prices adds about 2.5 percentage points to annual EPS growth, and a 10% weaker euro/dollar exchange rate adds about the same.\n\nTreasury yields ticked higher as investors assessed last week's subdued job creation, which reinforced view that the U.S. economy was not overheating enough to derail a rate cut.\n\nThe yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes rose 1.2 basis points to 4.512%, up from 4.5% late on Friday.\n\nTraders are now pricing in 48 basis points of Fed rate cuts by year end, with the first cut likely in September, according to LSEG's rate probability app. In recent weeks, traders had priced in just one cut due to signs of sticky inflation.\n\nWith public holidays in the UK and Japan, markets in mainland China and Europe got off to an upbeat start also enjoying the glow from renewed U.S. optimism.\n\nOil prices were also in focus on the prospects of Saudi Arabian price hikes and rising tensions in the Middle East, with U.S. crude up 0.56% to $78.55 a barrel and Brent higher at $83.39 per barrel, up 0.52% on the day.\n\nOn Monday, Israel's military called on Palestinian civilians to evacuate Rafah as part of a \"limited scope\" operation, but did not immediately confirm media reports this was part of preparation for a ground assault.\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan peaked at its highest level since February 2023 and closed 0.66% higher, while China's blue-chip index ended up 1.5%.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 4.7% last week and on Friday clocked its longest daily winning streak since 2018, closing on Monday 0.55% higher.\n\nINTERVENTION WATCH\n\nElsewhere, traders remained on alert for further volatility in the yen, after last week's bouts of suspected intervention from Japanese authorities to stop a sharp slide in the currency.\n\nTokyo is suspected of having spent more than 9 trillion yen ($59 billion) to support its currency last week, as suggested by data from Bank of Japan, taking the yen from a 34-year low of 160.245 per dollar to a roughly one-month high of 151.86 over the span of a week.\n\nThe yen gave back some of those gains on Monday and was last 0.63% lower against the greenback at 153.95 per dollar.\n\n(Reporting by Nell Mackenzie and Rae Wee; Additional reporting by Roshan Abraham; Editing by Gerry Doyle, Ed Osmond, Toby Chopra and Nick Macfie)", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Those were his words, 'unlikely,' and therefore they took that to mean that he wants to cut,\" said Brad Conger, chief investment officer at Hirtle Callaghan & Co. in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania.\n\nHowever, the rate outlook is still uncertain as the market hopes rates are restrictive enough to slow the economy and reduce the pace of inflation, Conger said.\n\nNew York Fed President John Williams on Monday said that at some undefined point the U.S. central bank will lower its rate target, but for now monetary policy is in a \"very good place,\" while Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said the battle against inflation will likely require a hit to demand.\n\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.32%, the S&P 500 gained 0.82% and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.95%.\n\nIn Europe, the pan-regional STOXX 600 closed up 0.53% on signs the European Central Bank is more confident about cutting rates as euro zone inflation continues to decelerate, three ECB policymakers said.\n\nPhilip Lane, Gediminas Simkus and Boris Vujcic said separately that the inflation and growth data cemented their belief that euro zone inflation, which was 2.4% in April, will slow to the central bank's 2% target by the middle of next year.\n\nMSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe rose 0.70%. Markets in Britain and Japan were closed for public holidays.\n\nThe dollar index fell 0.11% at 105.05, leaving the euro up 0.13% at $1.0772. Goldman Sachs raised its 2024 EPS growth forecast for STOXX 600 companies to 6% from 3% earlier, the bank said in a note on Friday.\n\nAccording to Goldman, a 10% annual rise in Brent prices adds about 2.5 percentage points to annual EPS growth, and a 10% weaker euro/dollar exchange rate adds about the same.\n\nTreasury yields ticked lower as investors assessed last week's subdued job creation, which reinforced view that the U.S. economy was not overheating enough to derail a rate cut.\n\nThe yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes fell 0.9 basis points to 4.492% from 4.5% late on Friday.\n\nTraders are now pricing in 44 basis points of Fed rate cuts by year end, with the first cut possibly in September, according to LSEG's rate probability app. In recent weeks, traders had priced in just one cut due to signs of sticky inflation.\n\nOil prices rose after Saudi Arabia hiked June crude prices for most regions and as the prospect of a quick agreement for a Gaza ceasefire deal appeared slim, reviving fears that combat between Hamas and Israeli forces will resume soon.\n\nU.S. crude settled up 37 cents at $78.48 a barrel and Brent rose 37 cents to settle at $83.33 per barrel.[O/R]\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan peaked at its highest level since February 2023 and closed 0.66% higher, while China's blue-chip index ended up 1.5%.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 4.7% last week and on Friday clocked its longest daily winning streak since 2018, closing on Monday 0.55% higher.\n\nINTERVENTION WATCH\n\nElsewhere, traders remained on alert for further volatility in the yen, after last week's bouts of suspected intervention from Japanese authorities to stop a sharp slide in the currency.\n\nTokyo is suspected of having spent more than 9 trillion yen($59 billion) to support its currency last week, as suggested by data from Bank of Japan, taking the yen from a 34-year low of 160.245 per dollar to a roughly one-month high of 151.86 over the span of a week.\n\nThe yen gave back some of those gains on Monday and was last 0.63% lower at 153.95 per dollar.\n\nGold prices climbed as the dollar weakened. U.S. gold futures for June delivery settled 0.9% higher at $2,331.20 per ounce.\n\nBitcoin gained 0.74% at $63,401.00 and ethereum declined 1.22% at $3076.7.\n\n(Reporting by Nell Mackenzie and Rae

Friday's U.S. payrolls report showed the smallest jobs gain since October, easing concerns the Fed would have to keep interest rates higher for longer.\n\nComments\n\nfrom Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday that rate increases remained unlikely were echoed by other Fed officials on Monday. New York Fed President\n\nJohn Williams said\n\nthat \"eventually\" the central bank will cut interest rates, although he did not give a time frame.\n\nthe current level of interest rates is restrictive enough to cool the economy to bring inflation back to the central bank's 2% target.\n\nThe economic calendar is light this week, highlighted by the consumer sentiment reading from the University of Michigan on Friday, while a host of Fed officials are due to speak, including Fed Governors Lisa Cook and Michelle Bowman later in the week.\n\nThe dollar will stay weaker \"as long as the data stays conducive to that and as long as those Fed speakers don't rebut Jay Powell, but I have a feeling that some of them will,\" said Thierry Wizman, global FX and rates strategist at Macquarie in New York.\n\n\"The labor market is evidently more loose now than it was a year ago, but at the same time, these guys who are more hawkish could easily build arguments to make a case for higher for longer,\" he said.\n\nThe dollar index fell 0.1% at 105.06, with the euro up 0.12% at $1.0771.\n\nThe yen was weaker against the greenback after last week notching its strongest weekly gain since early December 2022, following two rounds of suspected intervention from the Bank of Japan to pull the currency away from a 34-year low of 160.245 per dollar. The yen gained 3.5% in the week.\n\nOn Monday, the yen weakened 0.61% against the greenback at 153.92 per dollar.\n\nJapanese and British markets were both closed for a holiday on Monday, but with Japanese authorities choosing last week's quiet periods to intervene in the currency market, traders remained on guard to the possibility of another.\n\nTraders estimate the Bank of Japan spent nearly $59 billion defending the currency last week, but likely only bought some time, analysts say, as the market still views the yen as a sell.\n\nStill, \"it's pretty treacherous right now to be going long dollar-yen,\" said Wizman.\n\n\"It's not because FX intervention per se is effective, it's just that if the BoJ thinks that U.S. yields have peaked -- not saying they have -- but if they think that U.S. yields have peaked, they're going to be encouraged to try to intervene again.\"\n\nWhile Japan clearly has capacity to intervene more, the broader macro environment remains quite negative for the yen, according to Goldman Sachs strategists, saying that intervention \"success\" can go only so far.\n\nBarclays analysts said the interventions will do \"little more than delay the eventual\" move higher in the dollar.\n\nThe yen has been under pressure as U.S. interest rates have risen while Japan's have remained near zero, pushing cash out of the currency and into higher-yielding assets.\n\nThe latest weekly report from U.S. regulators showed that non-commercial traders, a category that includes speculative trades and hedge funds, reduced their yen short positions to 168,388 futures contracts in the week ended April 30, still close to their largest bearish positions since 2007.\n\nMarkets are now pricing in nearly 50 basis points of rate cuts from the Fed this year, including a 65.7% chance of a rate cut of at least 25 basis points in September, according to CME's FedWatch Tool.\n\nSterling strengthened 0.16% at $1.2564 ahead of a Bank of England policy announcement on Thursday, when interest rates are expected to be held at 5.25%.\n\n(Reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak; Editing by Andrea Ricci and Leslie Adler)", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Data on Monday showed the country's services activity expansion slowed a touch amid rising costs, but growth in new orders accelerated and business sentiment rose.\n\nMarkets globally have also enjoyed a boost from Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report.\n\nThat reinforced bets Fed rate cuts would most likely come this year, after Chair Jerome Powell also maintained the central bank's easing bias last week.\n\n\"(The) data point to a jobs market that is still tight, but not nearly as hot as it was a year or two ago,\" said economists at Wells Fargo. \"This should support a further slowdown in inflation as the year progresses, even if improvement proceeds only gradually.\"\n\nTraders would be closely watching whether the S&amp;P rises beyond the 50 day moving average of 5130 on Monday, an important price point in the S&amp;P, said Florian Ielpo, head of macro at Lombard Odier Investment Managers.\n\n\"If we breach this level we'll continue to see an uptrend of new highs but if it is missed, it could take a couple of days or even weeks to return to these levels,\" said Ielpo.\n\nIn Europe, Goldman Sachs raised its 2024 EPS growth forecast for STOXX 600 companies to 6% from 3% earlier, the bank said in a note on Friday.\n\nAccording to Goldman, a 10% annual rise in Brent prices adds about 2.5 pp (percentage points) to annual EPS growth, and a 10% weaker euro/dollar exchange rate adds about the same.\n\nThe dollar held broadly steady on Monday, leaving the euro away from a one-month high to last trade at $1.0769, while sterling similarly edged lower and last bought $1.2545.\n\nINTERVENTION WATCH\n\nElsewhere, traders remained on alert for further volatility in the yen, after last week's bouts of suspected intervention from Japanese authorities to stop a sharp slide in the currency.\n\nTokyo is suspected of having spent more than 9 trillion yen ($59 billion) to support its currency last week, as suggested by data from Bank of Japan, taking the yen from a 34-year low of 160.245 per dollar to a roughly one-month high of 151.86 over the span of a week.\n\nThe yen gave back some of those gains on Monday and was last 0.5% lower at 153.750 per dollar, after briefly weakening past the 154 level earlier in the session.\n\nGold tacked on 0.7% to $2,317 an ounce.\n\n($1 = 153.5700 yen)\n\n(Reporting by Nell Mackenzie and Rae Wee; Additional

The index is up nearly 4% this year but fell almost 1% last week.\n\nThe euro last fetched $1.0764, while sterling was up 0.2% at $1.25715 before a Bank of England policy announcement on Thursday, where interest rates are expected to be held at 5.25%.\n\nMainland China's markets opened after being closed for three days last week. In that time, the offshore yuan had risen on the back of the dollar's broad retreat.\n\nThe offshore yuan eased to 7.2194 per dollar, having gained more than 1% last week. In the spot market, the onshore yuan opened at 7.2009 per dollar, its strongest since March 25. It was last at 7.2149.

Those were his words, 'unlikely,' and therefore they took that to mean that he wants to cut,\" said Brad Conger, chief investment officer at Hirtle Callaghan & Co. in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania.\n\nBut the outlook on rates is still uncertain as the market hopes rates are restrictive enough to slow the economy and the pace of inflation, Conger said.\n\n\"That's a tenuous linkage, IE, meaning it's a leap of faith to believe that inflation goes away because activity slows down,\" he said. \"That's the orthodox view.\"\n\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.17%, the S&P 500 gained 0.55% and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.60%.\n\nIn Europe, the pan-regional STOXX 600 also was positive, up 0.52%, on signs the European Central Bank is more confident about cutting rates as euro zone inflation continues to ease, three ECB policymakers said.\n\nPhilip Lane, Gediminas Simkus and Boris Vujcic said separately that the inflation and growth data cemented their belief that euro zone inflation, which was 2.4% in April, will slow to the central bank's 2% target by the middle of next year.\n\nMSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe rose 0.54%.\n\nThe dollar held broadly steady, leaving the euro up 0.15% at $1.0774, while sterling strengthened 0.22% to $1.2571. In Europe, Goldman Sachs raised its 2024 EPS growth forecast for STOXX 600 companies to 6% from 3% earlier, the bank said in a note on Friday.\n\nAccording to Goldman, a 10% annual rise in Brent prices adds about 2.5 percentage points to annual EPS growth, and a 10% weaker euro/dollar exchange rate adds about the same.\n\nTreasury yields ticked higher as investors assessed last week's subdued job creation, which reinforced view that the U.S. economy was not overheating enough to derail a rate cut.\n\nThe yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes rose 1.2 basis points to 4.512%, up from 4.5% late on Friday. Traders are now pricing in 48 basis points of Fed rate cuts by year end, with the first cut likely in September, according to LSEG's rate probability app. In recent weeks, traders had priced in just one cut due to signs of sticky inflation.\n\nWith public holidays in the UK and Japan, markets in mainland China and Europe got off to an upbeat start also enjoying the glow from renewed U.S. optimism.\n\nOil prices were also in focus on the prospects of Saudi Arabian price hikes and rising tensions in the Middle East, with\n\nU.S. crude up 0.56% to $78.55 a barrel and Brent higher at $83.39 per barrel, up 0.52% on the day.[O/R]\n\nOn Monday, Israel's military called on Palestinian civilians to evacuate Rafah as part of a \"limited scope\" operation, but did not immediately confirm media reports this was part of preparation for a ground assault.\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan peaked at its highest level since February 2023 and closed 0.66% higher, while China's blue-chip index ended up 1.5%.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 4.7% last week and on Friday clocked its longest daily winning streak since 2018, closing on Monday 0.55% higher.\n\nINTERVENTION WATCH\n\nElsewhere, traders remained on alert for further volatility in the yen, after last week's bouts of suspected intervention from Japanese authorities to stop a sharp slide in the currency.\n\nTokyo is suspected of having spent more than 9 trillion yen($59 billion) to support its currency last week, as suggested by data from Bank of Japan, taking the yen from a 34-year low of 160.245 per dollar to a roughly one-month high of 151.86 over the span of a week.\n\nThe yen gave back some of those gains on Monday and was last 0.63% lower against the greenback at 153.95 per dollar.\n\n(Reporting by Nell Mackenzie and Rae Wee; Additional reporting by Roshan Abraham; Editing by Gerry Doyle, Ed Osmond, Toby Chopra and Nick Macfie)", "source": {"uri":

The dollar index, a measure of the U.S. currency against six major trading peers, was lower for a fourth straight session after data on Friday showed the lowest jobs gain since October, easing any angst the Fed might even hike again.\n\nA gauge of global stock markets rose on Monday on optimism that major central banks will cut interest rates this year, while the yen weakened against the dollar after a surge last week from Japan's suspected currency intervention. Stocks on both sides of the Atlantic advanced, and in Asia too, as a softer-than-expected U.S. labor market report last week led traders to revive bets that the Federal Reserve would ease monetary policy as early as September.\n\nThe dollar index, a measure of the U.S. currency against six major trading peers, was lower for a fourth straight session after data on Friday showed the lowest jobs gain since October, easing any angst the Fed might even hike again. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell \"told the market that a hike was unlikely. Those were his words, 'unlikely,' and therefore they took that to mean that he wants to cut,\" said Brad Conger, chief investment officer at Hirtle Callaghan & Co. in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania.\n\nHowever, the rate outlook is still uncertain as the market hopes rates are restrictive enough to slow the economy and reduce the pace of inflation, Conger said. New York Fed President John Williams on Monday said that at some undefined point the U.S. central bank will lower its rate target, but for now monetary policy is in a \"very good place,\" while Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said the battle against inflation will likely require a hit to demand.\n\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.32%, the S&P 500 gained 0.82% and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.95%. In Europe, the pan-regional STOXX 600 closed up 0.53% on signs the European Central Bank is more confident about cutting rates as euro zone inflation continues to decelerate, three ECB policymakers said.\n\nPhilip Lane, Gediminas Simkus and Boris Vujcic said separately that the inflation and growth data cemented their belief that euro zone inflation, which was 2.4% in April, will slow to the central bank's 2% target by the middle of next year. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe rose 0.70%. Markets in Britain and Japan were closed for public holidays.\n\nThe dollar index fell 0.11% at 105.05, leaving the euro up 0.13% at $1.0772. Goldman Sachs raised its 2024 EPS growth forecast for STOXX 600 companies to 6% from 3% earlier, the bank said in a note on Friday.\n\nAccording to Goldman, a 10% annual rise in Brent prices adds about 2.5 percentage points to annual EPS growth, and a 10% weaker euro/dollar exchange rate adds about the same. Treasury yields ticked lower as investors assessed last week's subdued job creation, which reinforced view that the U.S. economy was not overheating enough to derail a rate cut.\n\nThe yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes fell 0.9 basis points to 4.492% from 4.5% late on Friday. Traders are now pricing in 44 basis points of Fed rate cuts by year end, with the first cut possibly in September, according to LSEG's rate probability app. In recent weeks, traders had priced in just one cut due to signs of sticky inflation.\n\nOil prices rose after Saudi Arabia hiked June crude prices for most regions and as the prospect of a quick agreement for a Gaza ceasefire deal appeared slim, reviving fears that combat between Hamas and Israeli forces will resume soon. U.S. crude settled up 37 cents at $78.48 a barrel and Brent rose 37 cents to settle at $83.33 per barrel.\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan peaked at its highest level since February 2023 and closed 0.66% higher, while China's blue-chip index ended up 1.5%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 4.7% last week and on Friday clocked its longest daily winning streak since 2018, closing on Monday 0.55% higher.\n\nINTERVENTION WATCH Elsewhere, traders remained on alert for further volatility in the yen, after last week's bouts of suspected intervention from Japanese authorities to stop a sharp slide in the currency.\n\nTokyo is suspected of having spent more than 9 trillion yen ($59 billion) to support its currency last week, as suggested by data from Bank of Japan, taking the yen from a 34-year low of 160.245 per dollar to a roughly one-month high of 151.86 over the span of a week. The yen gave back some of those gains on Monday and was last 0.63% lower at 153.95 per dollar.\n\nGold prices climbed as the dollar weakened. U.S. gold futures for June delivery settled 0.9% higher at $2,331.20 per ounce. Bitcoin gained 0.74% at $63,401.00 and ethereum declined 1.22% at $3076.7.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri":

Those were his words, 'unlikely,' and therefore they took that to mean that he wants to cut,\" said Brad Conger, chief investment officer at Hirtle Callaghan &amp; Co. in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania.\n\nBut the outlook on rates is still uncertain as the market hopes rates are restrictive enough to slow the economy and the pace of inflation, Conger said.\n\n\"That's a tenuous linkage, IE, meaning it's a leap of faith to believe that inflation goes away because activity slows down,\" he said. \"That's the orthodox view.\"\n\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.17%, the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.55% and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.60%.\n\nIn Europe, the pan-regional STOXX 600 also was positive, up 0.52%, on signs the European Central Bank is more confident about cutting rates as euro zone inflation continues to ease, three ECB policymakers said.\n\nPhilip Lane, Gediminas Simkus and Boris Vujcic said separately that the inflation and growth data cemented their belief that euro zone inflation, which was 2.4% in April, will slow to the central bank's 2% target by the middle of next year.\n\nMSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe rose 0.54%.\n\nThe dollar held broadly steady, leaving the euro up 0.15% at $1.0774, while sterling strengthened 0.22% to $1.2571.\n\nIn Europe, Goldman Sachs raised its 2024 EPS growth forecast for STOXX 600 companies to 6% from 3% earlier, the bank said in a note on Friday.\n\nAccording to Goldman, a 10% annual rise in Brent prices adds about 2.5 percentage points to annual EPS growth, and a 10% weaker euro/dollar exchange rate adds about the same.\n\nTreasury yields ticked higher as investors assessed last week's subdued job creation, which reinforced view that the U.S. economy was not overheating enough to derail a rate cut.\n\nThe yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes rose 1.2 basis points to 4.512%, up from 4.5% late on Friday.\n\nTraders are now pricing in 48 basis points of Fed rate cuts by year end, with the first cut likely in September, according to LSEG's rate probability app. In recent weeks, traders had priced in just one cut due to signs of sticky inflation.\n\nWith public holidays in the UK and Japan, markets in mainland China and Europe got off to an upbeat start also enjoying the glow from renewed U.S. optimism.\n\nOil prices were also in focus on the prospects of Saudi Arabian price hikes and rising tensions in the Middle East, with U.S. crude up 0.56% to $78.55 a barrel and Brent higher at $83.39 per barrel, up 0.52% on the day.\n\nOn Monday, Israel's military called on Palestinian civilians to evacuate Rafah as part of a \"limited scope\" operation, but did not immediately confirm media reports this was part of preparation for a ground assault.\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan peaked at its highest level since February 2023 and closed 0.66% higher, while China's blue-chip index ended up 1.5%.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 4.7% last week and on Friday clocked its longest daily winning streak since 2018, closing on Monday 0.55% higher.\n\nINTERVENTION WATCH\n\nElsewhere, traders remained on alert for further volatility in the yen, after last week's bouts of suspected intervention from Japanese authorities to stop a sharp slide in the currency.\n\nTokyo is suspected of having spent more than 9 trillion yen ($59 billion) to support its currency last week, as suggested by data from Bank of Japan, taking the yen from a 34-year low of 160.245 per dollar to a roughly one-month high of 151.86 over the span of a week.\n\nThe yen gave back some of those gains on Monday and was last 0.63% lower against the greenback at 153.95 per dollar.\n\nSpot gold added 0.9% to $2,322.19 an ounce.\n\nBitcoin gained 0.30% to $63,119.00.\n\n(Reporting by Nell Mackenzie and Rae Wee; Additional reporting by Roshan Abraham; Editing by Gerry Doyle, Ed Osmond, Toby Chopra and Nick Macfie)", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk",

The index is up nearly 4% this year but fell almost 1% last week.\n\nThe euro last fetched $1.0769, while sterling was up 0.2% at $1.2575 before a Bank of England policy announcement on Thursday, where interest rates are expected to be held at 5.25%.\n\nMainland China's markets opened after being closed for three days last week.

The dollar held broadly steady on Monday, leaving the euro away from a one-month high to last trade at $1.0771, while sterling rose 0.2% and last bought $1.2575.\n\nIn Europe, Goldman Sachs raised its 2024 EPS growth forecast for STOXX 600 companies to 6% from 3% earlier, the bank said in a note on Friday.\n\nAccording to Goldman, a 10% annual rise in Brent prices adds about 2.5 pp (percentage points) to annual EPS growth, and a 10% weaker euro/dollar exchange rate adds about the same.\n\nWith public holidays in the UK and Japan, markets in mainland China and Europe got off to an upbeat start also enjoying the glow from renewed US optimism.\n\nEurope's broadest stock index rose 0.7% by 1245 BST.\n\nOil prices were also in focus on the prospects of Saudi Arabian price hikes and rising tensions in the Middle East, with Brent futures up 73 cents to $83.69 a barrel and US crude futures 81 cents higher to $78.92 per barrel.\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan peaked at its highest level since February 2023 and last gained 0.7%, while China's blue-chip index closed 1.5% higher.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 4.7% last week and on Friday clocked its longest daily winning streak since 2018, closing on Monday 0.55% higher.\n\nThe rebound in Chinese markets followed the country's Politburo meeting, where policymakers said they will step up support for the economy with prudent monetary and proactive fiscal policies.\n\nA long-awaited recovery in the Chinese economy is also gaining momentum. Data on Monday showed the country's services activity expansion slowed a touch amid rising costs, but growth in new orders accelerated and business sentiment rose.\n\nElsewhere, traders remained on alert for further volatility in the yen, after last week's bouts of suspected intervention from Japanese authorities to stop a sharp slide in the currency.\n\nTokyo is suspected of having spent more than 9 trillion yen ($59 billion) to support its currency last week, as suggested by data from Bank of Japan, taking the yen from a 34-year low of 160.245 per dollar to a roughly one-month high of 151.86 over the span of a week.\n\nThe yen gave back some of those gains on Monday and was last 0.5% lower at 153.765 per dollar, after briefly weakening past the 154 level earlier in the session.\n\nSeparately, investor morale in the eurozone improved for the seventh consecutive month in May to its highest level in more than two years, a survey showed on Monday, adding however that the recovery in the bloc's largest economy, Germany, was delicate.\n\nSentix's index for the eurozone rose to -3.6 points in May from -5.9 in April, its highest level since February 2022, also beating a forecast of -5.0 in a Reuters poll of analysts.\n\n\"The trend is therefore moving in the right direction, albeit in small steps, \" Sentix said. \"The data situation is encouraging, as the economy appears to have somewhat digested the various burdens of the last two years since the beginning of the Ukraine crisis.\"\n\nSentix said that expectations values for Germany were no longer negative for the first time since February 2022, but the situation index remained very weak at -33.5 points.\n\n\"The weak economic momentum is therefore by no means 'self-sustaining,'\" it said. \"We can only hope that German policymakers do not crush this delicate plant of hope again.\"", "source": {"uri": "gulftoday.ae", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Gulf Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Friday's U.S. payrolls report showed the smallest jobs gain since October, easing concerns the Fed would have to keep rates higher for longer.\n\nfrom Powell after the Fed's policy statement on Wednesday that rate increases remained unlikely.\n\nThe economic calendar is light this week, highlighted by the consumer sentiment reading from the University of Michigan on Friday, while a host of Fed officials are due to speak, including Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin and New York President John Williams on Monday.\n\n\"It will (stay weaker) as long as the data stays conducive to that and as long as those Fed speakers don't rebut Jay Powell, but I have a feeling that some of them will,\" said Thierry Wizman, global FX and rates strategist at Macquarie in New York.\n\n\"The labor market is evidently more loose now than it was a year ago, but at the same time, these guys who are more hawkish could easily build arguments to make a case for higher for longer.\"\n\nThe dollar index fell 0.23% at 104.93, with the euro up 0.23% at $1.0783.\n\nThe yen was weaker against the greenback after last week notching its strongest weekly gain since early December 2022 following two rounds of suspected intervention from the Bank of Japan to pull the currency away from a 34-year low of 160.245 per dollar. It gained 3.5% in the week.\n\nOn Monday, the yen weakened 0.44% against the greenback to 153.68 per dollar.\n\nJapanese and British markets were both closed for a holiday on Monday, but with Japanese authorities choosing last week's quiet periods to intervene in the currency market, traders remained on guard to the possibility of another.\n\nTraders estimate the Bank of Japan (BOJ) spent nearly $59 billion defending the currency last week, but likely only bought some time, analysts say, as the market still views the currency as a sell.\n\nStill, \"it's pretty treacherous right now to be going long dollar yen,\" said Wizman.\n\n\"It's not because FX intervention per se is effective, it's just that if the BoJ thinks that U.S. yields have peaked, not saying they have, but if they think that U.S. yields have peaked, they're going to be encouraged to try to intervene again.\"\n\nWhile Japan clearly has capacity to intervene more, the broader macro environment remains quite negative for the yen, according to Goldman Sachs strategists, noting intervention \"success\" can go only so far.\n\nBarclays analysts said the interventions will do \"little more than delay the eventual\" move higher in the dollar, rather than stem it.\n\nThe yen has been under pressure as U.S. interest rates have risen while Japan's have remained near zero, pushing cash out of currency and into higher-yielding assets.\n\nThe latest weekly report from U.S. regulators showed that non-commercial traders, a category that includes speculative trades and hedge funds, reduced their yen short positions to 168,388 futures contracts in the week ended April 30, still close to their largest bearish positions since 2007.\n\nMarkets are now pricing in nearly 50 basis points of cuts from the Fed this year, according to CME's FedWatch Tool, pricing in a 66.6% chance of a rate cut of at least 25 basis points in September.\n\nSterling strengthened 0.29% at $1.2581 ahead of a Bank of England policy announcement on Thursday, where interest rates are expected to be held at 5.25%.\n\n(Reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak; Editing by Andrea Ricci)", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Those were his words, 'unlikely,' and therefore they took that to mean that he wants to cut,\" said Brad Conger, chief investment officer at Hirtle Callaghan & Co. in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania.\n\nBut the outlook on rates is still uncertain as the market hopes rates are restrictive enough to slow the economy and the pace of inflation, Conger said.\n\n\"That's a tenuous linkage, IE, meaning it's a leap of faith to believe that inflation goes away because activity slows down,\" he said. \"That's the orthodox view.\"\n\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.17%, the S&P 500 gained 0.55% and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.60%.\n\nIn Europe, the pan-regional STOXX 600 also was positive, up 0.52%, on signs the European Central Bank is more confident about cutting rates as euro zone inflation continues to ease, three ECB policymakers said.\n\nPhilip Lane, Gediminas Simkus and Boris Vujcic said separately that the inflation and growth data cemented their belief that euro zone inflation, which was 2.4% in April, will slow to the central bank's 2% target by the middle of next year.\n\nThe dollar held broadly steady, leaving the euro up 0.15% at $1.0774, while sterling strengthened 0.22% to $1.2571. In Europe, Goldman Sachs raised its 2024 EPS growth forecast for STOXX 600 companies to 6% from 3% earlier, the bank said in a note on Friday.\n\nAccording to Goldman, a 10% annual rise in Brent prices adds about 2.5 percentage points to annual EPS growth, and a 10% weaker euro/dollar exchange rate adds about the same.\n\nTreasury yields ticked higher as investors assessed last week's subdued job creation, which reinforced view that the U.S. economy was not overheating enough to derail a rate cut.\n\nThe yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes rose 1.2 basis points to 4.512%, up from 4.5% late on Friday. Traders are now pricing in 48 basis points of Fed rate cuts by year end, with the first cut likely in September, according to LSEG's rate probability app. In recent weeks, traders had priced in just one cut due to signs of sticky inflation.\n\nWith public holidays in the UK and Japan, markets in mainland China and Europe got off to an upbeat start also enjoying the glow from renewed U.S. optimism.\n\nOil prices were also in focus on the prospects of Saudi Arabian price hikes and rising tensions in the Middle East, with\n\nU.S. crude up 0.56% to $78.55 a barrel and Brent higher at $83.39 per barrel, up 0.52% on the day.[O/R]\n\nOn Monday, Israel's military called on Palestinian civilians to evacuate Rafah as part of a \"limited scope\" operation, but did not immediately confirm media reports this was part of preparation for a ground assault.\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan peaked at its highest level since February 2023 and closed 0.66% higher, while China's blue-chip index ended up 1.5%.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 4.7% last week and on Friday clocked its longest daily winning streak since 2018, closing on Monday 0.55% higher.\n\nElsewhere, traders remained on alert for further volatility in the yen, after last week's bouts of suspected intervention from Japanese authorities to stop a sharp slide in the currency.\n\nTokyo is suspected of having spent more than 9 trillion yen($59 billion) to support its currency last week, as suggested by data from Bank of Japan, taking the yen from a 34-year low of 160.245 per dollar to a roughly one-month high of 151.86 over the span of a week.\n\nThe yen gave back some of those gains on Monday and was last 0.63% lower against the greenback at 153.95 per dollar.\n\n(Reporting by Nell Mackenzie and Rae Wee; Additional reporting by Roshan Abraham; Editing by Gerry Doyle, Ed Osmond, Toby Chopra and Nick Macfie)", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in",

Friday's U.S. payrolls report showed the smallest jobs gain since October, easing concerns the Fed would have to keep rates higher for longer.\n\nThe data helped affirm comments from Powell after the Fed's policy statement on Wednesday that rate increases remained unlikely.\n\nThe economic calendar is light this week, highlighted by the consumer sentiment reading from the University of Michigan on Friday, while a host of Fed officials are due to speak, including Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin and New York President John Williams on Monday.\n\n\"It will (stay weaker) as long as the data stays conducive to that and as long as those Fed speakers don't rebut Jay Powell, but I have a feeling that some of them will,\" said Thierry Wizman, global FX and rates strategist at Macquarie in New York.\n\n\"The labor market is evidently more loose now than it was a year ago, but at the same time, these guys who are more hawkish could easily build arguments to make a case for higher for longer.\"\n\nThe dollar index fell 0.23 per cent at 104.93, with the euro up 0.23 per cent at $1.0783.\n\nThe yen was weaker against the greenback after last week notching its strongest weekly gain since early December 2022 following two rounds of suspected intervention from the Bank of Japan to pull the currency away from a 34-year low of 160.245 per dollar. It gained 3.5 per cent in the week.\n\nOn Monday, the yen weakened 0.44 per cent against the greenback to 153.68 per dollar.\n\nJapanese and British markets were both closed for a holiday on Monday, but with Japanese authorities choosing last week's quiet periods to intervene in the currency market, traders remained on guard to the possibility of another.\n\nTraders estimate the Bank of Japan (BOJ) spent nearly $59 billion defending the currency last week, but likely only bought some time, analysts say, as the market still views the currency as a sell.\n\nStill, \"it's pretty treacherous right now to be going long dollar yen,\" said Wizman.\n\n\"It's not because FX intervention per se is effective, it's just that if the BoJ thinks that U.S. yields have peaked, not saying they have, but if they think that U.S. yields have peaked, they're going to be encouraged to try to intervene again.\"\n\nWhile Japan clearly has capacity to intervene more, the broader macro environment remains quite negative for the yen, according to Goldman Sachs strategists, noting intervention \"success\" can go only so far.\n\nBarclays analysts said the interventions will do \"little more than delay the eventual\" move higher in the dollar, rather than stem it.\n\nThe yen has been under pressure as U.S. interest rates have risen while Japan's have remained near zero, pushing cash out of currency and into higher-yielding assets.\n\nThe latest weekly report from U.S. regulators showed that non-commercial traders, a category that includes speculative trades and hedge funds, reduced their yen short positions to 168,388 futures contracts in the week ended April 30, still close to their largest bearish positions since 2007.\n\nMarkets are now pricing in nearly 50 basis points of cuts from the Fed this year, according to CME's FedWatch Tool, pricing in a 66.6 per cent chance of a rate cut of at least 25 basis points in September.\n\nSterling strengthened 0.29 per cent at $1.2581 ahead of a Bank

That sent the onshore yuan to its highest in over a month at 7.2009 per dollar.\n\nThe rebound in Chinese markets has come on the back of the country's Politburo meeting, where policymakers said they will step up support for the economy with prudent monetary and proactive fiscal policies.\n\n\"While the overall policy stance is in-line with those set at the National People's Congress in March, there is a more supportive policy tone on fiscal policy,\" said Louisa Fok, China equity strategist at Bank of Singapore.\n\n\"Looking ahead, policy implementation would be a key catalyst to watch in the coming months. In addition, earnings growth estimates revision momentum would be another key indicator to watch from a corporate fundamental perspective.\"\n\nThe broader market rally across Asia meanwhile got an additional boost from Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report, which came in cooler than expected.\n\nThat reinforced bets that Fed rate cuts would likely come later this year, after Chair Jerome Powell also maintained the central bank's easing bias last week.\n\n\"(The) data point to a jobs market that is still tight, but not nearly as hot as it was a year or two ago,\" said economists at Wells Fargo. \"This should support a further slowdown in inflation as the year progresses, even if improvement proceeds only gradually.\"\n\nThe dollar held broadly steady on Monday, leaving the euro away from a one-month high to last trade at $1.0766, while sterling similarly last bought $1.2551.

currency.\n\nTokyo is suspected to have spent more than 9 trillion yen($59 billion) to support its currency last week, as suggested by data from Bank of Japan, taking the yen from a 34-year low of 160.245 per dollar to a roughly one-month high of 151.86 over the span of a week.\n\nThe yen gave back some of those gains on Monday and was last 0.4% lower at 153.62 per dollar.\n\nEconomic leaders

This marked its biggest weekly gain since December 2022. The rally was fueled by suspected intervention from the Bank of Japan (BOJ) which helped steer the currency away from a 34-year low. After breaching the 160-level last week, the Japanese currency closed strongly at 152.928 last Friday.\n\nBOJ steps in as yen plummets\n\nData from the BOJ suggests that Japan intervened twice in the foreign exchange market last week. This is to support the yen as it plummeted to 160.21 per dollar on Monday, a level not seen since 1990. A Bloomberg analysis comparing BOJ accounts with money broker forecasts estimated that the central bank spent around 9 trillion yen (or $58.9 billion) to prop up the currency.\n\nSource: Tradingview, Wealth Securities Research\n\nYield differential weighs on yen\n\nThe BOJ has not officially confirmed the interventions. However, Japanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki told reporters at the Asian Development Bank's annual meeting on Friday, \"When there is excessive movement, it may be necessary to smooth it out.\" The yen has been under pressure as the BOJ maintains an ultra-loose monetary policy while other major central banks like the US Federal Reserve (Fed) are looking at maintaining interest rates \"higher for longer.\" This has led to a widening yield gap that makes the yen less attractive against the dollar.\n\nBearish bets on yen reach 18-year high\n\nThe BOJ's apparent intervention came as bearish bets against the yen hit the highest levels in at least 18 years, according to data from the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). This extreme positioning could potentially serve as a contrarian indicator, suggesting a short-term bottom for the yen.\n\nFriday's US jobs report also aided the yen's rally. The Japanese currency strengthened to an intraday high of 151.86 against the US dollar after April's non-farm payrolls showed 175,000 jobs gained which is below the 240,000 expected. The market is now pricing in a rate cut in September and a second cut by the end of the year. Rates dropped following the weak jobs report with the US 10-year yield falling below 4.5 percent.\n\nA turning point or temporary relief?\n\nThe BOJ's suspected interventions have led to a sharp appreciation in the yen, with the currency strengthening from a weekly low of 160.21 against the dollar to close near 152. Looking ahead, technical analysis suggests a likely consolidation of the yen between 152 and 160.40.\n\nThe yen's sharp recovery over the past week may provide a boost to regional currencies, including the Philippine peso, just as it had previously amplified the effects of \"higher-for-longer\" US rates. Investors should closely watch the yen's movement in the coming weeks to determine whether this marks the beginning of a broader reversal or merely a temporary respite in the currency's long-term decline.\n\nSource: Tradingview, Wealth Securities Research", "source": {"uri": "philstar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Philstar.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "wilson_sy@philstar.com", "name": "Wilson Sy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Japan", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japanese yen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foreign exchange market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shun'ichi_Suzuki_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shun'ichi Suzuki (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Finance_(Japan)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Finance (Japan)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Development_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asian Development Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_Futures_Trading_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commodity Futures Trading Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_trend", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market trend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_peso", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philippine peso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_analysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Technical analysis"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Paper_Money", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Paper Money", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Paper_Money", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Paper Money", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Conferences", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Local_Currency_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Local Currency Systems", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://media.philstar.com/images/filler/business-logo-filler-thumbnail.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540038", "eventUri": "eng-9540038", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

The dollar index, a measure of the U.S. currency against six major trading peers, was lower for a fourth straight session after data showed the lowest jobs gain since October, easing concerns the Fed would keep rates higher for longer.\n\nA gauge of global stock markets rose on Monday on optimism that major central banks will cut interest rates this year, while the yen weakened against the dollar after a strong surge last week from Japan's suspected currency intervention. Stocks on both sides of the Atlantic rose, with the three major indices on Wall Street in the green as a softer-than-expected U.S. labor market report last week slashed bets that the Federal Reserve might hike rates this year.\n\nThe dollar index, a measure of the U.S. currency against six major trading peers, was lower for a fourth straight session after data showed the lowest jobs gain since October, easing concerns the Fed would keep rates higher for longer. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell \"told the market that a hike was unlikely. Those were his words, 'unlikely,' and therefore they took that to mean that he wants to cut,\" said Brad Conger, chief investment officer at Hirtle Callaghan & Co. in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania.\n\nBut the outlook on rates is still uncertain as the market hopes rates are restrictive enough to slow the economy and the pace of inflation, Conger said. \"That's a tenuous linkage, IE, meaning it's a leap of faith to believe that inflation goes away because activity slows down,\" he said. \"That's the orthodox view.\"\n\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.17%, the S&P 500 gained 0.55% and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.60%. In Europe, the pan-regional STOXX 600 also was positive, up 0.52%, on signs the European Central Bank is more confident about cutting rates as euro zone inflation continues to ease, three ECB policymakers said.\n\nPhilip Lane, Gediminas Simkus and Boris Vujcic said separately that the inflation and growth data cemented their belief that euro zone inflation, which was 2.4% in April, will slow to the central bank's 2% target by the middle of next year. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe rose 0.54%.\n\nThe dollar held broadly steady, leaving the euro up 0.15% at $1.0774, while sterling strengthened 0.22% to $1.2571. In Europe, Goldman Sachs raised its 2024 EPS growth forecast for STOXX 600 companies to 6% from 3% earlier, the bank said in a note on Friday.\n\nAccording to Goldman, a 10% annual rise in Brent prices adds about 2.5 percentage points to annual EPS growth, and a 10% weaker euro/dollar exchange rate adds about the same. Treasury yields ticked higher as investors assessed last week's subdued job creation, which reinforced view that the U.S. economy was not overheating enough to derail a rate cut.\n\nThe yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes rose 1.2 basis points to 4.512%, up from 4.5% late on Friday. Traders are now pricing in 48 basis points of Fed rate cuts by year end, with the first cut likely in September, according to LSEG's rate probability app. In recent weeks, traders had priced in just one cut due to signs of sticky inflation.\n\nWith public holidays in the UK and Japan, markets in mainland China and Europe got off to an upbeat start also enjoying the glow from renewed U.S. optimism. Oil prices were also in focus on the prospects of Saudi Arabian price hikes and rising tensions in the Middle East, with U.S. crude up 0.56% to $78.55 a barrel and Brent higher at $83.39 per barrel, up 0.52% on the day.\n\nOn Monday, Israel's military called on Palestinian civilians to evacuate Rafah as part of a \"limited scope\" operation, but did not immediately confirm media reports this was part of preparation for a ground assault. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan peaked at its highest level since February 2023 and closed 0.66% higher, while China's blue-chip index ended up 1.5%.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 4.7% last week and on Friday clocked its longest daily winning streak since 2018, closing on Monday 0.55% higher. INTERVENTION WATCH\n\nElsewhere, traders remained on alert for further volatility in the yen, after last week's bouts of suspected intervention from Japanese authorities to stop a sharp slide in the currency. Tokyo is suspected of having spent more than 9 trillion yen ($59 billion) to support its currency last week, as suggested by data from Bank of Japan, taking the yen from a 34-year low of 160.245 per dollar to a roughly one-month high of 151.86 over the span of a week.\n\nThe yen gave back some of those gains on Monday and was last 0.63% lower against the greenback at 153.95 per dollar. Spot gold added 0.9% to $2,322.19 an ounce.\n\nBitcoin gained 0.30% to $63,119.00.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source":

In early trading, Germany's DAX was up 0.58 per cent while France's CAC 40 advanced 0.48 per cent.\n\nOil prices were also in focus on the prospects of Saudi Arabian price hikes and rising tensions in the Middle East, with Brent futures up 80 cents to US$83.76 a barrel and U.S. crude futures 91 cents higher to US$79.02 per barrel.\n\nOn Monday, Israel's military called on Palestinian civilians to evacuate Rafah as part of a \"limited scope\" operation, but did not immediately confirm media reports this was part of preparation for a ground assault.\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan peaked at its highest level since February 2023 and last gained 0.57 per cent, while China's blue-chip index closed 1.5 per cent higher.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 4.7 per cent last week and on Friday clocked its longest daily winning streak since 2018, closing on Monday 0.55 per cent higher.\n\nThe rebound in Chinese markets followed the country's Politburo meeting, where policymakers said they will step up support for the economy with prudent monetary and proactive fiscal policies.\n\nA long-awaited recovery in the Chinese economy is also gaining momentum. Data on Monday showed the country's services activity expansion slowed a touch amid rising costs, but growth in new orders accelerated and business sentiment rose.\n\nMarkets globally have also enjoyed a boost from Friday's U.S. non-farm payrolls report.\n\nThat reinforced bets Fed rate cuts would most likely come this year, after chairman Jerome Powell also maintained the central bank's easing bias last week.\n\n\"[The] data point to a jobs market that is still tight, but not nearly as hot as it was a year or two ago,\" said economists at Wells Fargo. \"This should support a further slowdown in inflation as the year progresses, even if improvement proceeds only gradually.\"\n\nTraders would be closely watching whether the S&P rises beyond the 50 day moving average of 5130 on Monday, an important price point in the S&P, said Florian Ielpo, head of macro at Lombard Odier Investment Managers.\n\n\"If we breach this level we'll continue to see an uptrend of new highs but if it is missed, it could take a couple of days or even weeks to return to these levels,\" said Ielpo.\n\nIn Europe, Goldman Sachs raised its 2024 EPS growth forecast for STOXX 600 companies to 6 per cent from 3 per cent earlier, the bank said in a note on Friday.\n\nAccording to Goldman, a 10 per cent annual rise in Brent prices adds about 2.5 pp (percentage points) to annual EPS growth, and a 10 per cent weaker euro/dollar exchange rate adds about the same.\n\nThe dollar held broadly steady on Monday, leaving the euro away from a one-month high to last trade at US$1.0769, while sterling similarly edged lower and last bought US$1.2545.\n\nElsewhere, traders remained on alert for further volatility in the yen, after last week's bouts of suspected intervention from Japanese authorities to stop a sharp slide in the currency.\n\nTokyo is suspected of having spent more than 9 trillion yen ($59 billion) to support its currency last week, as suggested by data from Bank of Japan, taking the yen from a 34-year low of 160.245 per dollar to a roughly one-month high of 151.86 over the span of a week.\n\nThe yen gave back some of those gains on Monday and was last 0.5 per cent lower at 153.750 per dollar, after briefly weakening past the 154 level earlier in the session.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [],

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged more than 0.5% higher, while China's blue-chip index gained 1.4%.\n\nChinese shares offshore posted strong gains last week while mainland markets were closed from Wednesday to Friday for the Labour Day holiday. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 4.7% last week and on Friday clocked its longest daily winning streak since 2018. It was last down 0.2%.\n\nThe Nasdaq-listed Golden Dragon China Index jumped 5.5% last week. Similarly, in currency markets, the offshore yuan was last roughly 0.1% lower at 7.2013 per dollar, after strengthening more than 1% last week, in part due to a broadly weaker dollar.\n\nThe People's Bank of China on Monday also lifted its official yuan midpoint to the highest in three weeks, catching up with movements offshore. That sent the onshore yuan to its highest in over a month at 7.2009 per dollar. The rebound in Chinese markets has come on the back of the country's Politburo meeting, where policymakers said they will step up support for the economy with prudent monetary and proactive fiscal policies.\n\n\"While the overall policy stance is in-line with those set at the National People's Congress in March, there is a more supportive policy tone on fiscal policy,\" said Louisa Fok, China equity strategist at Bank of Singapore. \"Looking ahead, policy implementation would be a key catalyst to watch in the coming months. In addition, earnings growth estimates revision momentum would be another key indicator to watch from a corporate fundamental perspective.\"\n\nThe broader market rally across Asia meanwhile got an additional boost from Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report, which came in cooler than expected. That reinforced bets that Fed rate cuts would likely come later this year, after Chair Jerome Powell also maintained the central bank's easing bias last week.\n\n\"(The) data point to a jobs market that is still tight, but not nearly as hot as it was a year or two ago,\" said economists at Wells Fargo. \"This should support a further slowdown in inflation as the year progresses, even if improvement proceeds only gradually.\" The dollar held broadly steady on Monday, leaving the euro away from a one-month high to last trade at $1.0766, while sterling similarly last bought $1.2551.\n\nTrading of cash U.S. Treasuries was closed with the Japan holiday, though futures were little changed. INTERVENTION WATCH\n\nElsewhere, traders also remained on alert for any further volatility in the yen, after last week's bouts of suspected intervention from Japanese authorities to stop a sharp slide in the currency. Tokyo is suspected to have spent more than 9 trillion yen ($59 billion) to support its currency last week, as suggested by data from Bank of Japan, taking the yen from a 34-year low of 160.245 per dollar to a roughly one-month high of 151.86 over the span of a week.\n\nThe yen gave back some of those gains on Monday and was last 0.4% lower at 153.62 per dollar. Economic leaders of South Korea, Japan and China had on Friday said heightened foreign exchange market volatility was one of the risk factors that could affect regional growth prospects in the near term.\n\nWith little major U.S. economic data due this week, Saxo's head of FX strategy Charu Chanana said \"any resulting yen strength could be more sustainable\". In commodities, Brent futures rose 0.3% to $83.21 a barrel, while U.S. crude futures similarly edged 0.35% higher to $78.39 per barrel.\n\nGold tacked on 0.2% to $2,307.15 an ounce.

Markets are now pricing in 45 basis points of cuts this year, with a rate cut in November fully priced in.\n\nThe Fed held interest rates steady at the conclusion of its two-day monetary policy meeting, as expected, but signalled it was still leaning towards eventual rate cuts, even if they may take longer to come than initially expected. \"While inflation is likely to remain closer to 3% than 2% this year, we project just enough cooling in inflation to meet the Fed's bar for a summer rate cut,\" Citi strategists said in a note.\n\n\"The case for cuts will be much stronger if we are correct that softer April jobs are a sign of further weakening to come.\" The dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against six rivals, was at 105.12, having touched a three week low of

A stronger yen could dampen Japan's export competitiveness, potentially weighing on corporate profits and economic growth.\n\n\"This, in turn, could have ripple effects on global supply chains and trade flows, affecting businesses and consumers worldwide,\" notes the deVere Group chief executive.\n\nIn 2022, Japan took action in the currency market on three occasions. They sold the dollar to purchase yen, initially in September and then again in October. These interventions occurred as the yen's value declined towards 152 to the dollar, reaching a 32-year low at that point. It's estimated that Tokyo allocated approximately $60 billion to support the currency during these interventions.\n\nHe concludes: \"Monday's jump by the yen is almost certainly an intervention.

In 2022 Japan spent more than $60bn of its foreign-exchange reserves defending the yen, its first intervention to strengthen the currency since 1998, after the exchange rate fell to nearly \u00a5146 to the dollar. And for what? Today the yen is weaker still. Yet instead of learning that fighting the market is futile, policymakers are repeating the mistake. After falling to \u00a5160 to the dollar on April 29th, its lowest in 34 years, the currency twice moved sharply upwards in the subsequent days. It seems the government is buying again, to the tune of tens of billions of dollars.\n\nThe yen has been falling primarily because of simple economic logic. The gap in interest rates between Japan and America is yawning. Although the Bank of Japan raised rates in March, it did so by only a smidgen: they increased from between minus 0.1% and zero to between zero and 0.1%. Rates in booming America, by contrast, are more than five percentage points higher. Investors expect the gap to shrink a little over time, but not by much. As a result, a ten-year Japanese government bond yields just 0.9%, compared with 4.6% for an American Treasury of the same maturity.\n\nThe gulf exists because of differences in the outlook for inflation. It is still unclear just how emphatically Japan has broken out of the low-inflation -- and at times deflationary -- trap in which it has been stuck since asset prices collapsed in the 1990s. Although headline annual inflation has been above the central bank's 2% target for nearly two years, there are signs that price rises have been slowing. Rightly, rate-setters at the Bank of Japan seem more concerned with hitting their inflation target than with using monetary policy to support the yen. All told, therefore, the country's interest-rate outlook is diverging from America's, where there are growing worries that inflation is not falling as it should and that the Federal Reserve will, as a result, not cut interest rates any time soon.\n\nGiven that Japan has an open capital account, an inevitable side-effect of its low relative interest rates is a weak currency. Higher rates abroad make profitable a \"carry trade\", whereby investors borrow in yen and invest in dollars; that weakens the yen and strengthens the greenback. In theory, the yen must depreciate until its cheapness -- and hence the higher likelihood of a rebound in future -- means this trade is no longer expected to yield profits. Currencies can overshoot the fundamentals, but it is difficult to tell when they have, and harder still to calibrate an appropriate response. The thresholds at which the Japanese government has chosen to intervene are arbitrary. It says that volatility in the currency has been excessive, but its opaque criteria for selling reserves may well have made that problem worse.\n\nAfter the last intervention, economic logic was temporarily obscured by good luck. Towards the end of 2022 America's bond yields fell, allowing the yen to strengthen in the months that followed the intervention, before its slide resumed the next year. There is no guarantee that this pattern will be repeated. Instead, resisting the adjustment is likely to create opportunities for speculators, who will gladly treat the government as dumb money. After the apparent interventions, the exchange rate quickly began drifting back towards its previous level.\n\nThe Japanese government's urge to intervene is driven by a combination of political calculation and national pride. A cheaper yen makes imports, most notably of energy, more expensive, which is painful for voters. There is no doubting Japan's firepower: at last count, it had almost $1.3trn of foreign exchange reserves to run down. But it is a waste to spend them doing battle with currency traders who -- thanks to the choices of Japan's own policymakers not to follow the Fed -- have good reasons to be selling yen and buying dollars.\n\nCorrection (May 1st 2024): A previous version of this article stated the Bank of Japan raised interest rates in February.

The Japanese yen fell below the 160 level on Monday, setting another 34-year record before recovering. On Wednesday, the yen climbed 2.1% and on Friday it strengthened to 151.85, a one-month high against the US dollar.\n\nThe sharp swings on Monday and Wednesday were likely caused by intervention from Japan's Ministry of Finance (MoF).

US Treasury Secretary Yellen also declined to say whether Tokyo had intervened, but Bank of Japan current account data indicated that the Japanese government may have bought up $60 billion to support the ailing yen.\n\nPrevious interventions by the MoF haven't been effective, providing only a brief boost for the yen.

It was last down 0.2%.\n\nThe Nasdaq-listed Golden Dragon China Index jumped 5.5% last week.\n\nSimilarly, in currency markets, the offshore yuan was last roughly 0.1% lower at 7.2013 per dollar, after strengthening more than 1% last week, in part due to a broadly weaker dollar.\n\nThe People's Bank of China on Monday also lifted its official yuan midpoint to the highest in three weeks, catching up with movements offshore. That sent the onshore yuan to its highest in over a month at 7.2009 per dollar.\n\nThe rebound in Chinese markets has come on the back of the country's Politburo meeting, where policymakers said they will step up support for the economy with prudent monetary and proactive fiscal policies.\n\n\"While the overall policy stance is in-line with those set at the National People's Congress in March, there is a more supportive policy tone on fiscal policy,\" said Louisa Fok, China equity strategist at Bank of Singapore.\n\n\"Looking ahead, policy implementation would be a key catalyst to watch in the coming months. In addition, earnings growth estimates revision momentum would be another key indicator to watch from a corporate fundamental perspective.\"\n\nThe broader market rally across Asia meanwhile got an additional boost from Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report, which came in cooler than expected.\n\nThat reinforced bets that Fed rate cuts would likely come later this year, after Chair Jerome Powell also maintained the central bank's easing bias last week.\n\n\"(The) data point to a jobs market that is still tight, but not nearly as hot as it was a year or two ago,\" said economists at Wells Fargo. \"This should support a further slowdown in inflation as the year progresses, even if improvement proceeds only gradually.\"\n\nThe dollar held broadly steady on Monday, leaving the euro away from a one-month high to last trade at $1.0766, while sterling similarly last bought $1.2551.\n\nTrading of cash U.S. Treasuries was closed with the Japan holiday, though futures were little changed.\n\nINTERVENTION WATCH\n\nElsewhere, traders also remained on alert for any further volatility in the yen, after last week's bouts of suspected intervention from Japanese authorities to stop a sharp slide in the currency.\n\nTokyo is suspected to have spent more than 9 trillion yen ($59 billion) to support its currency last week, as suggested by data from Bank of Japan, taking the yen from a 34-year low of 160.245 per dollar to a roughly one-month high of 151.86 over the span of a week.\n\nThe yen gave back some of those gains on Monday and was last 0.4% lower at 153.62 per dollar.\n\nEconomic leaders of South Korea, Japan and China had on Friday said heightened foreign exchange market volatility was one of the risk factors that could affect regional growth prospects in the near term.\n\nWith little major U.S. economic data due this week, Saxo's head of FX strategy Charu Chanana said \"any resulting yen strength could be more sustainable\".\n\nIn commodities, Brent futures rose 0.3% to $83.21 a barrel, while U.S. crude futures similarly edged 0.35% higher to $78.39 per barrel.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Meanwhile, the yen weakens after last week's suspected intervention by Tokyo to halt its surge, according to Reuters.\n\nFutures indicate a buoyant opening, with the S&P 500 futures adding 0.3% and Nasdaq futures ticking up 0.2%, setting a positive tone for Wall Street's session following Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report. The report reignited hopes for a soft landing for the U.S. economy, reinforcing expectations of Fed rate cuts in the near future, particularly after Chair Jerome Powell reiterated the central bank's easing bias last week.\n\nEconomists at Wells Fargo noted that while the jobs market remains tight, it's not as hot as it was previously, which could lead to a gradual slowdown in inflation. This sentiment supports expectations for further Fed action to stimulate the economy.\n\nFlorian Ielpo, head of macro at Lombard Odier Investment Managers, highlighted the significance of the S&P rising beyond the 50-day moving average of 5130, indicating a potential uptrend. However, failure to breach this level could lead to a delay in reaching new highs.\n\nIn Europe, Goldman Sachs raised its 2024 EPS growth forecast for STOXX 600 companies to 6% from 3%, attributing the increase to factors like rising Brent prices and a weaker euro/dollar exchange rate.\n\nMarket sentiment in Europe remained positive, with mainland China and European markets starting the week on an upbeat note. Europe's broadest stock index rose 0.7%, reflecting renewed optimism from the U.S.\n\nOil prices garnered attention amid prospects of Saudi Arabian price hikes and escalating tensions in the Middle East. Brent futures rose 73 cents to $83.69 a barrel, while U.S. crude futures climbed 81 cents higher to $78.92 per barrel.\n\nIn Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan reached its highest level since February 2023, with China's blue-chip index closing 1.5% higher. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index, which rose 4.7% last week, continued its winning streak on Monday, closing 0.55% higher.\n\nInvestors remained vigilant for further volatility in the yen following last week's suspected intervention by Japanese authorities. The yen weakened on Monday, partially retracing its gains from last week.\n\nGold prices edged higher to $2,316 an ounce, indicating investor demand for safe-haven assets amid market uncertainties.\n\nTraders will continue to monitor developments in global markets, particularly regarding Fed policy expectations and currency movements, for potential investment opportunities and

But the greenback found its footing on Monday.\n\nJapanese yen reverses some gains, USDJPY rises\n\nThe Japanese yen's USDJPY pair rose 0.6% on Monday, although trading volumes in the pair were held back by a market holiday in Japan.\n\nThe pair, which is inversely related to strength in the yen, had plummeted from a 34-year high of over 160 yen last week amid signs of repeated government intervention in currency markets.\n\nBut given that the underlying factors behind the yen's weakness- chiefly a large gap between U.S. and local rates- remain in play, bets against the yen persisted.\n\nThe USDJPY pair was now close to breaking above 154, with traders also doubting just how much capacity Tokyo had to keep intervening in markets.\n\nAustralian dollar strong, AUDUSD up before hawkish RBA\n\nThe Australian dollar's AUDUSD pair rose 0.1% on Monday, coming close to two-month highs as traders positioned for a Reserve Bank of Australia meeting on Tuesday.\n\nWhile the RBA is expected to keep rates unchanged, it is also expected to strike a hawkish chord after a stronger-than-expected inflation reading for the first quarter.\n\nSticky inflation gives the RBA more impetus to keep rates high for longer, with some analysts suggesting the bank could even hike rates further.\n\nDollar steadies after payrolls-driven plunge, rate cuts in focus\n\nThe dollar index and dollar index futures both rose 0.1% in Asian trade after tumbling 0.8% last week. Losses in the greenback came as nonfarm payrolls data read weaker than expected for April.\n\nThe data furthered bets that a cooling labor market will give the Federal Reserve more impetus to begin cutting interest rates.

Japan's currency has shed more than a third of its value over the past three years, says Jonathan Yerushalmy in The Guardian. The Bank of Japan (BoJ) has held interest rates \"extraordinarily low\", even as they rise in other countries. It finally raised them in March - the first hike in 17 years - but only to just over 0%.\n\nAt a meeting last week, the BoJ held rates steady, signalling that it is in no rush to hike again and precipitating \"another round\" of yen selling. Currency traders have finally realised \"that Japan is following a policy of benign neglect for the yen\", says George Saravelos of Deutsche Bank.\n\nSpeculation about rapid rate hikes was an illusion. While yen weakness does increase inflationary pressure, that is still not a pressing concern in Tokyo, since a weak currency has other advantages: it is helping exporters to stay competitive and driving a tourism boom.\n\nThe yen's new low didn't last long, says Richard Abbey on Bloomberg. In wild trading on Monday it quickly gained 3% against the US dollar, triggering suspicions that the government had intervened to stem the bleeding. While Tokyo may not mind a steady decline, it wants to avoid a destabilising currency crash.\n\nA weak yen is good for Japan's export-focused multinationals. The local Topix index has been one of the world's top performers with a 15% gain this year.\n\nUnfortunately, the yen's slump also eats into those gains in sterling terms, with the London-listed iShares MSCI Japan Fund up by a more modest 7% for the year to date.\n\n\"The drip, drip, drip of weak yen news\" has become \"part of the Tokyo zeitgeist\", says William Pesek in Nikkei Asia. Japan's sliding currency is discussed \"on television, in newspapers\" and \"at bank branches\"; it can also be seen in the exploding number of foreign tourists.\n\nThe slump threatens eventually to undermine the confidence of households and foreign investors. A relentlessly weaker currency is hardly the sign of an economy roaring into recovery mode after decades of stagnation. \"If Japan Inc. is primed for a boom,\" then why must the country rely on an \"Argentina-like currency strategy\"?\n\nJapan's Nikkei stock index hit a record high earlier this year, but it's not too late to jump aboard, says Kate Marshall of Hargreaves Lansdown. \"Japan's market still looks good value compared with other global markets and its own history,\" with especially appealing value among small and medium-sized firms.\n\nWhile \"excitement\" around corporate governance changes has cooled, the reforms have fostered a durable shift in \"mindset\", with firms increasingly run in the interests of their shareholders. That should keep providing a steady tailwind for Japanese shares.", "source": {"uri": "moneyweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MoneyWeek"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japanese yen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Japan", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deutsche Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOPIX", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TOPIX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_corporation", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Multinational corporation"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikkei_Asia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nikkei Asia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_governance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corporate governance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSCI", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MSCI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikkei_225", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nikkei 225"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Paper_Money", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Paper Money", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Paper_Money", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Paper Money", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Af4tYm7DyzWcXpxjVv43EW-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540038", "eventUri": "eng-9540038", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

USD/JPY is trading at 153.92, up 0.62% at the time of writing.\n\nThe yen took traders on a roller-coaster ride last week. The Japanese yen fell below the 160 level on Monday, setting another 34-year record before recovering. On Wednesday, the yen climbed 2.1% and on Friday it strengthened to 151.85, a one-month high against the US dollar.\n\nThe sharp swings on Monday and Wednesday were likely caused by intervention from Japan's Ministry of Finance (MoF). To no one's surprise, the MoF wouldn't comment on whether it had intervened. US Treasury Secretary Yellen also declined to say whether Tokyo had intervened, but Bank of Japan current account data indicated that the Japanese government may have bought up $60 billion to support the ailing yen.\n\nPrevious interventions by the MoF haven't been effective, providing only a brief boost for the yen.

Unemployment and wage growth were also down compared to March, and the somewhat soft employment report makes a September rate cut more likely.\n\nThe Fed's rate path will be data-dependent, with a focus on inflation, consumer spending and GDP.

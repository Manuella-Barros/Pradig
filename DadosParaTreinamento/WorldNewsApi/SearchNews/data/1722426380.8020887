The High Life Highland Leadership Programme has recognised the sterling efforts of four young people by awarding them the scheme\u2019s first ever platinum hoodies! They were presented with the new hoodie by Nicola Killean, children and young people\u2019s commissioner for Scotland, at the Highland Youth Parliament event in Inverness last week (June 21), with young leaders having to achieve 750 hours of volunteer leadership as well as organising a fundraising event for the charity of their choice. Archie Webster (15), from Inverness Royal Academy, was first to be awarded his platinum hoodie, for his many volunteering efforts with Active Schools and at Inverness Park Run. For his charity event he cycled 83 miles from Inverness to Aviemore and back, with a goal to raise \u00a3300 for Mikeysline. He cycled through wind, rain and snow and was rewarded with an amazing fundraising total of \u00a31372. Raising funds for the Highland Hospice at his former primary school was the challenge by Scott MacKay (16), from Culloden Academy. He carried out a variety of volunteering leadership activities with Active Schools and the Highland Hospice to reach his 750 hours. The fundraising event at Smithton Primary School raised over \u00a3180. Meanwhile, Orlagh McIver, from Fortrose Academy, organised a Health Walk and Talk and sold lucky squares to raise money for Mikeysline and the James Support Group (\u00a3400). Her 750 leadership hours were achieved with the support of Black Isle Youth Development staff at Fortrose Academy and included helping at Cromarty Youth Caf\u00e9 and intergenerational work in her local community. The Leadership Programme is open to young people aged 12-25 years \u2013 they do not need to be at school \u2013 and although underpinned by leadership in sport and youth work, the awards can be utilised by young people volunteering in clubs, libraries, facilities, and other community sectors. Rachael Hatfield (25), from Ardersier, is one of those people. She runs a local Brownie Group and having achieved gold hoodie status in 2019 she has now upgraded to platinum having organised a fundraising, end-of-term awards night for her Brownies, raising \u00a3113. The High Life Highland Leadership Programme offers a selection of varied learning opportunities using the charity\u2019s own High Life Highland SCQF accredited \u2018Choose To Lead\u2019 awards (Level 4 and 5) and other quality training opportunities and courses from Scottish governing bodies for sport, youth work and other trusted partners. The Leadership Programme development officer, Elizabeth McDonald said: \u201cA massive congratulations to our platinum hoodie young leaders who have worked so hard and dedicated a great deal of their own time to helping others. This really marks a milestone moment in the leadership programme. \u201cWe pride ourselves on the quality of the young leaders that we produce, and the experience is of tremendous value to the individual involved and the people they help in schools and the wider community. \u201cWe also have a brilliant team of High Life Highland mentors to support our young leaders \u2013 and I would like to thank all of them as we could not deliver this excellent programme without their support.\u201d There is more information on the Leadership Programme on the High Life Highland website at www.highlifehighland.com/sport/leadership-programme or email Elizabeth.McDonald@highlifehighland.com.

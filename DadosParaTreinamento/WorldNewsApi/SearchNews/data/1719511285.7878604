The reality TV star, who became a household name after appearing on Love Island in 2019, posted a number of pictures of her big day. In one picture her daughter Bambi is seen lying on her bed snuggled into the arms of her dad Tommy. She then posted a few pictures of her birthday breakfast which was a stack of pancakes, maple syrup and blueberries. She captioned her post with: \"Perfect birthday morning.\" And in a bid to silence rumours, she also posted a picture of her sharing a kiss with Tommy as they sat encased in their huge sofa, while Bambi playfully cuddled Molly's leg. She captioned the post: \"The most chilled birthday ever at home with the people I love.\" This comes after she has been forced to quell speculation that her relationship with the boxing champion was in trouble. Over the past few months,fans were left concerned that their engagement had been called off after she was seen without her \u00a3600,000 ring following pictures of Tommy out in the Middle East with singer Chris Brown, surrounded by a hoard of ladies. Since then, the rumour mill has been working over time as she failed to mention Tommy on his birthday and she then failed to mention her brother-in-law Tyson Fury after he was defeated in his latest boxing match. And most recently, when Tommy landed a role in a comedy film, she did not congratulate him on either of her social media platforms - which is strange for the influencer who spends a lot of her time on there. It's believed that Molly has found solace in her sister-in-law Paris to help guide her through what appears to be a rough patch in her relationship. A source told OK! magazine: \"Paris and Molly have become very close, and Molly often goes to her for advice. Paris has been through similar things with Tyson, so she understands what Molly is going through and she\u2019s a great support for her. She\u2019s told Molly she needs to pull the reins in and put her foot down with Tommy. Paris is a very strong woman and Tyson wouldn\u2019t be who he is today without her.\" And last year, Molly admitted the pair had been bickering more since the arrival of their daughter. She said on her YouTube channel: \"So, Tommy and I had a bit of a bicker this morning, as couples do, you know we have a baby together now, there\u2019s more things to bicker about\u2026Keeping it real, we had a bit of an argument. Anyway, I was ready to not talk to that boy all day, I was like, I\u2019m staying strong today, I\u2019m not going to be the first to crack on this argument, I was like, he can message me first\u2026So I was gonna be that strong independent lady, holding my ground.\" Follow Mirror Celebs on TikTok,Snapchat,Instagram,Twitter,Facebook,YouTubeandThreads", "summary": "Molly-Mae Hague proved to fans that her relationship with Tommy Fury was solid as ever as she posted a picture of her in bed with him to celebrate her 25th birthday", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/molly-mae-hague-celebrates-25th-32896969", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32897218.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_MAIN-Molly-Mae-celebrates-25th-birthday-in-bed-with-Tommy-after-shutting-down-split-rumours.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 16:26:39", "author": "Lucretia Munro,Lucretia-munro", "authors": ["Lucretia Munro", "Lucretia-munro"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.146}

I like to talk about the wins, but that was probably the dopest moment. I\u2019ve watched so many games here, growing up a big Red Sox fan, to come in and hit a homer, that\u2019s an unreal feeling.\u201d The Padres sent 13 batters to the plate in the fifth, with nine scoring on eight hits and two walks. The first nine batters reached base safely. Every batter in the Padres starting lineup had at least one hit and scored a run. The nine runs scored matches the most in an inning for the Padres this season. They also scored nine runs in the eighth inning on May 31 against the Kansas City Royals. The nine runs allowed surpassed Boston\u2019s previous season high of seven runs scored by the Toronto Blue Jays in the third inning on Tuesday. \u201cA lot going on,\u201d Padres manager Mike Schildt said of the fifth inning. \u201cWe talk about, you can never have enough runs. So, we stay hungry to get more. We want to continue to add on as much as possible all the time.\u201d After Nick Pivetta (4-5) gave up four hits \u2014 including Higashioka\u2019s ninth homer of the season \u2014 and a walk to open the fifth, he was replaced by Greg Weissert, who gave up four straight hits including two-run singles to Jake Cronenworth and Donovan Solano and Merrill\u2019s 11th homer of the season. \u201cThe sweeper didn\u2019t perform in that inning,\u201d Red Sox manager Alex Cora said of Pivetta\u2019s pitch. \u201cJust wasn\u2019t able to execute and everything happened so fast. I\u2019m usually not that aggressive bringing in the bullpen, but I wanted to give them a different look with the lefty there. It was still early in the game.\u201d Pivetta called his outing \u201cdissatisfying.\u201d \u201cI was hanging pitches in the middle of the zone and they took advantage of it because they\u2019re a good baseball team,\u201d he said. Right-hander Randy V\u00e1squez started for the Padres and went four-plus innings, giving up one run on five hits and a walk with one strikeout. He was replaced by Wandy Peralta after Ceddanne Rafaela\u2019s comebacker hit him on his pitching arm and he suffered a forearm contusion. \u201cThankfully, X-rays negative, no fracture or anything. Got him in the forearm pretty good,\u201d Schildt said. \u201cThat was a shame because this guy was pitching really well.\u201d Right-hander Stephen Kolek (2-0) threw two scoreless innings, giving up a hit with two strikeouts. Connor Wong\u2019s two-out single scored Wilyer Abreu from second base in the fourth to give Boston a 1-0 lead. Rafael Devers hit his 17th home run of the season in the sixth. Xander Bogaerts, who won two World Series titles in his 10 seasons in Boston, received a standing ovation from the Fenway crowd after the Red Sox showed a video tribute before the second inning. It was his first time back since signing with the Padres as a free agent in December 2022. ROSTER MOVES The Red Sox reinstated C Connor Wong from the paternity list and called up LHP Bailey Horn from Triple-A Worcester. C Tyler Heineman and RHP Isaiah Campbell were optioned to Worcester on Thursday. TRAINER\u2019S ROOM Padres: LHP Tom Cosgrove was placed on the 15-day injured list, retroactive to June 27, with left elbow inflammation. LHP Austin Davis was called up from Triple-A El Paso to take his spot on the roster. \u2026 RHP Joe Musgrove, out since May 29 with right elbow inflammation, was transferred from the 15-day IL to the 60-day IL. UP NEXT The Red Sox and Padres continue their three-game series on Saturday. RHP Tanner Houck (7-5, 2.18 ERA) is scheduled to start for Boston, opposed by RHP Michael King (5-5, 3.75).", "summary": "<p>All nine of San Diego's runs came in the fifth inning on Friday.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.boston.com/sports/boston-red-sox/2024/06/29/mlb-red-sox-padres-game-recap-highlights-quotes/\">Jackson Merrill\u2019s 3-run homer leads Padres to 9-2 win over Red Sox</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.boston.com\">Boston.com</a>.</p>", "url": "https://www.boston.com/sports/boston-red-sox/2024/06/29/mlb-red-sox-padres-game-recap-highlights-quotes/", "image": "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Padres_Red_Sox_Baseball_25007-667f8802ce01a-scaled-e1719633950603-768x432.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 04:07:07", "author": "Associated Press", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.066}

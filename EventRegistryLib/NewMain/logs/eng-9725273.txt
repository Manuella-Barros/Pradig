Getting Goldsmith Romero confirmed before the November presidential election could cement Democratic leadership at the agency for years to come and ensure those rules are implemented.\n\nSenators are expected to question Goldsmith Romero on how she will fix the FDIC's cultural issues, handle the \"Basel\" capital hikes and rules on bank debt and banker pay, and whether she has sufficient bank supervisory expertise, analysts said.\n\n\"Commissioner Goldsmith Romero has little experience in banking regulation, so the hearing will be the first opportunity for industry stakeholders, including bank investors, to hear her views on regulation,\" Brian Gardner, Stifel Chief Washington Policy Strategist, wrote in a note this week.\n\nGoldsmith Romero referred Reuters to the White House which did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nInvestors and regulators continue have concerns about the health of the country's regional banks which have been squeezed by high interest rates that contributed to three bank failures last year. She may be asked about the agency's handling of that crisis, as well as recent troubles at fintech companies which partnered with FDIC-regulated banks.\n\nAn attorney with a background in enforcement who previously oversaw a 2008 crisis bank bailout program, Goldsmith Romero is backed by Democratic progressives but is generally seen as a non-contentious pick and has influential supporters in Republican circles, Reuters reported. She was unanimously confirmed by the Senate twice before.\n\n\"Goldsmith Romero's no-nonsense, nonpartisan, inclusive, rigorous, and data-driven leadership style that holds people accountable is also exactly what the FDIC needs,\" Dennis Kelleher, CEO of Better Markets, a Washington group that advocates for stricter regulations, said in a statement.\n\nSherrod Brown, the Democratic chair of the Banking Committee, did not immediately provide comment on Wednesday.\n\nNominees need 51 votes to be confirmed in the evenly divided Senate where Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris can break a tie. But with contentious issues on the table and hardline Republicans vowing to oppose Biden nominees to protest former President Donald Trump's conviction in May, some analysts expect the process could drag on.\n\n\"The question is whether the Republicans try to peel off a couple of Democrats against her,\" Ian Katz, a managing director at Capital Alpha Partners wrote in an email to Reuters.\n\n\"They won't vote for her, but that's not the same as going all out to stop her.\"\n\nSenator Tim Scott, the most senior Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, plans to press her and the other nominees on their qualifications, and also wants to know if they will stick to their prescribed mandates, according to his spokesperson.\n\nKristin Johnson, another Democratic CFTC Commissioner, and Caroline Crenshaw, a Democratic member of the Securities and Exchange Commission, will also testify at the Thursday hearing.\n\nBiden nominated Johnson to be the Treasury Department's assistant secretary for financial institutions, and renominated Crenshaw to her role as SEC commissioner.\n\nJohnson declined to comment, while Crenshaw's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAdditional reporting by Christine Prentice, and Douglas Gillison Editing by Nick Zieminski\n\nPete Schroeder\n\nThomson Reuters\n\nCovers financial regulation and policy out of the Reuters Washington bureau, with a specific focus on banking regulators.

Act on the news with POLITICO Pro.\n\nIf President Joe Biden's pick to head a top bank regulator talks like a cop and walks like a cop, she's probably going to be a cop - and that's making some bankers nervous.\n\nChristy Goldsmith Romero, nominated to lead the embattled Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., made her name in Washington as the watchdog for the massive bank bailout after the financial crisis, leading a scrappy agency of roughly 150 people who pursued bankers and Wall Street traders for fraud.\n\nLater this morning at her Senate confirmation hearing, Goldsmith Romero will vow to clean up an FDIC that has been reeling for months over revelations of a troubled and toxic workplace that led longtime Chair Marty Gruenberg to announce in May that he'd step down once a successor is confirmed.\n\nGoldsmith Romero will pledge \"a complete overhaul of the FDIC's workplace culture\" to address \"deep-seated cultural issues that have caused pain for many employees,\" according to her prepared testimony. \"It must not continue, and I would bring accountability.\"\n\nThose workplace issues are likely to be front and center in the Senate Banking Committee hearing. But as lawmakers weigh Goldsmith Romero's nomination, they're also looking at someone with a record that suggests she's gearing up to take on the banking industry itself. Her history is stirring concern among some bankers that the FDIC may be on the brink of a new enforcement-heavy era.\n\nAs the special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program for 12 years, Goldsmith Romero teamed up with U.S. attorneys offices to build cases against the industry, leading to charges against more than 450 people and the recovery of $11 billion of taxpayer money. She sparred with Obama-era Treasury officials over access to bailout information and publicly castigated regulators for failing to spot financial crimes. And she pitched Congress on tougher laws against high-level bank executives and creating a new agency to police fraud.\n\n\"She's very long in enforcement experience and very short in banking experience,\" said Cam Fine, the former head of Independent Community Bankers of America, which represents small lenders.\n\nVeteran banking lobbyist Ed Hill told MM that \"many folks have concerns\" about Goldsmith Romero policing the financial industry.\n\n\"The FDIC historically hasn't been an enforcement agency the way SIGTARP is or the CFTC,\" where Goldsmith Romero is currently a commissioner, said Hill, a partner at Forbes Tate who previously worked for Bank of America and at a top industry lobbying group. \"They are a supervisory agency with enforcement powers, and someone who comes in with an enforcement approach is certainly going to raise questions for the industry.\"\n\nGoldsmith Romero's backers see her experience as an enforcer and reformer as a highlight that will be much needed at the FDIC.\n\n\"It might be the right person at the right time,\" said one financial regulatory official, who was granted anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly. \"Not just for the internal restructuring and clean slate you're going to have to do internally at the FDIC, but, in a post-Chevron world, I do think you're going to see enforcement and supervision in litigating these things as more important than maybe they were in the past.\"\n\nDespite the alarms, Goldsmith Romero is not lacking support from the business community. The worlds of financial technology and cryptocurrency have thrown their weight behind her candidacy for the FDIC, as our colleague Zach Warmbrodt reported earlier this week. And the Digital Chamber, a trade group that represents crypto companies, sent a letter saying Goldsmith Romero's nomination \"signals a much-needed focus on digital assets.\"\n\nLawmakers have mostly signaled support for Goldsmith Romero.\n\nA wide range of Democrats, including Senate Banking Chair Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, have cheered her selection since the White House's announcement last month.\n\nShe's also won tentative praise from more moderate corners of the party, including Sen. Jon Tester of Montana. Sen. Mark Warner told our Eleanor Mueller that he plans to introduce Goldsmith Romero, a fellow Virginian, at the hearing on Thursday.\n\nSo far, only one Republican -- Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee -- has publicly criticized the pick.\n\nRepublicans on the Senate Banking panel are planning to focus on the fallout from the FDIC workplace scandal and scrutinize whether Goldsmith Romero and other nominees \"will stay true to the important mandates of our financial regulators or follow in the administration's footsteps to pursue a liberal agenda outside the scope of their authority,\" a spokesperson for Ranking Member Tim Scott said in a statement.\n\nSen. John Kennedy of Louisiana, who has called for legislation to make it easier for former FDIC employees to sue the agency, told Eleanor that he wants to hear how Goldsmith Romero plans to \"clean up the mess\" at the agency and whether \"she's gonna fire somebody.\"\n\nIT'S THURSDAY. You can ping Declan at [email protected] and Michael at [email protected]. As always, you can find our usual MM host, Sam Sutton, at [email protected] and @samjsutton.\n\nSenate Banking will hold a hearing at 10 a.m. on the nominations of Goldsmith Romero for FDIC chair; Caroline Crenshaw to be SEC commissioner; Kristin Johnson to be assistant Treasury secretary; and Gordon Ito to be a member of FSOC. ... The Senate HELP Committee will hold a hearing on medical debt at 10 a.m. ... Alanna McCargo, president of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, will speak at an Urban Institute event on racial disparities in homeownership at 2 p.m.\n\nAll eyes (stay) on Biden -- President Joe Biden's attempts to quell the Democratic panic over his candidacy did not appear to land Wednesday, as a new drumbeat of lawmakers questioned his viability against former President Donald Trump come November. Now, the president is set to deliver what will be his next test: \"a rare NATO-themed press conference,\" our colleagues Isabella Ram\u00edrez, Jared Mitovich, Lauren Egan, Jonathan Lemire and Anthony Adragna report.\n\n\"Another poor performance from the president would reaffirm fears among Democrats that Biden doesn't have the stamina or mental acuity to run for president,\" they report.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Sen. Peter Welch of Vermont became the first Democratic senator to publicly press Biden to withdraw from the race.\n\nWhite House eyes next CFTC commissioner -- Biden is expected on Thursday to name OMB official Julie Siegel for a commissioner seat at the CFTC, Meredith Lee Hill scoops. Siegel previously worked as deputy chief of staff at Treasury and as a banking and economic aide to Sen. Warren. Her nomination would likely be for one of two seats at the derivatives regulator that may soon be up for grabs, pending Goldsmith Romero's and Kristin Johnson's respective nominations to the FDIC and Treasury.\n\nBuyback restrictions in CHIPS program -- In a report out this morning, the Institute for Policy Studies and the Americans for Financial Reform Education Fund argue that the Biden administration needs to pursue \"explicit restrictions on all stock buyback spending in the final CHIPS subsidy contracts,\" according to a statement from the groups.\n\n\"With such strong pressure from Wall Street to use stock buybacks to boost share prices, the federal government must lay down a firm line against potential abuse,\" the groups said, noting that more than $41 billion was dropped on buybacks between 2019 and 2023 by computer chip companies that are currently in store for $30 billion in subsidies.\n\nClosed-door crypto confab: White House senior adviser Anita Dunn said she had a \"good and blunt\" discussion Wednesday with critics of the administration's approach to cryptocurrency, Eleanor and Jasper Goodman report.\n\nThe private meeting was organized by Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) and featured prominent industry representatives and advocates, including billionaire Mark Cuban, a Biden supporter who has blasted the administration's digital assets policies.\n\n\"There were people who were listening and there were a lot of smart people from the crypto industry who communicated,\" Cuban said in an interview. \"Hopefully that leads to some action items.\"\n\nHouse delays crypto veto override vote -- The House on Wednesday postponed a vote on overriding a presidential veto blocking Congress from undoing an SEC cryptocurrency policy, Jasper reports. The override vote was slated for Wednesday afternoon, but the chamber punted its final votes of the day to Thursday after procedural motions forced it to begin debate on a resolution to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress.\n\nMore Hill crypto action: Senate Agriculture Chair Debbie Stabenow said Wednesday she wants to circulate text of her cryptocurrency regulation bill this week, even as she faces doubts from her committee's top Republican, Eleanor reports.\n\nMeanwhile, CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam is dialing up his campaign for new powers to police the cryptocurrency industry. As Declan reports, Behnam warned lawmakers Wednesday about the perils of the current piecemeal approach to the more than $2 trillion market and called for a comprehensive legislation.\n\nTrump's latest crypto play -- Trump is making yet another crypto play, this time at the bitcoin2024, according to the website for the purportedly \"world's largest bitcoin conference.\" Other speakers include ARK Invest's Cathie Wood, Russell Brand and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nSenate deal on stock-trading ban: A bipartisan group of senators unveiled legislation Wednesday aimed at barring members of Congress and other elected officials from trading stocks while in office.\n\nThe bill would immediately ban members of Congress, the president and vice president from buying and selling individual stocks. Those elected officials and their spouses would have until 2027 to divest individual stocks they already own.\n\nSen.

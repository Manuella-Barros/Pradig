The superstar is back on a number of tallies with his latest solo album, Right Place, Wrong Person. The title succeeds largely thanks to a sizable sales sum, one which helps the musician make history among his countrymen as the set arrives. Right Place, Wrong Person debuts at No. 2 on Billboard\u2019s Top Album Sales chart. The tally shows which titles actually sold the most copies in the U.S. every tracking period. In its first seven days of availability, Right Place, Wrong Person was purchased by 42,917 fans of RM in America. Normally, that large a figure would be enough for the title to open at No. 1 on the Top Album Sales chart, but this time around, he faced some stiff competition. Twenty One Pilots\u2019 Clancy starts in first place with over 113,000 sales. Right Place, Wrong Person marks RM\u2019s third trip to the top 10 on the Top Album Sales chart. With one more win to his credit, he becomes the South Korean soloist with the most placements inside the highest tier on the tally. Before this week, RM was tied with two other solo superstars from South Korea for this bit of history\u2013and he knows those musicians well. Both J-Hope and Suga, two other BTS singers, have cracked the highest region twice on their own. RM earned his first top 10 on the Top Album Sales chart in 2018, when his mixtape Mono reached No. 5. In late 2022, he returned and shot to a new peak position with Indigo. His first proper studio album stalled at No. 2. Now, he\u2019s added a second runner-up with Right Place, Wrong Person.
